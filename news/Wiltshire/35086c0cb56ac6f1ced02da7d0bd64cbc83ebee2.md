**The family of Bethany Michelle Ovenden-Gumm, who sadly died following a road traffic collision in Westbury on Friday evening (05/02), have released the following tribute:**

 ****

Bethany, who was 18, was born at the RUH in Bath, and grew up in Westbury.

She attended Westbury Infants, and then Westbury Leigh School, followed by Kingdown Secondary School, as well as Brune Park School in Gosport, and finally Trowbridge College to study childcare.

She was someone who loved dancing, funky make up, social media and having a laugh with her family and friends.

She leaves behind her mother Tracie, her father Ben, stepmother Dawny and siblings Charlie, Tom, Cam, JJ, Imogen, Paige, Louis and Grace.

Her family have released the following statement:

"What can we say about Bethany? All parents will say their children were amazing and beautiful, and that their loss is the hardest thing to ever have to face. But Beth was truly amazing, gorgeous and so talented.

"Our Beth had the most beautiful smile that lit up any room. She was the life and soul of the party, with a big heart and kind soul. Outgoing and caring, her amazing self-taught beauty and hair techniques were perfection and her eyebrows on point.

"She had the world in her hands. She was and will always be a free spirit. She had a way about her that touched so many hearts. Be it her smile, her laugh or just the way she was.

"She was honestly so perfect. She was so strong-minded, so powerful with her confidence and her bright colours will stay with us forever.

"She had a loudness about her and was just the sweetest thing. We couldn't have had it any better. She lifted everyone's mood when they were down, she just had that about her and we will always try and keep what she had.

"She has left a massive hole in our hearts. Life will never be the same without her in it.

"She was truly loved by all. Fly high, our beautiful butterfly."

Bethany's family would like to thank those who were first at the scene of the collision and the emergency services, for all they did to try and help her.

They would also like to thank everyone for their kind thoughts and messages.

There have been a number of tributes, cards and notes left at the scene, which have now been removed for safe-keeping due to the wet weather.
