We are appealing for witnesses after a man was attacked by a group of males at about 7.45pm yesterday (10/02) in Verwood Close, Park North, Swindon.

The victim is recovering following hospital treatment.

Members of the public may notice extra police patrols in the vicinity for community safety and reassurance.
