**Drugs worth up to a thousand pounds in street value have been discovered in a plastic bag in a hedgerow in Liden. **

 ****

The crack cocaine and heroin were discovered near the lagoon by a member of the public while out walking yesterday afternoon (02/02).

We are asking the public to be extra vigilant as we believe local drug gangs could be using natural undergrowth and vegetation as a drop off point for their dealings.

Insp Barry Reed said: "We believe drugs gangs may be using undergrowth like trees and hedges to hide and store drugs for someone to collect later.
"We are asking the public to aware of this practice as these are potentially harmful substances just lying about in places where children and dogs could find them.
"We are also asking the public to report any strange or suspicious activity in your local park, wood or any place that could be used as a natural cover for this type of activity."

You can report by calling us on 101, via our online reporting facility on our website or anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
