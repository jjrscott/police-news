**Two men from Swindon who were wanted by police have been arrested today thanks to the support of the public.**

Last week we appealed for information regarding Jordan Flynn, 19, and Seamus Hynes, 39, who were wanted on suspicion of involvement in a serious assault.

Information provided to us by the local community led to the arrest of both men this morning (17/08) on suspicion of grievous bodily harm and conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm.

Both are now in custody at Gablecross Police Station.

Supt Phil Staynings said: "The response from the public in regard to this was fantastic, with the appeal being shared extensively over social media.

"As a result both men handed themselves in this morning and for that I would like to say thank you to the local community for their support.

"Hopefully this encourages more people to trust that we will listen when you call us and to come forward with vital information in the future which will be handled discreetly and in confidence."
