PC Lyndsey Smith was awarded a Chief Constable's Commendation at our awards ceremony last week.
After being on patrol during a night shift, Lyndsey was stopped by a member of public who reported there was a man on a bridge close to the A303 who appeared to be in need of help.

She arrived at the location to find a man in an emotional state, who had one leg over the bridge.

With no regard for her own safety, Lyndsey acted swiftly and with immense bravery, to physically pull the man back over the bridge and restrain him, keeping him safe until help from colleagues arrived.

Well done Lyndsey, from all your colleagues at Wiltshire Police.
