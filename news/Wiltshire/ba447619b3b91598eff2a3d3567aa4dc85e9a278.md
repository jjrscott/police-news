**A Swindon man has been jailed after being found guilty of driving whilst disqualified and in possession of a knife. **

Lee Turner, aged 32, from Manton Street, Rodbourne was sentenced at Swindon Crown Court today (15/01) to eight months in prison after being found guilty last month.

In October last year, two roads policing officers saw Turner, who was disqualified from driving at the time, get out of the driver's side of a Toyota Urban Cruiser at the Chiseldon Service Station. He walked passed officers to the nearby ATM. One of the officers recognised Turner for having no licence and so he was arrested on suspicion of driving whilst disqualified.

During a search of the vehicle, officers discovered a knife inside; he was then also arrested for being in possession of a knife.

Following today's sentencing, PC Andy Lee, said: "We welcome today's result.
"Lee Turner denied driving the vehicle in question and never changed that plea despite us suspecting him of being behind the wheel on that October day.
"The custodial sentence is a good reminder how seriously we and the judiciary take incidents like this is and, coupled with the charge of possessing a dangerous weapon, a prison sentence is the only appropriate option in this case."
