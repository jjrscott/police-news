We can confirm that following an incident in Summers Street, Swindon, shortly after 2am this morning (08/11) a referral has been made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).

This is regarding the death of a member of the public.

The IOPC are independently investigating this incident so it would be inappropriate for us to comment any further on it.

We would, however, like to reassure the public there is no risk to the wider community and that there is likely to be an increased police presence in the area for a considerable time.
