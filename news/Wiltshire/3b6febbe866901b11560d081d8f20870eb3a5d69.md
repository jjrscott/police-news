**A woman has been arrested following a road traffic collision on the A350 this morning.**

We were called shortly after 6.00am to a two-vehicle collision involving a Tesla and a Vauxhall Zafira near Westbury.

The ambulance service were called but thankfully no serious injuries were reported.

The driver of the Zafira, a woman in her 40s from Bristol, was arrested on suspicion of being unfit to drive due to drugs and possession of a bladed article.

She was taken to Melksham Police Station where she remains in custody.
