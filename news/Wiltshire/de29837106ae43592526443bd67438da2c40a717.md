**Motorists in the Chippenham, Calne and Devizes areas may experience some delays on the roads this morning.**

An abnormal load is due to leave Junction 17 of the M4 at about 9am today (09/02) and take the A350 towards Chippenham before travelling onwards along the A4 through Calne and Beckhampton to Devizes Marina.

The move will consist of a pre-fabricated home, 4.3m wide, plus associated private and police escort vehicles.

Due to the width of the load, the move is likely to be slow and will potentially cause congestion in places where oncoming traffic will be required to pull in and wait for vehicles to pass. Traffic travelling behind the move will not be able to overtake.

Wherever possible, disruption will be kept to a minimum although both hauliers and motorists are asked to please be patient should they come across this load. Anyone travelling on time critical matters should allow sufficient additional time for their journey.

Police escorting resources are being provided by officers, paid for by the haulier at no cost to the public.
