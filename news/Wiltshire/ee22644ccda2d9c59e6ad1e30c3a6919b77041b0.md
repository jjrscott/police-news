We're appealing for witnesses following an assault in Royal Wootton Bassett last night (24/7).

At approximately 11.40pm, a disorder took place on the High Street which resulted in a man suffering a slash wound to his chest.

It is believed that a weapon was used during the assault.

The victim, a 25 year old man, required hospital treatment but was discharged in the early hours of this morning.

DS Scott Anger from Swindon CID said: "We are aware that there were a number of people in the area at the time of the assault so I would appeal directly to them to come forward and speak to us.

"This was a nasty assault which could have had more serious consequences.

"I would also appeal to anyone who was driving through the town last night at the time of the disorder to check your dash cam footage and contact us if you have anything which could assist with our enquiries."

Anyone with information is asked to contact 101 and quote crime reference number 54200073326.
