Police Constable Will Saunders has been presented with a Chief Constable's Commendation at our recent award ceremony.

On 11 May 2019, police received reports of a man in distress standing by railings a bridge in Swindon.

 Will and his colleague were first at the scene and quickly assessed the situation.

Will acted instantly and with immense bravery, using his full force to pull the distressed man off the bridge barrier and keep him safe.

The man then made repeated attempts to break free and jump over the bridge barrier, and his colleague courageously positioned himself between the man and the barrier to prevent him from coming to harm.
