**We are appealing for any witnesses who may have information relating to a cyclist being assaulted on Wednesday, July 22.**

A man and woman were cycling along the canal towpath from Bradford on Avon towards Trowbridge at around 5pm when they were confronted by a man who proceeded to be racially abusive and pushed one cyclist of their bike causing significant injuries.

PC Sam Shellard said: "We are appealing for any witnesses, particularly other cyclists, who may have seen this incident or the man involved in the area of the canal towpath.

"While we don't believe this to be a targeted attack, significant injuries were sustained and we'd urge anybody with any information to call 101 quoting crime reference number 54200072324.

"Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 to report anonymously."

If you've been a victim of racial abuse, we'd encourage you to report it by calling 101 or visit the True Vision website at www.report-it.org.uk.
