**We are appealing for witnesses following reports of an attempted assault on a driver in Swindon. **

At approximately 6.45pm on Tuesday 9 February, we received a report that a male driver of a BMW stopped his car on Elmina Road, got out and threatened the driver of a VW Passat with a knife. The driver of the VW drove off and was, although shaken, unharmed.

The driver of the BMW also drove off but was spotted by officers in an Armed Response Vehicle near Ocotal Way. They followed him and stopped the BMW on Drakes Way.
Shortly afterwards, a large knife was found nearby.

A 24-year-old local man was arrested on suspicion of drug driving and possession of an offensive weapon. He has now been released under investigation while our enquiries continue.

We are appealing for anyone who may have witnessed this incident or anything suspicious in the area around this time and on this date. We would also like to speak to anyone who may have been in the area at the time and may have dash cam footage. If you can help, please contact us on 101 quoting crime reference number 54210013022.

Alternatively, you can contact us anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
