**We have released CCTV images of four people we would like to speak to in connection with incidents of assault and criminal damage in Chippenham.**

Between 6pm and 8.30pm yesterday (21/02) we were made aware of a group of people who were throwing eggs and stones at cars.

On two occasions, when the driver stopped to confront the group, they were assaulted.

This happened at various locations, including Ladyfield Road, Hungerdown Lane and Queen's Crescent.

Sergeant Rich Marshall, from the Chippenham Area Community Policing Team, said: "This was a series of frightening incidents where people had their cars hit with eggs and stones and then, if they got out of their vehicles to confront the group, they were assaulted.

"Thankfully nobody was seriously injured, but it could have easily been a different story.

"We would urge anyone with information, including anyone who recognises any of these four people pictured, to call us.

"We'd particularly like to hear from anyone who might have private CCTV, doorbell or dash cam footage which could assist our enquiries."

If you can help please call Wiltshire Police on 101, quoting crime reference 54210017178. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
