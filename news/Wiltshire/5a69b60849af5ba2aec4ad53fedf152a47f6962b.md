**We are appealing for witnesses after a road traffic collision involving a car and a cyclist.**

It happened at around 12.25pm yesterday (27/01) when the cyclist, a 19-year-old man, was riding along Tidworth Road, in the direction of Tidworth.

Close to the sharp left bend at E crossing, there was a collision between a vehicle and the bike, causing the cyclist to fall to the floor.

He suffered head, knee and foot injuries and was taken to hospital. His injuries were not life-changing or life-threatening.

The vehicle, which did not stop, is described as a silver saloon-type car and as driving in the direction of Tidworth.

PC Danila, from the Amesbury Area Community Policing Team, said: "We are appealing for any witnesses who saw either the cyclist or this car immediately before or after the collision happened.

"We are particularly keen to speak to anyone who was driving along the road around the time and may have dash cam footage which could assist with our enquiries."

Anyone with information should call PC Danila on 101, quoting crime reference 54210008404. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
