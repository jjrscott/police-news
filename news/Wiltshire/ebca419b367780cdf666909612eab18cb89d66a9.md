We're continuing to appeal for witnesses after a serious fail to stop collision in Swindon.

The incident happened at 3.30pm on Friday (06/03) outside The Dolphin pub on Rodbourne Road.

A vehicle collided with two pedestrians - a 26 year old man and a 31 year old man - before being driven away.

The 26-year-old was taken to Southmead Hospital in Bristol where he remains in a life threatening condition.

The 31-year-old suffered minor injuries.

The vehicle, a Nissan Juke, was found abandoned a short while later and is now being forensically tested.

As part of our enquiries, a 25-year-old man was arrested yesterday. He has been released on bail pending further enquiries.

We would like to hear from anyone who was in the Rodbourne Road area on Friday afternoon and may have witnessed the collision or the vehicle being driven away.

Anyone with information should call us immediately on 101 and quote crime reference number 54200023696.
