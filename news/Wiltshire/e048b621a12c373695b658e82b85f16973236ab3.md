Two courageous members of the public, Steven McDonald and Richard Fox, have been presented with a Chief Constable's Certificate of Recognition for Members of the Public.

Both showed incredible bravery by intervening in a violent attack on a woman in Salisbury in May this year.

The woman was violently attacked by a man armed with a food processor blade whilst they were travelling in a car together. During the attack the car crashed in to a row of parked cars at the side of the road. The injured and distressed woman repeatedly tried to escape but her attacker kept pulling her back in to the vehicle.

Hearing the woman's cries for help, Steven and Richard showed incredible bravery by intervening in the attack. They acted quickly by grabbing the keys and locking the attacker in the car - protecting the woman and looking after her until the emergency services arrived.

While we would never advise members of the public to engage an armed offender, these courageous individuals thought of others before themselves and with little regard for their own safety stepped in to help. They should be incredibly proud of their actions. Well done Steven and Richard from everyone at Wiltshire Police.
