A man has been arrested on suspicion of drink and drug driving after being stopped by police near Salisbury earlier today.

Officers out on mobile patrols of the Downton area spotted a Ford Transit van being driven at speed in Moot Lane at around 5am this morning (16/02).

They followed the vehicle into Squarey Close, where it parked and a man was seen to get out of the driver's side and lie down on the floor close to another nearby vehicle.

A 30-year-old local man has been arrested on suspicion of drink and drug driving and is currently in custody at Melksham Police Station.

Acting Inspector Tracey Holloway, from the Salisbury Area Community Policing Team, said: "This is an excellent example of proactive policing where officers were carrying out mobile patrols and spotted that something wasn't quite right about the manner of driving.

"We are committed to making our roads safe and will continue to do everything we can to apprehend drink and drug drivers."
