We've located and charged one of our most wanted offenders.

Jason Murray, 28, who has links to the Swindon area, was wanted in connection with numerous offences which took place in March.

He was found and arrested on the South Gloucestershire border yesterday morning (24/7) and has subsequently been charged with a dwelling burglary, theft of a motor vehicle and being in possession of an article used in fraud.

He remains in custody at this time.

DC Jared Yalden of the Swindon Community Tasking Team said: "Murray has been outstanding for multiple matters since March this year.

"We have repeatedly appealed to the public for their assistance in locating him and we are very pleased to confirm that, with the co-operation of various departments within Wiltshire Police and neighbouring forces, Murray has been found and charged.

"I hope this demonstrates that we will never give up looking for those who commit crimes, especially those that seek to evade arrest."
