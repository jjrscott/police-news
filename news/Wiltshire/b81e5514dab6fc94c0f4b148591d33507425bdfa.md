We're appealing for witnesses after a man in his 30s was threatened by a group of males.

At approximately 7pm yesterday (15/02), we were called to a report of a disturbance in Green Lane, Trowbridge. An unknown group of four males had stopped the man on his bicycle and one of the group then threatened to stab him.

The victim managed to ride off unharmed, and although a knife wasn't seen he was left shaken.

PC Sam Shellard said: "We would like to speak to anyone who may have heard or seen anything suspicious in this area around this time. If you can help with our enquiries, please contact us on 101 quoting crime reference number 54210015254."

Alternatively, you can report anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
