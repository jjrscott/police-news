Police Constable Pedro Wiltshire was awarded a Chief Constable's Commendation this week.

Pedro was first on scene of a vulnerable man on a footbridge in Swindon in June 2018. Ensuring colleagues has been alerted to make sure the road below was closed, Pedro engaged in conversation with the man.

After a few moments the man then started to climb the safety railing. With no consideration for his own safety, PC Wiltshire rushed forward and took hold of the man, pulling him back over the railing.

He then escorted the man from the bridge, handing him to the care of paramedics, who later revealed that the man told them that PC Wiltshire had undoubtedly saved his life.

Well done Pedro, everyone at Wiltshire Police is incredibly proud of your brave actions and quick thinking.
