We've arrested a man who was found with two large knives in Swindon.

We were contacted by members of the public at 11am this morning with concerns regarding a man in possession of knives in the Post Office on Moredon Road.

He made no threats to anyone in the Post Office and left a short time later.

Officers attended and a 34-year-old was arrested nearby on suspicion of possession of a bladed article and possession of an offensive weapon. He remains in custody at this time.

We would like to take this opportunity to thank the public for their support with this matter. We hope it demonstrates that we will respond rapidly and proportionately to incidents such as this.

Anyone with information regarding this incident is asked to contact us on 101 and quote log number 131 of today.
