**We are appealing for witnesses after a cow was attacked by a dog at the River Bourne Community Farm in Salisbury. **

At approximately 7.30pm on Saturday 9 January, a member of the public reported seeing a bull terrier type dog in a field of cows along with two young girls.

Our officers attended but the girls and dog had already left the area. We spoke to the manager who confirmed a cow had been badly bitten on the lip and an electric fence had been damaged.

If anyone was in the area at this time and heard or saw anything suspicious or can help identify the girls and dog, please call 101 quoting crime reference number 54210002490.
