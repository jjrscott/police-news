**A man has been arrested after a member of the public found a bin bag full of cannabis on the side of the road in Lydiard Millicent.**

We were called shortly after 6.00am last Monday morning (25/01) to Holborn after the discovery of the bag.

Following investigations, a local man in his 40s, has been arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the production of class B drugs.

He was taken to Gablecross Police Station and has since been released under investigation.

Acting Insp Katharine Smith, of the Royal Wootton Bassett Community Policing Team, said: "This is a great job and shows what can be achieved with the support of the community.

"I'd like to thank the member of public who phoned this in when they discovered the suspicious looking package and the quick work of the officers in locating and arresting the suspect swiftly.

"I continue to urge the public to report any information they have around the dealings of drugs in their community and we will always pursue these to protect those affected."
