**A Trowbridge man has been jailed for six months for his prolific shoplifting. **

 ****

Simon Parker, aged 36, targeted several shops - from larger stores to corner shops - across the Trowbridge and Bradford on Avon area.

One of the incidents Parker was sentenced for was a burglary where he reached across a bar at a public house and stole a bottle of alcohol.

He was sentenced at Swindon Magistrates Court last week (09/12) to a total of 24 weeks in prison after pleading guilty to the stealing offences .

Trowbridge Neighbourhood PC Helen Daveridge said: "Simon Parker has been relentless in shoplifting locally since 2014; each time local officers spend time gathering evidence to put the cases before the court.
"Again, he has received a prison sentence and I hope this time he takes up the support offered by our partner agencies to address his offending.
"Shoplifting is not a victimless crime, the stress and anxiety caused to key staff working in these shops and other retail outlets are a real cause for concern.
"In a year when all our lives have been turned upside down, I hope all parties affected can feel more at ease that this man is now behind bars and can do no more harm."
