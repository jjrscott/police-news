We would like to thank the public for continuing to behave responsibly as Government restrictions are eased.

Only a handful of arrests were made across the weekend in connection with licensed premises being reopened for the second week.

Chief Inspector Keith Ewart said: "We would like to thank the vast majority of people who visited pubs and bars across the county on Friday and Saturday for acting responsibly and in line with the current guidance.

"I would also like to extend my thanks to the management teams at venues across the county for playing their part and supporting us in minimising the risk of anti-social behaviour which might have arisen from the reopening of licensed premises.

"We've taken a multi-agency approach to ensuring our communities have been kept safe both this and last weekend - working particularly closely with colleagues from the licensing teams at Wiltshire Council and Swindon Borough Council, South Western Ambulance Service and Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service.

"As we all start to enjoy more freedom as part of the Government's road map to relaxing the COVID restrictions further, I would encourage our communities to continue to act in a sensible and responsible way."

Across this weekend, officers dealt with:

路 37 reports of disorder

路 22 reports of anti-social behaviour
