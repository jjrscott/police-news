**A partial closure order has been granted for a property in Chippenham to tackle concerns about anti-social behaviour and drugs activity.**

Officers from the Chippenham Area Community Policing Team worked with partners to secure the court order against an address in Derriads Green.

It means that nobody apart from the named occupant is allowed to enter the property and anyone found there will be committing an offence and may be arrested.

The partial closure order, which will last for three months, was granted by Swindon Magistrates Court earlier this month.

Neighbourhood PC Ashleigh Bray said: "This is an address which has caused nuisance and frustration for the local community for some time.

"Those living nearby have had to put up with drugs activity and the associated disorder, anti-social behaviour and intimidation.

"I hope this sends out a strong message that this kind of behaviour will not be tolerated and we will use court orders where appropriate to tackle the problems and safeguard the wider community."
