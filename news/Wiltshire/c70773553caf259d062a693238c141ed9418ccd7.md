**A Swindon man has been sentenced after admitting carrying two air rifles in the open amongst shoppers in Swindon town centre yesterday (20/12). **

Joseph Mclaughlin, aged 31, from Curtis Street pleaded guilty to the two offences of possession of a firearm in a public place and one charge of being drunk in charge of a loaded firearm.

He appeared before Swindon Magistrates this morning (21/12) where he was given:
26-weeks custodial sentence suspended for two years
Tagged curfew between 8pm and 7am
Six month alcohol treatment
30 days of rehabilitation activities

Det Sgt Justin Downes said: "I am pleased that this man has been dealt with so quickly by the judicial system.
"It's completely irresponsible and dangerous to brandish any weapon in public - especially when there are so many people around.
"I hope this sentence and the subsequent help offered will now give this man the opportunity to turn his life around."
