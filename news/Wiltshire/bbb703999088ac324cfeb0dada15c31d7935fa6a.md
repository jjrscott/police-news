Two people were arrested on Friday (27/11) following a drug warrant in Rodbourne.

Officers from the Stratton, Central North and West Swindon Community Policing Team executed a warrant at an address in Grove Street at approximately 11am.

A quantity of class A drugs were seized and a male and a female were arrested on suspicion of possession of class A drugs and possession with intent to supply class A drugs.

They were taken to Gablecross Police Station for questioning and have since been released under investigation.

Community Tasking Team Investigator Hayley Beales said: "This was a positive warrant carried out by officers from the local community policing team which led to the arrest of two individuals and a seizure of a quantity of suspected class A drugs.

"We hope this brings reassurance to the local community and sends a clear message that drugs will not be tolerated, and we will continue to disrupt drug use.

"We'd continue to urge residents who suspect illegal drug activity in their neighbourhood to report their concerns to police so action can be taken."

Call 101 to report concerns and always call 999 in an emergency.
