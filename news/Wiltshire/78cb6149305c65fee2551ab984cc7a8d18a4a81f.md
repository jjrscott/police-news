**We have had a report of a distraction burglary at a property on the Woodcock Road in Warminster. **

On Monday 21 December at approximately 5.30pm, a man posing as an electrical engineer called at an address in this area of town. The elderly male occupant was asked to step outside with the unknown offender but became suspicious of the man. The occupant went back indoors and then realised a window had been forced open and an untidy search had been made of his home.

If you heard or saw anything suspicious in this area on this date, please contact us on 101 quoting crime reference number 54200126143.

Please remember that an official visitor will always arrange an appointment with you before. Our advice will always be to not open the door to anyone you don't know or are not expecting. Always check by using a spyhole or look through a window.
