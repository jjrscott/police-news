**We're appealing for witnesses after two incidents of disorder in Swindon last week.**

They both happened last Tuesday (23/02), with the first in Buckhurst Fields between 6pm and 7pm and the second in Torrington Court at around 8pm.

On both occasions it involved a group of teenagers wearing face masks and hoods, who were shouting threats and abuse.

Nobody was injured.

Three males, aged 15, 16 and 18, were arrested on suspicion of a number of offences, including affray and weapons offences. They have all been released on conditional bail while our enquiries continue.

PC Jon Pearce, from Swindon Community Policing Team, said: "We know that these two incidents would have been witnessed by a number of people and, if you know something and haven't already spoken to the police then we would urge you to come forward.

"Also, if you have private CCTV, video doorbell or dash cam footage which you think could help, then please give us a call."

Anyone with information should call Wiltshire Police on 101, quoting crime reference 54210017887. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
