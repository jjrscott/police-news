**A dispersal order was required in Chippenham town centre last night following several large scale disorders involving up to 100 people.**

Superintendent Steve Cox said: "Unfortunately, we received a number of reports of anti-social behaviour and public order issues in Chippenham town centre last night shortly before the 10pm curfew currently in place for licensed premises.

"Officers attended the area and, due to the number of people there, issued a Section 35 dispersal order meaning those in the location had to leave immediately.

"The swift and proportionate actions of the officers meant that no arrests were made and no fixed penalty notices had to be issued.

"I would like to place on record my thanks to the public in all other areas of the county who showed respect for the current COVID restrictions.

"We will continue to work with our partner agencies as we navigate through this public health pandemic."
