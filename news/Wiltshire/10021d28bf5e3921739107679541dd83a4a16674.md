**A partial closure order has been issued for a Swindon address following an investigation into anti-social behaviour and criminal activity in the area.**

Officers from the Swindon South Community Policing Team submitted the application for the property in Kemerton Walk, Park South, after it was identified a local group of young people involved in criminal activity and anti-social behaviour used the address. The group had been linked to persistent nuisance and disorder - conduct which had been having a significant detrimental impact on the local community.

The order was granted earlier this week (2/2) by Swindon Magistrates' Court and prevents anyone, apart from the occupants and two relatives, from entering the property.

Anyone other than those listed found entering the property for the next three months will be committing a criminal offence and may be arrested.

PC Samuel Whettam, CPT Neighbourhood Officer, said: "We are pleased the court has recognised the serious impact the attendance and conduct of criminal groups at this address has been having on both the occupants and the local community.

"The application of the partial closure order has allowed us to promptly respond to the local community concerns and provide additional policing powers to tackle the problems.

"We believe this will have an immediate, and significant impact, in the community, providing some much-needed respite to the issues experienced, in addition to protecting the vulnerable occupants from being exploited by the group.

""Community Policing Team officers will continue to conduct regular welfare checks at the address to ensure the order is being adhered to and the welfare of the occupants is not being put at risk."
