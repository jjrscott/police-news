We are appealing for witnesses after several incidents of criminal damage at churches in North Wiltshire.

The first incident happened between 1 August and 20 September at St Giles' Church, Alderton.

The second occurred between 9pm and 9.30pm on 28 October at Holy Cross, Sherston.

The church at St Mary's, Luckington has been targeted on two separate occasions. The first happened between 29 October and 6 November, and the second between 18 and 21 November.

Damage has been caused to the leaded windows and it is expected to cost the churches thousands of pounds to properly repair.

PCSO and Wildlife Crime Officer Juliet Evans, appealed for anyone who was in the area on the dates given and saw anything suspicious to come forward.

She said: "These crimes have all taken place in picturesque rural villages, and although nothing has been taken, this is mindless vandalism with no respect for religious and historic buildings.

"The damage is expected to cost the churches thousands of pounds. If you believe you know who may either be responsible for the damage, or you have witnessed something suspicious, then please call us."

Anyone with information should call 101. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
