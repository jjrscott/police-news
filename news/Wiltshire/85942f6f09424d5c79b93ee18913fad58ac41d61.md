We're appealing for witnesses following a robbery at a shop in Swindon.

The incident took place at the Martin McColl store on Covingham Square at 6am this morning (13/06).

A man entered the store and demanded cash from the till before threatening a member of staff with a metal bar.

He then took a quantity of cash and other items before fleeing.

The man, described as white, in his 20s and wearing a white hooded jumper and a navy blue tracksuit with white stripes on the leg, made off on a red push bike towards Covingham.

No-one was injured during the incident.

Officers remain at the location as we progress our enquiries.

Anyone with information is asked to contact us now on 101 and quote log 48 of today.
