A large number of officers remain in Summers Street, Swindon following the death of a man this morning (08/11).

Following the incident, which took place shortly after 2am, a cordon was put in place and the road has remained closed all day.

This cordon will likely remain in place overnight until tomorrow.

Assistant Chief Constable Debs Smith said: "We would like to thank the residents of Summers Street and the wider community for their patience as enquiries continue in the area.

"We appreciate this will likely have caused concern and disruption for many people.

"However, this work is crucial as the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) continue to undertake it's enquiries to establish the full facts of what happened this morning.

"I would ask anyone in the local area with concerns or questions to approach one of our officers on the cordons - they will happily help if they can.

"We will continue to assist the IOPC investigation."
