Wiltshire Police enquiry offices at Trowbridge, Gablecross and Bourne Hill will reopen tomorrow (15 July 2020).

The decision has been made following the latest Government advice and measures being put in place to protect both the public and our officers and staff.

The opening times for each enquiry office will be as follows:

 * **Trowbridge** \- Monday to Friday (8.30am-5.30pm) and Saturday (9am-1pm)
 * **Gablecross** \- Monday to Friday (8.30am-5.30pm) and Saturday (8.30am-1pm)
 * **Bourne Hill** \- Monday to Friday (8.30am-5.30pm) and Saturday (9am-1pm)
 * All enquiry offices are closed on Sunday.

We fully appreciate that some people will still not feel confident attending enquiry offices. We want to reassure them that they are still able to contact us through a variety of means, including the 999 emergency and 101 non-emergency numbers, our website, and using the yellow phones positioned outside enquiry offices.

At this time, enquiry offices will remain closed at Marlborough and Melksham, as well as the front counter service at our shared premises at Monkton Park in Chippenham. However, the Wiltshire Council enquiry office at Monkton Park will remain open as a necessary contact point for vulnerable people.

Any member of the public wishing to visit our enquiry offices must adhere to the following guidance and safety measures:

 * **Entering enquiry offices (Trowbridge and Gablecross)** \- Visitors will only be allowed into enquiry offices one at a time. Signs have been fitted outside of the building, which notifies visitors of the process and the need to queue, with 2m social distancing, until they are prompted to enter by someone leaving or by a member of police staff
 * **Entering enquiry offices (Bourne Hill)** \- Signs have been fitted outside of the building, which notifies visitors of the process. There will be physical barriers put in place to maintain 2m social distancing
 * **Hand Sanitiser** \- All visitors are expected to sanitise their hands at the designated hand sanitiser station before they physically enter the main enquiry office
 * **Screens and tape** \- Front counters have been fitted with Perspex screens, similar to what you see in a Supermarket. There is also tape on the floor, which will help guide visitors of where to stand when speaking to an enquiry officer
 * **Toilets** \- Toilets at Trowbridge and Gablecross will remain closed to the public. However, the public toilets at Bourne Hill are open.

Police and Crime Commissioner for Swindon and Wiltshire Angus Macpherson said: "I welcome the decision to re-open enquiry offices at Trowbridge, Gablecross and Bourne Hill. It is important that the police are able to deliver a vital public service when safe and appropriate to do so.

"The health and safety of both the public and our officers and staff has been at the forefront of our minds throughout the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and we have continued to follow the guidance set out by the Government.

"Despite some of our enquiry offices re-opening, and extensive safety measures being put in place throughout our estate, I want to remind people of the other ways the police can be contacted. Calling us or visiting the Wiltshire Police website is still the safest option for everyone".

Chief Constable Kier Pritchard said: "I want to thank people for their continued patience and understanding as we continue to adapt to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the new normal.

"I want to reassure you that the initial closure of our enquiry offices has not impacted our visibility in your communities. Our police stations have been, and will remain running as normal, and you will have no doubt seen our Community Policing Teams out and about on patrol in your area, and responding to 999 and 101 calls.

"I want to thank you all for you continued support for Wiltshire Police. These are unprecedented times, and I know there are still challenges and uncertainty ahead, but as ever, we are committed to providing the very best service to the communities of Wiltshire and Swindon."
