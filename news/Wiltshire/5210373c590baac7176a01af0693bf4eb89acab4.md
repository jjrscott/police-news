We are appealing for information following the burglary of a property in Warminster.

On the evening of Wednesday 25 November, while the occupants were out, offenders broke in through a rear patio door of the home in Ludlow Close and stole a number of items of jewellery and a significant quantity of cash.

A Wiltshire Police spokesman said: "Burglary is an awful crime. It can have a significant impact on the victims far beyond monetary value of stolen items - such a crime invades the privacy and sanctity of the home, leaving many victims feeling vulnerable in the place they should feel safest.

"We would like to hear from anyone who was in the area of Deverill Road, Ashley Place and Ludlow Close from 5pm to 7pm on November 25 to check dash cam footage or cast their minds back to see if they saw anything unusual or anyone acting suspiciously."

Please call us on 101 quoting incident log number 54200117651 or report anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.
