We're appealing for witnesses following a fatal road traffic collision close to Salisbury yesterday afternoon (05/12).

The incident took place at Pepperbox Hill on the A36 shortly after midday and involved a car in collision with a van.

Sadly, the driver of the car, a man in his 70's from Somerset, was pronounced dead at the scene. Our thoughts remain with the man's family and friends.

The driver of the van sustained serious but not life-threatening injuries and was taken to Salisbury District Hospital. A passenger in the van was also taken to hospital with less serious injuries.

The A36 was closed in both directions at the location for six hours whilst collision investigators carried out their enquiries.

The vehicles involved were a blue Jaguar XF estate and a Ford Transit van.

We're now asking anyone who might have witnessed the collision to contact us on 101 and quote reference number 54200120835.
