We're appealing for the public's help in tracing two men - wanted in connection with suspected hare coursing and criminal damage.

The unknown suspects have reportedly released lurcher type dogs onto farmland near Marlborough, damaging crops and fence posts in the process, at approximately 12.30pm on 12 January 2021.

PC Lynn Thatcher, from the Community Investigation Team, said: "We take reports of illegal hare coursing very seriously.

"Anyone who may have information on the individual's identification, are asked to call 101 and use crime reference number 54210003451.

"Information can also be reported anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111".
