We're appealing for witnesses after a motorcyclist died in Swindon this afternoon (25/5).

Officers were called just after 2pm following a collision between a car and a motorcycle on Highworth Road.

Sadly, the motorcyclist, a local man in his 60s suffered fatal injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene.

Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this time.

The road remains closed between the junction with the A419 and the B&Q roundabout. The road is likely to be closed for several more hours.

We would advise motorists to use alternative routes.

Anyone who witnessed this collision should contact us immediately on 101 and quote log reference number 152.
