We have released an image of a man we would like to speak to in connection with illegal hare coursing in Pewsey.

At approximately 4.30pm on Wednesday 11 November, we received a report alleging that a man was poaching and had fired ball-bearings, using a catapult, at a member of the public and their vehicle.

PC Peter Simmonds from the Rural Crime Team said: "We are one of twelve forces involved in Op Galileo, the national police effort to tackle illegal hare coursing.

"We take reports of illegal hare coursing very seriously. If you recognise this individual, we urge you to contact us. Their behaviour was dangerous and unacceptable".

If anyone recognises the man pictured, please call 101, quoting crime reference number 54200112943.
