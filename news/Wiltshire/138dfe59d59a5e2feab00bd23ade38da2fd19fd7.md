We are appealing to members of the public to help identify a suspect in relation to a theft and assault that took place at Bargain Buys in St Margaret's Retail Park in Swindon shortly after 11am on Wednesday 25 November.

It has been reported that a man entered the store and stole a 59p energy drink. When challenged by a member of staff he picked up a bag of sugar and threw it at them before leaving the store.

A Wiltshire Police spokesman said: "This is a completely unacceptable assault on a shop worker who was simply trying to do their job. We are lucky to have quite a good CCTV image of the man we would like to speak to in connection with this assault. I would urge anyone who recognises this individual to please get in touch."

Anyone with information should call 101, quoting crime reference number 54200117490 and ask for PC Kerry Vicat. Alternatively you can report anonymously by calling Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.
