**We are trying to trace a Good Samaritan who stepped in to help a 16-year-old boy who was assaulted in Swindon.**

The victim was attacked while walking between Morrisons, in Thames Avenue, and Asda, at the Orbital shopping centre, at around 6pm on 18 December.

A group of teenage boys approached him and punched him numerous times, resulting in facial injuries and two chipped teeth.

The assault only ended when a passing man intervened and helped the victim.

PC Emilia Cutler, from Swindon Community Policing Team, said: "I appreciate that this assault happened a while back, but we have been carrying out detailed enquiries and interviewed two suspects.

"However, we really need to trace this man who intervened and helped the victim as he could be a key witness.

"We believe he was white, aged in his 40s and had blonde hair. If this was you, please call us to see if you can help with our investigation."

Two boys, aged 14 and 15, have been formally interviewed in connection with this assault.

Anyone who witnessed the assault or could help with our enquiries should call Wiltshire Police on 101, quoting crime reference 54200125760. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
