Officers from our Rural Crime Team are appealing for witnesses following a sheep theft in Westrop, near Corsham.

At approximately 1.30am on Tuesday 26 May, we received a report that 10 ewes and 13 lambs had been stolen from a field on Lacock Road, Westrop.

PC Emily Thomas said: "We are urging anyone from the local area to check their CCTV for any individuals, or vehicles, acting suspicious around the time of the theft.

"If you saw something or have any information that could help in our investigation, please call 101. Even if it turns out the individuals are legitimate, we would rather be made aware so we can check all is well.

"While of course there is a financial loss to the farmers, this type of theft can also have an emotional impact as in some of these circumstances; it would have taken years of breeding to establish the flock. Not knowing what may have happened to the animals can be extremely upsetting."

Anyone with information about the incident should call 101 immediately.
