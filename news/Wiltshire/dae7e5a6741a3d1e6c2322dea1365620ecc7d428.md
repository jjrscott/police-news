**We're appealing for witnesses after a serious road collision on the A361 between Swindon and Highworth yesterday ( 17/12) left a man with life-changing injuries. **

Two motorcyclists were taken to hospital after the collision - which saw the single rider of a Kawasaki motorbike collide with a lorry while his vehicle carried on and was in collision with a car and another motorbike before coming to a stop.

The rider of the Kawasaki motorbike, a man in his 60s, from Swindon, had to be stabilised at the scene before being taken to Southmead Hospital where he remains.

A man, in his 20s, from Highworth \- the rider of a Honda motorcycle - was taken to the Great Western Hospital. He sustained a fractured wrist.

The road was closed for nine hours to allow our officers to carry out their investigations; it reopened just before 10pm.

We are appealing for anyone who may have been in the area prior to the collision, especially those with dash cam footage, to contact us on 101 quoting log 141 of yesterday's date.
