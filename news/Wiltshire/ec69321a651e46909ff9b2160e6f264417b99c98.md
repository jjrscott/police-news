We have reopened Summers Street, in Swindon, following yesterday's serious police incident.

There is now only a small scene in place at a private address in the street, which will continue to have police attendance.

We would like to thank everyone for their continued cooperation and support during what has understandably been a worrying time.

The Independent Office for Police Conduct is continuing its enquiries into the death of a man in the street in the early hours of yesterday morning (08/11).

We will of course continue to co-operate with their investigation.
