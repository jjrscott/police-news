**We are appealing for witnesses after a spate of criminal damage in The Borough area of Downton last night.**

We've been made aware of number of incidents overnight, including where the windows of a parked vehicle and a house were damaged.

The car, a blue Hyundai Tucson, was parked in The Borough when its window was smashed at around 8pm last night (09/02).

Shortly afterwards we received a report that a house had a cracked glass window.

PC James Barrett, from the Salisbury Area Community Policing Team, said: "At this stage of our enquiries we believe the damage has been caused by somebody firing ball bearings from a moving vehicle.

"We are urging any witnesses, including anyone who may have dash cam footage or private CCTV footage to get in touch.

"We're keen to hear from anyone who was in the area near the Co-op or The Borough between 8pm and 8.20pm last night."

If you can help please call 101 quoting crime reference 54210013010. Alternatively you can email SalisburyAreaCPT@wiltshire.pnn.police.uk or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
