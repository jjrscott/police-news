**We're appealing for witnesses to a road traffic collision which took place between a van and two pedestrians in Trowbridge. **

At approximately 12.30pm yesterday (20/12), a VW Transporter van was in collision with two women on Bythesea Road. The women - one in their 40s and one in their 50s - sustained non-life threatening injuries and were taken to hospital for treatment.

They are now both home recovering.

We'd like to speak to anyone in the area at the time who may have witnessed this as well as anyone who may have dash cam footage of the incident.

If you can help, please contact us on 101 quoting reference number 54200125788.
