**We're appealing for witnesses after a section of fence at Shearwater on the Longleat Estate was damaged. **

We believe it happened sometime between Friday 9 January and Tuesday 12 January.

PCSO Candida Jackson said: "Due to coronavirus restrictions the gates have been locked.

"However, unknown suspect(s) have decided to break their way into the area - causing expensive damage to the fence and flouting the law around Covid-19.
"Did you hear or see anything suspicious in this area?
"If you can help with our enquiries, call us on 101 quoting crime reference number 54210003377.
"Please remember that some public areas, which are normally open, are currently closed to prevent people gathering for their own safety. If a gate is locked then people should not try and enter an area.
"Please be mindful during lockdown that action will be taken against anyone found to be blatantly flouting or breaking the law and fines issued where it is appropriate to do so."
