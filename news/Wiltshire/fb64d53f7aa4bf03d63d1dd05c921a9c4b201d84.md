Marjory MacCallum was presented with a Chief Constable's certificate of Recognition for Members of the Public this week at our awards ceremony.

Marjory, a member of Wiltshire Police, was off duty in Devizes town centre, when a teenager approached her and demanded money. After refusing, Marjory was threatened with a knife and had her bag and phone snatched.

The altercation caused Marjory to fall and hit her head. Despite her injury, Marjory chased the girl and engaged her in conversation long enough to allow the police to arrive and arrested her attacker. Well done Marjory.
