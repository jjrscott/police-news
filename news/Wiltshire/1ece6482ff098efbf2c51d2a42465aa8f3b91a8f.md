**We are appealing to anyone who was near Netherhampton Road, Salisbury, on Saturday 18 July and may have witnessed two men carrying out work in a manhole on the drive leading to Bookers Cash and Carry supermarket shortly after 1pm.**

The two men are described as white, of slim build and both wearing white t-shirts, one of them was thought to have been wearing a hi-viz jacket.

At the time, Cash and Carry staff reported that phone lines were down in the store and it was later discovered that cables had been cut in the manhole where the men were seen.

Both men were arrested shortly afterwards on suspicion of conspiracy to commit burglary and bailed pending further investigation.

We are keen to hear from anyone who may have been in the area and remembers seeing the men. We would also like to hear from anyone driving past at the time who may have dashcam footage.

Anyone with information should call 101 and quote crime reference number 54200070656.
