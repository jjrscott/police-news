** ** Police Constable Lucy Wileman was presented with a Excellence in Partnership Working Award at our Wiltshire Police Ceremony on Tuesday.

Lucy has an exceptional local knowledge and great relationships with numerous partner agencies within the community of Amesbury.

She has worked hard to build strong local relationships, including with parents of young people who have come to police attention, the travelling community and local councillors and business owners.

This hard work has paid off and means Lucy is constantly provided with community intelligence, which she uses to help safeguard, prevent crime or set local policing priorities. Her work in the community receives praise from many partner agencies, including the Youth Offending Team and the Area Board.

Lucy puts her community at the heart of everything she does and we are immensely proud to have her as part of Wiltshire Police. Well done Lucy, we couldn't be prouder to have you as part of Wiltshire Police.
