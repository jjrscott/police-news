**Statement from Wiltshire Police Chief Constable Kier Pritchard following the Government COVID funding announcement -**

"Since the beginning of the COVID pandemic, my officers, staff and volunteers have been working tirelessly to engage and educate our communities on the guidance and rules in place to protect lives.

"They have done this in addition to dealing with the high level of demand we see day in, day out to ensure our communities are safe and crime is prevented.

"This funding is acknowledgement of their dedication and professionalism and will be invested into enhancing our ongoing policing presence in our communities.

"Last week, we announced our plan to further enhance our policing activity, primarily through the deployment of PCSO's to areas of concern in the community.

"This proactive, targeted work, is being supported by our frontline police officers, staff and special constables, who will continue to work hard to police the restrictions alongside their everyday duties, as they have been doing since the regulations started.

"The grant provided to policing and received in Wiltshire Police today will enable me to bolster duties where necessary, especially surrounding key events, but I must emphasise that I cannot recruit additional officers or staff from this fund.

"Finally, I also welcome the additional funding being given to our local authorities and I hope that this might allow them to invest in COVID marshals who could work alongside my officers and relieve them of some of the current demand."
