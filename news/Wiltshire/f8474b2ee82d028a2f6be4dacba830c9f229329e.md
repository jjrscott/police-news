We are appealing for help to identify this man captured on CCTV. We would like to speak to him in connection with a suspected distraction theft from the Co-op Store in Kelsey Road Salisbury on 19 November.

It is thought that a man entered the store at 7.20pm where he purchased some cigarette papers, paying with a £10 note. He then repeatedly asked the cashier, who has autism, to change up some notes for him - confusing him into handing over £218.

When a colleague saw the cashier in conversation and attempted to go over to support him, another man engaged her in conversation and prevented her interrupting the exchange.

If you recognise this man please call us on 101 quoting log number 54200115839
