A group of men were arrested on suspicion of theft from a legal Home Office licenced cannabis farm in Swindon on Sunday afternoon (16/08).

We were called to reports of suspicious activity at the farm (at an undisclosed location in Swindon) on Sunday evening, after two men were spotted in a field of the hemp plants.

Following a search, supported by a drone and a dog unit, six men were subsequently arrested on suspicion of theft, four of them also on suspicion of going equipped for theft. All six suspects, aged between 19 and 27, have since been released under investigation.

A Wiltshire Police spokesman said: "We were alerted to reports of suspicious activity at the Home Office approved farm and quickly identified and arrested six suspects. It's worth pointing out that these plants, which are legally produced under strict conditions, are a particular strain which cannot be used for recreational drug taking. We would urge anyone with information about this suspected theft to contact us on 101 and quote reference number 202008160228."
