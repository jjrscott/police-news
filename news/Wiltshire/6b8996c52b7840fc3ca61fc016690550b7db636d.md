Police Constable Paul Davis was presented with a Chief Constables Commendation at our award ceremony this week.

On 15 May 2019, PC Paul Davis attended a domestic incident in Swindon. When he arrived at the address the victim was outside and the suspect was inside a flat on the 8th floor.

Whilst a colleague remained with her, Paul went up to the flat. The man let him in and was clearly in a highly-emotional state. Without warning the man suddenly made his way to the patio doors of the 8th floor flat, opened them and tried to climb over the balcony.

Paul showed great courage by restraining the man before he could jump. The man was actively struggling, dragging Paul to the balcony's edge too. Refusing to release his grip, Paul struggled with the man for a prolonged period until he managed to pull him back over the balcony and into the room where the man was safely restrained.

Throughout this entire incident Paul acted with kindness and compassion towards the suspect, who was clearly in crisis. Well done Paul, your colleagues at Wiltshire Police could not be prouder of you.
