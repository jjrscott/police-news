**Up to 50-thousand pounds worth of designer goods have been seized by officers following the execution of a search warrant in Salisbury. **

We carried out the warrant on an address on Cold Harbour Lane, Salisbury on Wednesday 3 February; Â£48,000 worth of clothing and an amount of Class A drugs were discovered as part of an on-going investigation into the supply of drugs and money laundering.

The goods are suspected to be as a result of proceeds of crime.

A 37-year-old local man was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply a Class A drug and has been released under investigation while our enquiries continue.

The warrant was conducted by the Operation Fortitude Team as part of our ongoing commitment to target some of the most prolific and serious offenders in our communities.
