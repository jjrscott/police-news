**A man has been jailed for 16 weeks after pleading guilty to breaking into a number of cars in Ogbourne St George.**

Lee Allen, 32, of Station Road, Swindon, appeared at Swindon Magistrates Court this morning (23/12).

He pleaded guilty to 5 counts of theft from a motor vehicle and 5 counts of motor vehicle interference.

The offences relate to a spate of incidents in the early hours of 28 November when vehicles in the village were broken into.

A police officer examined CCTV footage from the scene and recognised Allen, so he was subsequently arrested.

PC Alanna Wakeford, from the neighbourhood policing team in Marlborough, said: "The items stolen from the vehicles, such as sunglasses and CDs, were of relatively low financial value.

"However, this spate of incidents caused a great deal of frustration and inconvenience for the numerous victims, and I am pleased to see this sentence being passed today."
