We're appealing for witnesses following a fatal road traffic collision in Marlborough this afternoon (25/7).

A silver Ford Mondeo collided into Marlborough Town Hall on the High Street shortly before 1.45pm.

Sadly, the driver of the car, a 75-year-old woman, died shortly after the collision.

Our thoughts are with her friends and family at this time.

Anyone who witnessed the collision is asked to contact us via 101 and quote log number 195.
