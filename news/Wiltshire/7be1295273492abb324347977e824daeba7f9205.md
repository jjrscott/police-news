**We are repeating health information from Public Health England, available on their website**

Mike Wade, Deputy Director of Health Protection for PHE South West, said:

> "Our current advice, based on the small number of casualties affected, is that there is no significant health risk to the wider public. We will keep this assessment under constant review as further information becomes known.
>
> "While there is no immediate health risk to anyone who may have been in any of the 5 locations identified by police today, as a highly precautionary measure, we are advising that people who visited the sites between 10pm on 29 June and 6.30pm on Saturday 30 June undertake the following actions.
>
> "If you visited any of the 5 locations identified by police you should:
>
> * wash the clothing that you were wearing in an ordinary washing machine using your regular detergent at the temperature recommended for the clothing
> * wipe personal items such as phones, handbags and other electronic items with cleansing or baby wipes and dispose of the wipes in the bin (ordinary domestic waste disposal)
> * keep your items double-bagged and securely fastened, if they are dry-clean only (further details will follow)
>

>
> "None of these actions should damage your washing machine.
>
> "Other items such as jewellery and spectacles which cannot go in the washing machine or be cleaned with baby wipes, should be hand washed with warm water and detergent and then rinsed with clean cold water.
>
> "Please thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water after cleaning any items."
