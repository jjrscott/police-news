```

We've charged a man who breached one of the cordons in Salisbury.
â€‹
Jamie Knight, 30, from Salisbury, breached the cordon on The Maltings on Friday evening.

He was swiftly arrested and has now been charged with assaulting a police officer, common assault, criminal damage to a police vehicle and a racially aggravated public order offence.

He has been remanded in custody and is due before Swindon Magistrates' Court tomorrow morning.

Robust action will be taken against anyone who breaches or interferes with any cordon or the ongoing police investigation.

We would also like to thank a security guard who assisted officers in detaining Knight.
