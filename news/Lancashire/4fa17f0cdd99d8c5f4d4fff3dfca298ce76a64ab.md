Sunday, January 19, 2020

We were called at shortly before 1pm today (Sunday, Jan 19th) to a report that a man had been stabbed at an address on Edleston Street in Accrington.

Paramedics attended the address but sadly the man was pronounced dead at the scene.

A murder inquiry has been launched and is in its very early stages.

A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is currently in custody.
