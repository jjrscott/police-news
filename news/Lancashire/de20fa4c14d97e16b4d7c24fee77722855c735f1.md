Thursday, November 28, 2019

A man has today (Thursday, November 28) been arrested in relation to the deaths of Conner Stevens, 24, and Luke Peaurt-Moran, 18, after a collision in Burscough.

The incident happened at around 4am last Wednesday (November 20) when a white Audi S1 collided with a wall, a telegraph pole and then a second wall on Moss Lane.

Conner, who was driving, sadly died at the scene. Luke, who was the front seat passenger, was taken to Aintree Hospital but sadly later died.

The Audi, along with a red Fiat 500 Abarth, had been stolen during a burglary prior to the collision at an address in the Towngate area of Eccleston. The Fiat Abarth was later recovered on Valley Close in Crosby, Merseyside.

This afternoon (Thursday, November 28), a 26-year-old man from Liverpool was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving, failing to stop at the scene of a collision and burglary.

He remains in police custody at this time.

Luke and Conner's families have been informed and continue to be supported by specially trained officers.

Anyone with information about the incident can call 101 quoting incident reference 114 of November 20.
