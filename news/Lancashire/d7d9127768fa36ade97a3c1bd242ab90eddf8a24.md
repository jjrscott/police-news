We are appealing for information following a collision in Blackburn.

It happened around 3pm yesterday (13 October) when a Ford Fiesta being pursued by a police car, left the carriageway. It collided with the corner of a building on Bennington Street at the junction of Dickens Street.

The driver of the Ford Fiesta, a 24 year old man from Blackburn, was taken to hospital to be treated for a suspected broken ankle and facial injuries.

The road was closed for around three hours for collision investigation.

#### Sgt Oll Jones of Lancashire’s Tactical Operations Division, said: “If you witnessed the collision or have any CCTV or dash cam footage that might be relevant, please get in touch.”
