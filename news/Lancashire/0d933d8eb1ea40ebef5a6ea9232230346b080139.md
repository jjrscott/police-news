Have you seen Sophie Wilson?

Sophie is missing from home in Nelson but we believe she is now in the Blackpool area and in the company of an older man – Steven Purkhardt, 38.

Steven Purkhardt

We are growing increasingly concerned about Sophie and we are appealing for anyone who sees her or Steven Purkhardt to get in touch urgently.

Sophie is 17 years old, approximately 5"5 tall, and has long blonde hair. She was last seen wearing a grey top and zip up hoody.

Sophie Wilson

Detective Chief Inspector Alisa Wilson, of West Police, said: “We believe Sophie is in Blackpool and that she is with Steven Purkhardt, a man considerably older than her. As time goes on we are growing increasingly worried about her and I would appeal for the public’s help in trying to find her and make sure she is safe.

“I would also ask that if Sophie or Steven see this appeal then they come forward and contact us.”

If you have seen Sophie or Steven or have any information about their whereabouts please contact us on 101 quoting reference 04/55085/21. For immediate sightings call 999.
