THE family of a teenager who died in Euxton at the weekend have issued a heartbreaking tribute to him.

Luke Bennett, 17, was killed after a metal pole he was holding came into contact with power lines at Euxton Villas FC, Runshaw Hall Lane, where he was playing football with friends.

Luke, an academy youth player with AFC Fylde, who lived in Chorley, suffered serious injury in the incident on Saturday and was sadly pronounced dead at the scene. Two other teenagers were less seriously hurt.

In an emotional tribute Luke’s family said: “No words can describe how we are feeling today, we are completely inconsolable. No parent should have to go through the pain that we are feeling. Luke was our light, he was a beautiful boy in every way. He had a personality like a magnet and touched everyone he met. We could not have wished for a better son, or brother and friend for Dylan. There were four of us and there will always be four of us. His beautiful light will never go out.”

Luke’s family continue to be supported by specially trained officers and our thoughts remain with them at this time.
