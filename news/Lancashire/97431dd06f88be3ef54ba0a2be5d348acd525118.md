Have you seen wanted man David Dunn, from Preston?

He is wanted by police for breaching a restraining order and a community order and for failing to appear at court in January.

The 45-year-old, formerly of Centenary Mill Court, Preston, is described as around 6ft 2in, of average build, with a shaved head and facial stubble.

We would advise the public not to approach Dunn but to contact us with his location and a description of his clothing.

PC Karen Goulding of Lancashire Police said: â€œWe need to trace Dunn, who is aware he is in breach of these orders and that we are looking for him. If you have seen him or know of his whereabouts, please get in contact with us as soon as possible. Similarly I would urge Dunn if he sees this appeal to hand himself in at the nearest police station."
