We are growing increasingly concerned about a missing teenager.

He is white, five ft 6ins, medium build, with short light brown hair.

He was last seen wearing a black tracksuit with white stripes and carrying a black Nike bag.

Tyler has links to the Cambridgeshire area.

PC Andy Potts, of West police, said: “We are growing concerned about Tyler and I would appeal for anyone who sees him or has any information to get in touch. I would also ask Tyler himself to contact us if he sees this appeal.”

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting log number 1367 of November 26th.
