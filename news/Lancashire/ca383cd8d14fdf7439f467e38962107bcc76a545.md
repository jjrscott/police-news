Thursday, October 3, 2019

We were called by a member of the public at around 4:15am on Saturday (September 28th) to the report of a woman being assaulted by a man in a car at a garage on New Hall Lane in Preston.

The woman had been seen to be repeatedly dragged by a car close to the Texaco Garage.

An investigation has been launched and enquiries are on-going. At this stage, no one has been arrested.

We have now been made aware that a video of the incident is in circulation on social media. We would encourage people not to share this video out of respect and consideration for the victim.
