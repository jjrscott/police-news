POLICE investigating a fatal collision in Burnley have arrested three men.

Lewis Taylor 22, of Burnley sadly died following a collision on December 23rd last year.

We were called at around 12.55pm to reports of a collision between a motorcycle and a Toyota Yaris on Harold Street in the town. Emergency services attended and found Mr Taylor with serious injuries. He was sadly pronounced dead at the scene a short time later.

Following enquiries police yesterday (Wednesday, March 17th) arrested three people in connection with the collision.
