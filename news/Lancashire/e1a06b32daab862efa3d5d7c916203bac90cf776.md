POLICE have recovered a huge haul of drugs following a warrant in Darwen.

The drugs, believed to be ecstasy pills, cannabis and cocaine, were found during a search of the address on Marsh House Lane this morning (Friday, July 12th)

A 23-year-old man from Darwen was arrested on suspicion of Possession of Class A drugs with Intent to Supply and Cultivation of Cannabis. They are currently in custody.

While enquiries are at an early stage, police believe the drugs could have been destined for one of the local summer festivals.

It is the popular Beatherder festival near Clitheroe this weekend and police are warning festival goers to be aware of the dangers of taking drugs.

Detective Constable Paul Hayes said: “There is no safe way of taking drugs, and no way of knowing exactly what you are putting into your body and whether it is safe.

“Our best advice would be to not take drugs at all but if people do and they start to feel unwell or experience different symptoms then they should seek immediate medical attention.” For information about the dangers of taking drugs and their effects, please visit Talk to Frank at www.talktofrank.com. Lancashire Constabulary takes a proactive response into tackling the issue of drugs in the county. We would urge people who have information about illegal drug related activity to come forward and contact us or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
