WE are appealing for information after a mother and daughter were racially abused and assaulted by a gang of youths.

The women, aged 53 and 18 from Blackburn, were going for a walk near to Brockholes nature reserve at about 6.50pm on Friday, May 29th.

The pair say they were approached by a group of around 20-25 youths when a female offender, described as white and fat wearing a white vest punched and pulled the hair of the 18-year-old. A second offender was described as white, dressed all in black, with false nails.

The mother and daughter, who saw they were racially abused as well during the incident, managed to get away and call the police. Officers attended but despite a search of the area there was no sign of the offenders.

PC Emma Brookfield, of Preston Police, said: “This must have been an extremely distressing and intimidating ordeal for these two women and I would appeal to anyone who witnessed the incident or who saw this group in the area to get in touch.”

Police are investigating and are treating the incident as racially aggravated assault and racially aggravated public order.

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting log number 1336 of May 29th or independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
