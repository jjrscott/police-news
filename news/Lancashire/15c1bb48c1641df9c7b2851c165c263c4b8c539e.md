A man has been charged following our earlier appeal after a woman was assaulted in Blackpool.

We were called at around 3.45am on Friday (August 9th) to Queen Street, to reports a woman had been approached by a group of men and then hit with a metal pole.

The victim, aged 19, was taken to hospital for treatment for injuries to her face, including a broken jaw.

Jonathan Holland, 34, of Collett Crescent, Blackpool, has been charged with assault – GBH. He appeared at Blackpool Magistrates’ Court this morning (13 August) and has been remanded in custody.
