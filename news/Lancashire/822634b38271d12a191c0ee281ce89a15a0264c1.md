We are appealing for information after a child was seriously injured in a collision in Blackpool.

It happened at around 17:40 hours yesterday (16 October) on St Walburgas Road close to the junction with Tennyson Road. The 12 year old boy from Blackpool was involved in a collision with a Volkswagen Golf.

The boy suffered serious head injuries. He was initially taken to Blackpool Victoria Hospital but is now being treated at Alder Hey.

The driver of the car stopped at the scene.

No arrests have been made.

Police are appealing for any witnesses and dash cam footage.

#### Sgt Tracey Ward of Lancashire’s Tactical Operations Division, said: “First and foremost, our thoughts are with the injured boy at this time.

#### “We know the area was busy at the time of the collision. If you witnessed it or have any relevant video footage and haven’t already spoken to us, please call us now.”

If you have any information please call us on 101 quoting log number 1042 of 16th October.
