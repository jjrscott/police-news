Three teenagers have been arrested after a fire was started at the former Co-op bank building in Skelmersdale.

We were called at around 7.50pm on Tuesday, September 15th, to reports of a fire at the derelict site, on Westgate.

We attended and found offenders had entered the building and set it alight before making off.

A short time later we arrested three teenagers from Skelmersdale on suspicion of criminal damage â€“ arson not endangering life.

The youths; a boy and girl both aged 13 and a 14-year-old boy, were later released under investigation.

Our enquiries ongoing and anybody with information is asked to get in touch on 101, quoting log number 1307 of September 15th.
