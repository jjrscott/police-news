DETECTIVES investigating the murder of a teenager in Preston have made a further arrest.

The 25-year-old man was arrested at an address in the town this morning (Tuesday, January 12th) on suspicion of assisting an offender.

They have now been released under investigation.

Officers were called to an address in Chatham Place at 5.43pm on Wednesday December 23rd where the victim, 16-year-old Sarmad Al-Saidi from Preston, was found with stab injuries to his chest and legs.

He was initially treated at the scene but was later transferred to hospital where he sadly died on Sunday December 27th.

Three males - Jamie Dixon, 18, of Clayton Avenue, Leyland, and a 16-year-old boy and a 17-year-old boy who cannot be identified for legal reasons, are charged with Sarmadâ€™s murder.

A 20-year-old man, a 28-year-old woman, both from Preston, and a 36-year-old woman from Leyland all previously arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender have since been released under investigation.
