We are appealing for witnesses after a man sadly died in a single-vehicle collision in Claughton-On-Brock yesterday (March 1).

We were called at 3.29pm to Brock Mill Lane following a report that a red Land Rover, travelling towards the Brock Bottoms Picnic Site, had come off the carriageway, collided with a tree and caught fire.

The driver, who was the sole occupant of the car and believed to be a man in his 50s, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

Officers are now appealing for anyone with information, dashcam or CCTV footage from the area to come forward.

#### Sgt Finn Quainton, of Lancashire Police’s Tactical Operations, said: “This collision has led to a man sadly losing his life and first and foremost my thoughts are with his family at this extremely difficult time.

#### “We are working to establish a full picture of what led to this fatal collision and I would ask anybody with any information or footage which could assist with our enquiries to please get in touch with police as soon as possible.”

Anyone with information is asked to email [email protected] or call 101, quoting log 0846 of March 1, 2021.
