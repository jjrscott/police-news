DETECTIVES are appealing for witnesses after a couple were attacked in their own home during a burglary.

Police were called to the address on Marlborough Road in Accrington at shortly after 11pm last night (Monday, Jan 27th) following the break-in.

The couple answered a knock at the door before two masked men pushed their way in demanding money. The men are believed to have been armed.

During the incident both the occupants, aged in their 60s and 70s, received injuries and were taken to hospital for treatment. Their injuries are not life threatening.

A handbag and the couple’s Vauxhall Mokka were stolen. The car was found a short time later abandoned on Lee Street.

Detective Sgt Steve Craig, of East CID, said: “This was a despicable attack on a couple in their own home and it is only though good fortune that the injuries sustained are not more serious. We are following a number of lines of enquiry to identify those responsible and I would appeal to anyone with any information to contact us.”

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting log 1500 of Jan 27th or independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
