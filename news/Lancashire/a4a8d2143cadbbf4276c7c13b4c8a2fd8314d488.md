WE are appealing for information after a woman sadly died following a collision in Blackpool.

The incident happened at about 6.15pm on Ryburn Avenue when the owner of a Peugeot 206 parked on the road leaned into the car and turned on the ignition.

The car reversed knocking the 77 year old woman to the ground and causing serious injuries. She was taken to Blackpool Victoria Hospital but sadly died a short time later.

Sgt Lee Campbell, of the Road Policing Unit, said: “This was a tragic incident involving the death of a woman and I would appeal to anyone who saw what happened to contact us.”

Anyone with information should contact 101 quoting log number 1150 of June 8th.
