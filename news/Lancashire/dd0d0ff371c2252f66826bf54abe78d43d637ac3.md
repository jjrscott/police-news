Police looking for a missing man have found a body.

Scott Pharo, 35, from Accrington, was last seen on CCTV walking towards Accrington Victoria Hospital at about 12.45pm on Monday (Oct 7th) after leaving his car, a black Vauxhall Insignia on Haywood Road.

A man’s body was found this afternoon (9 October) in woodland off Burnley Road, Hapton.

The body has yet to be formally identified but it is sadly believed to be that of Mr Pharo. His family have been notified.

His death is not being treated as suspicious and a file will be prepared for the Coroner.

Our thoughts are with Scott’s family and friends at this extremely sad and difficult time.

Thank you to everyone who took the time to share our appeal.
