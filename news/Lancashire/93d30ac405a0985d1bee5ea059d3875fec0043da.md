AN investigation is underway after a man was found with serious injuries in Rossendale.

The man, 22, was found at shortly before 2.30pm yesterday (Wednesday, December 5th) by a member of the public on a footpath at the base of a 30ft wall off Blackburn Road close to St James Church, Haslingden.

He was taken by ambulance to hospital where he remains in an induced coma.

Enquiries are underway to try to establish how the man came by his injuries.

Detective Inspector Scott Waddington, of East CID, said: “This young man has suffered some very serious injuries and we are trying to piece together what has happened to him. At this stage there is no evidence to suggest third party involvement in this case however in the absence of any other explanation a number of further enquiries will be necessary today to establish the full circumstances.”

Anyone with information should call 101 quoting log number 0762 of December 5th.
