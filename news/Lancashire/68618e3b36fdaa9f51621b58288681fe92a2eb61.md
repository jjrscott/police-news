Three boys who were missing from Blackburn have been found safe and well.

The boys, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, were found this afternoon (Tuesday June 4th) in the Manchester area following an appeal.

They had last been seen together at around 10.30pm on Sunday 2nd June in the Audley Range area of the town.

We would like to thank everyone who shared our appeal â€“ it is much appreciated and can genuinely make a difference.
