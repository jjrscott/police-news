Do you recognise this man? We want to speak to him as part of a sexual assault investigation in Morecambe.

Around 10.10pm on Friday, December 4, a woman was walking on Chatsworth Road when a man approached and grabbed her.

The man attempted to kiss the victim, following her into a shop before making off from the scene. The woman later reported the incident to police.

Following CCTV enquiries, we want to identify this man, pictured, as part of the investigation.

 **Det Con Peter Bennett, of Lancaster CID, said: “This was a frightening incident for the woman involved, with the attacker grabbing her and attempting to kiss her in the street.**

 **“The victim told a shop worker who challenged the man, with the attacker making off from the scene.**

 **“We want to speak to this man, pictured, in connection with the incident.**

 **“If this is you, or you recognise the man, please come forward and speak to police.”**

Anyone with information can contact police on 101 or email [email protected] quoting log 0807 of December 5.
