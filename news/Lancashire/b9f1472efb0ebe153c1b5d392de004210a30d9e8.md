We are appealing for information following an assault on a teenager in Preston which left him with serious facial injuries.

The incident occurred on February 21st sometime between 4.25pm and 4.45pm on New Hall Lane close to the junction with Acregate, when an altercation broke out between a man and woman and two teenage boys.

One of the boys, aged 17, was punched to the face during the altercation, fracturing his eye socket and breaking his nose.

The man made off from the scene.

A woman, aged 43 and from Preston, was arrested a short time later on suspicion of assault – ABH and has since been released under investigation.

#### PC Ben Gomer, of Preston Police, said: “Two teenagers were approached by a pair of adults – complete strangers - before an altercation broke out between them, resulting in one of the boys being assaulted and left with some nasty injuries.

#### “We are now appealing for information about the incident and would like to speak to anybody who saw it happen, or who perhaps has dashcam taken in the area at around the same time.”

Anybody with information should call us on 101, quoting log number 1100 of February 21st.
