We are appealing for information after a motorcyclist was left with serious injuries following a collision.

The incident happened at about 7.40pm yesterday (Saturday, August 8th) on Station Road in Whitworth when a man riding an off-road bike failed to negotiate a bend and collided with a fence before being thrown from the vehicle.

The man, in his 30s, sustained some significant injuries, despite wearing full protective clothing and a helmet, and was taken to the Royal Salford Hospital where he remains in a serious condition.

Sgt Chris Evans, of Lancashire Constabulary’s Tac Ops, said: “This incident has left a man with some very serious injuries and I would appeal to anyone who witnessed the collision to come forward and contact the police.”

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting log 1831 of August 8th.
