Do you know Leon Halsall?

We want to speak to him following two violent incidents in June and July.

On June 22nd, a woman was screamed at and grabbed by the wrists at an address in Ingol.

On July 12th, she was confronted by a man who was trying to climb through her upstairs window with a ladder. The man became abusive, resulting in an altercation when she tried to stop him.

> Sgt Scott Archer, of Lancashire Constabulary’s South Division, said: “We really need to speak to Leon Halsall about these incidents.

> “If you have seen him, or know where he could be, please get in touch.

> “Leon, if you see this appeal, please make contact.”

Leon Halsall, 34, was last seen in Hawthorne Drive, Ribbleton.

He is 5ft 9ins tall, medium build with short brown hair and a beard – although he may have shaved his beard off.

Call 01772 209729 or 01772 209783 or email [email protected] with any information.

Alternatively you can call 101 or the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
