We are appealing for information after a cyclist suffered serious injuries.

The cyclist, 65, was riding his Cannondale bike (pictured) along Longridge Road in the direction of Hurst Green when for an unknown reason he came off the cycle.

The man, from Blackburn, suffered some serious injuries and was taken to the Royal Blackburn Hospital where he remains.

The incident happened at about 12.30pm on August 5th.

Police are keen to try and establish how the incident occurred and are appealing for anyone who saw the cyclist in the moments before he came off the bike.

Sgt Marc Glass, of Lancashire Constabulary’s Tac Ops, said: “The cyclist has suffered some significant injuries and I am keen to establish exactly what has happened to cause him to fall from his bike. I would appeal to anyone who saw the cyclist before the incident to get in touch.”

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting log 0558 of August 5th.
