A MAN has been jailed for seven years after admitting drug offences.

He was jailed yesterday (Tuesday, February 26th) at Burnley Crown Court for seven years.

Lancashire Police carried out a warrant at Baig’s home address on Howard Close on September 6th last year.

A quantity of Class A drugs, namely heroin and cocaine, was recovered and valued at more than £25,000 street value.

Det Sgt Martin Kennedy, of East Police, said: “This is a great result against a prolific drug supplier in the Accrington area and the significant sentence should serve as a warning to others engaged in the supply of illegal drugs.

“We will continue to proactively target those who deal drugs in Lancashire and to put them before the courts but we also need the help of our communities to do this effectively. If anyone has concerns or information about drug dealing where they live they should contact us on 101 or speak to independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
