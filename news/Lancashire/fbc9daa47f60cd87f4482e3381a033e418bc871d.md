**We are appealing for information following an arson in Skelmersdale.**

We were called at 00:04 yesterday (14 May) to reports a car had been set on fire outside a residential garage on Ormskirk Road.

It is believed the car window was smashed and accelerant was used to set the vehicle alight.

A person wearing dark clothing was seen to run from the scene.

Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service extinguished the fire and nobody was harmed.

#### DS Diane Higham said: “It is only by luck that somebody noticed the car was on fire and that it was put out before it caused too much damage or harm to people nearby.

#### “We are looking to find who is responsible for this crime and are asking to speak to anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area around the time to come forward.”

If you have any information please call 101 quoting log number 0004 of 14th May.

Alternatively you can contact independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
