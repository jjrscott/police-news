We are appealing for information following a serious fail to stop collision in Blackburn.

We were called at 13:45 hours yesterday (23 October) to reports a cyclist had been involved in a collision with an articulated HGV. It happened on Longsight Road, close to the junction with Lovely Hall Lane in Salesbury.

The rider of the bicycle, a 78 year old woman, suffered serious injuries including a fractured arm and back fractures.

She was taken to Royal Preston Hospital where her condition is described as stable.

The HGV failed to stop at the scene.

#### PC Jenna Millward of Lancashire’s Tactical Operations Division, said: “Our thoughts are with the woman who is seriously injured in hospital.

#### “We need to trace the vehicle and driver as soon as possible and are urging anybody who saw the incident and has not yet been spoken to, or who has information about the collision, to contact us as soon as possible.

#### “We would also appeal directly to the driver to do the right thing and come forward.”

Anyone with information should call us on 101 quoting log number 735 of 23rd October.
