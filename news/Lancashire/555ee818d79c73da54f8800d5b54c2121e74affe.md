Two men and a boy have been charged by police with the murder of a Blackburn woman.

Alison McBlaine, 36, sadly passed away on Thursday (21st November) in hospital following a serious collision around 7.45pm on Tuesday (19th November) on King Street/ Whalley Banks at the junction with Pearson Street.

Police believe a car, a Fiat Punto Grande, deliberately mounted the pavement before colliding with Alison, and a second pedestrian, a man aged 26 from Blackburn. He sustained serious injuries.

Following extensive enquiries a number of people were arrested by police in connection with Miss McBlaine’s death.

After consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service, Kaylib Connolly, 18, of Ivy Street, Blackburn, Dean Qayum, 20, of Patterdale Avenue, Blackburn and a 16-year-old boy from Blackburn, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were yesterday (Monday, November 25) charged with murder and attempted murder. They have been remanded in custody to appear at Blackburn Magistrates’ Court today (Tuesday, November 26).

A 26-year-old man and a 25-year-old man, both arrested last week, have been bailed to December 19.
