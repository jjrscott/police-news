DETECTIVES are appealing for information after a firearm was discharged in Burnley.

Police were called at shortly after 9pm yesterday (Sunday, October13th) to reports shots had been fired at a property on Colne Road in the town.

Thankfully no-one was injured but damage was caused to a car and a window of the house.

Chief Inspector Ian Cooper, of East Police said: “We’re in the very early stages of an investigation and I would appeal to anyone who saw or heard anything or who has information which could assist to get in touch.

“It is only by good fortune that no-one was seriously hurt or even killed in this incident and we will do all we can to find those responsible.

“I would reassure people that this incident was not directed at the general public and appears to be a targeted attack.”
