A woman has died following a collision in Preston.

We were called at 18:55 hours on Friday (15th November) to reports of a collision on Fishergate Hill. It involved a Scania double decker bus and a pedestrian.

The bus was travelling uphill in a bus lane towards Preston at the time.

The pedestrian, a 32 year old woman from Preston, was taken to Royal Preston Hospital with serious injuries but she sadly passed away today (18th November).

Nobody on the bus was injured.

#### Sgt Phil Baxendale of Lancashire Police’s Tactical Operations Division, said: “Our thoughts are with the woman’s family and friends at this incredibly difficult and tragic time. They are being offered support by specially trained officers.

#### “Our investigation is ongoing and we would encourage anyone with information to speak to us as soon as possible if they haven’t already.”

If you have any information that could assist our investigation, please call 101 or email [email protected] and quote log number 1309 of 15th November.
