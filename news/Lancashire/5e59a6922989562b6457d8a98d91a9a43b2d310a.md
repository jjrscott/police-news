Do you recognise the passenger in this car?

We’d like to speak to him as part of our investigation into the large fire which started on Winter Hill on Thursday June 28.

The car, a black Peugeot, registration MC16 ZNV, was seen in the area around the time the fire was first seen.

We have spoken to the driver as part of our investigation, but are now trying to identify the passenger.

> Det Con Stuart Lunt, of Chorley CID, said: “This is a complex investigation and we are still working hard to find out how this fire started.

> “If you recognise the man in the passenger seat or have any information which could help with our inquiries, please get in touch.”

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting log ref 1176 of June 28.

Alternatively you can call the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or you can do it online at www.lancashire.police.uk/reportonline
