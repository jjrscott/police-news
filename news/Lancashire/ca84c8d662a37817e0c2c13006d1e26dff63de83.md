A woman has this evening (Monday, January 27th) been charged with the murder of Alison McBlaine in Blackburn.

Karis Poynton, 27, of Whalley Road, Clayton-le-Moors, has also been charged with the attempted murder of a 26-year-old man. She is due to appear at Blackburn Magistrates Court tomorrow (Tuesday).

Poynton was arrested this morning along with two other people. A 62-year-old man arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder x 2 has since been released on bail until February 25th and a 25-year-old man arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender and arson has since been released no charge.

Ms McBlain, 36, sadly passed away on November 21st in hospital following a serious collision around 7.45pm on November 19th on King Street/Whalley Banks at the junction with Pearson Street.

Detectives believe a car, a Fiat Punto Grande, mounted the pavement before colliding with Ms McBlain and the 26-year-old man, who sustained serious injuries.

Four people have already been charged in connection with Ms McBlaineâ€™s death.
