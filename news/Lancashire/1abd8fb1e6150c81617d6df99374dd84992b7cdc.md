We are appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Blackpool on Monday.

At around 8pm on 25th February an elderly man was withdrawing cash from an ATM machine on Tyldesley Road when he was approached by an unknown man.

The man shouted towards the 76 year old victim and presented what is believed to be a knife. He then grabbed £50 from the cash dispenser and made off on foot.

He headed along the side of Home Bargains on Hopton Road and the down Blundell Street. It is then believed he went along Rigby Road.

The offender is described as being white, approximately 30 years old and 6 foot tall. He had facial hair and was wearing all dark clothing.

#### DC Justin Hudson of Blackpool CID said: “The victim was on holiday in the area when he was subjected to this robbery. Luckily he didn’t suffer any harm, but it has understandably left him shaken.

#### “We’re doing all we can to find whoever is responsible. If you have any information, or saw anybody acting suspiciously in the area, please get in touch as soon as possible.”

Anyone with information should call 101 or email [email protected] quoting log number 1367 of 25th February.
