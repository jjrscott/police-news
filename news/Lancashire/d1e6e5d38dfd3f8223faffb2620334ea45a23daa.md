Have you seen missing Leigha Birkett, 14, from Blackburn _(pictured)_?

She was last seen at an address on Brodick Road in the town last night (Monday, November 16th) at around 8:30pm. Leigha has not been seen since and so we are very concerned for her welfare.

#### PC Kerry Jarvis from Blackburn Police said: “We urgently need to find Leigha and so I am urging anyone who has seen her or knows where she is to make contact with us as soon as possible.”

Leigha is described as being around 5ft 8ins, of slim build with long brown hair and green eyes. She was last seen wearing a black coat with blue jeans and black and white trainers.

Anyone with information can call 101 quoting incident reference 0052 of November 17th. For immediate sightings of Leigha, please call 999.
