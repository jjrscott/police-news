Have you seen this man?

We want to speak to Reece Cartledge in connection with a number of domestic violence offences, including threats to kill, harassment, coercive control and criminal damage.

Cartledge, 24, last known address Captains Row, Lancaster, has links to Blackpool, Preston and West Yorkshire as well as Lancaster and Morecambe.

He is described as white, five ft 8ins tall, slim build. He has a number of distinctive tattoos, including the words ‘only god can judge me’ and a picture of an eye on his neck and the words ‘RIP Shannon’ on his hand. He also has a scar on his face.

Anyone who sees Cartledge or knows where he may be should email [email protected] or call 101. Alternatively contact independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
