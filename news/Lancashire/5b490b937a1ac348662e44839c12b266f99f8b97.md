Monday, September 7, 2020

We were called at around 9:05pm last night (Sunday, September 6th) to the report of a collision on the M55, approximately one mile before junction 3 on the westbound carriageway.

It is believed that there was a collision between a car and motorcyclist, with another collision between the motorcyclist and a van.

Sadly, the motorcyclist was pronounced dead at the scene.

Two people have been arrested in connection with the incident and remain in police custody at this time.

The motorway remains closed in both directions between junctions 3 to 1 whilst police continue their investigation. It is likely to remain closed for some time.

We would advise motorists to avoid the area and to plan alternative routes.

Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call 101 quoting incident reference 1538 of September 6th.
