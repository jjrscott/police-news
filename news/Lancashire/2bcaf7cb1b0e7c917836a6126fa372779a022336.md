We are appealing for information after a cyclist died in Lea.

We were called at 12:14 yesterday (8 August) to reports a cyclist had fallen from his bike on Sidegreaves Lane.

The 83 year old man from Preston was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

#### Sgt Michael Higginson of Lancashire’s Tactical Operations Division, said: “These are tragic circumstances where a man has died after what we suspect is a medical episode.

#### “Our thoughts are with the gentleman’s family at this incredibly upsetting and difficult time.

#### “If you were in the area and have any information that could help with our investigation, please get in touch.”

You can call us on 101 quoting log number 527 of 8th August
