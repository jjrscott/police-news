Sunday, June 10, 2018

We are appealing for witnesses after a serious collision involving a car and cyclist in Churchtown today (June 10th).

Police were called at around 2pm to reports of the collision on Garstang Road at the junction with Ainspool Lane. It involved a Land Rover Freelander and a mountain bike.

Both vehicles were travelling in the same direction, towards the A6, when they collided.

The cyclist, a man in his 60s, was taken to Royal Preston Hospital after suffering a head injury. His condition is described as serious but stable.

The driver of the Land Rover was uninjured.

The road was closed for around four hours for accident investigation.

#### Sergeant Marc Glass of Lancashire’s Road Policing Unit said: “We are working to establish exactly what happened and are appealing for any witnesses who we have not already spoken to, to please come forward.

#### “If you have any information please call 101 quoting log number 880 of June 10th.”
