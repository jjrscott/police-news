A BLACKBURN nightclub has been closed following a serious incident of disorder.

An urgent licensing review of Nocturnal took place at Blackburn Town Hall today (Friday August 24) after several people were injured during an affray outside the club in St Peter’s Street on Sunday August 19th.

After hearing evidence from Lancashire Constabulary, licensing officers from Blackburn with Darwen council took the decision to suspend the licence with immediate effect.

A full review will be held in 28 days.

> Gary Hennighan, Licensing Sergeant at Lancashire Constabulary, said: “Due to the serious nature of the disorder that took place at Nocturnal nightclub in the early hours of Sunday, 19th August, we had no choice but to call for an expedited review of the licence.

> > “This decision was not taken lightly but first and foremost was to ensure the safety of people having a night out in Blackburn.

> > “I am keen to point out that the disorder is related to the upstairs Nocturnal nightclub rather than the ground level Switch – which has also been affected by this incident.

> > “This kind of incident is fortunately rare at licensed premises but we will take all available courses of action to ensure that pubs and clubs are run safely and take action against those who fail to uphold their licensing obligations.”
