We are appealing for witnesses following a collision in Church.

It happened at around 16:35 hours yesterday (22 January) on Henry Street and involved a police car and a Toyota Aygo.

The driver of the Toyota, a 56-year-old woman from Accrington, suffered hip, leg and abdominal injuries and was taken to Royal Preston Hospital for treatment.

The two police officers in the Hyundai i30 sustained minor injuries.

The road was closed for four and a half hours for collision investigation.

#### Sergeant Michael Higginson of Lancashire's Road Policing Unit, said: “If you witnessed the collision or have any information that could help with our investigation, please let us know.”

Anyone with information should call police on 101 quoting log number 937 of 22 January.

The collision will be referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).
