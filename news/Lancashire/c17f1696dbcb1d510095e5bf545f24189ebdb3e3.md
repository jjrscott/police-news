We are appealing for witnesses after a man suffered a fractured jaw in Accrington.

The victim, 22, was walking along Church Street with two friends at around 4am on Monday 6th May when he was assaulted.

As the group passed a taxi rank, the victim has gone to shake the hand of a man who was leaning against the wall. The man then punched the victim in the face, causing him to fall backwards.

When he got back up to his feet again, the offender had left.

The victim suffered two fractures to his jaw which required surgery.

The offender is described as being white, in his late 20s to early 30s. He was approximately 6ft tall, of stocky build with short sandy coloured curly hair.

He was wearing black jeans or tracksuit bottoms, black Nike trainers with white sole and white tick, beige t-shirt and a black jacket.

#### DC Jane Gregson said: “This was a serious, unprovoked attack on a young man who was out enjoying the bank holiday weekend.

#### “If you were in the area and remember seeing anything suspicious, or the man described please get in touch with us as soon as possible.”
