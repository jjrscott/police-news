Wednesday, July 17, 2019

Following last nightâ€™s use of Section 60 powers in Nelson after serious disorder we would like to thank the community for their support.

Authority for the powers was rescinded at 4am this morning (Wednesday, July 17th) with no further incidents of disorder and no linked arrests, although we did search a number of vehicles and individuals

The use of the powers follows some incidents of serious disorder in the town which we are investigating.

Police were called around 1.15am yesterday (Tuesday, July 16) after reports a number of men carrying machetes had been involved in a fight in the Brunswick Street area.

It is believed the disorder may be connected to two incidents in Nelson on Monday, July 15, including a fight close to Spar in Manchester Road around 11pm and a further report of a fight around 11.40pm in Southfield Street.

Enquiries are on-going with a number of people under arrest.

While there are currently no plans for further use of the Section 60 powers we will be keeping extra police resources in the area as reassurance.

You can find out more about Section 60 authorisations here: https://www.lancashire.police.uk/help-advice/stop-and-search/section-60-without-suspicion-searches/ Anybody with information about the above incidents is asked to get in touch with us on 101, quoting log number 0096 of July 16th or independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
