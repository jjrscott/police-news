We are appealing for information after a motorcyclist died following a collision in Blackburn.

Police were called at shortly before 7am today to reports of a collision between a Range Rover and a Triumph motorbike on Alan Shearer Way at the junction with Aqueduct Road and Bolton Road.

The motorcyclist, a man in his 50s, suffered serious injuries and sadly died a short time later.

Sgt Craig Booth, of Lancashire Constabulary’s Tac Ops, said: “First and foremost my thoughts are with loved ones of the man who has sadly died.

“I would appeal for anyone who witnessed the collision itself or the motorbike in the moments before the collision to get in touch.”

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting log number 295 of Friday, August 7th.
