Have you seen Jack Slaven?

We are trying to trace Jack, 26, as we need to speak to him about a robbery in Blackpool.

He was last seen at 9.30am today (Saturday, May 11th) on Talbot Road and he could be around the town centre.

Officers want to trace Jack following the robbery on Talbot Road on Thursday (May 9th).

Police are also concerned about Jackâ€™s welfare and we are urging him to come forward and contact us.

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 or independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
