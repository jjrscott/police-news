**A fourth person has been charged today (Tuesday, December 17th) as part of the investigation into the murder of Blackburn mum Alison McBlain.**

Ms McBlain, 36, sadly passed away on November 21st in hospital following a serious collision around 7.45pm on November 19th on King Street/Whalley Banks at the junction with Pearson Street.

Detectives believe a car, a Fiat Punto Grande, mounted the pavement before colliding with Ms McBlain and a second pedestrian, a man aged 26 and from Blackburn. He sustained serious injuries.

Following extensive enquiries a number of people were arrested by police in connection with Ms McBlain’s death.

After consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service, Kaylib Connolly, 18, of Ivy Street, Blackburn, Dean Qayum, 20, of Patterdale Avenue, Blackburn and a 16-year-old boy from Blackburn, who cannot be named for legal reasons, have previously been charged with murder and attempted murder and appeared at Blackburn Magistrates’ Court on November 26th.

Today John Chatwood, 25, of Walsh Street, Blackburn, has also been charged with murder and attempted murder and is due to appear at Blackburn Magistrates’ Court tomorrow (Wednesday, December 18th).

Another man, aged 26 and also from Blackburn, was arrested last month on suspicion of the same offences and remains bailed pending further enquiries.
