Do you recognise this man? We want to speak to him in connection with a sexual assault in Fulwood.

Around 5.30pm on October 3, a 13-year-old girl was walking on Black Bull Lane, close to the One Stop store, when she was approached by a man.

The man sexually assaulted the girl, with the teenager shouting at a member of the public for help. The attacker then made off from the scene.

The offender was described as wearing black clothing with blue trainers and a dark coloured baseball cap.

Following enquiries police are keen to identify this man (pictured) in connection with the attack.

#### Sgt Scott Archer, of Preston Police, said: “An investigation is underway after a girl was sexually assaulted in Fulwood.

#### “We are keen to trace this man – do you know who he is?

#### “If you can help, please contact us immediately.”

Anyone with information can contact police on 101 quoting log 1033 of October 3.

Alternatively independent charity Crimestoppers can be contacted on 0800 555 111.
