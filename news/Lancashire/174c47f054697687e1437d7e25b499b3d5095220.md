Wednesday, December 2, 2020

We were called at about 9.30am today (Wednesday, December 2) to a report of a stabbing inside the Marks and Spencer store in Burnley.

Two women received injuries which are thankfully not thought to be life threatening at this time. They have been taken to hospital for treatment.

Police officers were quickly on the scene and a 57-year-old local man was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and is currently in custody.

A knife has been recovered.

Police enquiries are ongoing but at this stage this is believed to be an isolated incident.
