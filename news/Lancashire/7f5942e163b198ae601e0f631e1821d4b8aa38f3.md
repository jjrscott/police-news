We are appealing for witnesses after a 70-year-old man suffered serious injuries in a collision in Bispham.

At around 1pm on Saturday September 23, the man was crossing the Kingraig Road, close to Kingraig Primary School, when he was struck by a Hyundai Insight.

He suffered serious head and pelvic injuries and was taken to Royal Preston Hospital, where he remains in a critical condition.

> Sgt Finn Quainton, of Lancashire Constabulary, said: “This was a serious collision which resulted in very severe injuries for the pedestrian.

> “Our thoughts remain with the man and his family while we try and establish the circumstances surrounding the collision.”

Anyone with information or with dashcam footage which may be of assistance is asked to call 101 quoting log 0654 of September 23.
