​Three people have been charged with attempted murder after a teenage boy was stabbed inside a house in Preston.

Officers were called to an address in Chatham Place at 5.43pm on Wednesday (December 23) where the 16-year-old boy was found with stab injuries to his chest and legs.

He was initially treated at the scene but was later transferred to hospital where he remains in a critical condition with his family by his bedside.

On Thursday (December 24) a 16-year-old boy from Preston and an 18-year-old man from Leyland were both arrested on suspicion of attempted murder; and a 17-year-old boy from Preston was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder.

Following consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service, Jamie Dixon, 18, of Clayton Avenue, Leyland, has this evening been charged with attempted murder, along with a 16-year-old boy and a 17-year-old boy who cannot be identified for legal reasons.

They are due to appear before Preston magistrates tomorrow.

A 20-year-old man and a 28-year-old woman, both from Preston, arrested yesterday (December 26) on suspicion of assisting an offender have since been released under investigation.

A 36-year-old woman from Leyland arrested on Thursday on suspicion of assisting an offender has also been released under investigation.

#### DCI Lee Wilson, of the Force Major Investigation Team, said: “The victim in this case is continuing to battle for his life and my thoughts remain with him and his family at this extremely distressing time.

#### “While we have now charged three males as part of this investigation, our enquiries are very much ongoing.

#### “I want to take this opportunity to thank members of the community for their invaluable help with this investigation so far but would renew my plea that anyone with information in relation to this offence comes forward.”
