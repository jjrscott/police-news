A woman and a 16-year-old girl have suffered knife injuries following an attack at a house in Preston.

We were called at around 9:25pm on Thursday evening (June 20th) following the report of an altercation at an address on Derry Road in the Ribbleton area.

It is believed that a man stabbed a woman in her thirties causing injuries to her arm and face. A 16-year-old girl who tried to intervene was also attacked, suffering an injury to her head.

They were both taken to Royal Preston Hospital to be treated for lacerations. Their injuries are not thought to be life threatening.

The offender made off from the scene.

A 33 old man was later arrested in Rochdale. He is currently in police custody.

Inspector Martin Pearson said: “We would like to reassure local residents that we believe all parties are known to each other and this was an isolated attack. We do not believe there is a threat to the wider public.

“Our thoughts are with the two victims of this nasty attack who we hope and trust will make a speedy recovery from their ordeal.”

If anyone has any information that could assist our investigation, they can call 101 quoting incident reference 1762 of June 20th.
