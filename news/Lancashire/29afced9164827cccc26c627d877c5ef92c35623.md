DETECTIVES are investigating after a man reported he was raped in Blackpool.

The 29 year old victim was on a night out in the town centre and was walking back to a friend’s address at about 10.30pm on Saturday (August 18th) when he was approached by two men on Middle Walk on the ramp area leading to Pleasant Street.

One of the men pushed the victim to his knees and the other then sexually assaulted him.

The offender is described as white, around 5”8, slim build, no older than 24yrs wearing a black jacket and grey cotton tracksuit bottoms. The other man was white, slightly taller than the offender, medium build wearing a white vest and heavy duty combat pants. Both had local accents.

Both offenders walked off in the direction of the Metropole Hotel.

Detective Constable Sarah Moyes, of Blackpool CID, said: “This man was walking home when he was sexually assaulted and I would appeal to anyone who may have witnessed anything in the area or who recognises the description of the two offenders to come forward and contact us.”

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting log number 1753 of August 18th or independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
