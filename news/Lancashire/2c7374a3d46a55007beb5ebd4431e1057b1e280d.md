We are appealing for information following a fail to stop collision in St Annes last night.

We were called at 21:05 hours on Sunday (15 September) to reports a pedestrian had been seriously injured on St Annes Road West.

It was reported she had been involved in a collision with a car that had stopped briefly close to the scene before driving off.

The pedestrian - a woman in her 80s from Blackpool – suffered a number of serious injuries including a broken elbow, broken ribs and fractured ankle. She was taken to Royal Preston Hospital where she is receiving treatment.

The car involved is described as a dark coloured saloon.

#### Sgt Phil Baxendale of Lancashire Police’s Tac Ops Division said: “A woman is in hospital in a serious condition and our thoughts are very much with her at this time.

#### “We are treating this as a fail to stop collision and need anyone who may have seen the vehicle described, or the collision itself, to come forward with information.

#### “I would also appeal directly to the driver of the car to search their conscience and do the right thing. If this is you, you need to come forward and speak to us.”

Anyone with information should call us on 101 quoting log number 1528 of 15 September.
