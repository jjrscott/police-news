We are appealing for information following a serious assault in Blackburn.

At some time between 16:30 hours and 18:00 hours on Sunday 14th October, a man and his friend were walking along Queen Victoria Street with two dogs.

Three unknown men, believed to be in their 20s drove past the victim and his friend in a dark coloured car, possibly a Ford Fiesta.

It is believed the vehicle turned down Mill Hill Street and minutes later, the occupants appeared on foot.

They approached the victim and one of the men punched the victim once to the left side of his face. He had to have surgery for a broken jaw.

#### DC Fiona Hall, said: “This has been a serious assault which has left the victim with a serious facial injury. We’re working to establish who is responsible, and are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

#### “This has happened in daylight in a busy part of town. If you saw anything suspicious, we need you to let us know.”

Anyone with information should email [email protected] or call 101, quoting log number LC-20181017-1361.
