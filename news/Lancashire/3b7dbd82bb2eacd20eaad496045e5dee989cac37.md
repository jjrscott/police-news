Five people have now been arrested following a firearms discharge in Preston.

Police were contacted at shortly before 2am on Tuesday (October 23rd) to a report that a single shot from a shotgun had been fired through the door of a house in Browning Road, Ribbleton.

Four people were arrested earlier this week on suspicion of possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.

They are a 38-year old-woman, 25-year-old man, 30-year old man and 20-year-old man – all from Preston.

A fifth person - a 27-year-old man from Preston - was arrested last night (25th October) on suspicion of possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.

They have all been released on police bail.

A vehicle believed to have been used in the incident has been recovered.

#### Detective Chief Inspector Richard McCutcheon of Lancashire Police said: “Our enquiries into the incident remain ongoing. If you saw or heard anything suspicious around the time or have any information which could assist our investigation, please let us know.

#### “I would like to remind the community that this incident was not directed at the general public and appears to be a targeted attack.”

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting log 0070 of October 23rd or independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
