Do you recognise this man?

Police want to speak to him in connection with a serious fail to stop collision in Adlington.

We were called at around 10pm on 31 December to reports an 18 year old woman had been involved in a collision on Church Street, Adlington.

She was taken to Royal Preston Hospital with multiple injuries and is still recovering.

The vehicle – a Toyota Yaris – failed to stop at the scene and was later found abandoned in a nearby alleyway.

We have been making a number of extensive enquiries and now want to speak to the pictured man as part of our investigation.

He is known as Ioan Bogdan, 26, but may go by other names.

#### PC Damian Whittle of Preston Police, said: “If you know the man in the picture, or have any information about his whereabouts, please contact us as soon as possible.”

If you have any information please dial 07970501938 or 101 quoting log number 1367 of 31 December. Alternatively you can email [email protected] or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on **0800 555 111.**
