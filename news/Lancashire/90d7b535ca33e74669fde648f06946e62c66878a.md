Police searching for a missing Preston man have sadly found a body.

John Rigby, 37, was last seen around 1pm on Monday (November 25) on Alston Lane.

Following extensive searches police yesterday (Tuesday, November 26) recovered a body close to Alston Lane.

While formal identification has yet to be carried out the body is believed to be that of Mr Rigby. His family have been informed and our thoughts are with them at this time.

The death is not being treated as suspicious and a file will be passed to the coroner.

We would like to thank everyone who assisted during the search for John.
