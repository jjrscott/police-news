Have you seen Ryan Tyson Murrayland?

The 30 year old from Manchester is wanted for breaching his sex offender notification requirements and on recall to prison for breaching his bail conditions.

He was jailed in 2015 for sexual activity with a child.

He is described as being 5ft 8in tall and of proportionate build. He has blue eyes, short blonde hair.

DS Angela Grey of West’s Management of Sexual and violent Offenders team, said: “If you have seen Murrayland or have any information about where he might be, please call us immediately. I would also urge Ryan, if he sees this, to contact us.”

Murrayland has links to Blackpool, in particular the Mereside area.

Anyone with information should call 01253 604019, or failing that, 101.
