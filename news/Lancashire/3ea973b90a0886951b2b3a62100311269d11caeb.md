We are appealing for information after thousands of pounds worth of electronic equipment was stolen from Currys PC World in Ribbleton.

Police were called to the store on Blackpool Road around 3am on April 23rd following a report of a break in after the alarm was triggered.

Offenders are thought to have gained entry into the warehouse area of the unit via the back of the building and taken stock worth upwards of £6,000.

Some of the stolen equipment which includes laptops, speakers, microphones and headphones has since been recovered after being found in a nearby wheelie bin but several items are still thought to be outstanding.

PC Thomas Rettie of Lancashire Police said: “We would appeal to anyone who has been approached to buy any electronic equipment in the past week or anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area around Currys PC World at the time of the break-in or in the hours leading up to it to please get in touch.”

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 or email [email protected] quoting log number 0181 of April 23rd. Alternatively information can be given anonymously to Crimestoppers by calling 0800 555 111.
