Detectives are appealing for information following an arson attack in Morecambe.

Police were called by Lancashire Fire and Rescue around 11.55pm yesterday (Wednesday, February 3) to a report of an incident in Beecham Street.

Fire crews had attended the scene and found the entrance to a property ablaze.

The crews quickly put out the fire with no injuries reported. Following a joint investigation between firefighters and police, the incident is being treated as suspicious as it is believed the fire was started deliberately.

#### Det Sgt Sam Johnson, of Lancaster CID, said: “We have launched an arson investigation following a property fire in Morecambe.

#### “Initial enquiries between both the fire service and police suggest the fire had been started deliberately’.

#### “This is clearly very concerning and we are urging anyone with information about the incident to come forward.

#### “Did you see anyone acting suspiciously in the Beecham Street area between 11.00pm and 11.55pm? If so please come forward.”

Anyone with information can contact police on 101 quoting log 1720 of February 3.
