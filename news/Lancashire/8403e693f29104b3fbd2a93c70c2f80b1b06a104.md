Following our earlier post, responding to claims of an abduction in Preston, we have now been able to clarify exactly what occurred and can confirm that no abduction has occurred.

We were called at around 5.10pm yesterday (Sunday) to reports of children causing a nuisance at an empty business premises at Southgate, Preston.

Initial reports suggested the children were on the roof of the building which had been damaged by fire and was unsafe.

At the same time we also received a report of criminal damage to a car in the same area.

We attended a short time later and found the person who made the call to us had briefly detained two girls in his car while he waited for officers to arrive on the scene. Words of advice were given to all parties and no serious offences were committed, or are being investigated at this time.
