We are appealing for witnesses after a collision on the M61 motorway left a man with serious injuries.

Police were called at shortly before 11am after a Mercedes C220 collided with the rear of a VW Passat, shunting it off the carriageway and into a tree.

The driver of the Passat, a 38 year old man from Hull, suffered serious injuries and was taken by ambulance to the Royal Preston Hospital where he remains in a serious condition.

Three passengers in the Passat, a man and two women also from Hull, suffered more minor injuries.

The driver of the Mercedes, a 27 year old man from Blackpool, was arrested on suspicion of drug driving, causing serious injury by dangerous driving and having no insurance. He has been released under investigation

The motorway was closed for about five hours.

The collision happened Southbound close to Junction 9.

Sgt Martin Wilcock, of Tac Ops, said: “This collision has left a man with some very serious injuries and I would appeal to anyone who witnessed the collision itself, or the Mercedes in the moments beforehand, to get in touch. I would also appeal to anyone who has any dash cam footage to contact us.”

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting log number 0439 of Sunday, April 14th
