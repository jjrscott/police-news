A man has been charged in connection with a robbery at a newsagent in Rawtenstall.

We were called at around 9.40am yesterday (November 25th) to reports that a man had stolen a till from Bank Street News and ran away on foot.

Officers attended and after a search of the area a man was quickly located and arrested. They also recovered the till and a weapon.

During the incident a 38-year-old man was injured and later taken to hospital to be treated for puncture wounds to his cheek.

Earlier today Connor Stokes, 24, of Linden Lea, Rawtenstall was charged with robbery and possession of an offensive weapon.

He was due to appear before Blackburn Magistrates this morning.
