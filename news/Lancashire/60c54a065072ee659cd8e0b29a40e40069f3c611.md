We are appealing for witnesses following a fatal road traffic collision on Newton Drive in Blackpool on Monday (24th September).

Police were called at around 14:40 to reports of the collision involving a Ford Fiesta and a pedestrian who was walking with his dog.

It happened close to the junction with Tarnbrook Drive.

The pedestrian – a 73 year old man suffered serious head injuries and was taken to Blackpool Victoria Hospital where he was sadly pronounced dead a short time later.

The dog was taken to the vets to be treated for minor injuries.

#### Sergeant Finn Quainton of Lancashire’s Road Policing Unit, said: “First of all, my thoughts are with the gentleman’s family at this incredibly tragic time.

#### “We’re working to establish the circumstances around the collision and would ask that anyone who witnessed the collision, or was driving along Newton Drive around the time and has dash cam footage, to let us know as soon as possible.”

Anyone with information can contact us by calling 101 quoting log number 755 of 24th September.
