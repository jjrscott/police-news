WE are appealing for witnesses after a collision in Burnley which left a motorcyclist with serious injuries.

The collision happened shortly before 2pm yesterday (Thursday, June 6th) at the junction of Oxford Road and Clarence Street when a Kawasaki motorbike collided with a Ford Focus.

The motorbike rider, a 29-year old man from Burnley, suffered serious leg injuries and was taken by ambulance to hospital.

The motorbike is believed to have been stolen from an address in Nelson earlier in the day.

The driver of the Ford Focus, a 45-year old man from Burnley, was uninjured but was subsequently arrested on suspicion of drug driving. He has been released under investigation.

Sgt Oliver Jones, of Tac Ops, said: “This collision has left a man with some significant injuries and I would appeal for anyone who witnessed the collision or who has dashcam footage or CCTV to contact the police. I would also appeal to anyone who saw the motorbike in the moments prior to the collision to get in touch.”

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting log number 0802 of June 6th.
