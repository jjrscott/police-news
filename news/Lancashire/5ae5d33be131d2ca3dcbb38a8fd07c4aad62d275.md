Police searching for missing man Luke Noone have found a body.

Luke, 21, from the Islington area of Blackburn, was last seen on October 15 in Darwen.

Following extensive searches police recovered a body from a reservoir close to Punstock Road on November 6.

He has since been identified as Mr Noone. His family have been informed and our thoughts are with them at this time.

We would like to thank everyone who assisted during the search for Luke.

The death is not being treated as suspicious and a file will be passed to the coroner.
