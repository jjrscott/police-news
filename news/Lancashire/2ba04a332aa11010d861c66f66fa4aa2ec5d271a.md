A number of people have been charged by detectives in connection with a firearms investigation by Lancashire Police.

Three people were arrested at an address on Lowergate in Clitheroe on Wednesday (June 27) and a further arrest was made at an address on Bradshaw Street in Nelson on Thursday (June 28).

The four people - a 26-year-old man, 43-year-old man, 46-year-old woman and a 23-year-old woman - were taken into custody and searches conducted at both addresses.

Pawel Poltacha, 26, of Lowergate, Clitheroe, Jacek Olszewski, 43, of Bradshaw Street, Nelson and Mayuri Achchutan, 23, of Bradshaw Street, Nelson, have since been charged with being knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of prohibition on a prohibited weapon.

The charges relate to the attempted importation of a Glock 17 handgun and a Ruger handgun.

All have been remanded to appear at Preston Magistrates' Court today (June 30).

A 46-year-old woman was released no charge.
