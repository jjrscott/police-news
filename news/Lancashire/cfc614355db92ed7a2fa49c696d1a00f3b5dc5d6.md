DETECTIVES investigating a murder in Nelson have charged a man.

Following consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service, Atif Muhmood, 38, of Bankhouse Road, Nelson has this afternoon (Wednesday, July 4th) been charged with the murder of Christopher Moore.

Muhmood will appear before magistrates in Blackburn tomorrow morning (Thursday, July 5th)

Police were called by the Ambulance Service around 10pm on June 20th to reports of a sudden death in Derby Street. Officers attended and the body of 45-year-old Christopher Moore was sadly found at the scene. The death was initially treated as non-suspicious, but following further investigation and a Home Office post mortem, Mr Moore was found to have suffered a number of injuries.

Police are continuing to support Mr Mooreâ€™s family at this time.

Anyone with information which could assist the investigation should contact the police on 101 quoting log 1657 of June 20th.

Alternatively you can contact independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously and in confidence on 0800 555 111.
