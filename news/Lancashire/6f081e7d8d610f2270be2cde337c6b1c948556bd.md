Two men have been charged in connection with a firearms discharge in Brierfield.

The incident happened at around 7.10pm on Wednesday (March 10th) following an altercation on Humphrey Street and a previous incident a short time earlier at the nearby Morrisons Daily store on Colne Road.

An 18-year-old man suffered facial injuries as a result.

Neil Barnett, 34 and Lee Barnett, 37, both of Kinross Street, Burnley, have been charged with attempted murder and will appear before Blackburn Magistrates' Court today (Monday, March 15th).

A woman, 32, from Nelson arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder and assisting an offender has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

We would like to thank the local community for their support.
