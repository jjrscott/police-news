**We are appealing for information after a man was seriously injured in a collision near Bickerstaffe.**

It happened at around 12:22 today (8 June). A Volkswagen Golf was travelling eastbound on the M58 close to Bickerstaffe when it left the carriageway and collided with undergrowth and a tree.

The driver of the car, a man in his 30s from Upholland, suffered a number of serious injuries. He was taken to Aintree Hospital where he is said to be in a poorly condition.

A 4 year old boy who was a passenger in the front of the car received a minor injury to his head. He was taken to Alder Hey hospital but later discharged.

#### Sgt Mick Belfield of Lancashire’s Road Policing Unit said: “Our thoughts are with the man who is seriously injured at this time.

#### “We’re working to establish the circumstances surrounding the collision and would ask that anyone who witnessed it, or has any dash cam footage, gets in touch as soon as possible.”

Anyone with information should call 101 and quote log number 580 of 8th June.
