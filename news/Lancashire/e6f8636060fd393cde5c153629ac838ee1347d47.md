We are appealing for information following a serious assault in Rawtenstall.

Officers were called after a report that a man had been assaulted on Bacup Road at around 00:55 hours on Bank Holiday Monday, August 31st.

The victim was approached by a man leaving Mimi’s Takeaweay, who punched him to the head, causing him to fall and hit his head, resulting in a fractured skull.

The 36-year-old victim was taken to hospital to be treated for his injuries where he remains.

We are investigating the incident and would now like to appeal to anyone who witnessed the assault, or nearby properties who may have CCTV of the area, to come forward.

### DS Ash Johnston of Burnley CID said: “This happened at a time of night when people will have been in the area on nights out and so we’d appeal to anyone who saw this incident to contact police. This is a brutal attack, and incidents of this nature will not be tolerated.

### “During that time, there were pockets of other disorder in the Rawtenstall area. We believe that this is unrelated, and we’re focussing on this assault as an isolated incident.”

Anyone with information is asked to call police on 01282472205, or failing that, 101, quoting log number 0078 of August 31st.
