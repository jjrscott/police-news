WE are appealing for witnesses after a collision left several people injured.

Police were called at shortly before 7.30pm yesterday (Thursday, August 16th) after a Vauxhall Vectra was involved in a head on collision with a Ford Focus travelling in the opposite direction. The collision happened on Roundhill Road, Haslingden, near to the Farmer’s Glory pub.

The driver of the Vauxhall, a 34 year old man from Haslingden, suffered bruising. Two children who were passengers in the car also suffered bruising. They were an eight year old girl and a ten year old boy, also from Haslingden. They were taken to the Manchester Children’s Hospital.

The driver of the Ford Focus, a 48 year old man from Haslingden, suffered broken bones and was taken to the Royal Blackburn Hospital.

The road was closed for five hours for accident investigation.

Sgt Tracey Ward, of the Road Policing Unit, said: “This was a serious incident and I would appeal to anyone who witnessed either the collision itself or the Vauxhall Vectra prior to the collision to get in touch.”

Anyone with information should call police on 101 quoting log number 1413 of August 16th.
