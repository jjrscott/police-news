We are appealing for information after a teenage boy was left with potentially life-threatening head injuries following a road traffic collision in Preston yesterday (March 17).

Officers were called at 2.55pm to reports a 14-year-old boy had been struck by a Ford Transit van on Black Bull Lane at the junction of Queens Drive.

The boy was airlifted to Alder Hey Children’s Hospital, where he remains in a critical but stable condition.

The driver of the van stopped at the scene and no arrest has been made.

Officers are now appealing for witnesses and are keen to hear from anybody with CCTV, dashcam or mobile phone footage of the incident.

#### Sgt Craig Booth, of Lancashire Police’s tactical operations, said: “This incident has left a young man very seriously injured and my thoughts are with him and his loved ones at this difficult time.

#### “We are at the early stages of our investigation and I am asking anybody who has information or footage which could assist with our enquiry to please get in touch with police.”

Anybody with information is asked to call police on 101, quoting log 0879 of March 17, 2021 or report it online at https://doitonline.lancashire.police.uk/
