A man has been charged following an incident in Accrington.

Daniel Halstead, 32, of Bobbin Close, Accrington, was charged with section 18 assault and is due to appear at Burnley Crown Court on February 27th.

Police were called shortly after 4.30am on Friday (January 25th) to reports a man had been assaulted with a baseball bat on Edgar Street in the town.

A 48-year-old man suffered a bleed on the brain and fractures to the skull and was taken to the Royal Preston Hospital where he remains in a critical but stable condition.

We are continuing to appeal for information about the incident and any witnesses are asked to contact DS Sarah Hargreaves on [email protected] or by calling independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
