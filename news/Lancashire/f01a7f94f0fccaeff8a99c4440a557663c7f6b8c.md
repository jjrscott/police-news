SECTION 60 powers are in place in Preston.

The powers have been authorised following two incidents of disorder in the Deepdale and Brookfield areas this afternoon (Saturday, July 20th)

Having a Section 60 in place gives us the power to search people or vehicles without suspicion in an area where we believe violence could take place.

This should not overly concern people. It’s not about targeting people,but is about making sure we do all we can to keep people safe.

The powers – which apply in the area shown on the map - were put in place at 7pm today and will last until 7am tomorrow (Sunday, July 21st)
