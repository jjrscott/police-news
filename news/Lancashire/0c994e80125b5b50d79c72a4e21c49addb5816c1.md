**Discovery at Accrington Cemetery - update**

Following a discovery at Accrington Cemetery on the evening of Saturday, August 24th we can now sadly confirm that the find is that of the body of a woman.

Police were called at shortly before 8pm on Saturday, August 24th to a report by a member of the public of the find in an area of Accrington Cemetery, Burnley Road.

A lengthy and detailed examination of the scene has been carried out through the day by forensic experts.

We are not in a position to confirm the womanâ€™s identity at this stage and while the family of missing teaching assistant Lindsay Birbeck have been told of this latest development we would ask once again that people do not speculate on social media as this could cause the family additional distress.

A Home Office post mortem examination will now be carried out to try to establish the cause of death.

Enquiries are continuing and we will continue to update you when we can.
