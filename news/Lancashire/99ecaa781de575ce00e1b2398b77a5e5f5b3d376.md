*****Urgent appeal******

Do you know this man?

We are appealing for help to find him after a police officer and member of the public were threatened with a syringe.

The man was disturbed by police at the scene of a burglary on South Park Drive at about 2.30pm today (June 12th)

He ran off but was caught by police on Carsluith Avenue when he pulled out a syringe and threatened the officer. He also threatened a member of the public with the needle when running off.

He is described as white, bald, grey stubbly beard, wearing a dark puffa jacket.

PC Nathan Gulati, of Blackpool Police, said: “We need to find this man as a matter of urgency as he is clearly prepared to threaten both police officers and members of the public. If you know him or where he may be please get in touch with us.”

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting log number 0643 of today or independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. You can also email [email protected]

For immediate sightings please call 999.
