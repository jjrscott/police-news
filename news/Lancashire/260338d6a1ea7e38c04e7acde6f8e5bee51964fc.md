**Do you recognise this man?**

We want to speak to him after a fight outside Ma Kelly’s in Talbot Road, Blackpool on Wednesday August 1st.

At 11:30pm a man is thought to have swung a knife at another man, which led to a fight between the pair between the doorways of the pub.

One of the men suffered an injury to his eye.

> Det Con Joe Isaacs, of Blackpool CID, said: “We are asking for the public’s help to identify the man in the picture.

> “If anyone was in the area and saw the fight, or has any information, please call us.”

The man is white, approx. 5ft 10ins, and was wearing a bright blue T-shirt, blue jeans, Nike trainers and carrying a large shopping bag.

Anyone with information is asked to call 01253 604141or email [email protected] quoting log 1792 of August 1st.
