POLICE searching for a missing woman have found a body.

Brenda Wignall, 58, was last seen in the early hours of Friday, October 11th at her home address in Preston and extensive searches have been taken place since.

A woman’s body was found at South Walney Nature Reserve in Barrow at around 10.30am today.

While the body has yet to be formally identified it is sadly believed to be that of Mrs Wignall. Her family have been informed.

There are no suspicious circumstances and a file will be prepared for HM Coroner.

Our thoughts are with Brenda’s family and friends at this extremely sad and difficult time.

Thank-you to everyone who took the time to share our appeals during the search.
