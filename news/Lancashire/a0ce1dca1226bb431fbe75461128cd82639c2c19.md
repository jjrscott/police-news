A man who was charged with murder following the death of his brother in Lancaster has admitted a lesser charge of assault.
Police were called at around 6.40pm on Saturday, Sept 5th to reports that a man had been assaulted near to Barclays Bank.
We were subsequently called at 10.15am on Monday (September 7th) to an address in Chestnut Grove, Lancaster, following reports of a sudden death.
Enquiries established the deceased man was 46-year-old Seamus Cuffe who was the victim of the earlier altercation.
Following enquiries we arrested Kieran Cuffe, Seamus’ brother and after consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service, Kieran Cuffe, 48, of Dunkeld Street, Lancaster was charged with murder.
However, following further pathological evidence Seamus Cuffe’s death, has now been shown to have no link to the assault. It will now proceed to an inquest.
Kieran Cuffe, 48, of Dunkeld Street appeared at Preston Crown Court on December 18th when the murder charge was formally withdrawn and replaced with a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He has pleaded guilty to that charge and will be sentenced on February 18th.
The Cuffe family have been informed.
