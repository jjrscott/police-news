We are appealing for information following a robbery.

We were called at 18:44 hours on Sunday (15 December) to reports of the incident in Appley Bridge.

It was reported that a man had completed a takeaway delivery on Finch Lane when he was threatened by two men. They were holding weapons – one believed to be a gun and the other, an iron bar.

As the victim left his vehicle, a blue Ford Fiesta, he was approached by another man in a black Saab Estate who took a small amount of money from his hand. The Saab then drove off, with the two offenders leaving in the victim’s car.

The victim was not hurt.

The Fiesta was later found by police in a car park in Shevington.

Nobody has been arrested at this stage. Enquires are ongoing.

#### DC Danny Gardner of Ormskirk Police said: “We would appeal to anyone who saw anything suspicious to get in touch.

#### “We are particularly keen to know if anyone has seen the two vehicles described between 18:44 and 19:10 hours on Sunday. If you have any information at all, no matter how small, please pick up the phone.”

Anyone with information should call 101 quoting log number 1140 of 15 December.

Alternatively Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.
