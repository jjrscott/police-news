Do you recognise this man?

We want to speak to him following a robbery in Blackburn this weekend.

We were called at around 10.15pm yesterday (Sunday 13 January) to reports of a robbery at Domino’s Pizza on the Royal Retail Park, Blackburn.

A man had entered the store shortly after 9.30pm and had made threats towards a member of staff with a needle, before taking a small amount of cash from the till area.

Nobody was hurt.

The man exited the store before leaving the area in a dark-coloured vehicle, later identified as being a taxi.

Following enquiries, we believe the man had travelled from McDonald’s on Livesey Branch Road in Ewood to Domino’s in a taxi.

#### DS Sarah Hargreaves said: “Luckily nobody was hurt, but this has understandably been a traumatic experience for the worker involved.

#### “If you saw anything or recognise the man in the picture, please let us know.”

The man is described as white, late 40s to mid-50s, skinny build and around 5ft 8in tall. He was wearing a red beanie hat, dirty white combat pants and had a scarf covering his mouth. He is described as having a teardrop tattoo under one of his eyes. He also had rucksack with him.

Anyone with information should call 101 or email [email protected] quoting log number 1257 of 13 January
