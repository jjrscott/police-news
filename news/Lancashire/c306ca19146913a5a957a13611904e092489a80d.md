Lancashire Constabulary has been re awarded its accreditation from the White Ribbon Campaign.

The White Ribbon Campaign is an initiative that aims to end violence against women.

The Award is a recognition of the work the Constabulary has already undertaken to challenge this type of violence.

In 2017, Lancashire became the first White Ribbon County with, Lancashire Constabulary, the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner all Lancashire District Councils and Unitary Authorities achieving the White Ribbon Accreditation to mark their commitment to ending violence against women and girls.

Part of the work that is required to achieve reaccredited status involves demonstrating how the organisation has raised awareness of the campaign to engage men and boys in helping to end male violence towards women.

Over the last two years, the Constabulary has:

 * Been a key partner in the pan-Lancashire Domestic Abuse Strategic Group which is evidence of the county wide commitment to raising awareness of, and tackling, domestic abuse
 * Increased the number of Ribbon Ambassadors and Champions within the organisation
 * Embedded the White Ribbon Campaign into the training for new recruits to enable them to be aware of and spot the early signs of domestic abuse

Detective Chief Inspector Jason Richardson of Lancashire Constabulary said: “ _We are delighted to have been reaccredited by the White Ribbon campaign as part of our commitment to_ _keeping people safe. I’d encourage anyone of any gender who is experiencing domestic abuse of any form to contact us, assured that we will respond sensitively and work with them to protect them.”_

Lancashire Police and Crime Commissioner Clive Grunshaw added: _"I am proud to see Lancashire Constabulary reaccredited by White Ribbon UK._

_"We have to stand side by side in speaking up against domestic violence and abuse in Lancashire and this accreditation is credit to the Constabulary's efforts to protect victims and bring offenders to justice._

_"We must do all we can to challenge offending behaviours and to ensure that victims know that support is out there for them and the White Ribbon campaign provides the opportunity to share these messages far and wide."_

Anyone, male or female, affected by abuse in Lancashire can find details of their local support services at www.noexcuseforabuse.co.uk
