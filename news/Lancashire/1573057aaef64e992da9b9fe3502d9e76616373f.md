Do you recognise this man? He is wanted by police in connection with a robbery in Fleetwood.

Around 9.30pm on Friday (February 19) a man entered the One Stop shop in Lindel Road with a knife.

The man threatened to harm the shop worker, a woman in her 60s, demanding money from the till.

The victim opened the till with the offender making off from the scene with a quantity of cash.

Following investigation, we want to identify this man (pictured).

He is described as 5ft 8in tall, wearing a royal blue North Face hoody with distinctive red markings, black trousers and black trainers. His face was covered by a light coloured beanie hat with eye holes and a facemask. He was also wearing gloves.

**Det Con Cherie Hall, of Blackpool CID, said: “This was a shocking and worrying incident which left the victim very shaken.**

**“We know someone in the Fleetwood area will recognise this individual.**

**“Please come forward and contact police if you can help.”**

Anyone with information can call 101 or email [email protected] quoting log 1552 of February 19.
