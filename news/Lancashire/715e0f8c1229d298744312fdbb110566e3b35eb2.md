Detectives investigating an attack on a man in his Preston home during a burglary have arrested two teenagers.

The incident happened at around 2:40pm on Tuesday (December 18th) after the victim, a 23-year-old man from Preston, was followed by two men as he walking along Meadow Street. When he made his way into a block of flats on Graham Street he was forced inside and assaulted and threatened with a knife.

A Playstation console and a computer mouse were stolen.

Two 17-year-old youths were arrested on Christmas Day on suspicion of aggravated burglary and have been bailed pending further enquiries.
