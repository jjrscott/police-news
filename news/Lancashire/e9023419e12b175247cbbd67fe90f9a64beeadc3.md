Two children who were missing from Skelmersdale have been found safe and well.

The boy and girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, were found in the Merseyside area this evening (27 June) following an appeal.

They had last been seen in Skelmersdale in the early hours of Wednesday morning (26 June).

Thanks to everyone who shared our appeal.
