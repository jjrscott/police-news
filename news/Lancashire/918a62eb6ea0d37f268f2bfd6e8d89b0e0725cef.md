A man wanted in connection with a firearms discharge has been arrested.

Hasriat Omar Khan, 32, formerly of Moorlands View, Ramsbottom, was wanted in connection with the incident which occurred on May 7th 2017 at around 1.10am, when a firearm was discharged at an address on Beaconsfield Street. Nobody was hurt during the incident.

After failing to attend the end of the trial at Preston Crown Court, Khan was convicted of one count of conspiracy to possess a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence on 18 April. He was later sentenced in his absence to 8 years in prison with an extended licence of a year.

He was arrested last night (17 June) in the Blackburn area and is currently in police custody.
