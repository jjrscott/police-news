Have you seen Lewis Westwood?

We are re-appealing for information about the 25 year old who is wanted for absconding from HMP Kirkham on 4 August.

Westwood, who is previously of Hillbrook Road, Leyland, was jailed at Preston Crown Court for 8 years in 2014 for grievous bodily harm with intent. He was recalled to prison on 8th March 2018 for breaching his licence conditions.

Westwood is 5ft 7in tall and of slim build. He has blue eyes, short blonde/ brown hair and speaks with a regional accent.

He has links to Lancashire (in particular, South Ribble), Manchester, Merseyside and South Yorkshire.

#### Sergeant Paul McLernon said: “Westwood has been wanted for almost two months and we have been making extensive enquiries to find him. If you have seen him or have any information at all about where might be, please do not approach him but contact us.” You can call us on 101 quoting log number 1256 of 4th August. For immediate sightings please call 999.

Alternatively independent charity Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.
