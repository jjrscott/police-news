Can you help us to identify the people in these images?

We want to speak to them about an incident in Blackpool in which a man in his 20s suffered serious injuries.

At around 4.40am on Sunday July 29th the man, who had come to Blackpool from the Stockport area to attend the Pier Jam festival, got into a confrontation with three men and a woman in Cocker Street, close to the junction with Dickson Road.

One of the men punched him to the ground, and when the man got to his feet, a second man punched him back to the ground.

The other man and woman witnessed the attack but did not take part in it.

Det Con Queenie Chan, of Blackpool Police, said: “This man suffered serious injuries and was operated on at Manchester Royal Infirmary.

“His jaw was broken in three places and he had injuries to his head, eye and face.

“We realise the CCTV is not the best quality but we are hoping someone may recognise the people pictured as we try to investigate this serious incident.”

Anyone with information is asked to call 01253 604112 or 101 quoting reference WA1818079.

Alternatively you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or report online at **lancashire.police.uk/reportonline**
