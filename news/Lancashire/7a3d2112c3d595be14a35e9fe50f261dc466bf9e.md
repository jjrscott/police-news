Do you know these men?

We are trying to trace them after an arson on Vicarage Lane in Blackpool.

Police were called by the fire service at about 8.30pm on June 2nd after reports a Vauxhall Agila had been set alight in a car park next to the Tangerine Factory.

It is believed the vehicle was left there the day before, before it was set on fire.

PC Dan Knowles, of Blackpool Police, said: “We need to find these two men and I would appeal for anyone with information to contact us. This car was set alight very close to bushes attached to a house so it is fortunate the consequences were not far more serious.”

Anyone with information should contact police 101 quoting log 1433 of June 2nd or independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
