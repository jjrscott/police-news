WE are appealing for witnesses after a motorcyclist was seriously injured in a collision on the M65.

The collision happened at just after 7.20pm yesterday (Monday, June 18th) on the Eastbound carriageway near Junction 2 when a Yamaha R6 motorbike left the carriageway and hit a barrier. No other vehicles are thought to have been involved.

The rider, a 49 year old man from Wales, suffered serious injuries and was taken by ambulance to the Royal Preston Hospital where he is currently in a serious condition.

The road was closed for around 4 hours for accident investigations.

Sgt Chris Evans, of the Road Policing Unit, said: “This collision has left a man with some very significant injuries and I would appeal for anyone with information to come forward and contact police.”

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting log number 1411 of June 18th.
