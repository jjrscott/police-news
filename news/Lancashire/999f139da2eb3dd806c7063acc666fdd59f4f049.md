THE family of a man found dead in Kirkham have paid tribute to him.

Lee Walker, 47, was found at an address on Chestnut Close in the town last Wednesday (April 8th)

Police are treating the death as unexplained. A Home Office post mortem examination was carried out last week but a cause of death has yet to be established.

Enquiries are on-going and a 39-year-old woman from Preston has been arrested on suspicion of murder and released under investigation.

In a tribute Lee’s family said: “Lee was a great son, kind, thoughtful, generous and funny. All our hearts are broken. He tried so hard adapting to becoming paraplegic. We are all so proud of him, RIP my loving son Lee xxx.”

“Our enquiries are very much on-going and while we have made an arrest I would continue to appeal to anyone with any information to contact us.

.

“I would particularly like to hear from anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious at the address over the last week or so.”

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting log 0674 of April 8th or independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
