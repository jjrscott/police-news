DETECTIVES are appealing for information after two men were stabbed in Skelmersdale.

The incident happened at about 10.45pm yesterday (Wednesday, October 10th) at the junction of Birch Green Road and Ferndale.

Unknown offenders approached the two victims, local men aged 27 and 17, and assaulted them. The older victim suffered a punctured lung and the teenager suffered a leg injury. Neither injury is life threatening.

The offenders were a group of five – three men and two women.

Police believe the motive for the attacks was robbery and an investigation is underway.

Officers are keen to trace any witnesses, in particular the driver of a white van which pulled out of Ferndale at around the time of the incident.

Detective Inspector Ian Moore, of South Police, said: “We are treating this extremely seriously and I would appeal for anyone with information which could assist to get in touch.”

Anyone with information should call police on 101 quoting log number 1597 of October 10th or independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
