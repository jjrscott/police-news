Friday, April 2, 2021

We are appealing for information after a man died in a collision in Lytham.

Police were called at about 9pm yesterday (Thursday, April 1st) to a report of a collision between a pedestrian and a Ford Mondeo on Ballam Road in the town.

The pedestrian, a local man in his 50s, suffered serious injuries and was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

His next of kin have been identified and spoken to.

The road was closed for six hours for collision investigation to take place.

Sgt Martin Wilcock, of Tac Ops, said: “This collision has very sadly resulted in a man losing his life and my thoughts are with his family and friends at this time. I would appeal to anyone who witnessed the collision itself or the victim in the moments before the collision to get in touch. I would especially like to hear from anyone who may have CCTV or dashcam footage.”

We are also appealing for information about some vehicle debris from a red coloured Peugeot which was found at the scene. Based on CCTV enquiries it is not believed to have been involved in the collision but officers are keen to identify it’s origin and reason for being at scene.

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting log 1612 of April 1st.
