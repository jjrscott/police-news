We are appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Colne yesterday.

We were called at 08:45 hours on Tuesday (23 July) to reports a woman had her handbag stolen as she was walking along Keighley Road close to the junction with Clarence Street.

The 46 year old victim was approached from behind and had her handbag pulled from her shoulder. The man then pushed her to the ground and ran off down Clarence Street.

The man is described as Asian, well built, in his 40s, wearing a white t-shirt and jogging bottoms.

#### DC James Jankovski of Burnley Police, said: “Luckily the woman wasn’t hurt during this incident but it has understandably left her shaken up. We’d ask that anyone who saw anything suspicious gets in touch. This is a busy road and we think there will have been a large number of people travelling along this road on their daily commute.”

A 42 year old man and 33 year old man, both from Nelson were arrested on suspicion of robbery. They have both been released under investigation pending further enquires.

Anyone with information should call 101 quoting log number 329 of 23rd July.
