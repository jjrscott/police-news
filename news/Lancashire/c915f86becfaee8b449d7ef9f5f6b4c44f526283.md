We are appealing for witnesses after a collision.

Police were called following the collision on Preston New Road at the junction with Beardwood in Blackburn which happened at shortly before 8pm yesterday (Tuesday, May 28th)

Three vehicles were involved: a Vauxhall Vivaro, a Seat Ibiza and a Lexus RX400.

The Vivaro was travelling along Preston New Road towards Blackburn and the Seat Ibiza was travelling in the opposite direction and was about to turn right onto Beardwood when it altered direction and the vehicles collided. The Vivaro then collided with the Lexus.

Three people were injured. A 20-year old man from Blackburn, a passenger in the Seat, suffered pelvic and head injuries and the driver and passenger in the Lexus, both 48-year old women from Blackburn suffered minor injuries.

The road was closed for four-and-a-half hours for accident investigation.

Sgt Lee Harris, of Lancashire Constabulary’s Tac Ops, said: “This was a significant collision and I would appeal for any witnesses who have not already spoken to the police or anyone who may have dash-cam footage which could assist to get in touch.”

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting log number 1395 of May 28th.
