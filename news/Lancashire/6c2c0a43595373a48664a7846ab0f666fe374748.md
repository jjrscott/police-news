Have you seen Robert Holding, 34, from Bamber Bridge?

We want to speak to him in connection with a burglary, cruelty to animals and breach of a restraining order.

Robert is white, 6ft tall, proportionate build with cropped blond hair.

He may be in the Leyland area.

> PC Lloyd Willcox, of Lancashire Police’s South Division, said: “We are keen to trace Robert Holding and urge anyone who has seen him, or knows where he is to please get in touch.”

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting SA1809076
