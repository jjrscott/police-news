We are appealing for information following a collision in Rossendale which left a pedestrian with serious injuries.

The collision occurred at around 12.45pm on Saturday (March 27th) on a public car park on Newchurch Road, Rawtenstall, when a Renault Traffic van collided with a man aged in his 90s.

The man was taken to hospital with injuries which were initially believed to be life-threatening. He is now thought to have a broken hip and remains in hospital undergoing treatment.

We are now appealing for information and would ask anybody who witnessed the collision and has not yet been spoken to by police to get in touch with us.

#### Sgt Andrew Hemingway, of the Lancashire Police TacOps team, said: “This was a nasty collision which has left an elderly man seriously injured. We are working hard to establish exactly what occurred and are asking anybody who saw it, and has not yet spoken to police, to get in touch.

#### “There are a number of people we believe may have seen it happen, but who left the scene before officers could get their details. If this was you, please contact us straight away.”

Anybody with information is asked to call us on 101, quoting 639 of March 27th.
