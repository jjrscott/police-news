AN interpreter has been jailed for providing a false document to a court during a trial.

Kim Tran was acting as an interpreter for one of the defendants in a large scale conspiracy to produce cannabis trial last year.

As part of her work Tran, of Imperial Way Blackley, handed in a birth certificate which appeared to show the defendant, Thanh Nguyen, was 15. However, following enquiries the document was proved to be a forgery and Tran was charged with Conspiracy to Pervert the Course of Justice.

She had denied the charge but was found guilty following a trial in September.

Tran, 49, appeared at Burnley Crown Court on Wednesday (November 6th) and was jailed for 12 months.

Thanh Nguyen, 19, of Webster Avenue, Bootle; Jack Nguyen, 31, NFA and Hoai Nguyen, 20, also of Webster Avenue, Bootle were jailed for between seven and eight months for their part in the conspiracy. They had all pleaded guilty.

The cannabis gang were jailed in December 2018 for a total of 35 years following a trial.
