Saturday, November 16, 2019

Police are investigating after a man was assaulted in Bamber Bridge.

We were called shortly before 1:30pm today (16 November) to reports a man had been approached by a number of males and attacked with a weapon on Cottage Lane.

The man suffered lacerations to his arm, back and his head. He has been taken to Royal Preston Hospital for treatment. His injuries are not believed to be life threatening.

Our enquiries are ongoing but we are treating this as an isolated incident and do not believe there is any wider threat to the general public.

We have recovered three vehicles in connection with our investigation.

Nobody has been arrested at this stage.

Anyone with information should call 101 quoting log number 695 of 16 November.

Alternatively independent charity Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.
