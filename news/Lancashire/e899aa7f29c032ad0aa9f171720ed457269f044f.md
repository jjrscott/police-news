Tuesday, January 5, 2021

We are appealing for witnesses following a collision in St Annes which has left a man with serious head injuries.

The incident occurred at around 7.50pm on Sunday (December 3rd) on St David's Road South, when a red Volkswagen Polo collided with a Ford Transit van. The Polo was travelling in the direction of The Crescent and the Transit van was travelling in the opposite direction.

Two other parked vehicles were also damaged during the collision.

The driver of the Polo - a man aged in his 30s - suffered a serious head injury and remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition.

We are now asking anybody who witnessed the collision, and has not yet been spoken to by police, to get in touch with us.

#### Sgt Marc Glass, of the Lancashire Police TacOps Team, said: "A man is in hospital with serious injuries following a collision and we are working hard to establish exactly what occurred. If you saw the collision, or saw the vehicles involved in the moments before it happened, please get in touch with us straight away."

Anyone with information should call 101, quoting log 1117 of January 3rd.
