A MAN has been charged following a street disturbance in Morecambe in which four men received stab wounds.

Florentin Damian, 32, of Queen Street, Morecambe, is accused of violent disorder and possession of an offensive weapon. They are due to appear before magistrates in Preston tomorrow (Saturday, February 1st)

We were called at around 3:20am today (Thursday 30 January) to reports of the incident on Queen Street.

We attended and found four men in the street with stab wounds.

Three of the men remain hospital with serious injuries.

Two of the men being treated at hospital have also been arrested on suspicion of wounding and violent disorder. They are aged 32 and 21.

Another man, aged 33, has now been arrested on suspicion of wounding and violent disorder. They are in custody.

We are appealing for information and are particularly keen to trace anybody with CCTV or dash cam footage.

We earlier referred to an altercation at Pop World we believed had taken place before the events in Queen Street. Following enquiries we are happy that no altercation took place.

If you can help please ring 101 quoting log number 111 of 30 January. Alternatively you can speak to independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
