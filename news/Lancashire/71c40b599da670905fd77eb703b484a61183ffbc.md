Do you recognise this man?

We’d like to speak to him following a robbery at McColls in Leyland Road, Penwortham.

At 9.10pm on Thursday May 24th a man entered the shop and asked for a bottle of vodka, a packet of cigarettes and a lighter.

He tried to pay using a chip and pin card but when the card was declined there was a tousle with the shop assistant and he snatched the bag away.

The shop assistant pressed the panic button to lock the man inside the shop but the man smashed the wooden door and made off on a pedal cycle towards Lower Penwortham.

> PC Fabian Spence, of Lancashire Police’s South Division, said: “This was a frightening incident for the shop assistant.

> “While the offender only stole a bottle of vodka and a packet of cigarettes, there was significant damage to the door leaving the shop assistant feeling shaken and understandably vulnerable.”

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting log ref 1682 of May 24th.
