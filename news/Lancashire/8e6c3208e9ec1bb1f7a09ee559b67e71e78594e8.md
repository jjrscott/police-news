WE are growing increasingly concerned for a missing Heysham man.

Geoffrey Burns

He is described as white, six ft 8ins tall and walks with a silver walking stick. He has a tribal tattoo on his left arm.

He was last seen wearing a ‘No Fear’ hooded top with green on the front, blue denim jeans and black trainers.

PC Jon Longhorn, of West Police, said: “We are growing increasingly worried about Geoffrey and I would appeal to anyone who sees him or knows where he might be to get in touch. I would also urge Geoffrey himself to contact us if he sees this appeal.”
