Do you recognise this man?

We want to speak to him after a man was assaulted inside a Blackpool nightclub.

It happened at around 03:22 hours on 25 August inside Home and HQ nightclub on Talbot Road.

A man in his 30s was approached from behind and hit to the face with a bottle. He suffered a fractured jaw which required surgery and ongoing treatment.

The offender is described as wearing a hooded top with the drawstrings pulled covering his face.

We have been making extensive enquiries and now want to speak to the man in the pictures as part of our investigation.

#### DC Jennie Speight of Blackpool CID, said: “This was a very serious assault and the victim is still recovering from his injuries. We are committed to finding whoever is responsible.

#### “We know the nightclub was busy on this particular night for the ‘Sanctuary’ event. Were you out? If you saw anything suspicious or recognise the man in the photograph please get in touch as soon as possible.”

If you have any information that could help please call us on 101 or email [email protected] quoting log number 476 of 25 August.

Alternatively independent charity Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111 or online at crimestoppers-uk.org.
