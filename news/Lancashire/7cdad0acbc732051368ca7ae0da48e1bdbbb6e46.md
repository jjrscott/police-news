Thursday, June 25, 2020

Yesterday evening police received a number of reports of large gatherings and anti-social behaviour on The Green at Lytham.

Following these incidents we have a dedicated policing operation in place, which will see an increased police presence in the area and our intention is that there will be no repeat of last night’s events.

We understand that it has been a difficult time for everyone recently, particularly young people who won’t have been able to socialise with their friends in the environments they are used to, but the coronavirus regulations are still in place and they are there to protect people and save lives. The virus definitely hasn’t gone away and many areas of the North West continue to see high infection rates.

We will continue to engage with people and will take a proportionate policing approach – but we will not hesitate to use powers available to us if we need to.

If you are a parent or guardian, please pass on the message that these events can be harmful to your children’s health and they could end up getting themselves into trouble. Recent events in the region, which have been unregulated and unsafe, have seen serious issues reported and the safety of people at them simply can’t be guaranteed.

Please call us on 101 if you see anything you are concerned about, including any suspicious behaviour, anti-social behaviour or significant gatherings.
