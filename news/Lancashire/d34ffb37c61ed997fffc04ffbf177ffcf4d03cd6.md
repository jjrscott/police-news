Police are appealing for witnesses after an HGV drove the wrong way down the M65 and collided with the central reservation.

The incident happened on Saturday, December 22nd and caused the closure of part of the motorway, between Junctions 5 and 6, for most of the day.

The driver of the red Scania truck, a 20 year old man, was treated for minor injuries and has been reported for summons for an offence under Section 5a of the Road Traffic Act 1988.

PC Simon Grounds, of Tac Ops, said: “I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who saw the HGV driving against the traffic and any dashcam footage they may have.”

Anyone with information should contact PC Grounds on email at [email protected]
