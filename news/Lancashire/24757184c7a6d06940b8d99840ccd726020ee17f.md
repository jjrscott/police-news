Wednesday, December 19, 2018

We are aware of a video widely circulating on social media which shows a man making a number of offensive comments.

As soon as this video came to our attention we launched an investigation and we have today arrested a 41-year-old man from Preston on suspicion of religiously aggravated harassment.

He remains in custody and our investigation is on-going.

We recognise the distress the comments have caused to a number of people and we hope they are reassured by the action we have taken.

We are committed to tackling all crime motivated by hate and prejudice and we would urge anyone who has been a victim of a hate crime to have the confidence to come forward and report it to police. Victims will always be dealt with professionally and sympathetically.

Hate crimes can be reported to police on the non-emergency number 101 and through the Constabulary website www.lancashire.police.uk

Hate crimes can also be reported through True Vision, a national online reporting facility at www.report-it.org.uk
