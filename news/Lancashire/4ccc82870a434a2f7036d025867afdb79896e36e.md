Do you recognise the men in this footage (below)? We want to speak to them after a man was stabbed in Preston.

It happened on Wednesday, September 9th at just after 4pm when the victim, 23, was approached by a man who had been travelling on a motorcycle with a second man, outside the Co-op shop on Plungington Road.

The offender, who was wearing a helmet, stabbed the victim in the hand with a knife and got back on the motorbike as a passenger, making off from the area. The victim ran inside the store.

#### PC James Riley from Preston Police said: “This happened on a busy road in broad daylight and must have been terrifying for the victim, especially when he saw the offender get off the motorbike, coming towards him wielding a knife.

“If you recognise the offenders in the footage or you know anything about this incident, please come forward and speak to us.”

You can call 101 quoting incident reference 1039 of September 9th. You can also email [email protected]uk.
