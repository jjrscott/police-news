Section 60 powers are currently in place after a teenager suffered stab wounds in Skelmersdale this afternoon (Monday 29th July).

We were called at 17:20 hours to reports a 17 year old boy had suffered wounds to his arm and legs. It is believed he had been chased from Bearncroft by a group of teenagers before he was attacked.

The boy has been taken to hospital for treatment.

The Section 60 covers the areas of Digmoor, Tanhouse and Birch Green (pictured in the map below) and is in place from 7pm today until 3am tomorrow (30th July).

This gives us the power to search people or vehicles without suspicion in an area where we believe violence could take place. We hope that this does not overly concern you - itâ€™s not about targeting people, it is about making sure we do all we can to keep you and where you live safe, whilst offering you reassurance and maintaining a presence in the area.

We have a team of officers working on finding who was responsible. We do not believe there is any wider threat to the public.

If you know or saw anything that you think may help our investigation, it is important that you please call us on 101 quoting incident reference 1023 of 29th July.

Thank you for your on-going support and co-operation. If you have any concerns, please feel to approach an officer out and about in the area.
