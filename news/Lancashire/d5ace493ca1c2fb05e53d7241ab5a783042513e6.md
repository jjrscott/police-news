Two people have been arrested after a robbery in Blackburn.

Police were called at 11.15am today (Wednesday, May 29th) to a report that two men had gone into ZY Grocers, Infirmary Street.

The shop assistant was threatened with what appears to be a handgun before the offenders fled empty handed. No-one was hurt

A 17-year old youth and a 47-year old man were arrested on suspicion of robbery a short time later and are currently in custody.

Detectives are investigating.

#### Detective Inspector Rach Higson, of Blackburn CID, said: “This must have been a terrifying experience for the shop assistant and it is fortunate that no-one was injured. I would appeal for anyone with information which could assist to contact us.”

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting log number 0449 of May 29th or independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
