A man who suffered serious injuries in a shop in Earby has died.

Police were called at about 10am on Tuesday, June 4th to SB Fruits on Water Street after the 67-year old victim was found unconscious inside the shop.

The victim, who can now be named as Harry Morris, suffered some serious unexplained injuries and was taken by ambulance to the Royal Blackburn Hospital. He sadly died there on Friday

A post mortem examination will take place in due course to try to establish the cause of death.

Hayley Fullalove, 49, of Victoria Road, Earby had earlier been charged with Section 18 assault, robbery and unauthorised taking of a motor vehicle. She appeared at Blackburn Magistrates’ Court on Thursday (6 June) morning and has been remanded.

Our thoughts are with Mr Morris’ family at this sad time.
