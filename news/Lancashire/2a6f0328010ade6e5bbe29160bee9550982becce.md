We are appealing for information after a robbery at a Post Office.

Police were called at around 5.30pm yesterday (Friday, May 10th) to a report that a man had gone into the post office on Abbey Street in Accrington and sprayed a number of people with an unknown substance.

He demanded staff open the safe before making off with a quantity of cash.

The offender fled the scene on a pushbike.

Three members of staff and one member of the public were injured.

Police, fire and ambulance attended the scene and the injured parties were treated. Fortunately they were not seriously hurt.

A 33 year old local man was later arrested on suspicion of robbery. He remains in custody.

If you have any information about this incident, please call us on 101 quoting incident reference 1057 of May 10th

Alternatively call independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
