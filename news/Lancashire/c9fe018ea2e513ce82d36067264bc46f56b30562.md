A MAN has been charged after two attempted robberies in Ormskirk.

Detectives launched an investigation after the two attempted post office robberies yesterday (Friday, July 18th).

The first happened between 3pm and 3:30pm when a man entered County Road post office and made a demand for money brandishing a firearm. He left the scene having failed to steal anything.

At around 4.10pm a man entered Square Lane post office, made a further demand for money and brandished a firearm. Again nothing was stolen.

Following enquiries Adam Jones, 20, of the Ormskirk area has been charged with two counts of attempted robbery and possession of an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence. He is due to appear before Preston Magistratesâ€™ Court on Monday (July 22nd)
