We are appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Lancaster which left a man seriously injured.

It happened at around 5am on Saturday 21 September as the victim, in his 20s, was cycling along the cycle path on Torrisholme, close to Carlisle Bridge.

He was approached by two men, who threw him from his bike and kicked and punched him while he was on the ground.

He suffered a fractured cheekbone and fractured ribs.

The two men stole his money and tobacco and walked away in the direction of the Scale Hall Farm estate.

The offenders are described as wearing hooded clothing.

#### DC Ian Wright of Lancaster Police, said: “This was a violent attack which has left a man with some serious injuries. We need to find the people responsible and ask that anyone who may have seen this or anything suspicious in the area, gets in touch as soon as possible.”

If you have any information you can call 101 quoting log number 282 of 21st September.
