Do you know this man? We wish to speak to him in relation to an armed robbery at a post office in Ashton-on-Ribble.

At around 5.20pm on December 2, 2020, two men wearing balaclavas entered the Larches Post Office in Elswick Road with a suspected firearm and made demands for cash. It is believed that two to three males were waiting outside during the incident with a grey Audi A3 car.

The men left the post office empty-handed, getting into the Audi and leaving the scene together. The Audi was later found abandoned in Brook Place, Preston.

Detectives are appealing to anyone with information regarding the male pictured to come forward.

#### Det Con Rachel Scott, of Preston CID, said: “Do you recognise this man? We wish to speak to him in relation to an armed robbery at a post office in Ashton-on-Ribble.

#### “We would urge anyone with information to come forward immediately.

#### “No arrests have been made at this stage and officers are keen to stress that it is being treated as an isolated incident.

#### “Any information provided to police about the male pictured will be treated in the strictest confidence.”

If you know this male, or can help with our enquiries, please call 101 or email [email protected] quoting log 1025 of December 2.
