We are appealing for witnesses following a serious assault in Blackpool.

We were called at 15:15hours on Wednesday (29 May) to reports of an altercation outside the Clifton Christian Centre on Langdale Road.

Emergency services attended and found a 22 year old man lying on the ground with a head injury.

He was taken to Royal Preston Hospital where he remains in a critical condition.

A 36 year old man from Blackpool was arrested on suspicion of section 18 assault and later released under investigation pending further enquiries.

#### DC Joe Isaacs of Blackpool Police, said: “A man is in a critical condition and our thoughts are with him at this time.

#### “We have been making a number of enquiries and know that the area was busy at the time of the incident with pedestrians and cyclists nearby.

#### “We need to hear from anyone who witnessed the altercation or saw or heard anything that might be relevant to our investigation.”

If you can help please email [email protected], call 01253 604141 or 101 as soon as possible quoting log number 846 of 29 May
