***UPDATE: A 14-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy from Preston has been arrested on suspicion of affray. Enquiries are on-going.***

Officers are investigating a video which is currently circulating on social media which appears to show a homeless man being threatened in Preston.

The video shows a group of youths taunting the man with a knife, before his sleeping bag is set on fire.

We are now trying to locate the man, who was sleeping in the Market Car Park when he was approached by the youths on Saturday September 8.

> Inspector Helen Dixon, of Lancashire Constabulary’s South Division, said: “This is an extremely unpleasant incident and we are working with outreach services in the city to find this man and address any safeguarding concerns.

> “We are also trying to identify the young people in the video so we can take appropriate action.”

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting log 751 of September 26.

Advice on support services available to homeless people in Preston is available at https://www.preston.gov.uk/yourservices/housing/homeless-help/help-the-homeless/.
