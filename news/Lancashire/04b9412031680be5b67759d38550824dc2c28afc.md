Friday, October 19, 2018

We were called around 6.25pm yesterday (Thursday, October 18) following reports of a garage fire in Division Lane Blackpool.

Emergency services attended and remain at the scene today (Friday, October 19th) to try and make the area safe.

A 42-year-old man was injured in the incident and taken to Blackpool Victoria Hospital for treatment.

A quantity of chemicals was found within the garage and an investigation is underway.

The man, and a 28-year-old woman, who are both from Blackpool, have been arrested on suspicion of producing a controlled drug and are currently in custody.
