Thursday, December 6, 2018

We are appealing for witnesses following a serious collision on the A56 at Accrington yesterday (Wednesday 5 December).

We were called at around 4pm to the report that a white BMW 335 saloon had collided with a barrier on the road before overturning. The driver, a 37 year-old man from Accrington, was trapped in the vehicle. He suffered serious head injuries and was taken to the Royal Preston Hospital where he remains in a critical condition. His family have been notified.

The passenger, a 25 year-old local woman, suffered minor injuries. She was taken to the Royal Blackburn Hospital for treatment.

The road was closed for five hours for collision investigation work.

#### Sergeant Andy Ainsworth said: "A man has suffered serious injuries and my thoughts are with him and his family at this difficult time.

"My team are working to establish exactly what happened and I urge anybody who saw the collision and has not already spoken to us to make contact."

You can call 101 and quote log reference 0955 of December 5th.
