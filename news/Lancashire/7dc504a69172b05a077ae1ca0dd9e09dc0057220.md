Monday, September 9, 2019

We are appealing for information following a serious collision on the M55 in the early hours of yesterday morning.

We were called at 03:35 hours on Sunday 8th September to reports a Vauxhall Mokka had collided with the central reservation, before colliding with a tree between junctions 1 and 3.

The driver and sole occupant of the car - a 26 year old man – suffered a number of serious injuries.

He was taken to Royal Preston Hospital where he is receiving treatment.

#### Sergeant Dave Hurst of Lancashire Police’s Tac Ops Division, said: “We are looking into the circumstances surrounding the collision and would ask that anyone who witnessed it and is yet to contact us, does so as soon as possible.

#### “Likewise, if you have any dash cam footage which may be helpful to the investigation, we would like to hear from you.

#### “Our thoughts remain with the injured man at this time.”

If you have any information that could help, please call us on 101 quoting log number 210 of today (8 September).
