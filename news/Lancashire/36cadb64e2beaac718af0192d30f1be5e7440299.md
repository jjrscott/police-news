A MAN has been arrested on suspicion of robbery in Blackpool.

Police issued an appeal to trace 26-year-old Jack Slaven and he was traced to an address in Blackpool this morning (Sunday, May 12th)

He is currently in custody.

Officers wanted to speak to Jack following the robbery on Talbot Road on Thursday (May 9th) where a 77-year old woman had her handbag snatched and was pushed to the floor.

We would like to thank everyone who shared our appeal and to all those in the local community for their support.
