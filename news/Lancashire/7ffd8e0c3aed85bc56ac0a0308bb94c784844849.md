We are appealing for information after a collision left a woman with serious injuries.

Police were called at shortly before 9am today (Tuesday, September 1st) to reports that a Kia Picanto had left the road, crashed through a hedgerow and come to rest in a field.

The incident happened on Garstang Road near Little Eccleston.

The driver and sole occupant of the Kia, a 51-year-old woman from Blackpool, suffered serious injuries and was taken by ambulance to the Royal Preston Hospital where she remains.

The road was closed for around four hours while the incident was dealt with.

Sgt Martin Wilcock, of Tac Ops, said: “This collision has left a woman with some very serious injuries and I would appeal to anyone who witnessed the collision, or the car in the moments before the collision, or who has any information, to come forward and contact us.”

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting log number 0329 of September 1st.
