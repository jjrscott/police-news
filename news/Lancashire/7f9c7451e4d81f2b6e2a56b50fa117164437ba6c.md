Thank you to everyone who shared our CCTV appeal for information in relation to an assault on Queen Victoria Street in Blackburn in October.

A man suffered a broken jaw after being assaulted at some time between 16:30 hours and 18:00 hours on Sunday 14th October.

Last week we released an image of a man we wanted to speak to in connection with our investigation.

We have now received information as to the identity of the man and will be speaking to him in due course.
