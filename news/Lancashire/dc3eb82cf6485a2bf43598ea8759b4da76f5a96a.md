You may remember we appealed for information about a man we wanted to speak to in relation to an allegation of racial abuse following the Burnley vs. Olympiacos fixture at Turf Moor on 30 August.

We have now been contacted by someone who believes he is the man in the images and we will be speaking to him in due course.

Thanks to everyone who shared our appeal.
