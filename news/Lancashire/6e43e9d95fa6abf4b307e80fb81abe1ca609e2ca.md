Following consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service two men have this evening (Wednesday, June 12th) been charged with the murder of Steven Thurston in Blackburn.

George Preshur, 30, of Keele Walk, Blackburn and Andrew Tate, 22, of Brownbirks Road, Huncoat are due to appear before Blackburn Magistrates’ Court tomorrow morning (Thursday, June 13th)

Police launched a murder enquiry after the body of Steven Thurston, 50, was found inside his home address on Sussex Drive, Blackburn at about 12.50am on Monday (June 10th)

A Home Office post mortem examination showed he died from significant head injuries.

In a tribute Steven’s family said: “Steven was the kindest, caring, loving father, son and brother whose door was always open to help others.”

A 52-year-old woman from Blackburn arrested in connection with the investigation has been released under investigation.
