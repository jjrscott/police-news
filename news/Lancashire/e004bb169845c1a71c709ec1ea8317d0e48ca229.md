**DETECTIVES investigating the murders of a mother and daughter at their home in Reedley have today charged a woman.**

****

**Rabia Shahbaz, 44, of Ribble Avenue, Burnley, was originally arrested in October last year and following consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service has now been charged with Committing an act/series of acts with Intent to Pervert the Course of Justice.**

****

**She is due to appear before Blackburn Magistratesâ€™ Court on Thursday 4 th March 2021**

**Last October Shahbaz Khan, 51, of Ribble Avenue, Burnley, was charged with two offences of murder and a further offence of arson being reckless as to whether life is endangered.**

****

**The bodies of Dr Saman Mir Sacharvi, 49, and her 14-year-old daughter, Vian Mangrio, were sadly found at an address on Colne Road, Reedley, on October 1 after officers were called at around 8.45am to a report of concern for safety. There was also evidence of smoke and fire damage inside the address.**

**A Home Office post-mortem investigation has since revealed Dr Sacharvi died as a result of pressure to the neck and that she had also suffered an assault.**
