Friday, July 5, 2019

We are enforcing a dispersal order in the New Hall Lane area of Preston today (Friday, July 5) following recent anti-social behaviour.

From 6pm a Section 34 order (Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014) will give us the power to ask people to leave certain areas (see map). The order, which continues until 6pm on Sunday (July 7), has been put in place following the poor behaviour of youths in recent days.

The order will be reviewed during the weekend and further dispersal orders if necessary will be implemented beyond Sunday 7th July.

#### Insp Patrick Worden, of Preston Police, said: “Anti-social behaviour covers a range of offences and can involve harm to an individual, to the wider community or to the environment, leaving victims feeling harassed, alarmed or distressed.

#### “We understand that this can have a profound impact on victims and how safe they feel in their neighbourhood. We are committed to tackling this type of crime.

#### “Following recent anti-social behaviour in the New Hall Lane area we have decided to enforce a further two-day dispersal order. If necessary, further dispersal orders will be authorised in the area.”
