Sunday, July 21, 2019

We are appealing for information after a man was assaulted in Blackpool.

Police were contacted by the ambulance service at shortly after 2am today (Sunday, July 21st) to a report that a 31-year-old man had been assaulted outside Razor’s barber shop on Lytham Road in the town.

The victim was taken by ambulance to the Royal Preston Hospital where he remains in a critical condition.

Following a number of enquiries police arrested a 47-year-old from Blackpool on suspicion of Section 18 wounding. He remains in custody.

Police believe that the victim had earlier been drinking in Ma Kelly’s on Lytham Road nearby and may have been involved in an altercation with another man at around midnight.

We are keen to speak to people who were in the bar.

Detective Chief Inspector Mike Gladwin said: “This assault has left a man with some very serious injuries and I would appeal for anyone who witnessed the incident itself or the events earlier in the evening to get in touch.”

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting log number 0166 of July 21st or independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
