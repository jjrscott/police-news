Thank you to everyone who shared our appeal for the 17 year old girl missing from home in Blackpool.

We now believe she is in the Merseyside area and our colleagues at Merseyside Police are leading the enquiries to find her.

The 17 month old baby also reported as missing has been found safe and well.
