DETECTIVES are appealing for information after an aggravated burglary in Burnley.

The incident happened at about 5pm yesterday (Thursday, November 7th) when a masked man went into the home of an 81-year-old woman and demanded money. He was armed with a hammer.

The intruder ran from the address on Accrington Road when the victim said she didn’t have any cash.

She was left extremely frightened and upset, although thankfully not physically hurt.

Enquiries are now on-going to identify the offender who is described as five ft nine ins tall and slim build. He spoke with a foreign accent and was wearing a black jacket with a high visibility vest over the top.

Detective Constable Sarah Whittaker, of Burnley CID, said: “This must have been an absolutely terrifying experience for this elderly lady. It is fortunate that she was not physically hurt during this unnerving ordeal. We have a number of enquiries ongoing and I would appeal for the public’s help so we can identify this offender.”

Anyone with information should call police on 101 quoting log 1273 of November 7th or independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
