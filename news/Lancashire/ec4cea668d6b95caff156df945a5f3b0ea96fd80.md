We are appealing for information after a man suffered serious injuries in a raid at his home in Nelson.

At 11.55pm on Friday August 17th, two men dressed in dark clothing and balaclavas, went into the house in Napier Street armed with a large, curved machete.

The occupant, a Lithuanian man in his 50s, suffered defensive wounds to his arms and a cut to the back of his head.

He was taken to Royal Preston Hospital where he is undergoing treatment for his injuries.

> Det Sgt Mark Holland, of Lancashire Constabulary’s East Division CID, said: “This was a very violent, aggravated burglary.

> “Fortunately a member of the public heard a commotion and raised the alarm.

> “We are now asking anyone who was in the area and saw or heard anything, or who may have CCTV or dash-cam footage, to get in touch, as we try and establish the circumstances surrounding this incident.”

Anyone with information is asked to contact [email protected] or call 101 quoting log 1776 of August 17th.

Alternatively you can call the independent charity CrimeStoppers on 0800 555 111
