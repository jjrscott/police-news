A man has been charged in connection with the murder of Alison McBlaine in Blackburn.

Joshua Titterington, 26, of Scotland Bank Terrace, Blackburn has been charged with the murder of Alison McBlaine and attempted murder of another man. Titterington was initially arrested in connection with the investigation and bailed pending further enquiries. He was re-arrested yesterday (13 February) and later charged.

He is due to appear before Blackburn Magistratesâ€™ Court this morning (14 February).

Ms McBlaine, 36, sadly passed away on November 21st in hospital following a serious collision around 7:45pm on November 19th on King Street/Whalley Banks at the junction with Pearson Street.

Detectives believe a car, a Fiat Grande Punto, mounted the pavement before colliding with Ms McBlaine and a 26 year old man who sustained serious injuries.

Five people have already been charged in connection with the investigation.

We would appeal for anyone with information to come forward and speak to police.
