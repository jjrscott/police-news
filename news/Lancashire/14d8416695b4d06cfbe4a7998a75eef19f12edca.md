Last week we issued a CCTV still of an individual detectives wanted to speak to after a man was robbed at knifepoint in Burnley and a second male was subjected to threats.

We can now confirm a 30-year-old man from Burnley has been arrested on suspicion of robbery and is now in custody.

Thank you to everybody who shared and supported our appeal.
