POLICE are appealing for help to trace the family of a homeless man who died in Blackburn.

Andrew Davie was found collapsed outside Boots on the Townsmoor Retail Park just before 7am on Saturday (November 24th). Police and paramedics attended but he was sadly pronounced dead.

The death is not being treated as suspicious and a file will be prepared for HM Coroner. As part of those enquiries police are asking for help to try to find Mr Davie’s next of kin.

On the Wednesday before he died, Andrew had attended the Salvation Army hostel, Heaton Street and collapsed outside. Staff rushed to his aid providing medical attention and contacting an ambulance. They remained with him comforting and consoling him until paramedics arrived and took him to hospital where he was admitted overnight.

Inspector Rachel Higson, of East CID, said: “This is a really sad situation and I would appeal to anyone who may be able to help us find Andrew’s next of kin to get in touch with us.”

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting log number 318 of November 24th.
