Can you help us identify this man?

We’d like to speak to him after a racist incident close to the Metropole Hotel in Blackpool on Friday July 8th.

At 7.15pm a woman was out with family and friends when a man shouted racist abuse at her.

He then tried to punch her and pushed another woman she was with.

> PC Rob Stone, of Blackpool Police, said: “This was an extremely upsetting incident for this woman and the people she was with, who just wanted to enjoy Blackpool with her family and friends.

> “We are now trying to identify the man in the picture so we can speak to him.”

Anyone with information is asked to contact PC Stone on [email protected]police.uk or call 101 quoting log WA1815836.
