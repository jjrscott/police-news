We are appealing for information following a collision in Accrington between a car and a 12-year-old girl.

The incident occurred at around 2.05pm on Saturday (December 19th) on Manchester Road, when the Volkswagen Golf car was travelling in the direction of Rising Bridge.

The 12-year-old girl suffered a collarbone injury and broken leg and was taken to hospital for treatment. The driver of the Golf – a woman aged in her 60s – was uninjured.

We would now like to hear from anybody who witnessed the collision and has not yet been spoken to by police. We would also ask anybody with dashcam footage of the incident to get in touch.

#### Sgt Mick Belfield, of the Lancashire Police TacOps team, said: “This collision has left a 12-year-old girl with broken bones and we are working hard to piece together exactly what led to it.

#### “We are now asking anybody with information about it to get in touch. Perhaps you were in the area and saw the Golf or the girl in the moments before the collision or maybe you saw the collision itself or have dashcam of it. If you have any information at all, please get in touch with us straight away.”

Anybody with information is asked to contact us on 101, quoting log number 891 of December 19th.
