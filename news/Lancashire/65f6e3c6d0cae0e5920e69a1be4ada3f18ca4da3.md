We are appealing for witnesses after a serious collision in Preston.

Police were called at 20:36 hours on Sunday (10th February) to reports of a collision involving a DNA off road motorcycle and a Mercedes Sprinter.

It happened on Roebuck Street at the junction with Stocks Road.

The rider of the bike – a 32 year old man from Preston – received head and abdominal injuries. He was taken to Royal Preston Hospital where he remains in a serious condition.

#### Sergeant Steve Hardman of Lancashire’s Road Policing Unit said: “We’re working to establish the circumstances surrounding the collision and ask that anyone with information, CCTV or dash cam footage gets in touch.”

Anyone with information should email [email protected] or call 101 quoting log number 1367 of 10th February.
