Officers investigating a moorland fire near Darwen Tower have arrested three teenagers and interviewed a fourth boy in connection with the incident.

A joint investigation was launched between Lancashire Police and Lancashire Fire and Rescue following the fire which broke out on the moors close to Sunnyhurst Lane around 5pm on April 7th.

The boys, two 13-year-olds and two aged 14 were interviewed yesterday and today, following information received after our appeal. They have now been released under investigation while we carry out further enquiries.

Thank you to everyone who shared our initial appeal!

We would continue to ask anyone with information to contact 101 or email [email protected] quoting log number 1139 of April 7th.
