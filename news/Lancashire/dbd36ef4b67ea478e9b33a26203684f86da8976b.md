Enquiries are ongoing following the death of a baby in Blackpool.

We were called around 8am yesterday (Friday, February 8th) to reports a 13-month old baby had been found unresponsive at an address in Marton Drive, Blackpool.

Emergency services attended but the baby, a girl, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

A post mortem examination has been carried out but the cause of death remains unexplained at this stage.

Two people, a man aged 21 and a woman aged 24, who were arrested on suspicion of murder, have been released under investigation.

#### DCI Lee Wilson of Blackpool Police, said: “Our thoughts are with the child’s family at this incredibly sad and difficult time. This is not being treated as a murder investigation, however enquiries are ongoing into the circumstances surrounding the girl’s death.”
