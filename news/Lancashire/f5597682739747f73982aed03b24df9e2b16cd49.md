We are appealing for information following a report of indecent exposure in Blackpool.

It is reported to have happened at around 16:40 on Wednesday (29 October). A woman was walking her dog in Stanley Park when she saw a man exposing himself.

It happened in the nature area, with the nearest road being East Park Drive.

On seeing the man, the woman moved out of the way, but he then moved in her direction before walking off inland to the centre of the park.

The man is described as being white, in his late 20s, approximately 5ft 7in tall of medium build. He had a scarf over his face, was wearing a khaki green coat and jeans.

#### PC Adam Jackson of Blackpool Police, said: “Incidents of this nature understandably cause a lot of concern. I would like to reassure you that we are taking this very seriously and are making a number of enquiries to find the man involved.

#### “If you were in the park at around the time of the incident and remember seeing a man matching this description, or if you have any information at all, please get in touch.”

Anyone with information should call 101 quoting log number 993 of 29th October.
