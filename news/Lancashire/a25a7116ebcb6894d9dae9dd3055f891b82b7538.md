We are appealing for witnesses after a motorcyclist was seriously injured in a collision yesterday.

We were called at 12:15 hours on Thursday (21 February) to reports of the two vehicle collision on Newton Drive at the junction with Heron Way in Blackpool.

It involved a Toyota Yaris and a Yamaha SR 125.

The rider of the Yamaha, a 63 year old man from Blackpool, suffered significant facial injuries. He was taken to Royal Preston Hospital where he is receiving treatment.

The driver of the Toyota was not injured.

#### Sgt Andy Ainsworth of Lancashire’s Road Policing Unit, said: “Our thoughts are with the injured gentleman at this time. We’re working to establish the circumstances surrounding the collision and would appeal to anyone in the area with information to get in touch.

#### “If you live close by and have CCTV which may have captured the collision, or if you have a dash cam with any relevant footage, we would like to hear from you.

Anyone with information should call 101 or email [email protected] quoting log number 504 of 21 February.
