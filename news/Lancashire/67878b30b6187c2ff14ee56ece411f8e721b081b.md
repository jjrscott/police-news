We were called by Cumbria Police at 5:35 hours today (16 February) after a vehicle failed to stop for their officers. The vehicle later entered the M6 in Lancashire and travelled the wrong way down the northbound carriageway.

Whilst attempting to stop the vehicle, a Lancashire police car has been involved in a minor collision with it close to junction 33.

A police officer suffered minor injuries and was taken to hospital for treatment. He has since been discharged.

Two men have been arrested.

The motorway has since reopened
