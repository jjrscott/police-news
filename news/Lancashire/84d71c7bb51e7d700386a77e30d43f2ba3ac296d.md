We are appealing for witnesses following a collision in Tarleton.

It happened at around 2:30pm on Friday (10 January) on Bank Bridge and involved a Renault Kangoo and a Ford Transit.

The vehicles were travelling in the same direction and carriageway at the time of the collision.

The occupants of the Kangoo – a 64 year old man and 69 year old woman from Southport, suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospital for treatment. The woman remains at Aintree Hospital in a stable condition.

The driver of the Ford Transit – a 41 year old man from Southport - received minor injuries.

#### PC Andrew Hemingway of Lancashire Police’s Tactical Operations Division, said: “Our thoughts are with the injured people at this time.

#### We’re working to establish the circumstances of the collision and would ask anyone who witnessed it, to come forward if they haven’t already spoken to us.”

If you can help, please email [email protected] or call 101 quoting log number 850 of 10th January.
