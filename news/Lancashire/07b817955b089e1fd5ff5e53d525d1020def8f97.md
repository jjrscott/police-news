Police searching for a missing man have sadly found a body.

Jason Goldrick, 50, of Park Road, went missing from Blackpool Victoria Hospital around 11.30pm on November 1.

Following extensive police enquiries a body was recovered from the sea near Roa Island at Barrow on Sunday afternoon.

The body has now been identified as that of Mr Goldrick. His family have been informed and our thoughts are with them at this time.

A Home Office post mortem examination has been carried out this morning and the cause of death given as drowning. There are no suspicious circumstances and a file will now be prepared for HM Coroner.

We would like to thank everyone who assisted during the search for Jason.
