We are appealing for information following a burglary at a Vaping store last month.

We were called at 09:30 hours on Tuesday 1 May to reports of a break-in at E-Liquids on St Mary’s Street in Preston.

It is believed that three offenders gained entry to the shop on the evening of 30th April and made off with the till, a PC tower and a number of electronic cigarette products were taken.

Police have now released CCTV images in an appeal for information.

#### PC Warren Reeve of Preston Police: “We are appealing for the public’s help with our investigation. We have arrested two people in connection with our investigation and they have been released under investigation.

#### “While arrests have been made, our investigation remains ongoing. We are particularly keen to identify the man in the CCTV who we’d like to speak to. I appreciate that the CCTV isn’t that clear, but the man appears to have a distinctive tattoo on his hand which someone may recognise.

#### “I would also urge people to report any suspicious activity regarding the sale of e-cigarette products to police.”

Anyone with information is asked to contact Police on 101, quoting log number 295 of 1st May.
