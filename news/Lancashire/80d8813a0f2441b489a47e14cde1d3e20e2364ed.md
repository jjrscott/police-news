A man has been charged with the rape of an 18-year-old woman in Preston.

Following consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), Amanuel Tsegay, 35, of Lords Avenue, Salford was charged last night (10 October) with rape and sexual assault.

He is due to appear at Preston Magistratesâ€™ Court this morning (Friday, October 11th).

The incident happened in the early hours of Sunday, September 22nd on Lord Street in the city centre.

Another woman came forward reporting being sexually assaulted on the same day on Lancaster Road.

We would like to thank the public for their responses to our previous appeals.
