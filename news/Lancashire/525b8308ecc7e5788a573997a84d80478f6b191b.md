Following our earlier appeal for information about food contamination in a Morecambe supermarket we have arrested two people.

We launched an investigation after two people went into the Sainsbury’s store on Lancaster Road in Morecambe on April 4th before licking their hands and wiping them over meat, fresh produce and fridge handles.

The two men were arrested in Morecambe this afternoon (Wednesday, April 8th) after the release of CCTV images.

Enquiries into the incident continue.

We would like to thank everyone who helped with the appeal – your assistance is greatly appreciated as always.
