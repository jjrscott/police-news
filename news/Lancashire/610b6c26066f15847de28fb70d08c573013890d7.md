A woman arrested on suspicion of murder following the death of a man in St Annes has been released no further action.

Emergency services were called to an address in North Houses Lane at 4.55pm yesterday where a man in his 50s was found to have a number stab wounds.

His death was initially being treated as suspicious as officers worked to establish how he came about his injuries.

Following a post-mortem examination today and further investigation work carried out by detectives, we can now confirm that the man’s death is no longer being treated as suspicious and officers are not looking for anybody else in connection with it.

#### DCI Jane Webb, of the Force Major Investigation Team, said: “I appreciate this incident will have caused the community a great deal of concern and I would like to thank them for their patience as we fully investigated how the man came about his fatal injuries.

#### “The woman arrested yesterday has now been released and will face no further action. I also want to make it clear that we are not looking for anybody else in connection with the man’s tragic death.

#### “My thoughts remain with the deceased males loved ones at this at this incredibly difficult time.”
