A man from Morecambe wanted on suspicion of numerous offences has been arrested and charged by police.

Officers wanted to find Jed Kane, 36, of Mears Beck Close, following an incident on July 15 where an Audi A4 collided with a black Volkswagen Golf close to the junction of Lancaster Road and Whitby Road in Morecambe.

During the same incident the Audi is believed to have mounted the pavement, nearly colliding with two pedestrians.

Following a public appeal for information Kane was arrested in Lancaster yesterday (Wednesday, August 22) and charged with attempted section 18 wounding, dangerous driving, breach of restraining order and two fail to appear warrants.

He has been remanded to appear at Preston Magistrates Court today (Thursday, August 23).
