FOLLOWING enquiries the death of a woman in Preston earlier this year is no longer being treated as unexplained.

Police launched an inquiry after attending an address on Fir Trees Avenue, in the Grange area of the city, at around 11pm on Sunday (February 16) following a report of a concern for welfare.

Sadly the body of a woman was found at the address. She has since been formally identified as a 29-year-old woman from Preston.

A Home Office post-mortem examination has taken place and has now established that the woman died from natural causes. The matter will now be referred to HM Coroner.

Three people arrested on suspicion of murder have been released without charge.

Our thoughts remain with the deceasedâ€™s family and friends.
