Police are appealing for witnesses after a collision on the A49 at Chorley.

The incident happened at about 840pm yesterday (Friday, December 28th) when an Audi RS3 lost control close to the junction with Brookwood Way and collided with a lamppost.

The driver, a 19 year old man from Ilford in Essex, suffered serious but not life threatening injuries. He has been arrested on suspicion of aggravated vehicle taking, dangerous driving, failing to stop and obstructing police.

The road was closed for several hours for accident investigation and recovery of the vehicle, believed to have been stolen from the Blackburn area earlier the same day.

Anyone with information should call police on 101 quoting log number 1349 of December 28th.
