Detectives investigating an indecent exposure offence in Burscough have charged a man.

We were called around 1.35am on Monday (February 22) to reports of a break-in at an address on New Lane where a man entered a property before being disturbed. It was later alleged he had been seen touching himself inappropriately outside the address.

Following enquiries police arrested a man on Tuesday (February 23) in connection with the investigation.

Michael Shaw, 29, of no fixed address, has been charged with two offences of exposure and three offences of knowingly trespassing on premises with intent to commit a relevant sexual offence. He is due to appear at Preston Magistratesâ€™ Court today (Thursday, February 25).
