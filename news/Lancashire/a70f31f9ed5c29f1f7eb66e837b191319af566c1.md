Officers searching for a man from Preston who was missing from home in Fulwood have found a body.

Formal identification is yet to take place but it is believed to be John Culshaw, 72, who was reported as missing on Saturday (June 30th).

Mr Culshaw’s car was found near Penwortham Holme allotments, close to the River Ribble and sadly a body was recovered from the river last night.
His death is not being treated as suspicious.

A post mortem examination will take place in due course and a file will be passed to the coroner.

Insp Chris Abbott, of Preston police, said: “Our thoughts remain with Mr Culshaw’s family at this sad and difficult time.”
