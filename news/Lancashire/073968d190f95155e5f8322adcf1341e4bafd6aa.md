POLICE were called at shortly before 8pm yesterday evening (Saturday, August 24th) to a report by a member of the public of an unidentified object in an area of Accrington Cemetery, Burnley Road.

Officers attended the scene and there is a concern this could be the body of a person. An examination of the scene is on-going but at this stage it is too early to say exactly what the object is or how long it may have been there.

The family of missing teaching assistant Lindsay Birbeck have been visited and informed of the development but at this early stage it is too soon to say if the find is linked to her disappearance and we would urge people not to speculate on social media as this could cause the family additional distress.

We will of course update you when we know more.
