We are appealing for information following a robbery in Preston on Monday.

We were called at around 8pm on 25th February to reports of the incident at the Gulf Best One Service Station on Tag Lane.

It was reported two men entered the store and made demands for money from the lone shop worker.

One of the men was holding a hammer.

They managed to get £100 and possibly other items before running off.

The men had their faces covered and were wearing gloves and hoodies. One was holding a black Firetrap bag and the other had a yellow JD bag.

#### DC Abid Majid of Preston CID said: “This must have been a terrifying experience for the shop worker who was working on his own. Luckily he didn’t come to any harm, but we need to find out who is responsible.

#### “If you have any information that could help with our investigation, please get in touch as soon as possible.”

You can email [email protected] or call 101 quoting crime reference 04/45150/19.
