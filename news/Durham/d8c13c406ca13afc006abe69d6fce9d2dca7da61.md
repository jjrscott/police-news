A 7-year-old girl remains in a critical condition in hospital following a house fire in Darlingon.

The blaze happened at a house on Esk Road at about 1.50pm yesterday.

​A 16-year-old boy who was arrested on suspicion of arson has been released under investigation.

Detective Inspector Andy Reynolds would like to reassure the community that this is an isolated incident. He said: “Our early enquiries would suggest that this was not a deliberate act but the investigation into the cause of the fire is continuing.

“Our thoughts are with the young girl in hospital.”
