​A DURHAM officer is going the extra mile for charity – by taking on the London Marathon.

Darlington neighbourhood officer, PC Tracy Kirk, will run her first ever London Marathon on April 28 for Phabkids.

The 49-year-old aims to raise £1,750 for the charity, which helps build better lives for children and their families in the UK.

Tracy was inspired to enter the 26.2 mile race by her friend and running partner, Viv Pow. The former Durham officer, who retired in 2014, ran the race back in 2017 after recovering from bowel cancer.

Tracy, who has 24 years’ service with Durham Constabulary, said: “In a moment of middl aged madness I decided to do the London Marathon – a goal I wanted to achieve before I am 50, and to tick one off the bucket list.

“I have found the training difficult with juggling working full time, family life, the lengthy runs and the aching muscles!

“But I am buoyed on by the fact that I am raising vital funds for a worthy charity and achieving something I never ever believed I could.

“I am also looking forward to running alongside my amazing friend, Viv, who inspired me to enter in the first place.”

Tracy has so far raised £1,100 of her £1,750 target.
