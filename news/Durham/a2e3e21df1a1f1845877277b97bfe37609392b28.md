​Officers are appealing for information following an increase in criminal damage on Macmillan Road in Newton Aycliffe.

Residents are having ongoing issues with youths throwing stones at windows and running off.

The youths are known to disrupt the elderly residents and on one occasion have smashed the ground floor window of one of the properties.

PC Neal Jones of Bishop Auckland response said: “Newton Aycliffe should be a desirable location for the community to live, we will take all measures to ensure they know we will not tolerate this behaviour.

“We would also ask for support from parents to ensure they know where and what their children are up to in the evenings”.

Anyone with information regarding the incident is asked to contact PC Neal Jones on 101 quoting reference number 74 of February 20.
