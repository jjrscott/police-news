​A horse has been injured following a collision on Durham Road, Lanchester.

The accident happened at around 4pm on Monday night (February 11) and involved a HGV.​

It is believed the wagon was attempting to overtake the horse and its female rider when the vehicle clipped the horse’s leg.

The 12-year old girl was uninjured, the horse sustained minor injuries and was checked over by a vet.

PC Dave Brawn, from the Roads Policing Unit said: “The child was obviously shaken up by this incident.

"The driver of the HGV stopped briefly however soon left without leaving any details, we are keen to trace this individual."

Anyone who witnessed the accident or has dashcam footage is asked to contact PC Dave Brawn on 101 quoting reference number 260 of February 11.
