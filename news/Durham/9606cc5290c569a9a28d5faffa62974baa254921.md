​TWO men who carried out a violent and racist attack on staff at a takeaway have been sentenced.

Ross Morrow, 24, and Michael Johnson, 28, from Spennymoor, carried out the attack at Happy Valley, a Chinese takeaway on High Street, Spennymoor, on October 7 last year.

During the incident, Morrow made racist remarks towards the staff and punched and head-butted them, with Johnson’s help.

Morrow then went on to smash the windows of the premises before the pair made off, only to be arrested a short while later.

Morrow was found guilty of two counts of racially aggravated assault, two counts of assault and one of criminal damage, while Johnson was convicted of racially aggravated assault and assault.

Morrow was given an 18 months community order and must complete 300 hours of unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay £1,280 in fines, costs and compensation.

Johnson was ordered to complete 150 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay a total of £495.

A spokesman from Durham Constabulary said: “We take reports of hate crime extremely seriously and encourage members of the community to pass on any concerns by calling 101 so that we can work together to tackle this issue.”
