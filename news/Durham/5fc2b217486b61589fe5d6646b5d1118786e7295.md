â€‹The 66-year-old man was driving a Skoda Fabia car along Quebec Street, in Langley Park when the crash happened on Sunday (February 3) evening.

His vehicle left the road and collided with a Ford Transit van, which was parked on a footpath area in front of a terrace of houses.

No-one else was injured in the crash, which took place just after 7.45pm.

The driver, who lived locally, was taken to the University Hospital of North Durham, where he was pronounced dead.
