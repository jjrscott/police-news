​Peter Jewkes, 86, of Lilburn Close, was struck by a Seat Ibiza on Church Street shortly before 5pm on Monday, October 15, 2018.

Peter suffered head injuries and was taken to Darlington Memorial Hospital. Now, he has sadly passed away in a local nursing home on Saturday (January 5).

The family of Mr Jewkes said: “Dad was a former joiner who often spent his time tending to his allotment and would regularly be in and around Shildon. He was well known in the area for being an avid pigeon fancier, having had this passion most of his life.

“We are still in shock about what has happened but we have released this lovely photo of him, which shows him exactly how he was – always smiling!”

A police investigation into the collision continues.
