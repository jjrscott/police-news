TWO mountain bikes are believed to have been stolen from a Ford Transit van parked outside Hamsterley Forrest, between 8am and 9.30am on Monday.

Officers believe the high value bikes will be offered for sale.

One is described as a charcoal grey Morewood Makulu downhill style mountain bike, valued at about £3,500, while the other is a £4,000 bright yellow Ibis Mojo HD carbon fibre mountain bike.

Anyone with any information is asked to call Durham Constabulary on 101, quoting incident reference 90 of September 24.​
