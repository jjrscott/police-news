​THE Herbert Protocol is a new scheme recently introduced by Durham Constabulary.

Working alongside its partners in the council, fire and rescue as well as Age UK and The Alzheimer’s Society, it encourages staff, families, friends and carers to compile useful information which could be used in the event of a vulnerable person going missing from either care homes or their own homes.
