Sheep injured following nasty attack in Ferryhill.

The incident is believed to have happened on Friday morning (February 15) after the sheep was discovered with an injured ear.

The owner of the farm, which is in Kirk Merrington, Ferryhill was alarmed and saddened by the injuries.

PC Emma Bartley, from Bishop Auckland response team said: “We have recently seen a rise in attacks by dogs on sheep which causes heartache to the farmers who on many occasions have reared the sheep from lambs.

“No animals should be attacked, chased, frightened or killed and no farmer should be losing their animals in this way.

“This can be avoided by being a responsible dog owner – please ensure your garden or yard is escape proof, dogs are not unattended and are kept on a lead at all times around livestock.”

Anyone with information about the attack is asked to contact police on 101, or the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
