Victims of domestic abuse who may be facing a difficult period over the festive season and lockdown are being reassured they are not alone during this time.

We understand that during the pandemic and, particularly at this time of year which can be stressful for many, victims of domestic abuse are even more vulnerable.

There will be many who feel under pressure through job losses and finances, being isolated indoors with abusers and feeling the stresses of Christmas.

Detective Superintendent Andy Coller, head of safeguarding, said: "We do understand there will be many people feeling even more vulnerable and at risk from abuse of all kinds including mental, verbal and physical. We want you to know that we are here for you and you are not alone.

"Christmas may be here but we do not stop offering support and want you to know that keeping you and your children safe is a priority at this time of year, just as much as any other. We know many people will be forced to stay in close proximity without the same access to friends and family members. Please call us in an emergency or look at the numbers listed **below** for specific help and advice from other organisations who can help if you don’t feel you can contact the police."

Lorne Green, Police and Crime Commissioner for Norfolk, said: "2020 has been a challenging year for many but, for those for whom the need to stay at home and limit contact with friends and colleagues has put them at risk of harm at the hands of partners or family members, it has been, and continues to be, a particularly difficult time.

"As we move into the Christmas period, please know you are not alone. There are fantastic organisations working both locally and nationally who can help get you the support you need, first to be safe and then to recover. My office has been working even more closely with our local domestic abuse services over the last nine months to offer extra funding, support to make their services Covid-safe and to grow their specialist teams to meet demand – all to ensure they have what they need to continue to be there for those who need their help.

"Between our support services and our policing services, there are lots of people at the end of the phone, email or live chat screen ready and able to help you."

The #YouAreNotAlone message follows on from our partnership campaign, See Something, Hear Something, Say Something, led by Norfolk County Council, which encouraged people to come forward and report domestic abuse. We would again encourage friends or family of those being targeted by domestic abuse, adults and children, to come forward and report it or seek help.

There are also specific helplines for men who are victims, Mankind, and those who want to stop being violent and abusive and want help to change their behaviour, the Respect helpline, both are listed below.

If you are in immediate danger you should call 999. Police 101 is the non-emergency number.

Silent Solution

The Silent Solution system helps filter out accidental or hoax 999 calls from those who need genuine police assistance.

If you are calling from a mobile phone and speaking or making an immediate sound would put you in danger and you need immediate help, call 999 and stay on the line, then press 55 when prompted and the call will be transferred to the police, who will know it is an emergency call.

Important notice

If you are calling from a landline, Silent Solution does not apply as it is less likely to call 999 by accident. If an emergency call is made and no one speaks and only background noise is heard and an operator does not know whether an emergency service is needed, you will be connected to a police call handler.

Information about where you are calling from on a landline will be automatically available to call handlers to help provide a police response.

If you'd rather not talk to the police, there are other ways to get help. You can seek help and advice from the following agencies at this link and listed in full below: http://www.norfolk.police.uk/advice/assault-abuse-threats/domestic-abuse
