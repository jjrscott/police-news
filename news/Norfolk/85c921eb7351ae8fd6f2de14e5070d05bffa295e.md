A 33-year-old man who attacked a man with a metal tool in a park in Diss has been sentenced to 30 months in prison.

Mark Stagg, of Viscount Close, Diss, appeared at Norwich Crown Court today (Friday 5 March 2021), after pleading guilty to unlawful wounding in an earlier hearing.

The court heard how on Saturday 17 August 2019, shortly after 9.40pm, police had been called to Park Road, Diss, following reports a man had suffered head and facial injuries after being attacked by another man armed with a socket wrench.

The victim, a 32-year-old man, had been inside a tent in Diss Mere Park, when he was attacked by the defendant. After stepping out of the tent, the victim suffered multiple blows from a metal weapon at the hands of Stagg.

Stagg was seen leaving the scene on a bicycle by a witness, after the victimâ€™s calls for help alerted them to the incident.

Police enquiries led officers to arrest the defendant a short time later on suspicion of assault, occasioning grievous bodily harm.

Stagg was today sentenced to 30 months imprisonment for the offence of unlawful wounding.
