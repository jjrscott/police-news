A man convicted for supplying cannabis in North Walsham has been ordered to pay back £80,000 from the proceeds of his crimes.

Aiden Hyland, aged 25 and of Chapel Road in Paston, appeared at Norwich Crown Court on Friday 25 September where he was sentenced to an 18-month Community Order and 150 hours of unpaid work after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply cannabis at an earlier hearing.

Hyland was also ordered to pay £80,000 under the Proceeds of Crime Act.

The court heard how Hylands was arrested on Saturday 10 February 2018 after officers executed a warrant at an address on Kings Arms Street in North Walsham and seized drug paraphernalia and cash.

A number of mobile phones were also found which contained various messaged relating to the supply and sale of cannabis.

Sergeant Toby Gosdon said: “I am pleased Hylands has been ordered to return the money he made through his criminality. This case demonstrates that crime does not pay and officers will continue to ensure those engaged in illegal activity are stripped of the very thing that motivates them to commit their crimes.”
