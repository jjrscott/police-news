A man has been jailed for six months after he assaulted two police officers in Sheringham.

Dean Cope, aged 31 and of Knights Green in Sheringham, appeared at Norwich Magistrates Court on Friday 10 July and pleaded guilty to charges of assaulting an emergency worker.

It relates to an incident that happened in Knights Green on Thursday 9 July, when Cope assaulted one officer, causing a minor injury, and deliberately spat in the face of another.

Cope was sentenced to a total of six months in prison.

Sergeant Toby Gosden said: "Assaulting emergency service workers in their duty is unacceptable at any time but clearly the public health crisis we currently find ourselves in makes it all the more abhorrent and unacceptable.

"I hope this sentence is a warning that incidents such as these against emergency workers will not be tolerated and we will take action where necessary.‚Äù
