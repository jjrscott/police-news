Two men have been charged in connection with burglary and fraud offences following incidents in the Dereham area.

The suspects, who were arrested in Scarning on Tuesday (6 October), were interviewed by detectives at Wymondham Police Investigation Centre and each later charged with offences.

Richard Dawson, 34, and of Milddlemarch Road in Dereham, and Carl Emmerson, 35, of Dale Road, Scarning, are accused of burglary at Holland Court in Dereham between 4 and 6 October and two counts of fraud by false representation where they allegedly used stolen cash cards to obtain almost Â£500 on October 5.

Dawson also faces a second charge of burglary in connection with an incident at Green Lane in Beetley between 3 and 5 October.

Both men were remanded in police custody to appear before Norwich Magistrates Court this morning via video link. Dawson and Emmerson were further remanded in custody until their next court hearing on Thursday 5 November.
