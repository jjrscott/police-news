A London man who was responsible for controlling a County Line in Great Yarmouth has been jailed for four years.

Omar Salah, aged 19 and of Marshall Street in London, was sentenced at Norwich Crown Court today (Thursday 21 January) after he admitted being concerned in the supply of crack cocaine and heroin at a previous hearing.

The court heard how Salah was arrested in Market Row in Great Yarmouth on Tuesday 1 September 2020, following a joint operation between the Norfolk Police County Lines Team and the Metropolitan Police.

The operation, named Op Orochi, focuses of analysing mobile phone data to identify those controlling County Lines from London to Norfolk.

On arrest Salah was found to be in possession of a mobile phone suspected to be linked to a County Lines phone line.

The following day, Wednesday 2 September 2020, officers searched his home address in London and found a number of mobile phones, also suspected of being linked to the same County Line.

Analysis of the phones revealed Salah was responsible for controlling the ‘Spyder’ line in Great Yarmouth between April 2020 and September 2020.

PC Michael LeFevre from the County Lines Team said: "This latest sentencing under Op Orochi demonstrates our ongoing commitment to targeting those controlling County Lines in Norfolk.

"We will continue to work with the Met Police to identify line holders and protect those vulnerable young people and adults from the exploitation associated with this type of drug activity.”
