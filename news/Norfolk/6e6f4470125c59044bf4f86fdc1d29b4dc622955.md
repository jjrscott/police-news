The overwhelming majority of people in Norfolk are adhering to the restrictions on movement to help stop the spread of the virus.

We know through our own patrols and contact from members of the public that not everyone shares the same motivation when it comes to following these measures.

Our approach to dealing with people who flout the law is fair but firm; officers follow a four-step escalation process and we will engage, explain and encourage in the first instance.

Enforcement is last resort and, as the figures demonstrate, there have been many occasions where officers have been left with no other option. These are challenging times for each and every one of us, but the advice is clear; stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. Social distancing will only work if we all follow that advice so it is important we deal with people who put others at risk unnecessarily.

In Norfolk we are issuing on average six tickets a day, which we believe is proportionate amount. It is clear from the public contact we have about gatherings that people feel strongly about the government measures being followed, and quite rightly so. They are in place to save lives and we would urge everyone to play their part.

 * Most fixed penalty notices issued are for ‘Contravene requirement as to restriction of movement during emergency period’
 * The majority of tickets are issued at the weekend
 * Around 50% issued with fines have previous convictions
 * More than 50% issued with fines are aged 29 or under
 * More than 80% of fines have been issued to males
