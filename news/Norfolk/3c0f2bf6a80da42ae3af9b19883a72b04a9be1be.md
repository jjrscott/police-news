Norfolk officers have been in attendance at a number of incidents on the roads today (7 February 2021) as high winds and snow move inland from our coastline.

In one incident, just before 1pm this afternoon (7 February 2021), police were called to Belton New Road in Bradwell, after a van and car collided in snowy conditions (pictured). Thankfully nobody was injured.

Earlier this morning a number of trees had blown down, causing dangerous conditions and blockages on roads in Great Yarmouth.

Norfolk County Council’s highways teams are continuing to carry out essential gritting runs, as well as dealing with drifting snow on roads such as the A143 at Haddiscoe, while the storm is expected to move further inland overnight.

T/Superintendent Nathan Clark asked residents to continue to avoid travelling where possible:

“The storm has moved its way quickly inland over the course of today, and driving conditions in some areas are awful. Partner agencies are working hard to make the roads as safe as possible, but the best thing we can do right now is to stay off them.

With Government rules dictating that we stay at home anyway, thinking twice about whether you need to make that essential journey right now is sensible. Some areas of the county are yet to feel the worst of the weather.

We don’t want anyone to get hurt, or for anyone to expose themselves or those workers helping others to any more danger than they need to.”
