A man has been sentenced to more than three years in prison for running a County Line in Norwich.

Jahmoy Trail, aged 23 and from Croydon in London, appeared at Norwich Crown Court on Tuesday 13 October 2020 after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply crack cocaine and heroin at a previous hearing.

The court heard Trail was arrested in London on Monday 29 June 2020 in a joint operation between the Norfolk Police County Lines Team and the Metropolitan Police Service.

The operation, named Operation Orochi, focuses on analysing mobile phone data to target those individuals responsible for running a County Line from London into Norfolk.

Following his arrest, officers searched the home address of Trail and found a number of mobile phones which revealed he was responsible for running the ‘Ghost’ County Line.

Trail was sentenced to three years and six months in prison.

PC James Bailey, from the Norfolk Police County Lines Team, said: “This latest sentence under Operation Orochi once again shows Norfolk’s dedication to its work alongside our metropolitan colleagues in the tackle against county lines. This sentence should go out as a warning to anyone who is actively involved in county lines that you will be detected, and you will be prosecuted.”
