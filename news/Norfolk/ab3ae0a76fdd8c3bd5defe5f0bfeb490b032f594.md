Norfolk Constabulary's Chief Constable has issued the following response following the kidnap and murder of Sarah Everard:

Chief Constable Simon Bailey said: “The kidnap and murder of Sarah Everard has been incredibly sad and shocking. I met with chief constables across the country yesterday afternoon to discuss male violence against women and the experiences and fears that women have shared since Sarah’s tragic murder.

“It is understandable these events will cause people to be fearful and no woman should feel unsafe, either at home or whilst walking on the streets of Norfolk. However, we must be careful that we do not allow the fear of crime to disproportionately affect our lives.

“In Norfolk, it is rare for someone to be victim of a serious violence or sexual crime by a stranger.
Of our most serious violent offences against women in the last 12 months, none have been identified as having been committed by a stranger. And of all rape offences we have recorded in the same time frame, only one of those has been identified as being committed by someone we believe is not known to the victim and this case is being fully investigated by our Major Investigation Team. It is also known the vast majority of people who are murdered in this country are victim to someone who is known to them.

“However, what these figures do highlight is the importance of our work around domestic abuse and it is one of the most serious crimes we deal with as a force. There has been a particular focus on supporting those who are vulnerable during the pandemic as we know they are at greater risk during this time - and we continue to work with our partner agencies and a range of professionals to raise awareness of domestic abuse and sexual violence. Together we offer access to services, subjecting every case to a risk assessment and ensure we provide a robust response to every incident.

“This is a moment for us to reflect as a society on what we can do to reduce male violence, abuse and harassment. Many of the solutions lie outside of policing but I know Norfolk police has an important role to play.

“A key issue for policing and the criminal justice system is the effectiveness of our response to violence against women, particularly rape and other sexual offences, domestic abuse and stalking.

“Too few victims are seeing their cases go to court. For those that do, the experience is long and difficult. This has a serious impact on their confidence in the police and in the criminal justice system and means too many perpetrators get away with their crimes.

“We have implemented a Domestic Abuse Best Practice Framework with the CPS, and Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunal Service that aims to drive up prosecutions. We are increasing the use of the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme, obtaining more Domestic Violence Protection Orders (DVPOs) and Domestic Violence Protection Notices (DVPNs) at court and strengthening the vital multi-agency collaboration to tackle offenders’ behaviour and improve the safety of victims.

“Norfolk police, along with other forces across the country, have also contributed to and are waiting for the outcomes of the cross-Government rape review, which has been working to understand and address the reasons behind falling rape prosecutions. In the interim, a Joint National Action Plan is being implemented with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). It includes action to improve support for victims, help officers build strong cases from the outset and increase the knowledge and expertise of our officers and staff. There are promising signs as the referrals of rape to the CPS are starting to rise.

“Norfolk Police remains committed to the work already underway to improve our support to victims of rape and domestic abuse and help them get justice. In the coming weeks, we will be speaking to our partners, victims’ groups and experts about what more can be done.

“I have agreed with Chief Constables across the country that we will contribute to working with experts and partners, to consider carefully the role police could play in responding to street harassment. As part of this we agreed we need to further assess the calls for misogyny to be treated as a hate crime. The Law Commission is due to make final recommendations on this issue later this year and parliament will be debating the case for police forces recording where existing crimes are believed to be motivated by hatred of someone’s sex or gender.

“We know victims of rape, abuse and harassment are more confident to report to us and I want to reassure people in Norfolk we are here to help. Offences of this nature will be taken seriously. They will be fully investigated and if a crime has been committed we will seek to prosecute those responsible.”
