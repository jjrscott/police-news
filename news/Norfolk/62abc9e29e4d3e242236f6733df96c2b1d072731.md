A woman from Norwich has been jailed for 12 weeks after she damaged a car whilst drunk and coughed in an officer’s face after falsely claiming she had coronavirus.

Joanne Turner, aged 35 and of William Kett Close in Norwich, kicked and damaged a car as it was parked outside Norwich Train Station at around 11pm on Wednesday 25 March 2020.

Following further enquiries, officers located Turner to a property in William Kett Close where she became abusive. She then claimed she had coronavirus before coughing forcefully in one of the officer’s face.

Turner was sentenced to 12 weeks imprisonment after pleading guilty to being drunk and disorderly in a public place, criminal damage to property and common assault of an emergency worker, at Norwich Magistrates Court yesterday (Thursday 26 March 2020).

Chief Superintendent Dave Marshall said: “Any abuse and threatening behaviour towards the emergency services is unacceptable at any time. However, this sentence reflects the seriousness of threats and acts of coughing to put others in fear of contracting Covid-19. This should act as a clear warning that there will be serious consequences for anyone who behaves in such a threatening way towards others during this pandemic.”
