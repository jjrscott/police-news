Motorists are urged to reconsider any essential journey they intend to take over the next few days, as snow and gale force winds arrive in the county.

Officers have been out on the roads this morning following reports of fallen trees and debris as a result of the bad weather.

Police were called at 7:19am this morning (Sunday 7 February 2021) to the A143 between Fritton and St Olaves, after a tree had fallen down, blocking the road.

At 7:46am this morning officers were called to Ormesby Road in Caister-on-Sea to find a large tree hanging dangerously over the road, after being damaged in the high winds.

At a time when we should only be travelling when absolutely necessary, under lockdown rules, people are asked to be very careful and make sensible decisions if they need to leave their homes.

T/Superintendent Nathan Clark said: “While the majority of us are seeing blizzard-like snowfall today, high winds and saturated ground from the recent rain are posing as much of a threat to road users as the snow itself.

Every journey a motorist makes increases their chances of coming into contact with others, and potentially finding themselves involved in an accident or breakdown, and needing help from emergency services who are already stretched.

We are likely to see more disruption on the roads over the next few days as a result of the weather, so we would repeat our message and ask people to be sensible, and stay safe. “
