Norfolk Police is reminding residents across Norfolk and beyond that they need to continue to adhere to lockdown measures and stay local after hundreds of people were reported to have turned up at Sea Palling today (Saturday 27 February 2021).

Officers are carrying out patrols in coastal areas over the weekend and issued eight fixed penalty notices (FPNs) in Sea Palling this afternoon after finding people had travelled from areas such as Peterborough and Ipswich to walk on the beach. Around 30 vehicles were parked around the beach area.

Although the force is continuing to engage, encourage and explain to people first, those who continue to breach the rules could see themselves being fined.

Sergeant Dave Cooper said: "We understand people want to enjoy the sunshine, and our beaches are a big attraction in Norfolk, but we need to stay as local as possible and not become complacent as the vaccine programme is rolled out across the county.

"We will be carrying out Covid-19 patrols over the weekend and into the coming weeks to ensure we are helping to look after everyone and remain vigilant."
