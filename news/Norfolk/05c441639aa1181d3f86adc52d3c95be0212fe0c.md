Two people have been arrested after officers found an outbuilding being used to dismantle stolen vehicles.

On Tuesday 20 October 2020, officers from the Operation Moonshot team located a commercial hangar in Upwell, Wisbech being used to dismantle stolen vehicles from a number of counties, including from Suffolk, Linconshire, Leicestershire and London.

Four stolen vehicles, including Range Rovers and an Audi A7, and stolen plant machinery were seized at the ‘chop shop’ in Small Lode, along with vehicle parts linking to other stolen vehicles.

A man in his 30s, and a man in his 60s were arrested at the scene on suspicion of theft, and taken to King’s Lynn police station for questioning.

The man in his 30s was later released on conditional bail, while enquiries continue.

The man in his 60s was released under investigation.

Temporary Superintendent Lou Provart said:

“This finding was the result of a fantastic piece of proactive work from our dedicated Moonshot team. They continue working to target criminals, particularly those on our roads, who think Norfolk is a place to hide from involvement in serious crime across the UK.

“Our message is clear – there is no place to hide. Working together with forces across the country, we will keep on tracking and dismantling criminal activity.”
