Police are appealing for help to identify a man following a number of frauds in Downham Market.

It follows a series of incidents that took place between May and June of this year, in which victims have been contacted by fraudsters claiming to be police officers in London. After gaining the trust of the victims they have been encouraged to withdraw large quantities of money, before handing it over to a courier who falsely claims to be working on behalf of the police.

Officers are investigating eight incidents where money has been handed over between 28 May 2020 and 15 June 2020 resulting in a total loss of £37,000 to the victims involved. The suspect, who is believed to have collected money for all of the offences, is known to have travelled from Kings Cross train station in London to Downham Market before committing offences and returning to London, where he is believed to be from.

Officers have released CCTV images of a man they would like to speak to in connection with these incidents.

Anyone who may recognise this man, or anyone with information, should contact DC James Smith at King’s Lynn CID on **101** quoting Operation Radium.

Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on **0800 555111**.

Please note, the police will never ask you to provide details of your bank account over the telephone and will never ask you to withdraw money to assist with investigations.
