Police are appealing for information after three Cocker Spaniel puppies were stolen from the Rougham area on Friday night.

The red Cocker Spaniels, who are just three months old, were stolen from kennels in the back garden of a property in the Rougham area at about 11.30pm on Friday (5 February 2021).

Their owner, Gemma Wright said: "My whole family is absolutely heartbroken. My twin children already had an unbreakable bond with them and they're absolutely devastated.

"My husband and I are trying to stay strong for the children's sakes but this is a horrible situation for everybody. It's bad enough knowing our puppies have been stolen, and to think that strangers have been on our property while we were sleeping – we were only woken up by the dogs barking – is so upsetting. We feel violated and my children are struggling to sleep at night."

The stolen puppies consist of two bitches and one dog. All are microchipped.

Anyone with information is asked to contact PC Dale Reynolds at Dereham Police Station on **101** quoting crime reference 36/7859/21. Alternatively, they can call Crimestoppers anonymously on **0800 555 111**.
