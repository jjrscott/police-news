Police are appealing for witnesses to an aggravated burglary that took place in Brundall yesterday.

The incident took place last night (Wednesday 30 December 2020), at approximately 9:50pm, at a property on West End Avenue.

Three suspects rang the doorbell of the victims’ front door, before forcing entry into the property once the door had been opened, and carrying out a search inside the house.

One victim, a woman in her 80’s, was hit over the head with a metal object by one of the suspects, after she attempted to grab his face covering.

Another victim, a male occupant of the house, was also threatened by one of the suspects, before the three suspects left the property.

The female victim was taken to hospital for assessment, after sustaining cuts and swelling to the head. Both victims were left distressed, but not seriously injured.

One of the suspects is described as approximately 6ft 2, with bleached blonde hair, of very thin build, and wearing dark clothing.

Another of the male suspects is described as wearing a black, fluffy jacket with a hood, of stocky build, and wearing dark jeans.

Initial enquiries suggest this appears to have been a targeted incident, with specific items of property being sought.

Officers are keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the incident, or seen the men described.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Detective Inspector Tom Smith at Norfolk Constabulary on 101, quoting crime reference number 36/91486/20.

Alternatively, they can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
