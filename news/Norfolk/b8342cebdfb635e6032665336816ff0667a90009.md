A woman has sadly died following a boat incident in Great Yarmouth.

Officers were called just before 1.35pm on Wednesday 19 August to reports a woman had become trapped under a boat on the River Bure at North Quay.

Officers attended the scene, along with Norfolk Fire and Rescue Service, the Coastguard and the East of England Ambulance Service, however, the woman, aged in her 30s and from the London area, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

A cordon has been put in place around the boat and enquiries are ongoing to establish the circumstances leading up to the incident and how the woman came to be in the water.

Lawn Avenue, which was closed earlier today whilst emergency services were on scene, has now been reopened.
