Police can confirm the body of a man has been discovered in Great Snoring, near Fakenham, this morning (Tuesday 12 January 2021).

Officers were called to Thursford Road shortly before 8.45am after a member of the public reported finding an elderly man unresponsive on the ground.

Emergency services attended but the man was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

While formal identification is yet to take place the family of Robert Taylor, a 93-year-old man reported missing from Little Snoring last night (11 January 2021), have been informed.

The death is not being treated as suspicious and a file will be prepared for the coroner in due course.
