A 31-year-old man from London has been arrested in connection with fraud offences in Norfolk in which elderly people were conned out of money.

It follows two incidents in Hunstanton and Melton Constable on 28 January where residents were cold-called by someone claiming to be a police officer and conned out of thousands of pounds.

Following enquiries, a suspect was arrested by officers in London on Saturday (6 February) and transferred to Norfolk for questioning in relation to fraud offences.

The man was questioned by detectives at Kingâ€™s Lynn Police Investigation Centre and released on bail, with conditions, until Wednesday 3 March while enquiries continue.
