The victim suffered bruising around his eye as a result of the assault.

The suspects are described as white males, wearing gloves, with one believed to have been wearing a face covering with a skull symbol on it.

Officers are appealing for information, and witnesses to the incident. They are particularly keen to hear from the male member of the public who intervened.

Anyone with information should contact DC Simon Hawkins at Bethel Street Police Station on 101, quoting crime number 36/91433/20.
