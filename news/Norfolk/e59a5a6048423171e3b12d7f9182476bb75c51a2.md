Police are appealing for information, and to trace an owner, after a foldable bike was recovered.

A dark silver, Brompton, foldable bike was found by a member of the public at Thetford train station.

Officers believe the bike may have belonged to a passenger travelling on a train from Cambridge to Norwich.

The owner of the bike is suspected to have been travelling from approximately 7:30pm on Wednesday (2 December 2020).

Police are keen to hear from the potential owner, as well as anyone who may have seen suspicious activity around the time and date mentioned, during train travel between Cambridge and Norwich.

Anyone with information is asked to contact PC Charlie Large at Thetford Police Station, on **101**.
