Police are appealing for witnesses following a collision in Great Yarmouth last night (Tuesday 27 October 2020).

Officers were called to Nelson Road Central at about 9.40pm after a black Toyota Celica had crashed into the front of The Albion pub and had rolled on its side, colliding with a pedestrian.

Firefighters and paramedics also attended the scene and both the pedestrian and driver of the car were taken to the James Paget University Hospital for treatment for what are thought to be minor injuries.

The fire service made the building safe and the car was recovered around 3am this morning.

Police are keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the incident or has information concerning the driving manner of the Toyota in the moments leading up to the collision.

Anyone with information should contact PC Mike Stolworthy at the Roads and Armed Policing Team at Acle on 101.
