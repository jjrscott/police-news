Police are appealing for witnesses following a five-vehicle collision on the A11 at Ketteringham on Sunday 22 November 2020.

A black Jaguar was travelling along the Thetford-bound carriageway at approximately 3.10pm when it was in collision with a blue Vauxhall Tigra parked in a lay-by.

This resulted in a collision with two further vehicles in the lay-by â€“ a Ford Focus and a Ford Mondeo. A fifth vehicle, a black Nissan Qashqai, was hit by debris during the incident.

The drivers of the Tigra and the Focus were both taken to hospital with serious leg injuries, whilst the drivers of the Jaguar and Mondeo sustained minor injuries.
