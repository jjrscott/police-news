We’re gathering information and video footage in relation to last night’s trouble in Coventry city centre.

We need the public’s help to establish the complete circumstances around what happened.

The footage we’ve seen so far shows our officers moving in to protect two young men who were the target of a violent attack from a large crowd.

Those officers put themselves in harm’s way − in the face of bricks and bottles being thrown at them − in order to protect those two men and prevent the situation from escalating.

The officers were acting on information the two men may earlier have been in possession of a knife or knives. Given that information, one of the men was handcuffed while they were both searched.

They were not found in possession of any offensive weapons, they were not arrested, so our officers again escorted them away from the crowd in order to keep them safe.

If any hate crimes are identified we will take action against offenders.

We will be carrying out a thorough investigation into the disorder and claims the two men were earlier armed with a knife. We are also investigating claims that some of the crowd were in possession of weapons.

This kind of violence will not be tolerated in our city and we will take robust action against offenders.

We are working hard to establish exactly what happened and why and would urge anyone with information or video footage that may assist our enquiries to get in touch via Live Chat at WMP Online or by calling us on 101. Please quote log 2731 from 9 June.
