In 1994, there were 67 mobile phones for every 1,000 people in Britain. The Channel tunnel opened and big blockbuster movies like Forrest Gump, The Shawshank Redemption and The Lion King were released in cinemas.

But even bigger than that - it was the year our dog section began their now world renowned puppy development programme and a new TV series, Friends hit our screens.

We wanted to commemorate our quarter-century milestone in some way. So when a litter of six German Shepherd puppies were born in November (2019) - three girls, three boys - we just knew we had to name our fury friends after our favourite Friends characters, Ross, Joey, Chandler, Monica, Rachel and Phoebe.

And, just before they went to their new homes with our approved volunteer puppy fosterers we paid them a visit.

You can watch the one with the police puppies… here:

Dave Raymond, Head of the Puppy Development Programme for West Midlands Police, said: “The dog section is a proud part of WMP history and an integral part of operational policing.

“Historically, police dogs had always been recruited into service by means of public donation, by sale or gift.

“In 1994 we took the decision to initiate a breeding programme. This has continued to flourish and today the force operates the largest, most successful Police Dog Puppy Development Programme in the UK.

“It adheres to KC guidelines and we have achieved Assured Breeder Accreditation by the Kennel Club in recognition of our commitment to dog welfare."

The Friends litter will begin their journey through our structured Puppy Development Programme alongside our volunteer puppy fosterers and we will be following them throughout their journey.
