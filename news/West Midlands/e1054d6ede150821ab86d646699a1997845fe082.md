We’ve celebrated more than a year of Project Servator at Birmingham Airport and in Birmingham city centre.
Servator is designed to cut everything from shoplifting and pickpocketing to more serious crime such as terrorism.

It was launched at Birmingham Airport in May 2018 and Birmingham city centre in November of the same year. It is expected to move into Solihull and Coventry over the next year.

It uses uniformed and plain clothes police officers and staff alongside dogs, firearms, ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) and CCTV cameras in crowded places across the West Midlands.

Commenting on the success of the project , Chief Inspector Sallie Churchill, West Midlands Police’s lead on Project Servator , said: “We have seen some real successes including, the arrest of a man wanted on recall to prison, a drink driver arrested at a vehicle check-point and cash and drugs seized.

“The tactics gives us more opportunity than ever to connect with the public as well as hundreds of businesses in Birmingham.

“We can’t do this alone though, the public have been very supportive and those working, living and visiting the city have become our extra eyes and ears, reporting suspicious behaviour to help make it even harder for criminals.

“We continue to call on the public to be vigilant and to report anything that they think is suspicious immediately by telling a police officer, or by calling 101 or 999 in an emergency or by calling the Anti-Terrorist Hotline on 0800 789 321."
