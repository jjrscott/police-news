We've charged a man after another man was left with serious head injuries following disorder outside an Oldbury pub.

Thomas Matthews was yesterday (October 28) arrested in connection with an altercation near the Phoenix pub, Martley Road, last Saturday.

The 28-year-old, of Bredon Court, Halesowen, has since been charged with inflicting grevious bodily harm without intent.

He appeared at a virtual court hearing today and was remanded in custody to appear before Wolverhampton Crown Court on 26 November.

A man in his 40s remains in a serious condition in hospital and we still need to hear from anyone who was in Martley Road, at around 9.10pm on Saturday, and not already spoken to us.
