We’ve charged a man with the murder of a Birmingham dad almost four years ago after the suspect was traced to a house in Norway.

Abdulahi Shire was sought over the fatal stabbing of Zakir Nawaz in Highfield Road, Washwood Heath, on 10 September 2016.

A European Arrest Warrant was issued shortly after the killing – which had been sparked by a minor road rage collision – and our detectives were working with Europol in a bid to locate Shire.

He was detained earlier this month by Norwegian police and yesterday transported back to the UK by West Midlands Police officers.

Nakir Nawaz who was fatally stabbed in Birmingham in 2016

The 24-year-old of no fixed address – who is originally from Holland – has now been charged with murder and is due to appear in Birmingham Magistrates Court this morning (29 July).

Two other men have already been convicted in connection with Mr Nawaz’s death.

Warsame Mohamed was initially jailed for four-and-a-half years in July 2019 after admitting manslaughter – but we appealed his sentence as being unduly lenient and the Court of Appeal later increased it to seven years.

And a 29-year-old man was jailed in March 2017 for two years having admitting a charge of violent disorder.
