We're investigating after a man was attacked and a woman threatened with a knife during an armed robbery at their Bloxwich home.

Three men confronted the couple, both in their 60s, after smashing their way into an address in Harden Road at around 10.10pm last night (28 November).

The masked trio - who were armed with machetes, sledgehammers and a knife - left the pair fearing for their safety during the ordeal lasting more than half-an-hour.

The woman had a knife held against her throat, while the man suffered arm and head injuries after being repeatedly hit with a weapon. He remains in hospital for treatment and further assessment.

The intruders took a substantial amount of cash and jewellery.

Detective Inspector Mandy Thompson, from force CID, said: "This was an horrific experience for the victims in their own home.

"The man was repeatedly hit with a machete as he tried to get them to leave, while the woman had a knife put against her throat.

"We need to find whoever was responsible for this and I would urge anyone with information about this trio, however insignificant they feel it may be, to come forward."

Anyone with information can contact us via Live Chat, or by calling 101, and quote crime reference number 20WS/295078E/20.

Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
