A man has been sentenced to 34 years in prison after being found guilty of historical sex offences committed while he was a pastor in Edgbaston, Birmingham.

Michael Oluronbi, a self-proclaimed pastor and pharmacist, was convicted of rape and sexual assault against six young girls and the sexual assault of a boy.

His wife, Juliana Oluronbi, was also found guilty of two counts of aiding and abetting the rape of a child and one count of aiding and abetting the rape of an adult. She was sentenced to 11 years.

The offences began in 1989 when Oluronbi set up a church group at a house in Winson Green, Birmingham. It was after these church meetings the abuse for many of his victims would take place.

Oluronbi, now 60, carried out what he would call ‘spiritual work’ which involved bathing his victims when the sexual abuse would took place and in some cases made them drink perfume. On some occasions, 58-year-old Juliana also carried out the ‘spiritual baths’, assisting her husband in the abuse.

One of his victims was as young as nine when the abuse began and for some it continued into adulthood. Oluronbi would brainwash his victims into thinking that the abuse was a normal part of their religion, claiming that it warded off evil and even that it would help improve their school grades.

Four of the girls fell pregnant and when this happened, Oluronbi and his wife arranged for a paid abortion or Michael would administer the drug himself.

When one of the girls left home, the couple - both from Orchid Drive, Hockley - assisted in getting her a flat where the abuse continued despite her telling him repeatedly to leave her alone.

Last year, a family member of one of the victims confronted Oluronbi and his wife at their home address where he claimed the devil made him carry out the abuse.

Michael Oluronbi and his wife Juliana were both sentenced at Wolverhampton Crown Court this afternoon (6 March). The couple will also be ordered to sign the sex offenders register for life.

Detective Inspector Dave Sproson, from the Public Protection Unit, said: "These were sickening crimes committed against children who had put their trust in Oluronbi and looked up to him.

“I hope these sentences offer some closure to the victims and I would like to thank them for their bravery throughout the trial. I would like to reassure anyone who has been through anything similar that we will investigate and prosecute those responsible.

“I would urge anyone who has ever thought about speaking to police about sexual abuse, to come forward. We are here to help you.

“If you want to speak to me about this case in particular, please don’t hesitate to contact me on 101 ext 845 6157.”
