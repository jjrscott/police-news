A Birmingham pub has had its licence suspended after causing a nuisance and ignoring CoVID-19 rules.

PB’s is the first premises in the city to be ordered to close after it continually allowed people to flout social distancing and risk spreading the deadly virus.

Officers also discovered loud music belting out from the pub in Key Hill, Hockley, which was not only a noise nuisance in the area but meant it was difficult to have a conversation without shouting - increasing the threat of transmission.

There were at least seven breaches of government guidelines reported in August and it culminated in a closure notice being enforced in the early hours of Saturday morning (15 August).

This was followed by an application to suspend the licence, and remove the designated premises supervisor, which was considered by Birmingham City Council’s licensing sub-committee on Wednesday (19 August).

This was approved and will be in place for 28 days ahead of a full licencing review, which is due to take place on 14 September.

Inspector Nicola Court, from Birmingham Police, said: "We’re in a pandemic and it’s imperative pubs ensure government guidelines are followed to reduce the spread of CoVID-19.

"There is a real public passion for pubs and the vast majority of licensees have recognised the importance of safety measures.

"But at PB’s we found punters recklessly ignoring social distancing, mingling at the bar and even dancing around.

"Loud music meant people were having to shout which only increases the risk of spreading CoVID-19 as well as causing a noise nuisance.

"We will continue to enforce the law where there is a risk to public safety and to prevent the spread of infection but it’s imperative people act responsibly and follow the guidelines."

Mark Croxford, Head of Environmental Health at Birmingham City Council, added: “The decision to suspend this licence, pending a full hearing, sends a clear message to businesses which flout Covid restrictions and operate in a way that puts their staff, their customers, local community and the city at risk.

"That message is simple: we will take action against premises that breach these restrictions, which ultimately could lead to their licences being revoked."
