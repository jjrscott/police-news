A teenager has been jailed after admitting killing a young man in Dudley earlier this year.

Harvey Waterfield, aged 19, from Wednesbury, was found with a stab wound to his back in Spring Pool Meadow in Russells Hall on 16 March.

Harvey Waterfield

He sadly died at the scene, despite the best efforts of members of the public who rushed to his aid.

A 17-year-old boy who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty to his murder in October and was given a life sentence at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Friday (18 Dec). He was just 16 at the time.

He must serve at least 12-and-a-half years in youth detention and later prison before he can be considered for release.

Three others pleaded guilty to violent disorder.

They are Christopher Halford, aged 28, from Middle Park Road, Dudley; Connor Oakley, aged 18, from Spring Pool Meadow, Russells Hall; and a 17-year-old who cannot be named due to his age.

Christopher Halford

Connor Oakley was jailed for two years, Halford given a 20-month sentence, and the 17-year-old made subject of a two-year Youth Referral Order including intensive supervision.

Connor Oakley

Aaron Oakley, aged 41 and Connor’s uncle, was also jailed for 20 months for perverting the course of justice after our detectives found he tried providing a false alibi for the killer.

Aaron Oakley

In a statement earlier this year Harvey’s family said: "As a family we are devastated at the loss of our son Harvey.

"He was an amazing son and brother and words can’t possibly explain how we are all feeling."

Detective Inspector Adam Jobson, from our homicide team, said: “Harvey’s death was simply tragic. It was a savage attack, unprovoked and with no clear motive.

"I hope the sentences handed out today offer some comfort to Harvey's family.

“Knife crime and violence are completely unacceptable and there is no place for either within our communities.

“The consequences are devastating, Harvey was a young man with his whole life ahead of him. My thoughts remain with his family and friends."
