An armed robber has been jailed for five years after we tracked her down within two hours of her crime - thanks to her missing teeth.

Tara Gregory pulled out a knife and threatened her target in Brighton Street, Coventry, at around 10.10pm on 19 December last year.

She grabbed cash from the man in his 20s and quickly fled, but the victim was able to give a distinctive description which included the attacker having two front teeth missing.

Officers on patrol in Wellington Street, Coventry, spotted her and she was promptly arrested at 11.45pm the same day.

Gregory, aged 30 and of no fixed abode, was convicted of robbery following a trial and was sentenced at Warwick Combined Court on Wednesday (22 July).

DC Richard Walker, from Force CID, said: "Being threatened with a knife was a terrifying situation for the victim but he the acted quickly to contact us.

"The distinctive description - alongside our alert officers - meant she didnâ€™t get far and is now behind bars."
