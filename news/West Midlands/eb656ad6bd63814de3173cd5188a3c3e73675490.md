A murder investigation has been launched after a man died when shots were fired in Lozells this afternoon (26 August).

The 22-year-old was critically injured in Lozells Road just after 12.30pm and died a short time after arriving at hospital.

Officers immediately secured the scene to preserve evidence and are speaking to witnesses and examining CCTV and mobile phone footage.

A short time later a 28-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and has been taken into custody for questioning.

Detective Chief Inspector Jim Munro, from the force’s homicide unit, said: “This is a very dynamic situation and we are exploring every avenue to establish what happened this afternoon.

“Although we have made one arrest we believe that others were involved.

“We need the help of the community to come forward with information so that we can find all those responsible for such a shocking crime in broad daylight.

“The man’s family have been informed and we have specialist officers with them after receiving just devastating news."

Inspector Lee Wiggan leads the neighbourhood policing team in the area, he added: “Over the coming days you may well see an increased police presence within your community, as detectives continue their investigation and uniformed officers remain on patrol within the area.

“Some of the tactics we may need to employ as a police service over the next few days and weeks may include the use of armed officers as well as the application for extended search powers under Section 60 of the Criminal Justice Public Order act 1994. We will let you know where we can if we are doing this.

“In times like these, I can’t help but be saddened by the unnecessary loss of life and the associated grief experienced by friends and loved ones. This grief will also be felt by you as members of the community.
