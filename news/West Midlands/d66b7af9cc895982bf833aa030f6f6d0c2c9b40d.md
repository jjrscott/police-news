We are urgently appealing to identify them after a man fell from a flat balcony in Coventry last month.

We were called to Bath Street at around 7pm on Monday 17 August after a 31-year-old man fell from a second floor balcony.

He was taken to hospital with serious injuries and he remains in a critical condition today (24 September).

CCTV enquiries show a group of four men leaving the block of flats straight after the incident and we are urgently appealing to trace them as we believe they could hold vital information about what happened.

Two men, aged 25 and 33, were arrested from the scene on suspicion of attempted murder. They have both been released without charge.

If you recognise them, or have any information, please contact us as soon as possible via live chat or by calling 101.

Alternatively call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. Please quote crime reference number 20CV/196209L/20.
