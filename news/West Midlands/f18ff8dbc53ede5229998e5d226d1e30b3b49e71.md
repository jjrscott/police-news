The family of a man killed following a collision in West Bromwich on Thursday 16 July, have released a tribute to their loved one who had ‘such potential in life'.

Anthony Whitehouse was walking along Newton Road just before 9.30pm, when he was struck by a car near to the junction of Wigmore Lane.

The 27-year-old’s family, said: “Anthony was our beloved eldest son, a much loved big brother, grandson, nephew and friend to many.

“He will be sadly missed by us and many others. He had such potential in life that has sadly been taken from him and us.

“We have been left with a hole in our family that can never be filled and ask for peace to mourn him as a family.”

Mr Whitehouse, from the Stone Cross area, suffered serious injuries and died at the scene. His family continue to be supported by specialist officers.

The driver of a grey Audi A7 involved in the collision, stopped at the scene and is assisting with the investigation.

DC Jamie Simon from the Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: “I am trying to trace the driver of a silver four door saloon car that was overtaken by the grey Audi A7 shortly before the collision. We think they are a key witness and we need to hear from them.

“It’s possible the car was a Mercedes and it was travelling on Newton Road coming away from West Bromwich at about 9.22pm. It had joined the road from Holyhedge Road and would have been overtaken by the Audi in the immediate moments before the collision."
