We’ve charged a man with the murders of Julie Williams and her son David in Coventry and Nicole McGregor in Leamington.

The bodies of Julie and David were discovered in separate flats in Coventry earlier this week and on Thursday (29 October) the body of 31-year-old Nicole was discovered in woodland in Newbold Comyn.

Anthony Russell, 38, of Riley Square, Coventry, is also accused of a car-jacking and a section 18 wounding that took place in Leamington on Wednesday afternoon.

Russell will appear via video link at Birmingham Magistrates’ Court on Monday 2 November.

A post mortem for Julie, David and Nicole proved inconclusive and further tests will be carried out to understand the exact cause of their deaths. .

The family of Nicole have released this statement: “We wish to thank people for their well wishes, Nicole will be greatly missed. We request to be left alone to grieve at this difficult time.”

Detective Inspector Jim Mahon who is leading the investigation, said: “Our thoughts remain with the families of Julie, David and Nicole as they come to terms with the tragic circumstances of their deaths.

“We want to thank everyone for their assistance with our appeals for information this week, we really appreciate it.

“Our investigation continues and I would urge anyone with information who have not yet spoken to us, to get in touch."

We continue to ask for the public for any information to assist our investigation. Please contact us via Live Chat on our website west-midlands.police.uk between 8am and midnight, call 101 anytime or ring Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
