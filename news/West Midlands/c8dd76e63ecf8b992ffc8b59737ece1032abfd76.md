We’ve identified a taxi driver who is helping our enquiries into a shooting on Far Gosford Street last Thursday (17 September), after we appealed for help to trace him.

The man is now assisting with our investigation, but we are still appealing for anyone with further information to get in touch.

Three men were taken to hospital just after 10.15pm last Thursday after they were shot. Thankfully, all three have now been discharged from hospital.

No arrests have been made so far in the investigation and we are urging anyone who knows anything to get in touch with us.

Please contact us via Live Chat on our website or call 101 quoting 20CV/224909R/20.

If you’d prefer to remain anonymous you can contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. Tell them what you know - not who you are.
