We’ve secured an injunction against a suspected gang member that bans him from his Birmingham stomping ground and from mixing with other men linked to violent urban street gangs.

It’s the latest success in our ongoing efforts to tackle violent crime in the city and to make our communities safer.

The Gang Injunction was granted at Birmingham County Court last week (23 July) against Coyitito Morgan.

It makes him the sixth man in Birmingham now bound by such orders which come with strict conditions designed to disrupt the activity of people with suspected links to gangs.

Coyitito Morgan

The 23-year-old, originally from Newtown in Birmingham, now has an injunction preventing him from entering Newtown, Lozells, Handsworth, Hockley and Winson Green.

He’s also banned from hanging around with 16 named associates – all men aged between 17 and 29 – and must provide us with details of any vehicle he owns or intends to drive.

Breaching the order – which runs until 24 January 2022 – is a criminal offence that could see Morgan jailed.

Police officers from the Birmingham Organised Crime Unit, said: “There is a significant amount of police and community intelligence linking Morgan to gangs, plus he’s been at the scene of some nasty gang-related incidents.

“The court has granted us a Gang Injunction that will significantly disrupt his activity. If he flouts any of the conditions, we can arrest him and place him before the courts where he faces being jailed.”

We've taken almost 50 lethal firearms, including loaded pistols, off the streets since April (stock pic)

Last month we launched a new operation targeting violence and gun crime in parts of Birmingham.

It’s seen us carry out lots of warrants at addresses linked to gang activity and drug supply, numerous arrests and weapons seizures.

Since April we’ve taken 48 lethal firearms off the streets of the West Midlands – including 19 in Birmingham – and each one of those represents a potential life saved.
