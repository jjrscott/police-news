_In response to COVID-19 our staff and officers are working to keep you safe. For some this has meant a change to their role, the way they work and some personal sacrifices._

_As part of our series of new ‘Diary of a key worker’ features we’ll be bringing you the personal stories of colleagues from teams and departments across the force and how they are responding to the pandemic._

_Today we speak to a colleague about how he will be celebrating Eid (May 24 & 25) very differently this year. _

Asim and his family celebrating Eid

"Ramadan is a time for family and togetherness. I’m one of the lucky few whose been able to spend this Ramadan locked down with my immediate family, but I know many Muslims who haven’t and my heart goes out to them.

"It’s still been tough. This year we’ve not been able to open our fast with our extended family or visit the mosque and pray. I will never complain about going to the mosque late at night ever again!

"However there’s a blessing in everything. Being locked down as a family has meant we’ve really been able to give Ramadan our all and focus on the spiritual side as a collective.

"Eid is going to be weird this year. Usually we have a gigantic get together with our entire family surrounded by food and laughter. If my family are reading this, we will miss you. I’m also missing my barber and gutted I can’t get my traditional ‘Eid trim’.

"My whole family are key workers. While they’ve been busy teaching their school kids over Zoom, I’ve been on the other side of the living room making sure we’re sharing vital messages across our digital channels.

"Working on the social media team I’ve seen first hand the kindness and support shown during this crisis. People been amazing. Those actions are a reflection of what this blessed month means to Muslims - solidarity, reflection and perseverance while giving generously with open arms.

"Normally I’m writing as ‘West Midlands Police’ online, but from myself I wholeheartedly say thank you to every one for your patience.
