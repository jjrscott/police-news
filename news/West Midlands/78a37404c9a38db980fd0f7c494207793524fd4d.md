UPDATE: Ellie Wain was given a life sentence to serve a minimum of 17 years

A woman has been convicted of murder after fatally stabbing her boyfriend in the street outside their home.

Ellie Wain was armed with a knife following an argument with Kieran Brown on 1 June this year.

The pair ended up on the floor during a scuffle outside their home off Middle Ride, Coventry, and it led to 18-year-old Kieran being stabbed.

Kieran Brown

He was promptly driven to hospital by a relative but sadly died soon after arriving at around 10.10pm.

Wain, also aged 18, was arrested and claimed she had the knife for self-defence and Kieran had been accidentally stabbed.

However, Wain was today (21 December) convicted of murder by a jury and will be sentenced tomorrow (22 December).

Ellie Wain

A trial at Coventry Crown Court was told their on-off relationship was volatile and she had been drinking alcohol and smoking cannabis earlier that day.

Kieran’s family have described his as “a kind loving son, grandson and great grandson. His life was cut short by the cruel actions of Ellie Wain in a fit of temper because things weren’t going her way. We won’t see Kieran grow into a man, he won’t get married or have children. There is no sentence that will bring Kieran back our family are living a life sentence of our own - a huge hole has been left where Kieran should be. Ellie is young and will get to have a life at some point she has taken this opportunity from Kieran".

Detective Inspector Adam Jobson, from force CID, said: "If Wain hadn’t armed herself with the knife, she would not have been able to inflict the fatal injuries she did, and Kieran would still be alive today. This will now mean she loses her freedom for a long time.

“This is yet another reminder of the fatal consequences that carrying and using knives can have. I urge anyone that picks up a knife to stop and think before it’s too late... there is no going back."
