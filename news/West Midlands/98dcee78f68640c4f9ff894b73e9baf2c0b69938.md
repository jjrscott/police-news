We are investigating a fight outside an Oldbury pub last night that led to a man suffering a serious head injury.

We attended the Phoenix pub in Martley Road, Oldbury, at 9.10pm following reports of a disorder.

It’s understood a man, aged in his 40s, was punched in the face and suffered a serious head injury as he fell to the floor. He’s been taken to hospital where he remains in a serious condition.

Officers attended the scene to make initial enquiries

Our officers conducted initial enquiries at the venue last night and have seized CCTV for examination.

We’re appealing for witnesses who’ve not yet spoken to us to come forward - and we would also urge the people involved in the fight to come and speak to us so we can hear their side of the story.

Anyone with information, suspects they know who was involved, or who witnessed what happened are urged to message us via Live Chat on our website or call us on 101. Please quote crime reference SW/260613P/20.

Or call the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
