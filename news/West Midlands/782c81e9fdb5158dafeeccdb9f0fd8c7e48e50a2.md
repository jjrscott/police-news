Weâ€™ve charged a second brother with murder following the fatal stabbing of Thomas Rogers in Birmingham.

David Rogers has been remanded in custody to appear before Birmingham Magistrates Court tomorrow (29 August).

The 32-year-old, of Nora Street, South Shields, had been detained in the North East on Thursday morning and transferred to the West Midlands for questioning.

Thomas was discovered seriously injured near the junction of Bristol Road and Mill Pool Way, Bournbrook, last Saturday (22 August).

The 26-year-old was rushed to hospital but was pronounced dead shortly after his arrival.

His brother Samuel Rogers, aged 30, and Ryan Hurt, 22, have already been charged with murder and remanded into custody.

Detective Inspector Stuart Mobberley, from our homicide team, said: "This is another significant development in our investigation.

"However, we are still keen to hear from anyone with information as our enquiries around what happened last Saturday continue."
