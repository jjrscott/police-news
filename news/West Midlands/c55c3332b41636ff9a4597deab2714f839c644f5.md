A callous couple have been jailed after killing a man in a Birmingham street robbery last year.

The pair stalked their victim, Mark Lloyd, aged 39, as he made his way home after an evening out with friends on the 21st September 2019.

Sean Sweeney and his girlfriend Shannon Cronin, went out intent on robbing someone as they wanted to buy cigarettes and alcohol.

At around 11:30pm they assaulted and robbed Mr Lloyd on Aldridge Road, Perry Barr.

The attack was captured on CCTV and clearly shows the pair stalk Mr Lloyd as he walked home alone.

He was attacked from behind, with Sweeney punching Mr Lloyd to the back of the head with such force that he collapsed to the ground and never regained consciousness.

The pair then searched him, stealing his mobile phone and bank card before leaving him alone at the side of the road.

The couple were arrested 25 minutes after the assault and were initially charged with robbery and fraud.

Tragically, Mr Lloyd died in hospital eight days later as a consequence of a head injury caused by Sweeney’s punch.

The couple were re-arrested and further charged with murder.

Yesterday, Monday 28 September, Cronin, aged 23, of Clyde Street, Cradley Heath was found guilty of manslaughter, robbery and fraud following a trial at Birmingham Crown Court. She was sentenced to five years in prison.

Her boyfriend, Sweeney, aged 27, from Oscott Road, Perry Barr, had previously pleaded guilty to manslaughter, robbery and fraud. He was sentenced yesterday to 10 years.

The investigation was run by our complex investigation team’s Detective Sergeant Jonathan Gill who said: “This was a shocking attack on a loving and devoted family man who was on his way home after an evening with friends.

“The violence used was extreme and the couple’s actions were callous and lacking in remorse as they left Mr Lloyd seriously injured and went to buy the cigarettes and alcohol using his bank card.

“Mr Lloyd’s family are left devastated by their actions; I hope the conviction of Sweeney and Cronin, and the support our officers have given them, provides some comfort.”
