We're appealing for witnesses and information after a man died after being hit by a car in Quinton last night (27 November).

The 46-year-old pedestrian was struck by a VW Golf on Hagley Road West, on the into city carriageway between Wood Green Road and Stanley Road, at around 10pm.

Despite the best efforts of emergency services he was sadly confirmed dead at the scene.

A 30-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and being unfit through drink or drugs. He remains in custody for questioning.

Our Serious Collision Investigation Unit are working to establish the full circumstances and are asking for anyone with information or dash cam footage.

Sergeant Dean Caswell, from the unit, said: "A man has sadly lost his life and our thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time.

"We're in the early stages of our investigation but we're keen to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time and has not spoken to us already. We're particularly interested in anyone who was in the area and has dash cam footage."

Anyone with information can contact collision investigators on FL_COLLISION_INVEST@west-midlands.pnn.police.uk, via Live Chat at www.west-midlands.police.uk 8am - midnight, or by calling 101 anytime. Please quote log number 4670 of 27/11/20.
