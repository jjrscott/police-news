The teenage holder of this sawn-off shotgun has been jailed as we continue our efforts to take weapons of our streets.

We acted on information and discovered the gun and ammunition at an address associated with Dalton Travers in Sutton Coldfield in September.

We also found CS spray, just over £7,000 in cash and just over 20 cannabis plants after swooping on his home in Aldridge Road, Great Barr.

The 19-year-old pleaded guilty to possession of a prohibited firearm, weapon and being concerned in the supply of Class B drugs.

He was jailed for a total of five years at Birmingham Crown Court on Tuesday (22 December).

DC Louise Davies, from force CID, said: "This was a dangerous weapon we’ve managed to take out of circulation. We know the harm they can cause within our communities when in the wrong hands.

“Travers was also connected to drugs and has now lost his freedom as a result of his criminal actions."
