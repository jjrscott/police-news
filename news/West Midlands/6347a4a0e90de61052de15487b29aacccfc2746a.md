The family of a teenager who died after a car overturned in Knowle have spoken of the 'heartbreak' at their loss.

Tributes have been paid to 15-year-old William Kingham following a fatal collision along Kenilworth Road around 9.30pm on Monday (23 November).

In a statement they said: "William was a loving son and grandson and a caring and funny brother. We are all totally devastated and heartbroken to have lost him so early in such cruel circumstances and will miss him dearly."

William from Solihull was in a Renault Clio which flipped on its roof and he was sadly confirmed dead at the scene.

A 15-year-old girl from the same car was taken to hospital with injuries and since been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.

She has been de-arrested while she continues to receive treatment for her injuries - which are not believed to be life-threatening - and will be interviewed when deemed medically fit.

The driver of a second car was also arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. The 19-year-old man has since been released under investigation.

Detective Sergeant Paul Hughes, from our serious collision investigation unit, said: "The death of William has clearly had a massive impact on those who knew him and the wider community.

"I’m aware there are rumours circulating and I’m again asking for people not to speculate on the circumstances, it does not help our enquiries or families we're supporting.

"Following our initial enquiries it’s currently unclear who was driving the Renault Clio when it flipped over, and we're working hard to establish exactly what happened on Monday night.

"We understand there are a mixture of emotions from a range of people during this difficult time. But we need everyone to trust us to do our roles and get answers.

"No-one has currently been charged with any offences and we are keen to hear from anyone with any information to contact us directly."
