The family of a ‘much loved young man’ who was killed in Lozells yesterday (26 August) have paid a loving tribute to him, while detectives investigating the murder have arrested three people.

Naasir Francis, aged 22, was shot on Lozells Road just after 12.30pm and died shortly after arriving at hospital. A post mortem revealed he died of a gunshot wound to the abdomen.

Naasir Francis

His family have today paid an emotional tribute to him, saying: “Naasir was the warm entity that bought a sense of security to the family.

“A deep comfort has been lost by his mother and siblings.

“A much loved and respected young man in his community, Naasir’s charming personality, birthed a light of spiritedness in the eyes of his family, a light that has dulled since his passing.”

A 24-year-old man was arrested earlier on suspicion of murder and a 23-year-old woman and 39-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. They are all in custody to face questioning.

The 28-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder yesterday has been released with no further action.

Detective Chief Inspector Jim Munro, from the force’s homicide unit, said: “This is a tragic loss of life which was shockingly committed in broad daylight.

“We realise how this terrifying this incident must be for residents and people in the area at the time and we’re doing all we can to try to understand exactly what happened.

“These arrests are a positive step in our investigation, however we still need the help of the community to come forward with any information they may have.

“Local neighbourhood police teams have increased their presence in the area as we understand the shock and grief is not felt by Naasir’s family and friends, but also the wider community."
