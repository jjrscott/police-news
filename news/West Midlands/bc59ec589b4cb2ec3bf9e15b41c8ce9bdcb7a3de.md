We are appealing for information after a woman was grabbed from behind as she pushed a pram with her baby son in down Yarningdale Road in Coventry on Friday (20 November).

A small dark car had stopped beside them close to the junction with Weymouth Close and two men wearing balaclavas and their hoods up got out of the car and attempted to put the woman inside it. She screamed and they then left her and drove off towards St James Lane.

It’s possible the vehicle involved was a black three door car. It happened at around 11.10pm.

Detectives investigating the case are asking for anyone who saw any suspicious behaviour in the area or who may have CCTV or dashcam footage of the incident to come forward.

Sergeant James Rees, from the force CID team, said: “We are keen to hear from anyone who saw the incident taking place or who may have seen men driving around wearing balaclavas.

“The information you have may not seem like much, but it could really help with our investigation. This was really distressing for the woman and we need to work out exactly what happened.”

Enquiries continue and anyone with information is asked to contact us via live chat at west-midlands.police.uk between 8am and midnight, or call 101 anytime. Crimestoppers can be called anonymously on 0800 555 111. Please quote crime reference 20CV/286819Z/20.
