We’re appealing for information following an attempted armed robbery at a shop in Coventry last night (22 December).

The brave shopkeeper was threatened with a knife but still managed to thwart the masked man in Hollyfast Road, Coundon.

The worker at Ganatra News managed to repel the would-be robber with a spray, which saw some red dye end up on his jacket.

He fled the store empty-handed at around 7.25pm and we’re keen to hear from anyone who saw a man - with red coating on his coat - to come forward.

DC Mike Bray, from force CID at Coventry, said: "This was a terrifying situation for the shopkeeper who was confronted with a knife and ordered to open the till.

"He managed to repel the man and in doing so some red dye went onto his jacket.

"We believe the would-be robber fled on foot and we really need to hear from anyone who was in the area around that time and saw him.

"You may have paid extra attention to him because of the dye on his clothing, unaware of what had happened just beforehand."

Patrols have been stepped up in the area and anyone with information is asked to contact us via Live Chat, or by calling 101. Quote 20CV/319537K/20.
