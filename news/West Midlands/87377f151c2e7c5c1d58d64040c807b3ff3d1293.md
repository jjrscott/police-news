Have you seen Michaela Pulova with her two children Amelya Pulova and David Pulo?

Michaela Pulova

We are urgently trying to find them after they went missing yesterday (Tuesday 24 November) at around 7.30pm.

Amelya is aged one, and her baby brother David is four-months-old.

David requires urgent medical attention so we really need to find them as soon as possible.

Michaela, aged, 23, is around 5ft 4ins tall and of a slim build.

It’s thought the family could be in the #Oldbury or #Smethwick area of #Sandwell and we need to make sure they’re safe.

Please call 999 if you have any information on their whereabouts.
