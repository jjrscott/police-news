We've seized more than 140 vehicles during an operation to crackdown on uninsured drivers across the region this week.

We joined forces with the Motor Insurers' Bureau (MIB) for the nationwide #OpDriveInsured campaign to stop law-breakers.

The MIB estimates around 26,000 people a year are left injured by an uninsured or untraced driver.

Such collisions also cost the national economy up to £2 billion a year in emergency services, medical care, loss of productivity and property damage.

We have ANPR camera systems that scan thousands of number plates an hour and were part of our targeted operations around the West Midlands. It saw us stop drivers and seize vehicles between Monday and Friday.

Vehicles can be crushed or sold off at auction if necessary documents are not provided to us within seven days. Those caught driving without insurance face six points on their licence and a £300 fixed penalty notice, or substantial fine if the matter is pursued through the courts.

Sergeant Jon Butler, from our road harm prevention team which were involved in the operation, said: "We don't want to see any uninsured vehicles on our roads and this action was part of our ongoing efforts to tackle the issue.

"Let’s be clear, to drive while being uninsured is unacceptable, illegal and unfair on those who properly insure their vehicles."

West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner David Jamieson said: “I introduced police powers to seize and destroy uninsured vehicles as a road safety minister back in 2004. This was in answer to the menace of uninsured drivers, who are often in untaxed and unsafe vehicles.

“I know that the vast majority of law-abiding motorists will welcome this action by West Midlands Police as they are sick of paying the price for uninsured drivers.”
