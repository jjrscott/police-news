Belfast woman Christine Connor has been jailed today for attempting to murder a police officer in the Crumlin Road area of Belfast in 2013, as well as causing explosions and other offences.

Connor, aged 35, was found guilty at a re-trial last month at Laganside Crown Court. Today (24 August) she was handed an extended custodial sentence totalling 24 years, comprising of 20 years in custody with an extension period of four years under licence. She was also sentenced to 15 years to run concurrently for possessing explosives and causing explosions with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property on May 16 and May 28, as well as preparation of terrorist acts between February 1, 2013 and May 30, 2013.

Head of Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands CTU Detective Chief Superintendent Kenny Bell said: “We have continued to work closely with the PSNI’s Serious Crime Branch and West Mercia Police over a number of years during this protracted investigation, the initial trial and the retrial.

“Today’s sentencing is a fantastic result and testament to the concerted efforts of all forces, together with the national counter terrorism network, to thwart attacks and bring individuals to justice."

Detective Superintendent Richard Campbell, of Police Service of Northern Ireland’s Serious Crime Branch, said: “On 28 May 2013 police responded to a ‘999’ call reporting a domestic dispute. This call was made by what appeared to be a very distressed woman. Officers were despatched to the address given and when they exited their vehicle two improvised explosive devices were thrown.

“Thankfully neither of the officers were seriously injured, however they were left extremely traumatised by this horrific experience. It is good fortune that an officer was not killed that night.

“Christine Connor callously made a call for help, pretending that her boyfriend was ‘smashing up the house’. She exploited an all too familiar situation that numerous people find themselves in – domestic abuse.

“Today’s sentencing is the result of excellent joint working between the PSNI and West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit and other UK police services. I would like to thank all officers who were involved in bringing Christine Connor to justice.

“Thankfully she is now in prison paying the price for her crimes.”

A co-defendant, who also jointly faced five charges including attempted murder and possessing explosives and causing explosions with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property on May 16 and May 28, is now deceased.
