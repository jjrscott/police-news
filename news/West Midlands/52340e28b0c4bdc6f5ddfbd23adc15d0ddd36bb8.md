We’re appealing to trace more potential witnesses following the death of a man found with a serious head injury in a Smethwick alleyway on Tuesday 14 April.

Jagdev Lally was rushed to hospital after a passer-by found him collapsed off the High Street at around 9am.

Jagdev Lalley died almost three weeks after being found with significant head and facial injuries in Smethwick.

Our investigations show the 39-year-old was attacked at approximately 3am and suffered significant head and facial injuries. He died almost three weeks later on Friday 1 May.

Ashley Pace was previously charged with wounding and the 34-year-old, of no fixed address, was remanded by the courts. The charge has since been reviewed and changed to murder.

We previously launched an appeal to trace a witness, but unfortunately that person is yet to come forward. Today (24 July) we have launched a new appeal to trace him as well as a further six potential witnesses.

We've launched a renewed appeal to trace an additional six potential witnesses.If you recognise any of these people, or were in the area at the time, please get in touch.

The images have been taken from CCTV cameras covering the Tollgate shopping precinct in the hours before Jagdev was found.

We understand the images are grainy, but if you recognise any of these people, or were around the area at the time, we are urging you to contact us.

This is the witness we originally appealed to trace. We're still hoping they will come forward.

It’s really important that we speak to these seven individuals to find out what they know. It might be nothing, but it’s still a vital part of our investigation.

Please get in touch via Live Chat on our website www.west-midlands.police.uk 8am – midnight, or by calling 101 anytime.

Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously. Tell them what you know, not who you are. Please quote log number 4039 of 20/4/20.
