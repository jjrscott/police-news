A 52-year-old fast food delivery driver has been convicted of raping a woman in Coventry.

Naiem Malik Suleman offered the 22-year-old woman a lift in his car in the early hours of 19 January last year, after she had split up from her friends on a night out.

But instead of talking her home, the court heard that he raped her.

Later when she arrived home she had on a jacket bearing the logo of the delivery firm Suleman worked for.

She also had bruising round her neck and scrapes and scratches on her knees.

Suleman, of no fixed address, denied the charge but forensic evidence from her clothes linked him to the rape and he was convicted on Friday (20 November) at Warwick Crown Court.

DC Becci Jones, from the force’s Public Protection Unit, said: "It saddens us that throughout this case Suleman denied raping the woman – meaning she also had to endure a court trial.

"But with the support of our specially trained officers she remained strong and resilient and with her help we have now secured his conviction. We hope that this will bring her some comfort and wish her well for the future."

Suleman remains remanded in custody for sentencing in January.
