The family of a 59-year-old woman who died after being hit by a car on a pedestrian crossing in Brierley Hill have paid tribute to her as detectives renew their appeal for witnesses to come forward.

Jennifer Batty suffered serious injuries after being hit by a silver Vauxhall Insignia on Audnam, at the junction of Brettell Lane at around 7am on Friday (18 December). She was sadly later confirmed dead at hospital.

Her family, who are being supported by our specially trained staff, said: “Jennifer was a much loved wife, daughter, sister, auntie and successful local business woman.

"She was a devoted animal lover and was extremely well thought of in the community.

"The family are absolutely devastated and have asked that their privacy be respected at this very sad time."

A 37-year-old man arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving has been released pending further enquiries.

Detectives are keen to hear from anyone who saw the collision or has dash cam footage and who has not yet spoken with officers.

PC Dave Crump, of the Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "I am really keen to trace a witness who was also driving along Audnam and approaching the traffic lights junction with Brettell Lane and High Street.

"They would have been passed by a silver coloured Vauxhall Insignia just before the collision and it’s likely they continued onto High Street and in the general direction of Stourbridge."
