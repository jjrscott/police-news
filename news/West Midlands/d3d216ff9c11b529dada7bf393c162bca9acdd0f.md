A 43-year-old man was yesterday (Thursday 30 July) jailed after a driver was killed in a three-car collision in Castle Bromwich.

James McIlkenny, who was over the prescribed limit for cannabis, had been seen driving at speed and undertaking another car just seconds before he collided with Ross WIlliams on the A452 dual carriageway.

Victim Ross Williams

McIlkenny’s orange Ford Fiesta hit the Peugeot 205 as Mr Williams was turning across the carriageway into Lancaster Way at about 8.25am on 11 January 2019.

The 37-year-old suffered a serious head injury and was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

Our investigators calculated that McIlkenny was travelling at 65mph when he hit Mr Williams. The speed limit for that stretch is 50mph.

Jailed - James McIlkenny

The Peugeot span through 360 degrees before coming to a stop on the verge, while McIlkenny’s Fiesta was thrown into the air and ’barrel rolled’ twice before coming to rest on its wheels further down the A452.

A third vehicle, a black VW Golf, hit the central reservation as its driver tried to avoid colliding with the other two vehicles.

Our officers interviewed a number of witnesses with one driver describing how just before the fatal collision, the Fiesta had overtaken him at 65mph and then undertaken the VW Golf before pulling back in front of it.

McIlkenny, who was treated in hospital for minor injuries, was later arrested and found to be over the prescribed limit for cannabis.

In police interview, McIlkenny admitted to officers that he had undertaken the VW.

A vehicle technician, McIlkenny of Larkmeadow Drive, Kings Hurst, Birmingham, had previously admitted causing death by careless driving whilst over the prescribed limit for drugs.

He was sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court to two years and four months in custody.
On release he will also be disqualified from driving for four years and have to complete an extended driving test.

Detective Sergeant Paul Hughes, of the serious collision investigation unit, said: "McIlkenny was driving over the speed limit and whilst over the prescribed limit for drugs when he collided with Mr Williams.

"There is no place on our roads for this type of driving. The resulting collision has tragically taken a family’s adored son, brother, uncle, brother-in-law and nephew and my thoughts remain with them."
