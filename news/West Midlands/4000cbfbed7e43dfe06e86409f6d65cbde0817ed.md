We are reminding local people to play their part in the fight against Coronavirus as other areas of the country move into tougher measures and the festive season approaches.

It is so important, now more than ever, to do the right thing to curb the spread of the virus.

We will continue to take a proportionate and common sense approach to policing the West Midlands – we don’t intend to intrude on private spaces but we are counting on you to act responsibly before, during and after the festive season.

Our approach remains to positively, politely and proactively, engage, explain and encourage people to follow the rules in the first instance so that all members of our communities are kept safe.

We will only resort to enforcement when we cannot be satisfied that a reasonable excuse exists and other members of the public are being unnecessarily put at risk.
These are challenging times for the public and police alike. We would rather we didn’t have to police CoVID-19 legislation but it is important we do to limit the spread of the virus and save lives.

We are committed to keeping our communities safe from the virus.

The West Midlands remains in a tier 3 area for more information https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tier-3-very-high-alert
