A brave member of our police family has raised hundreds of pounds for Cancer Research UK after recently battling the disease herself.

Jill Harrison - who has been with us for more 30 years in roles ranging from a police traffic warden to PCSO - underwent six bouts of chemotherapy after her breast cancer diagnosis 17 months ago.

The determined 53-year-old continued working in her current union secretary role - where she supports staff through any difficulties - while receiving her own life-saving treatment.

Now selfless Jill wants to help save the lives of others after recent confirmation of her latest mammogram coming back clear.

This includes sharing her own personal story during Breast Cancer Awareness Month, to give others hope and encourage everyone to check themselves regularly.

She said: "I found the lump in my breast by luck not judgement. I was getting ready for a conference which would take me away for a week. I was in the shower and I found the lump. It was so obvious like a small hard marble.

"I booked an appointment to see the doctor and just went to the conference and tried to forget about it, but all my colleagues and friends knew I wasn’t quite myself and I couldn’t concentrate on anything."

The doctor referred Jill to the hospital and just two weeks later she was in the waiting room of the breast clinic.

"I was sitting in a room with about 20 people and as we went along the group got smaller and smaller," she said. "Others were being sent home with the all clear, but I was still there, and when I looked around it was me and three others and we all looked terrified.

"I was taken into a small room with comfy seats and was told the news I was dreading - we suspect it to be, the chances are you may have cancer."

Jill was then delivered the life-changing news a week later. But it was telling her mum which was one of the toughest parts of dealing with the diagnosis.

"They told me it was triple negative cancer, a more aggressive cancer. I had a mammogram a year ago and it was clear and now I had cancer. They needed to remove the lump as soon as possible and any other cells that were cancerous.

"I was saying to mum ’it’s ok they’ve caught it in time’ and she was trying to be positive and strong for me but I could see the devastation in her eyes. It was the hardest thing."

Jill had an operation to remove the lump and fortunately the cancer hadn’t spread, but she needed a series of chemotherapy along with daily radiotherapy treatment for three weeks. She built a rapport with hospital staff which helped to keep her spirits high.

"The staff were amazing. On the first day I turned up in bright pink converse, which was noticed and after that I turned up every day in a different pair which was definitely a talking point for us all."

Working at West Midlands Police throughout her treatment was important for Jill, although she still missed out on one of her big passions... watching the football.

"Work was fabulous, that I was able to work helped me psychologically. It was so important for me not to lose my identity and my worth, not to be defined by cancer and to still contribute. I will always be thankful for the support of WMP and my friends who were with me every step of the way.

"It’s the little things that are more important to me now. I am feeling great and every morning I am grateful. My biggest regret - missing last season’s football - I’m a huge Wolves fan and not being able to go to the matches because of having to isolate due to my treatment was frustrating. When we get back to some kind of normality my first outing will be a family meal and watching a match at the Molineux."

Jill has raised more than £800 for Cancer Research UK after completing her own Race for Life challenge last month.

She’s urging people to remember to check yourself at least once a month. The earlier breast cancer is diagnosed, the better the chance of successful treatment.
