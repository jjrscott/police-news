The family of a schoolgirl who died following a collision in Coventry have paid tribute to the "best daughter anyone could ever have."

Isabelle Boshell suffered serious injuries after being struck by a car on Tamworth Road last Thursday evening (22 October).

The 11-year-old was rushed to hospital but sadly passed away yesterday morning (26 October).

In an emotional tribute her family said: "Isabelle was a loving daughter, granddaughter, great granddaughter and sister. She was loved by her friends, family and adored by her dog and cat whom she loved.

"She meant a lot to everyone and lived life to the full; she loved art, dancing, singing and learning. She was learning to play the guitar and was a unique individual who loved to set her own trends.

"The best daughter anyone could ever have. Please respect our family at this sad time and allow us the privacy to grieve."

The 53-year-old driver of the car, a Toyota Verso, remained at the scene but required medical assistance. He will be spoken to in due course.

Weâ€™re still appealing for any witnesses who've not come forward already or anyone with dash cam footage.

Detective Sergeant Paul Hughes, from our serious collision investigation unit, said: "We've all been left numb by the sad death of Isabelle. She was just 11-years-old with her whole life in front of her, but this has been tragically taken away.

"To see the loss of someone so young is difficult for us as officers, but we know the pain is even greater for Isabelle's family.

"We'll be doing all we can to support them while they grieve, while also trying to establish what happened leading to the collision. We need your help so we can give answers to Isabelle's family."
