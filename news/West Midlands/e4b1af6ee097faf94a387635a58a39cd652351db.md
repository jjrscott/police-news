We caught more than 80 people during a dangerous driving crackdown along the region’s collision hotspot route last week.

We took action after figures revealed more than 40 serious or fatal collisions took place on the Birmingham Ring Road in 12 months.

Our road harm prevention team carried out an operation with particular focus on dangerous driving near junctions.

It led to 88 drivers being caught for offences of going through a red light, speeding, using a mobile phone at the wheel, not wearing a seatbelt and having no insurance.

They now face fines, penalty points or referral to an education programme to reinforce the potential impact of their actions to deter them from such behaviour again.

The ring road operation formed part of the national One Road One Week campaign; which also saw us work alongside partner agencies to educate pedestrians on safer crossing.

Along with the road harm prevention team crackdown the Central Motorway Police Group (CMPG) carried out similar vehicle stops elsewhere. In total there were 283 traffic offences recorded.

Sergeant Jon Butler, from the road harm prevention team, said: "We’ve sadly seen the devastation of dangerous driving on our roads all too often.

"We targeted the Birmingham Ring Road as figures suggested this was the most dangerous road for serious collisions - particularly near junctions.

"It coincided with our ongoing actions to reduce collisions at hotspot locations and keep all road users safe as part of Operation Safer Junction.

"We’ll continue to monitor routes and carry out operations across the region to enforce the law and educate people about the potential impact of being irresponsible at the wheel."

West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner, David Jamieson said: “Ensuring our roads are safe is a priority for me and I commend the work West Midlands Police is doing to make a difference.

“Reducing the number of injuries on the roads and cracking down on those breaking the law is a priority for me. The number of people being killed or seriously injured on roads in the West Midlands is falling. It is clear that the operations run by West Midlands Police are making a positive difference.

“The majority of motorists drive responsibly. The operations that have been run by West Midlands Police are about cracking down on the minority who are putting lives at risk especially the lives of children and the elderly.

“Those who break the law and put people’s lives at risk will face the appropriate consequences."
