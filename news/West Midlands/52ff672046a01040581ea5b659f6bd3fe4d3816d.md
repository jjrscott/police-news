Two drivers have been locked up after a 43-year-old passenger died following a high-impact collision on a dual carriageway in Sutton Coldfield.

Anthony Moran was a front seat passenger in a silver Renault Megane when the fatal crash happened in the early hours of 8 December 2018.

Anthony Moran died four days after the collision

The Megane, which had stolen number plates, was being followed by Sabeel Nazir, in a black Audi A7, who believed it had been involved in an alleged criminal damage incident earlier that evening in South Yardley.

As the Megane, being driven by Leigh Robinson, and the Audi travelled along Eachelhurst Road, at around 12.25am, they hit speeds of up to 80mph.

Jailed - Leigh Robinson

Travelling in the opposite direction was retired licensee Peter Stockwell, aged 76, in a grey Rover MG ZR.

Tests later showed that he was over the legal limit to drive with 90mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood - the legal limit being 80mg.

As Stockwell turned right across the dual carriageway into Ashford Drive his grey Rover MG ZR collided with the Megane, which left the road and flipped onto its roof.

Nazir, a bank manager, managed to avoid hitting the other two cars but mounted the grassed central reservation and hit street furniture.

Despite the best efforts of paramedics and medics, Mr Moran sadly died four days later in hospital.

On Wednesday (25 November), Robinson, aged 33 who is unemployed and of no fixed address, was jailed for three years and two months at Birmingham Crown Court.

Nazir, also aged 33, of Blakesley Road, South Yardley, was jailed for two years and five months.

Robinson and Nazir, had both admitted causing the death of Mr Moran by dangerous driving at an earlier hearing.

Both men were also banned from driving for three years following their release from prison.

Stockwell, of Eachelhurst Road, had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity to causing death by careless driving whilst compromised by alcohol.

He was sentenced to eight months jail, suspended for 12 months.

He was also disqualified from driving for two years and ordered to attend 10 days education around drink driving.

PC Mark Crozier of the Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "This was a tragic incident that resulted in the death of Anthony Moran and I offer my condolences to his family.

"Both Robinson and Nazir pleaded guilty to causing Anthony’s death by the dangerous manner of their driving.

"Had Nazir not decided to take the law into his own hands and pursue Robinson then this collision would never have happened.”
