Officers from Birmingham police have donated bikes to two youth workers who work to reduce violent crime.

Darnish Amraz and Clinton Gordon work for Birmingham City Council Youth Service and work alongside Birmingham police officers around areas including Aston, Ladywood, Sheldon and Sutton Coldfield.

The pair walk miles a day, talking with young people, offering advice and providing information and guidance. They also offer health and support and signpost young people to facilities that can help them if they need.

To see if they could be even more effective and reach wider communities, Darnish contacted partnerships and engagement officer, Georgina Johnstone to see how we could help them.

Georgina got the ‘wheels in motion’ and organised for two bikes to be donated to them, to help them reach a much larger area in a day to help with youth violence.

The bikes were provided out of police property, after either being seized or recovered and despite extensive work, no owners came forward to claim them.

Clinton and Darnish receive bikes to help them reach more people

Youth Worker, Darnish, said, "As a young person myself, that went through the youth service, I am now giving back and working for people that supported me so much over the years. So to have been given these bikes and to be able to make an even bigger impact really does mean the world to us.

“Not only does this mean we are able to talk to so many more young people in a day, they all seem a bit more interested in engaging with us now we have our new wheels.

"It has helped give us a common interest as well as us providing a much more efficient service.

“We'd like to thank Georgina for helping us and getting us these bikes!"
