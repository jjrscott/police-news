We’ve released an image of a man who sadly died in Birmingham early this month, as detectives launch a murder investigation into his death.

It was launched earlier this month after a man was found dead at his sheltered accommodation in Sorrel Grove, Erdington. A post mortem examination carried out on 15 October showed that Leonard Sandel, aged 67, died of a neck injury.

As part of our investigation, a 48-year-old woman and two men, aged 42 and 39, have been arrested on suspicion of murder. They’ve been released on police bail pending further enquiries.

We're appealing for anyone who saw Mr Sandel at a cash machine on Tyburn Road earlier this month

The CCTV image we’ve released shows Mr Sandel using a cash machine on Tyburn Road on Monday 3 October, at around 7:30pm. We’re appealing to anyone who may have seen him to get in touch. We need to understand his whereabouts as we believe he may have been killed that day.

Mr Sandel’s family have said that he will be sadly missed.

Detective Inspector Michelle Allen, from our homicide team, said: “Mr Sandel’s death is very sad. We’re working hard to determine exactly what happened to him.

“While the arrests are a significant development in our investigation, I still need to speak to anyone who may have seen Mr Sandel before he died, possibly on the Tyburn Road on 3rd October, or around his home in Sorrel Grove. I’m also asking anyone who was driving through this area on the evening of the 3 into 4 October to check their dashcams. Please contact my team as soon as possible if you have any information that may assist us."

Anyone with any information is urged to contact us via Live Chat on our website, or call 101 quoting log number 2246 of 7 October.
