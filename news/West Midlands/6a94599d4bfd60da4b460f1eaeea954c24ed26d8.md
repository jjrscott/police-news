We seized five off-road bikes yesterday (20 Sept) after the police helicopter tracked a group of reckless riders in Birmingham.

An off-road bike was spotted by the local neighbourhood team in Aldridge Road shortly after 1pm carrying a pillion passenger; it failed to stop for officers and continued to ride on the wrong side of the road and on the pavement.

A police helicopter sighted the pair and tracked them into Netherhall Park in Great Barr where the officer found more off-road bikes.

A 28-year-old was also detained on suspicion of dangerous driving, failing to stop and driving with no insurance or licence.

The helicopter also spotted a 15-year-old dangerously driving in Kingstanding. The teenager attempted to run off but was quickly caught and detained on suspicion of driving with no insurance or a licence.

The teenager and a 28-year-old man have both been released but will appear before court at a later date.

Police seize five off-road bikes in Great Barr

Traffic Sergeant Mitch Darby , said: “We take people riding these off-road bikes illegally incredibly seriously.

“We know not only how much of a nuisance they are to residents, but also potentially very dangerous to other road users.

“This action last night, will hopefully send a message to those thinking about illegally riding these bikes on our streets as our work to tackle these issues continues.

“We will have an increased presence of police motorbikes around the force area for the rest of the week and will not hesitate but to seize any bikes being ridden illegally”
