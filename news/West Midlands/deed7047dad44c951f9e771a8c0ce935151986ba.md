We seized drugs and searched for weapons after responding to your concerns in and around Halesowen.

Our neighbourhood team co-ordinated a day of action on Thursday (27 August) after listening to issues which worried and frustrated you.

Following your intelligence, we recovered cannabis and drug paraphernalia from an address in Drews Holloway . Enquiries are on-going around this.

We set up a knife arch near the townâ€™s bus station, while a police dog was on hand to sniff out anyone believed to be carrying drugs.

We carried out searches in open spaces to ensure the area was safe from weapons, and also worked with a Speedwatch group in Halesowen North where 26 drivers were caught speeding.

As part of the wide-ranging activity, we arrested a 32-year-old man for failing to appear at court on suspicion of assault.

The day of action involved teams from other areas of the force, our fantastic Street Watch volunteers, and other partners including Halesowen BID and National Express.

Sergeant Jenni Griffin, from the Halesowen neighbourhood team, said: "The focus of the day was to tackle the use of drugs, knife crime and further speak with our communities.

"We want people to feel safe in Halesowen hopefully reassure them we are doing all we can to reduce crime and anti-social behaviour."
