A prominent drug dealer we helped put behind bars last year is now significantly poorer after we stripped him of his ill-gotten gains.

Mohammed Osman was given a 15-year jail term in September for drug dealing.

We raided his home in Beacon Street, Walsall, in the early hours of 5 April 2019 and found 2.5kg of heroin valued at £67,000, plus almost £10,000 in cash and a loaded handgun hidden under the cooker hood.

This cash was seized from his house under the Proceeds of Crime Act

A further £36,000 in cash was seized from a house in Moncrieffe Street, Walsall, which was also linked to Osman.

Following his conviction we started proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act and at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Friday (26 June) we secured a Confiscation Order against him for £146,356.68.

We’ve already taken almost £46,000 from him − that’s the cash found at both addresses − and the rest of the debt will hang over him when he is eventually freed from prison.

We found 2.5kg of heroin valued at £67,000 inside his home in April 2019

We can go back to strip him of any cash or assets he comes into until the full amount is repaid.

Detective Constable Rob Gough from our Economic Crime Unit, said: “We’ve delved back into Osman’s bank records over several years to identify any suspicious credits.

“He was not able to account for deposits totalling £33,411 − and as he can’t show that money has been accrued legitimately it’s considered ill-gotten gains through crime or drug dealing.

“The total value of the drugs we recovered was just over £67,000 − which means the Confiscation Order we secured was more than £146,000.

This loaded handgun was found hidden under the cooker hood

“Our investigation isn’t over and we will continue probing any money or assets linked to him. It’s important we show that crime doesn’t pay and that we will work to strip offenders of cash or property they have gained through crime."

Osman had previously admitted possessing a prohibited handgun and ammunition, possessing drugs with intent to supply and CS spray.

We always take information passed to us seriously so if anyone suspects someone is dealing drugs in their community, or has access to firearms, the please let us know so we can take action.
