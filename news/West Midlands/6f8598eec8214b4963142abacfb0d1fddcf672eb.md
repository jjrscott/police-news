One of our enthusiastic and helpful Sandwell police Cadets has been helping local care home residents this Christmas, by offering them a hand of friendship.

Chloe Ashman, who attends Bristnall Hall Academy School in Oldbury was one of the only young people who applied for funding from Building Blocks this year to help people in the community.

She came up with the idea of getting parcels made up for elderly people in care homes, particularly Ash Lodge in Smethwick, so everyone would have something to make them smile this Christmas.

It’s been a difficult year for everyone and Chloe wanted to show care home residents that they are not alone.

Last week, our Sandwell Partnerships team and Chloe’s head teacher attended the care home with Chloe to hand deliver the packages containing care items and adult colouring books designed by another local hero, Steve Tidman.

We managed to secure 90 colouring and painting books from local charity Creative Collective CiC, who kindly donated their stock for free.

Chloe’s school head teacher is immensely proud of her work and Kully Uppal, Principal of Bristnall Hall Academy, said: “It’s amazing to see the great work of our police Cadets still continuing, despite the obvious and unfortunate restrictions due to Covid-19.

“In particular, Chloe’s bid to support some of our most vulnerable members of society is truly uplifting and befitting of what our Christmas spirit should be all about.

“This initiative, supported by our friends at the local charity Creative Collective CiC, will help ensure residents of the local care home will benefit from 90 colouring and painting books.

“What is truly inspiring about this is that our children and young people want to help make a real difference in their communities; all of us within our Bristnall Hall Academy family are extremely proud.”

Chloe even went to the trouble of making sure each resident received a hand written Christmas card. The cards were written by local primary school children and police officers.

Ash Lodge care home staff were overjoyed with the donation from local people and agencies coming together and took the time to speak with Chloe – in a socially distanced and safe manner!
