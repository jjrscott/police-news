A pub doorman is critically ill in hospital after being hit on the head with a brick.

The victim was working at the Oak Inn in Coventry’s Far Gosford Street in the early hours of this morning when he was attacked.

A grey Seat Leon pulled up outside the venue at around 12.45am before one man got out and hurled the brick.

It struck the 28-year-old on the head and he is currently in hospital having undergone emergency surgery.

The doorman was attacked at around 12.45am - did you see anything?

Detective Sergeant Aman Hundal has urged anyone who witnessed what happened or was in Far Gosford Street and saw the Seat Leon to get in touch.

He added: “The victim has suffered a serious head injury…we need to find the men responsible for this violent assault.

“We have seized CCTV which shows the offenders arriving and leaving in a grey Seat Leon which had the number plates removed.

“There were quite a few people nearby and I really need them to get in touch to tell me what they saw. And I would also ask taxi drivers and other motorists in the area to check dash-cam footage to see if they have caught the offending vehicle on camera.

“There will be people in Coventry who know who is responsible for this. People who were on a night out last night and have access to a grey Seat Leon.

“The victim is fighting for his life in hospital and I would urge those people to do the right thing and contact me.”
