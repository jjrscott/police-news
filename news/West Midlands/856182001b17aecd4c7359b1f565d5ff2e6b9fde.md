A Leicester man has been jailed for 12 years after he broke into a house in Birmingham then raped and sexually assaulted a woman.

Jason Murty, from Irwell Close, subjected the woman to an 11 hour attack on the 20 February earlier this year.

He kicked, punched and spat at the woman and threatened her with a drill bit before he wrapped his hands around her neck in an attempt to choke her.

Murty, who had been out drinking earlier that evening, eventually passed out, giving the woman an opportunity to call for help. The 41-year-old was arrested and the woman was immediately safeguarded.

At Birmingham Crown Court last Friday (21 August) Murty was found guilty of rape, sexual assault and causing actual bodily harm.

As he was sentenced to 12 years in prison, Judge Buckingham told Murty that he had shown ‘a total lack of regard for women’.

Detective Inspector Dave Sproson, from the force’s Public Protection Unit, said: "I applaud the victim’s bravery and welcome the lengthy jail sentence handed to Murty.

“I hope this may start to give the victim some kind of closure and a sense of justice.”
