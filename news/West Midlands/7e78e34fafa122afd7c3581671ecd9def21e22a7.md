We’re appealing for witnesses to a Birmingham collision that’s left a young boy seriously hurt in hospital.

It happened just before 7pm yesterday (29 July) in Debenham Road, near Laxton Grove, in Yardley when the seven-year-old was hit by a Mini.

The boy became trapped under the car and we understand members of the public helped lift the vehicle to free the youngster.

He has suffered a serious head injury and remains in hospital in a critical condition.

The 63-year-old driver of the car – a blue Mini Cooper – remained at the scene and is helping with our enquiries.

Detective Sergeant Paul Hughes, from our Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: “A young boy has been critically injured and his family are clearly devastated. We have specialist officers supporting them at this difficult time.

“We are urgently appealing for anyone with information who hasn’t already spoken to us to make contact. We are particularly keen to hear from anybody who witnessed the collision or may have CCTV or dash-cam footage.

“I would also ask that people do not speculate on the circumstances of the collision. It does not help the family or ourselves as we work to establish the facts.”

Information can be given by contacting collision investigators on FL_COLLISION_INVEST@west-midlands.pnn.police.uk or via Live Chat at west-midlands.police.uk between 8am and midnight. Quote log 3897 of 29/07/20.
