Just days before Christmas we’re again warning delivery drivers and postal workers after a recent spike in robberies.

We’re working hard to reduce these crimes and find those responsible, but we need your help.

If you are robbed, or witness anything, it’s really important that we receive timely and accurate information about what happened. This increases our chances of finding those responsible and ultimately a successful prosecution.

We appreciate it’s a really busy time, but there have been a few occasions where delivery drivers have left their car running while dropping a parcel off − unfortunately the car has been taken by opportunist thieves.

We understand the temptation to report this as a robbery - often for insurance purposes - however this diverts the focus of our investigation. It is also a criminal offence to provide false information and sadly we’re having to deal with several matters as perverting the course of justice.

Just yesterday, we received a report where a driver reported the robbery of his van which he told us involved weapons and violence. Further enquires and witness reports suggest that the keys were left in the ignition and the thief simply drove off.

We’re committed to supporting victims of crime and finding those responsible we’d encourage you to be vigilant and report any suspicious behaviour and take a moment to consider the following advice.

• Don’t leave engines running or vehicles unlocked
• Never leave the keys in the vehicle
• Secure your vehicle every time, no matter how short your stop will be
• Be aware of your surroundings
• Put your own safety first

We are working with delivery companies to share crime prevention and safety messages so that we can all receive the parcels we have ordered. And we have increased patrols in areas where crimes have happened.

Any suspicious behaviour can be reported via Live Chat at www.west-midlands.police.uk between 8am and midnight or by calling 101 anytime.

In an emergency always dial 999. To remain anonymous please contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
