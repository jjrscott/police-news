Today new Government legislation has been announced meaning organisers of unlicensed music events and street or house parties of more than 30 people could face fines of £10,000.

Ahead of the Bank Holiday weekend our officers are preparing to respond to calls for service should any of these events be reported to us.

Chief Superintendent Claire Bell said: “We understand that people want to have fun, but we are in a pandemic situation and the spread of Covid-19 is still a very real threat.

“Not only are you risking catching or spreading the virus to family and friends, the larger scale events are generally unlicensed and not risk assessed, meaning emergency services could have difficulty getting to someone in need. Many of these events have seen criminal behaviour including disorder, drug dealing and possession of weapons. Is it worth the risk?

“We aim to target the organisers of these events who face having their equipment seized as well as a hefty fine.

“We take no pleasure in breaking up parties, but these are Government regulations to control the spread of Covid-19 and we must all play our part to help the country get back to a new normal."

Over the last five weekends we have been called to a staggering 825 events with most shutting down after advice from our officers. In only a handful of cases has enforcement been necessary.

This week a Disruption Notice has been issued to a Birmingham woman thought to have organised several music events in the city recently. Glossy artwork on social media promised food and drink on sale at a secret location which would be announced shortly before it began this weekend. These events have now been cancelled.

And a restaurant in south Birmingham has been given a Direction Notice by Birmingham City Council after several reports of wedding receptions and large parties at the venue, as well as no regard for social distancing between tables, entrance queues and waiting areas. Eight confirmed cases of Coronavirus have been linked to the premises and the owner faces a fine or even closure if restriction are not adhered to.

Ch Supt Bell added: “As with the last few weekends, we will have extra officers working this weekend to respond to calls from the public, so I am urging everyone to think twice about their plans if you are considering holding or attending an event of more than 30 people.

“We don’t want to be your uninvited guests, but we will be enforcing the regulations."

The Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner, Waheed Saleem said: “It is vital that people stay safe over the bank holiday. People should be able to enjoy themselves in a way which ensures that the virus can’t spread.

“We’ve had a large number of illegal gatherings and raves over the past few weeks which can pose a real threat. These events are an ideal place for the virus to spread in large crowds as well as being a hub for other criminality.

“I would urge anybody considering attending a large gathering or rave to think again. Police have powers to fine organisers of these events £10,000 and attendees can also receive a penalty notice."

We’re continuing to urge people to inform us if they hear of plans for large gatherings, we rely on information from you so we can act upon it. You can contact us via Live Chat on our website or by calling 101.
