    We were called to break up 96 parties and meet ups throughout the West Midlands which included up to 100 people at Babbs Mill Park in Solihull.


    The majority of calls were for smaller groups which were quickly disbanded after officers advised on the risks of spreading the deadly virus.


    Chief Superintendent Claire Bell said: &quot;We acted on information we received from our communities to break up and disperse illegal gatherings throughout the West Midlands.


    &quot;While we didn&#039;t see hundreds gathering like in previous weekends, it&#039;s important to remember it&#039;s still illegal for meet ups and parties of more than 30 people.


    &quot;We always try to be proportionate with our response and, given the numbers at the majority of the gatherings, we were able to engage with people and remind them of the health risks.


    &quot;However, it remains as important as ever for people not to mingle in large groups, especially with strangers.


    &quot;We&#039;re already preparing for next weekend and the introduction of tougher powers against event organisers which we&#039;ll be looking to enforce.&quot;


    We continually need people to inform us if they hear of plans for large gatherings, we rely on information from you so we can act upon it. You can contact us via Live Chat on our website or by calling 101.'

We continued to break up and disperse illegal gatherings - which risk spreading CoVID-19 - during another busy Saturday night across our region.

We were called to break up 96 parties and meet ups throughout the West Midlands which included up to 100 people at Babbs Mill Park in Solihull.

The majority of calls were for smaller groups which were quickly disbanded after officers advised on the risks of spreading the deadly virus.

Chief Superintendent Claire Bell said: "We acted on information we received from our communities to break up and disperse illegal gatherings throughout the West Midlands.
