We’ve treated a teenager to a pre-Christmas surprise in recognition of the compassion and maturity he showed when rushing to the aid of a boy seriously hurt in a road collision.

Elijah Rama was in Wolverhampton city centre when he saw 11-year-old Ezekiel Reid hit by a taxi while crossing the street.

He suffered a badly broken leg in the collision which happened back on 15 November 2019.

A large crowd gathered at the scene but King’s Church of England School pupil Elijah made his way to the front to comfort Ezekiel and place his coat over the injured boy to keep him warm.

He moved onlookers away to make room for paramedics and even called Ezekiel’s mum to let her know what had happened and that he was in good hands.

_**Watch how we surprised Elijah at his school**_

We intended to present Elijah with a Chief Constable’s Young Person’s Award this year but CoVID-19 saw all our presentation ceremonies cancelled.

But we were determined to reward his kindness so worked with King’s Head of Year Kerry Taylor to arrange a surprise presentation in school.

The 15-year-old thought he was dialling into a careers talk but instead came face-to-face with our Assistant Chief Constable Mark Payne.

ACC Payne praised Elijah for his actions before Miss Taylor presented the award plus a sports clothing voucher for £60 as an early Christmas gift. Ezekiel also joined the virtual meeting to say his thanks.

“You might expect a teenager’s first reaction to reach for a phone and film the drama,” said ACC Payne, “but Elijah showed compassion and maturity beyond his years to help Ezekiel.

“He was very calm, managed the situation well and showed great care. In fact, all the attributes we look for in a police officer!

“Good deeds like this don’t go unnoticed by us; he’s a very worthy recipient of the award.”

Ezekiel was treated at Birmingham Children’s Hospital for a nasty leg fracture but thankfully has made a good recovery.

The Christmas gift was kindly paid for by the West Midlands Police & Crime Commissioner David Jamieson using money seized from criminals under the Proceeds of Crime Act.

Mr Jamieson said: “What Elijah did was nothing short of heroic. He was confronted with an incredibly challenging set of circumstances.

“Most 15-year-olds would not have had the courage or the calmness to get on top of a situation like this and help to keep another injured young person at ease whilst help was on the way.

“He thoroughly deserves this present and I am pleased that we have been able to use money that we have seized from criminals to put towards a gift for this very brave young man.”
