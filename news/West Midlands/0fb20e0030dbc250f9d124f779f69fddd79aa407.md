Our officers were out in force across Birmingham over the weekend as we launched a new offensive on gun crime.

Armed police and response crews teamed up with our Organised Crime Unit, including plain clothes ‘spotters’ looking out for anyone with gang links, as we made our presence felt in areas that have witnessed recent shootings.

Several vehicles and people affiliated with city gangs were stopped; two people were arrested on suspicion of drugs offences.

And the activity is set to ramp up throughout this week as we plan warrants and enforcement action on men we suspect are linked to firearms.

Armed police supported our work targeting gun crime in Birmingham over the weekend

Chief Inspector Phil Cape from the Birmingham Organised Crime Unit, said: “There was a lot of activity over the weekend. Lots of disruption work by our officers and interaction with men we suspect are linked to gangs and gun crime in Birmingham.

“This is just the start. We’re working on a series of enforcement opportunities over the coming days and weeks; no-one associated with gun crime in Birmingham will be able to sleep easily because we could be coming through their door at any time.”

Officers stopped a car in Rookery Road, Handsworth, on Saturday night and three occupants were arrested on suspicion of drug dealing.

A 36-year-old man from Great Barr was later charged with drugs possession; the two others were released without charge.

Another vehicle was stopped in Summer Hill Road that led to the arrest and charge of a 23-year-old Lozells man. It’s alleged he was found with two bags of cannabis hidden inside his boxer shorts.

There were no reported firearms discharges in the target areas over the weekend.

Chief Insp Cape added: “We’re aware of tensions between some criminal gangs…we’re responding by making sure officers are in the right places at the right times.

“It’s also vital we let law-abiding people know we're taking action and are here to help; we want them to see what we’re doing to protect people against those who pose a significant threat.

“If anyone has information that would help in our fight against gun crime then please get in touch; people can contact us anonymously.”

The West Midlands Deputy Police & Crime Commissioner, Waheed Saleem, said: “Operations like this are vital in the fight against gun and gang crime and I'm pleased to see the force taking tough proactive measures to keep our communities safe.

“I'm concerned about the recent rise in gun crimes and young people becoming involved in gangs. As well as action like this we need to make sure that we are doing everything in our power to make sure young people do not get involved in gangs and criminality.

“This is why our new report 'A Future Generations Deal' calls for a range of measures to ensure that young people can thrive after COVID-19 and find good employment, education and training.”
