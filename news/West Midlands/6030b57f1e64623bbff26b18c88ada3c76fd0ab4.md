We need to identify a number of witnesses to a serious collision in Birmingham city centre this morning (24 September).

A man seriously injured after being hit by a car in Holloway Circus Queensway at around 3.40am has tested positive for Covid-19.

From CCTV enquiries we believe there were a handful of people who were in close contact and assisted the man, who is in hospital with serious head injuries, until emergency services arrived.

A woman - also a pedestrian and known to the man - suffered a leg injury in the collision. It is not known at this stage whether she is also infected.

A police officer who was in close proximity of them is now self-isolating in accordance with protocols.

We urgently need the members of the public who were in contact with the man and woman after the collision at around 3.40am to identify themselves.

They are not only witnesses, but importantly need to follow Government guidelines when in close contact with confirmed Covid-19 cases.

Contact us via Live Chat, or by calling 101, and quote log 301 of 24 September.

An 18-year-old man arrested on suspicion of dangerous and drink driving remains in police custody for questioning.
