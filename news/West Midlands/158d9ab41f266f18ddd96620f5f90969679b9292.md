We've issued more than 100 fixed penalty notices after officers broke up an illegal rave despite being pelted with missiles.

We acted on information and discovered an unlawful music event being held in a disused warehouse in Birmingham last night (28 November).

Officers were pelted with bottles as they had to force their way into the illegal party in Bordesley Street, Digbeth, at around 9pm.

Someone also kicked out towards an officer but they were unhurt.
A 36-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of assault and since been released under investigation.

A search of the site saw us recover DJ equipment, Class A drugs and a knuckleduster. We're reviewing all footage but believe we've identified the organisers and looking at pursuing further action.

We were approached by a woman who suffered an ankle injury at the gathering - further highlighting the dangers of congregating at unauthorised events.

Chief Superintendent Andy Beard said: "This was not only illegal, but extremely dangerous for both those who attended and officers.

"It's extremely disappointing that some are still not grasping that such events only increase the risk of spreading a deadly virus.

"We're currently under national restrictions and the region will then go into the highest tier due to the number of Covid cases next week.

"It's unacceptable when people recklessly ignore the rules and put themselves and others at risk of catching the disease. It's also unacceptable that officers should be attacked while going about their duties.

"We've seized equipment, drugs and a weapon and we'll be looking to ensure there will be no repeat again."
