We’re appealing for information and dash cam footage after a pedestrian was seriously injured after being hit by a car in Solihull.

A 74-year-old man was struck by a black Nissan Qashqai while crossing Damson Parkway, near the junction of Lugtrout Lane, around 7.20am yesterday (Friday 24 July).

He remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition.

The 28-year-old driver of the car remained at the scene and is assisting with enquiries.

We’re still in the process of piecing together what happened and urge anyone who saw the collision, and has not already spoken to officers, to get in contact.

Contact collision investigators on FL_COLLISION_INVEST@west-midlands.pnn.police.uk, via Live Chat or by calling 101. Quote log number 619 of 24 July.
