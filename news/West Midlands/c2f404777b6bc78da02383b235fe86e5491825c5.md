Our officers have been spreading some Christmas cheer with hundreds of cards, gifts, toys and food parcels going out to residents across Birmingham and beyond.

As part of the force's regionwide Christmas appeal, officers and staff have been gathering in sackfuls of donations which are being handed out to those in need this festive season.

From little Niamh, pictured, whose police officer parents rallied their friends and family to join in and gathered up an amazing haul of food and toys to Molly and Megan, also pictured, who helped their gran, whoâ€™s a neighbourhood officer, write some of the 500 Christmas cards which we've given out to elderly residents in care homes around the city.

We've also been handing out toys to youngsters, including young patients at the children's wards in Birmingham's Heartlands Hospital, as well as those with their families living in refuges at this time of the year.

The thousands of food items, everyday essentials and treats which have also been donated, are being passed on to food banks and soup kitchens across Birmingham.

Among them are the soup kitchen at Villa Road Church and the food bank at #BalsallHeath Church Centre.
