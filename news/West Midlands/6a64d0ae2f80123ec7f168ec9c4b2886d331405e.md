Crime in the West Midlands fell over the last year, with big reductions in burglary and theft.

The statistics cover the 12 months ending in June this year, so include several weeks of lockdown, and show an overall drop in crime of five per cent.

Burglary of homes saw a drop of 23 per cent, while theft fell by the same amount.

There was no significant change in the number of homicides (50, compared to 52 the previous year), or violent crime resulting in injury.

There was a six per cent fall in the number of sex offences.

However, overall violent crime rose 17 per cent and there was a rise in public order offences and weapon possession.

Domestic abuse has risen by 31 per cent so far this year, with it currently making up 21 per cent of total recorded crime in the region.

Deputy Chief Constable Vanessa Jardine said: “While it’s always pleasing to see overall crime fall, this year has obviously been unique.

“We’ve all been spending far more time at home while we all do our bit to try to reduce the spread of coronavirus, and that has undoubtedly led to a drop in burglaries.

“We continue to see domestic abuse cases rise, and are working with partners to understand the reasons why the West Midlands is seeing rates climb higher than other similar areas.
“But it is reassuring that victims do have the confidence to come to us for help, and our dedicated domestic abuse investigators work tirelessly to ensure victims are safeguarded and offenders are brought to justice.

“We continue to take knife crime and youth violence extremely seriously. We’ve invested dedicated resources in the areas which have the highest knife crime rates, within Birmingham, Coventry and Walsall, and our work with partners and schools is ongoing.

“Targeted patrols, weapon sweeps and searches have increased the number of weapons we’ve recovered, and we are developing ways to ensure those most likely to get involved in knife crime are given support before they go down that dangerous path.

“The weeks and months ahead will be challenging as we continue to enforce the coronavirus laws, but the public can help us by sticking to the rules and guidelines so that we can focus on tackling the crime that causes the most harm to communities."
