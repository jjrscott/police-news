Birmingham officers recently visited the Stockland Green Action Group, a residential group who are cleaning up their community, to see how they can work together to tackle local issues.

The group, made up of residents from Kings Road, Queens Road and Frances Road, have been established for three months with the aim of creating a safer environment.

They have spent weeks cutting back shrubs, installing gates and litter picking to create a more open and safe space in their alleyways and were only too proud to show off their hard work to local officers, PCSO Wayne Potter and Sgt Deb Gilbert.

The neighbourhood team are now looking at ways they can work closely with the group to tackle other issues such as drug dealing and anti-social behaviour.

Sgt Deb Gilbert has praised the work of the group: “This community has come together and really achieved a lot in such a short space of time.

“It’s so rewarding to see people taking such pride in their local area and the space really does look so much better.

“We are looking forward to developing a further partnership, and hopefully set up a local Street Watch with the group to continue to create a safer community.”
