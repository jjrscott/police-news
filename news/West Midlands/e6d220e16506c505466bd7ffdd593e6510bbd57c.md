We arrested a man in the early hours of this morning (30 June) in connection with a series of arsons in Coventry.

Fire crews alerted us to two wheelie bin fires at around 3.30am in Shorncliffe Road and Dovecote Close – both in the Coundon area of the city which has seen several fires in recent days.

The arsonist has targeted several wheelie bins in Coundon

Officers were deployed to the area and minutes later spotted a man nearby matching the description of a suspect sought over the arson attacks.

One bin fire spread to a house causing extensive damage

The 40-year-old, from the Coundon area, ran off but was chased down in Holyhead Road where he was arrested.

He remains in custody today for questioning over the arsons, including a bin fire last week (25 June) that saw flames spread to a house and cause significant damage.

Coventry Police Chief Inspector Paul Minor, said: “These fires are causing great concern in the local community; they are senseless acts and ones that can have tragic consequences.

“The attacks were happening in the early hours of the morning and mainly in Coundon. We focused our overnight activity in the area and got officers quickly to the scene this morning when we were alerted to two more bin blazes.”

Fortunately no-one was in the Lavender Avenue property when it caught fire last Thursday but the blaze still caused damage estimated at several thousand pounds.

Wheelie bin fires had previously been reported in the early hours of Tuesday morning (23 June), including ones in Lavender Avenue, Redesdale Avenue and Banks Road which resulted in a car catching fire.

And a tree was also set alight in Browett Road on the same morning.
