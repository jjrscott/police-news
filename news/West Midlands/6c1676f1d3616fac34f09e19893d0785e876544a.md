Weâ€™ve launched a murder investigation after a body was found at a recycling unit in Warwickshire on Friday 21 August.

We were made aware that a freezer - transported to a waste management centre in Colliery Lane, Exhall - had been opened and the body of an elderly man had been discovered. The freezer had been moved from a flat clearance by a housing association in Birmingham.

A post-mortem examination is due to take place tomorrow (Wednesday 26 August) which will help identify the man.

Today (Tuesday) a 50-year-old man, who is believed to have been known to the victim, has been arrested on suspicion of murder and taken into police custody in Derby.

Enquiries continue and anyone with information is asked to contact us via Live Chat at www.west-midlands.police.uk 8am - midnight or call 101 anytime. Crimestoppers can be called anonymously on 0800 555 111. Quote log 2654 of 21 August.
