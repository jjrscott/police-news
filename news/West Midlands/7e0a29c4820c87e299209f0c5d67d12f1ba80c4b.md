Two men have been arrested overnight as officers continue to crack down on car cruising in Birmingham.

An unmarked traffic car on patrol spotted a group of five vehicles driving erratically and in convoy around Heartlands Parkway, with large groups of spectators lining the streets.

Officers pursued one of the cars, which reached nearly 80mph in a 40mph zone. The driver, a man in his 20s, was arrested for breaching a civil injunction currently in place around car cruising.

He has appeared before Birmingham County Court today (23 October) and has been released on bail to appear at a later date.

We were then alerted to reports of up to 80 boy racers in Nechells in the early hours of this morning.

We spotted a motorbike, being driven dangerously on the wrong side of the road and at excessive speed in the Saltley area of the city.

Traffic officers pursued them for a few minutes, before the police helicopter took over and guided officers on the ground to a wooded area nearby.

A 26-year-old man was found hiding in woodland after hiding his bike under a tree. The bike was seized for no insurance and he was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and failing to stop for officers.

He has been released from custody while investigations continue.

PC Paul Brant from Central Motorway Police Group said: “We want these arrests to be a warning to motorists that these injunctions are very much still in place across the West Midlands.

“We take car cruising incredibly seriously, it is not just the motorists that are a hazard, but spectators too. Lots of people on the streets, making noise and encouraging these drivers become a nuisance for residents and we will take action against anyone choosing to partake in the activity.

“We are committed to tackling this issue as we know many people are concerned about this anti-social and dangerous activity. We carry out regular operations across the force in response to concerns raised by communities.

“I urge anyone who hears of plans for car cruise meets, to inform us. Your information can help us to stop these from happening."

The High Court order bans people from taking part in car cruising, including speeding, racing and driving in convoy, performing stunts and causing an obstruction on a public highway across Birmingham, Solihull and the Black Country.
