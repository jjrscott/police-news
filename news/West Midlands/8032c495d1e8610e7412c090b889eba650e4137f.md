What do you call a police officer with an owl on their head?

No…it’s not an early Christmas cracker joke but the surreal scene response cop PC Oscar Finney found himself in when reacting to reports of suspicious behaviour in the early hours of yesterday morning (21 Dec).

PC Finney was on patrol around the Brierley Hill area at around 2.20am when we received a call suggesting a man was walking another man on a lead!

The caller believed the pair were in danger of being hit by traffic as they walked in Hill Street.

PC Oscar Finney and the owl

However, Oscar found the men were taking a pet owl for an early morning stroll!

He said: “The bird was tethered by a piece of rope and perched on one of their shoulders - so from a distance it appeared that one man had a lead around his neck.

“I was patrolling in the area on my night shift so popped along to check out what was happening - and the next thing I knew the owl was on my head.

“One of the more bizarre jobs I’ve attended. I was there for just a few minutes and, after speaking to the men, continued on my patrols."

We felt it was only right to ‘tweet’ about the incident!
