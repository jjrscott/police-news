Today we’re entering a new phase of the restrictions put in place to tackle coronavirus. People are allowed to move around more freely than they have been, but still with some significant limits.

Our approach to the lockdown will not change – we will continue to use common sense and discretion. We’ll be engaging with people and explaining the rules, and encouraging them to follow them.

Enforcement will continue to be a last resort.

Fines have been increased, and will now start at £100, lowered to £50 if paid within 14 days. This will double on each further repeat offence up to £3,200. The increase in fixed penalty sends a clear message to the small minority who break the law, and to safeguard the country’s recovery.

The tremendous efforts of people in the region mean we have only had to enforce the Government regulations on a few occasions so far. We know the vast majority of people will continue to do their bit and follow guidance in this next stage.

We’re incredibly grateful for the support that the people of the West Midlands have given us over the recent weeks as well all work together to keep the region safe and healthy through this incredibly difficult time.
