We've charged two men with murder after a man was found fatally stabbed on the side of a busy Birmingham road.

Thomas Rogers was discovered near the junction of Bristol Road and Mill Pool Way, Bournbrook, at around 4.55pm on Saturday (22 August).

The 26-year-old was rushed to hospital but sadly pronounced dead not long after his arrival. A post mortem revealed he died as a result of stab wound to the chest.

Thomas Rogers

Detectives have now charged his brother Samuel Rogers, aged 30, of St Michaels Street, Sutton-In-Ashfield; Nottinghamshire; and Ryan Hurt, 22, of Peel Crescent, Mansfield, with murder.

They have been remanded to appear before Birmingham Magistrates Court today (25 August).

A 40-year-old man has been released with no further action. A woman aged 28 and 15-year-old girl who were previously detained have been bailed pending further enquiries.

Two women and a man - aged between 24 and 31 - were also arrested in the South Shields and Jarrow areas in the North East on suspicion of assisting an offender. They've been released under investigation.

Detective Inspector Stuart Mobberley, from our homicide team, said: "This remains a very active enquiry as we seek to establish the full circumstances around this stabbing.

"We've made quick progress but we still need to hear from anyone with information which can assist our investigation."
