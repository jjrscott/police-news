We've charged three men after a pensioner was knocked unconscious following a robbery in Coventry.

A man in his 80s suffered head injuries after being knocked to the floor in Cromwell Lane at around 12.45pm on Monday (21 December). An ornament was taken as his attackers fled in a car.

A vehicle matching the description was stopped in Bromsgrove by colleagues from West Mercia Police. A knife was recovered and three people were detained.

Shaun Jones, aged 35 of West Heath, has now been charged with robbery, possession of an offensive weapon and driving offences.

Matthew Ned (32) and Rickeal Manning (30), both of Bartley Green, have been charged with robbery and possession of an offensive weapon.

They appeared before Coventry Magistrates Court this morning where Jones was remanded in custody, and the other two bailed with conditions, to appear at Warwick Crown Court on 21 January.

The injured man has been discharged from hospital and is continuing with his recovery.
