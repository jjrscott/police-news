Two robbers who were involved in a £320,000 cash-in-transit crime spree have been jailed for more than 20 years.

We connected Giovani Garrick and Keenan Anderson to 11 cash box raids inside just three months, across mainly Handsworth and other parts of Birmingham.

A gang assaulted or threatened security drivers with weapons as they went to shops, post offices and other premises between April and July last year.

The robbers then fled in a waiting vehicle - which was different on most occasions to try and avoid being traced.

We launched a dedicated operation to catch those involved and CCTV and other enquiries identified Garrick and Anderson as prime suspects.

L-R Garrick and Anderson have been jailed for more than 20 years

After arresting the pair in August we carried out searches of addresses linked to them and recovered clothing matching the description on CCTV clips. We also found two axes in a property connected to Anderson.

The pair admitted conspiracy to commit cash-in-transit robberies and they were sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court on Monday (19 October).

Garrick , aged 23, of York Road, Edgbaston, was jailed for 12 years and 11 months; while Anderson, also 23, of Albert Road, Handsworth, was sentenced to 10 years and nine months.

Detectives are still trying to find another 23-year-old, Dante Kalsi, who is wanted for questioning over this series of robberies.

Despite a previous appeal for information on his whereabouts, he is still to be traced, and we need to hear from anyone who can help us locate him.

Detectives are appealing to trace Dante Kalsi

DC Tom Simpson, from force CID, said: “This was a sustained crime spree where security drivers were left fearing for their safety. Fortunately no-one was seriously injured but a lot of money was taken.

"We launched a dedicated operation to catch those responsible and enquiries established that Garrick and Anderson were involved. This was backed up by the

subsequent searches.

"They were not the only ones involved and we still need to trace Dante Kalsi for questioning. I would urge anyone with information to contact us via Live Chat, or by calling 101."
