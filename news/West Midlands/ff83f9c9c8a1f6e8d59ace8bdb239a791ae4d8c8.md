We’re appealing for the public’s help after a man was seriously injured during a suspected burglary in Wolverhampton.

We were called to Willenhall Road by paramedics at around 9.40pm yesterday to reports that a 28-year-old man had suffered serious electrical injuries following a break-in at an electricity substation.

He is in hospital in a critical condition today.

It is believed he may have been with two other men, who left the scene when paramedics arrived.

Insp Kate Longbottom, from Wolverhampton CID, said: “We believe that the injured man was using cutting equipment and came into contact with a live wire.

“We really need to trace the other two men who we believe left the scene when paramedics arrived.

“We also need to hear from anyone who may have seen anything suspicious in the area at the time to get in touch with us.”

Get in touch, quoting log 4938 of 24 November, via live chat at west-midlands.police.uk, by calling 101, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
