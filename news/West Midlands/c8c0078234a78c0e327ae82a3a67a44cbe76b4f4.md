The PC who was critically injured when he was run over by a stolen police car in Birmingham has returned to thank the hospital where his life was saved, by handing over money he raised by selling pin badges during his recovery.

PC Gaz Phillips suffered a head injury, internal bleeding and his spine became detached from his pelvis, which was shattered.

He underwent three rounds of emergency surgery - including the first operation described as “life-saving" - and spent four weeks in hospital.

Gaz, aged 43, of the Central Motorway Police Group (CMPG) returned to work earlier this year, doing half-days in the control room supporting colleagues in the CMPG, while his recovery continues.

Now he’s been back to the hospital to hand over £1,500 for Critical Care raised through the sale of badges of the CMPG mascot which Gaz and colleagues sold to the public and colleagues.

The CMPG’s mascot, a bear, was originally drawn by children’s book illustrator Peter Scott. Gareth got in touch with Peter whilst he was in hospital and Peter re-drew the mascot, but this time as an injured bear, complete with bandages and crutches.

Gaz said: “It’s a bit strange [coming back to the hospital], the first time I’ve been here for 12 months where I’ve not been operated on or treated. It’s nice to meet the staff again. It’s lovely to give the money over to the hospital charity.”

Critical Care sister Ann O’Meara said: “I looked after Gareth when he first came in, so straight after surgery when he was sedated and ventilated, so it was just really great to see him progress. It’s just fabulous to see him today looking so well.

“Any donation is fantastic. It will just mean we can buy stuff that will be beneficial for the patients and the staff and make their stay in hospital a bit easier and a bit nicer. We’re so grateful to the people who donated. It means a lot to the people who work here.”

Gaz presented the cheque to University Hospitals Birmingham Charity, which funds equipment, research and training beyond the scope of the NHS and also supports the military patients treated at the QE.
