Police searching for a suspected killer have arrested a man in a Staffordshire village this morning (30 Oct).

A manhunt has been underway for 38-year-old Anthony Russell since the bodies of Julie Williams and her son David were found in separate flats in Coventry earlier this week.

A woman’s body, found yesterday in woodland in Newbold Comyn near Leamington, has also been linked to the other two murders. She has now been formally identified as 31-year-old Nichola McGregor from Leamington.

Officers on patrol discovered the suspect in a red Ford C-Max car, stolen in a car-jacking in Leamington on Wednesday afternoon, in a country lane in the village of Rolleston-on-Dove around 4am. He has been arrested on suspicion of murder and robbery in relation to the car. He will be questioned later today.
