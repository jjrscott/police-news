Over the past few weeks we have been hosting hate crime events run by Communities Inc across every area in our force to help participants with how to intervene when they see hate crime incidents taking place.

The idea of the Stand By Me events is to give people the knowledge and courage to step in when they witness something they don’t agree with in public and to help people in need.

On Friday 11 September, we hosted the event in Sandwell for local residents to attend West Bromwich police station. We ensured the station conference room was Covid secure with spaced out chairs and sanitisation points. We asked for masks to be worn and utilised the track and trace facilities.

We were happy to see 15 students from Sandwell College come along last week and learn from the input in West Bromwich, as well as numerous representatives from local charities, victim support groups, community members and Aston University students attending across the two weeks.

The day-long event equipped participants with an insight into what hate crime is, the impacts it can have, how it can be reported and how to intervene safely in person. They were also told how to support others as well as keeping themselves safe. Additionally, our officers were able to explain how the West Midlands Police hate crime app works and how to report incidents you see happening online.

Force lead on hate crime Chief Superintendent Mat Shaer, said: “Hate crime is something I feel we all need to help with destroying. We are hoping that each individual that takes part in these sessions is able to learn and create a culture shift within communities. We want people to become braver in standing up for others and showing support to those who need it.”

The Stand By Me sessions are designed to help us all show solidarity with one another and aims to be part of a national movement to make a real difference in challenging any type of discrimination. The Bystander Intervention training is delivered across all of England, Scotland and Wales. For more information, visit the Communities Inc website.

If you need to report a hate crime, you can do so on our website.
