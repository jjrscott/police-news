We seized a loaded revolver and arrested two teenage brothers during a raid in Birmingham this morning as we ramp up the pressure on city gangs.

Officers forced entry to a house in Handsworth just after 6am following intelligence linking the address to drug dealing and firearms.

A significant quantity of what’s believed to be crack cocaine was found in a bedroom, while a revolver containing two live rounds was also recovered.

Two brothers aged 15 and 17 have been arrested in connection with the finds; they remain in police custody for questioning.

We've taken more than 40 guns off the streets since April (stock image)

And in a separate operation we raided an address in Kenwood Road, Bordesley Green, suspected to be linked to a drugs supply network.

Two taser-type stun guns – both classified in law as firearms – were seized and a large stash of Class A drugs found inside a safe locked in a van parked on the driveway.

Another address in Parkfield Road, Alum Rock, is also being searched as part of the investigation.

Men aged 42 and 45 were arrested on suspicion of drugs supply and they also remain in custody for questioning.

Force CID Inspector Al Teague, said: “We’ve executed two very successful warrants this morning within the space of two hours. It’s seen us seize drugs valued in excess of £10,000 and take a loaded revolver off the streets.

“The gun has been sent for forensic examination and will be analysed by ballistics experts to determine if it can be linked to any reported shootings.

“We launched a fresh campaign against gangs and people linked to firearms last week and we’re seeing rapid results.

“Intelligence from the community is key to making our streets safer and taking dangerous criminals and drug dealers out of society.

“We really value information from the public and handle it with the utmost of confidence – so please get in touch so we can take action.”
