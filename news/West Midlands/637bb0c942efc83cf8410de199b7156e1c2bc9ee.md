Five people have now been questioned by police following an appeal for information into the disorder in Coventry city centre last Tuesday (9 June).

Two men, aged 29 and 33, were arrested on suspicion of violent disorder after seeing the appeal and handing themselves in. They have been released on police bail pending further enquiries.

A further three people who have been identified as a result of our appeal have handed themselves in and were voluntarily interviewed and released pending further investigation.

One of them has been questioned in connection with footage weâ€™ve received as part of the enquiry in which someone is heard to say a racist comment. This comment is being taken very seriously and forms part of our investigation.

If any further hate crimes are identified or reported we will take the appropriate action in order to bring the offenders to justice.

A silver baton that was seen in the footage has been recovered. A knife that was found in a nearby bin just after the incident has been submitted for forensic examination.

We continue to gather footage and information to identify all those involved in the disorder and establish exactly what happened and why and would urge anyone with information to get in touch.

Anyone who has any information can get in touch via Live Chat at west-midlands.police.uk, call 101, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. Please quote log 3390 from 11 June.
