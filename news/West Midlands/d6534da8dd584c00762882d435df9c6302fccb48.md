Weâ€™re appealing for information after a woman was assaulted on Reservoir Road in Edgbaston on Friday 29 May.

At around 9.15pm, the 29-year-old was sitting on a bench at Edgbaston reservoir with a friend when she was approached by a man who repeatedly kicked and punched her. Members of the public intervened and the woman ran off, with the man chasing her.

The man then further assaulted the woman and forced her into a car and made off. Fortunately she managed to escape, a short while after.

The man is believed to be known to the victim but we are keen to hear from anyone who might have seen anything to get in touch.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police via live chat or by calling 101 quoting 20BW/123805H/20.

To remain anonymous please call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
