We're appealing for information after a teenage girl was sexually assaulted and robbed on a canal towpath in Walsall.

The 14-year-old was grabbed by the throat on the pathway off Green Rock Lane, Bloxwich, at around 3pm yesterday (24 July).

The teenager was forced to the ground and assaulted before her attacker fled with a mobile phone, bank card and airpods.

He made off towards the canal bridge at Goscote Lane and we understand there were a number of people in and around the area.

We believe they may have seen the attacker either before or after the assault without realising his intentions and then actions.

He is described as white, around 40 years old, between 5ft 5-8ins tall, with a blond short moustache and tattoo sleeve.

He was wearing a black v-neck shirt with blue jeans and had a black balaclava pulled into a beanie hat.

Sgt Lisa Tibbitts, from our public protection unit, said: "This was a sickening attack which has left a teenage girl traumatised.

"We're supporting her through this and carrying out extensive enquiries, but we need your help to identify the attacker.

"We need anyone with information, however insignificant it may seem, to come forward as it could assist us in tracing him."

Contact us via Live Chat, or by calling 101, and quote crime reference number 20WS/173732U/20.
