We’ve launched an investigation after a fatal hit and run in Washwood Heath Road, Birmingham last night (Thursday).

We were called to reports of a serious collision involving a car and a cyclist just before 11.15pm.

Emergency services attended but despite being treated by paramedics the cyclist was pronounced dead at the scene.

We believe there were four men in the car at the time of the collision; all four fled the scene and efforts are underway to identify and trace the offenders.

The car, a grey BMW M135i registration LG20 MYB, has been seized for forensic analysis.

Investigators are also working to identify the cyclist, a black man believed to be in his 50s or 60s with long grey dreadlocks, and they are asking anyone who may know who he is to get in touch.

The road was closed in both directions while specialist reconstruction staff examined the scene. It has now been reopened.

Detective Sergeant Paul Hughes from the Serious Collision Unit, said: "I believe the man who has tragically lost his life in this collision may well be local and I would ask anyone who may know who he is to get in touch.

"My main priority right now is to identify the cyclist and ensure that his family are aware. I have made the decision to release his description now in the hope this leads us quickly to his family

"I would also urge the four men who were in the car at the time of this collision to do the right thing and come and talk to us.

"They clearly know what has happened and made a conscious decision to run away.

“There were lots of people out on Washwood Heath Road to celebrate Eid when the collision happened.

"I’d appeal to anyone who witnessed the collision and hasn’t already spoken to us, or has CCTV or dash-cam footage to get in touch."

The Serious Collision Investigation Unit can be contacted on email at FL_COLLISION_INVEST@west-midlands.pnn.police.uk, call 101 or Live Chat via WMP Online between 8am and midnight. Please quote log 5069 of 30 July.
