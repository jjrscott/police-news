The family of a man murdered in Sutton Coldfield last month are asking the community to respect their wishes for a quiet and peaceful funeral tomorrow (Tuesday).

Gary Warner, aged 31, was stabbed in the chest and tragically died from his injures on 31 October.

Gary’s funeral will take place tomorrow afternoon (24 November).

Gary Warner

His family are concerned that lots of people may go to the cemetery, after a vigil they held in Churchill Parade on 1 November, attracted a large gathering of up to 400 people and disorder broke out.

Gary’s mother, Collette, is urging people to respect their wishes for a quiet and peaceful funeral.

She said: “Thank you for the love, help and support shown by so many of our family, friends and the local community during this awful time.

“We are all devastated at our loss, Gary was a kind loving brother, son, nephew, uncle and friend. He had a zest for life and everyone who knew him loved him.

“We’re also eternally grateful to everyone who has donated money via just giving which has helped us give Gary the funeral and send-off he deserves.

“We’d respectfully ask that we’re allowed to have our service privately and peacefully and would ask people not to congregate or come to the crematorium.

“What happened at the vigil was deeply distressing for my family who are in pain and shock at Gary’s sudden passing.

“We need as a family to be able to put Gary to rest at peace. If people wish they can pay their respects by lining the street as Gary leaves our home, but we’d then like to be left in private.”

A man has been charged with Gary’s murder and is currently remanded in custody.

Gary’s family continue to be supported by our specialist family liaison officers and our thoughts remain with them at this sad time.
