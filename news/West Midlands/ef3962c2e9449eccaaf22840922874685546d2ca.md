Weâ€™ve arrested a teenage boy as part of our investigations into disorder involving fireworks in West Bromwich town centre.

We're investigating whether disorder in the High Street on Tuesday (20 October) is connected to similar nuisance the day beforehand.

On Monday, a 14-year-old girl was struck across the head with a firework in the High Street.

This was followed by lit fireworks thrown at officers and members of the public on Tuesday afternoon (20 October).

One of our officers was hit in the face with a firework but fortunately his injuries are not serious.

We acted on information and detained the 16-year-old from the Kingstanding area yesterday (22 October) on suspicion of assaulting the girl. He has been bailed while enquiries continue.

We have put additional officers on town centre patrols and are working closely with partners to prevent similar unacceptable disorder. We have seen no repeat since Tuesday.

Anyone with information is urged to contact police via Live Chat at west-midlands.police.uk between 8am and midnight, or call 101 anytime.

Crimestoppers can be called anonymously on 0800 555 111. Quote 20SW/256450T/20.
