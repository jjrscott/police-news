An 11-year-old girl who was seriously injured after being hit by a car in Coventry last week sadly died in the early hours of this morning.

She was struck by a Toyota Verso on Tamworth Road, near the junction of Waste Lane, at around 6.10pm on Thursday (22 October).

The girl was rushed to hospital where she sadly passed away this morning.

The 53-year-old driver of the Verso remained at the scene, but was not spoken to at the time as he required medical attention.

He will be spoken to in due course as we seek to establish the full circumstances of what happened.

The family of the girl is now being supported by specialist officers as our investigation continues.

Weâ€™re keen to hear from anyone with dash cam footage, or who was in the area at the time and has not spoken to us already.

Anyone with information can contact us via live chat on our website or by calling 101. Please quote log number 3979 of 22/10/20.
