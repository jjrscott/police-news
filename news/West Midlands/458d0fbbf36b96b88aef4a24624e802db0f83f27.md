    The PC was pushed onto the bonnet of the oncoming black Fiesta in Hermes Crescent, Wood End, at around 9.45pm yesterday (29 September).


    He was thrown to the floor but fortunately escaped with minor injuries as the car, later established to be on cloned plates, fled the area.


    The Fiesta had initially been spotted acting suspiciously in nearby Lambeth Close, prompting it to be followed by officers. The vehicle was found abandoned in Doncaster Close, Wyken, an hour later.


    We&#039;re keen to hear from anyone who was in the Wood End area around the time and may have dash cam footage. We are also trying to trace anyone who later saw anyone fleeing from the car.


    Detective Sergeant Ged Gray, from Force CID, said: &quot;It&#039;s through sheer fortune the officer was not seriously injured.


    &quot;After being followed into Hermes Close the driver tried to mount the kerb to get away. As an officer approached the car they were deliberately driven at and ended up on the bonnet.


    &quot;They were carried a short distance before being flung to the ground and the car was driven away.


    &quot;We really need to hear from anyone who saw anything and has not already spoken to us, or has heard anything since, which could help us catch whoever was involved.&quot;


    Anyone with information can contact us online via Live Chat, or by calling 101, and quoting 20CV/236235Z/20.'

We're appealing for information after a police officer was driven at by a stolen car during a hit and run in Coventry.

The PC was pushed onto the bonnet of the oncoming black Fiesta in Hermes Crescent, Wood End, at around 9.45pm yesterday (29 September).

He was thrown to the floor but fortunately escaped with minor injuries as the car, later established to be on cloned plates, fled the area.

The Fiesta had initially been spotted acting suspiciously in nearby Lambeth Close, prompting it to be followed by officers. The vehicle was found abandoned in Doncaster Close, Wyken, an hour later.

We're keen to hear from anyone who was in the Wood End area around the time and may have dash cam footage. We are also trying to trace anyone who later saw anyone fleeing from the car.

Detective Sergeant Ged Gray, from Force CID, said: "It's through sheer fortune the officer was not seriously injured.

"After being followed into Hermes Close the driver tried to mount the kerb to get away. As an officer approached the car they were deliberately driven at and ended up on the bonnet.

"They were carried a short distance before being flung to the ground and the car was driven away.

"We really need to hear from anyone who saw anything and has not already spoken to us, or has heard anything since, which could help us catch whoever was involved."
