We are investigating after a man died when he was hit by a car on Midland Road, Darlaston at 1am this morning (27 November).

We believe the car involved in the collision with the cyclist had been involved in a ram raid in Wolverhampton just over an hour before.

Officers on patrol spotted an ongoing ram raid at a Boots store on Dudley Street, Wolverhampton at 11.50pm on Thursday night.

A 22-year-old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of burglary. A police car was rammed by a red Vauxhall Corsa as it left the scene.

Over an hour later, a police car was in the Darlaston area when it came across the same Corsa which had collided with a cyclist.

The police car was not believed to be in pursuit of the Corsa at the time of the collision.

A 19-year-old suffered serious injuries, and sadly died at the scene.

His family have been informed and are being supported by specialist officers.

A 33-year-old woman was arrested at the scene on suspicion of burglary. Two other women, aged 21 and 39 and a 36-year-old man, were later arrested on suspicion of burglary and death by dangerous driving. They all remain in police custody today.

Inspector Chris Fox from force CID said: “This is a really complicated investigation and we are still piecing together the circumstances leading to the tragic death of a young man.

“Although we have made several arrests, we are still urging anyone with information on both the ram raid and the collision to contact us.

“The road remains closed as we conduct forensic examinations, and we thank everyone for their patience.”

Our professional standards department and the IOPC have been made aware as is normal procedure in these circumstances.

Anyone with information or dash cam footage is urged to contact us via live chat on our website or by calling 101. Please quote lot number 106 of 27/11.
