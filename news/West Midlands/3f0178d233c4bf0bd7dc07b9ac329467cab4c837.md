We are appealing for information after shots were fired at a property in Coventry overnight.

We were called to Tile Hill Lane, Coventry shortly before midnight last night (29 November) following reports gun shots were fired through the window of a house.

Fortunately no one was injured but there was damage to the window.

A scene was held for a forensic examination, but now we are appealing for any dash cam footage or CCTV to contact us, and anyone who may have seen someone run from the property and along Middlecotes.

We believe the suspect was then picked up by a dark coloured vehicle.

If you have any information, please contact us via live chat on our website or by calling 101, quoting crime reference number 20CV/295935B/20.
