There remains no hiding from our super recogniser PCSO Andy Pope - and he’s even managed to identify wanted people who were wearing face masks!

The coronavirus pandemic hasn’t prevented PCSO Pope from continuing to pick out crime suspects during 2020.

And this summer the 43-year-old sailed through the 2,000 mark for the number of suspects he’s identified - even managing to spot some suspects while they were wearing face coverings.

His talent for remembering faces has been a vital tool since 2012 and he is already eyeing up the next target of having spotted 2,500 within a decade.

Andy regularly patrols in and around transport hubs and the surrounding areas as part of the Safer Travel Partnership team.

Even with the public movement restrictions he has remained on the lookout for wanted faces he has the knack of remembering from CCTV, video stills and police briefings.

It has continued to keep him busy with hundreds of people spotted - with his eight year tally now standing at more than 2,100.

It also led to him being a finalist in the Against All Odds category of the Amplifon Awards For Brave Britons 2020. Winners in some of the other categories included Captain Sir Tom Moore and Marcus Rashford.

Andy said: "Although it’s been a year like no other, I’ve still carried on as usual with the same preparation coming onto a shift.

"I’ve made sure I’m fully updated on the images of people wanted by the force, and it’s paid off.

"I’ve even been able to spot some in Birmingham city centre while they’ve been wearing face coverings.

"I have been asked many times how, but it’s impossible to explain. It’s just an instinct that is the person and thankfully it’s proven right.

"The most important thing is being able to assist in catching criminals and keeping the public safe, especially given the year it has been."
