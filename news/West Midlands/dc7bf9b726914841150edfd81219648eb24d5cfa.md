We were called shortly before 9am following the collision between two lorries and a Citroen C1, between junction 9 for Wednesbury and junction 10 for Walsall.

Ms Kavanagh, aged 41, suffered critical injuries and was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

The drivers of both lorries stopped at the scene and are assisting officers in their investigation.
