Murtaza Nazir

His family have today paid an emotional tribute to him, saying: “Life as we knew it will never be the same. Our lives shattered and hearts broken.

“As a family we are united and trying to heal, but the process won’t be an easy one. As a family not only have we lost a father, husband, son, brother, we have lost our friend and protector.

“Everyone who knew him will have their own unique memory with him, and that, in these hard times will get them through it.

“All we request is for prayers for our loved one and for any videos circulating on social media to be taken down. We do not wish to see this distressing footage. These are difficult times for us and we hope people can show compassion towards our feelings.

“We thank the police and ambulance service for their assistance and are forever grateful. To god we belong and to god we shall return. Justice will be served. If not in this life then the hereafter.”

Detective Chief Inspector Scott Griffiths, from the force’s homicide unit, said: “This is a shocking crime that has resulted in a young father losing his life.

“I want to say thank you to the community who have really pulled together during this time and would urge anyone who has any information who have not yet spoken to us to get in touch.

“We are working around the clock to understand exactly what happened and find those responsible.”
