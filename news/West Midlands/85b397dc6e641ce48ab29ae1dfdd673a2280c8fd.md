We’ve launched a murder investigation after a man was hit by a car this morning (26 December), in Birmingham.

Ambulance colleagues alerted us after a man was found in Coton Lane, Erdington, with serious head injuries just before 6am.

Sadly the man, aged 28, died shortly after.

Detectives believe he was hit in a deliberate act by a car which fled away, an investigation is now underway to fully understand what happened.

Detective Sergeant Nick Barnes, from our homicide team, said: “My thoughts are with the family of the man who tragically died this morning.

“We’re in the early stages of our investigation and I’d urge anyone who witnesses anything who hasn’t yet spoken to us, or anyone with any information or dash cam footage to get in touch as soon as they can.

“A family have lost a loved one and we need to find out what took place and who is responsible.”

If you have any information please contact us via live chat on our website or call 101 quoting log number 688 of 26 December.
