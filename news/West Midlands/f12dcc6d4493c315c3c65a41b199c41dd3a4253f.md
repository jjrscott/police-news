As Walsall Superintendent Kim Madill leaves for pastures new, she reflects on her policing career and aspirations for her new role as Chief Superintendent in Dudley.

Kim, a keen runner, wife and mother of two children, has served West Midlands Police for 23 years. Having decided she wanted to be a police officer aged 10, she was a member of the junior crime prevention panel while at school and then became a special constable in Staffordshire during her time at university.

Taking inspiration from her uncle who joined the cadets when she was growing up, and also from her grandad, who was a local councillor, Kim’s always had a desire to be involved with communities and make them nicer, safer places to live.

She fondly remembers being posted to Walsall when she first joined as a PC and recalls that on one of her first shifts, on New Year’s Eve, she arrested a drunken man.

Kim has relished her more recent time at Walsall as part of the senior leadership team, responsible for local policing in the borough.

A big believer in prevention, Kim has worked closely with partners and the violence reduction unit to progress their collaborative work to reduce violence amongst young people, by trying to get to the root of behaviours, such as poverty, abuse and lack of educational opportunities. While this work is very much ongoing, Kim hopes to continue this in nearby Dudley.

Although sad to be leaving Walsall, Kim is excited about her new role and can’t wait to get to meet her new teams and residents of Dudley.

Kim, who describes her role in policing as a ‘privilege’, is delighted on her promotion and hopes it inspires other women within the organisation and people who may be considering joining to follow her lead and get involved.

She said: “This is my dream job, I’m immensely proud of what I do and cannot wait to get to Dudley where I hope to deliver the very best service possible with the teams I have.

“I’m passionate about neighbourhood policing, it’s at the heart of our communities, and we can achieve so much when we work together. I’ll be initially focusing on getting to know everyone and the area, before looking at how we tackle violence and also addressing public perception around fairness and legitimacy in policing.

“Sally Bourner who recently retired was a much-loved character and a superb leader, I hope to maintain and build on the wonderful relationships she had in place.

“I’d urge anyone who is interested in a career in policing to take a look at our website. It’s a fantastic and varied career and we pay you while you study for a degree! We’re hoping for a more diverse workforce which better reflects the communities we serve. We’d love to your fresh ideas and enthusiasm, and in return you get to see many interesting areas of the force while you train.

“While my work life is busy, it’s varied and I get to meet the most fantastic people. My family are proud and I still have time to enjoy family life. I’m also training for the half marathon which I hope to do next year to raise money for Motor Neurone Disease, after my colleague and wonderful leader, ACC Chris Johnson was diagnosed in 2018."
