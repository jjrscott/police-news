We arrested a kidnap suspect who’s alleged to have dragged a woman into a car after an extensive trawl of road cameras led us to intercept his vehicle.

It happened in Tower Street, Coventry, at 12.30pm on Sunday (27 Sept) when a member of the public reported seeing a crying woman being grabbed round the neck and abducted along with a young child.

The Ford Mondeo’s details – noted down by the alert caller – was circulated to our patrol units for observations.

Officers conducted enquiries at an address linked to the vehicle and found it had recently been sold – but they were able to find social media accounts linked to the buyer where images of the suspect were found.

All of our traffic cars are equipped with ANPR technology to identify uninsured cars or wanted drivers

And while they worked to identify the man, colleagues analysed Coventry’s network of road cameras in a bid to trace vehicle.

Yesterday officers acting on that intelligence were patrolling in the Wyken area of Coventry where the car was stopped and a man arrested.

The 24-year-old, who lives in Wood End, was arrested on suspicion of kidnap and the victim later found safe and well at an address in the city.

He was charged with driving without a licence and insurance – and appeared at Coventry Magistrates Court yesterday – and bailed in relation to the kidnap with strict conditions not to contact the victim.

Detective Inspector Chris Jones from our Public Protection Unit, said: “The 999 call was really worrying. We understood this to be a domestic incident and the concern was that if this man could display such aggression in public, what could happen behind closed doors.

“It was imperative we identified the suspect and woman as quickly as possible.

“The responding officers did a great job to gather quick-time intelligence on the car and suspect – and the analysis of road cameras helped us intercept it the following morning.

“The man has been bailed to give us time to complete ID parades with witnesses and gather more evidence. Referrals have also been made to children’s services.”
