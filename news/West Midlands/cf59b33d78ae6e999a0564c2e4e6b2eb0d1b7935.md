We are appealing for your help after a Solihull pensioner was attacked and robbed on his drive.

The 76-year-old man pulled up outside his house in Froxmere Close on Monday 14 December and, as he got out of his car, three offenders hit him over the head and demanded the keys to his blue BMW 540i xDrive M Sport estate.

They rifled through his pockets and took his wallet and bank cards before one left in a dark coloured Audi, driven by a fourth man and the other two drove off in the stolen BMW.

The victim was taken to hospital with a laceration to his head, but fortunately has since been discharged.

DC Amrit Nepaul, from force CID, said: “The consequences to this attack could have been much worse given the victim’s age so we are keen to hear from anyone who can help our investigation.

“We are exploring CCTV from the victim’s journey home as it appears he could have been followed by the Audi, which was on cloned plates."

Anyone with information should contact us via Live Chat on our website between 8am and midnight, call 101 anytime or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting crime reference 20SH/310993L/20.
