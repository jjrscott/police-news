We're appealing for witnesses to disorder in a Wolverhampton street yesterday (22 December) to come forward.

We were called to reports of a fight between two men in Lime Street, Penn Fields, around 4.20pm.

A 36-year-old man was found with minor stab wounds to his neck and leg, and cuts to his face and chest.

He was taken to hospital for treatment and then subsequently arrested on suspicion of affray. He remains in police custody for questioning.

We're still trying to trace a second man who is also believed to have injuries. A golf club is also understood to have been used as a weapon during the disorder.

DC Jemma Follows, from force CID, said: "We're still in the process of piecing together exactly what happened yesterday afternoon and to trace another man who we believe also suffered injuries.

"We've reviewed CCTV and there appears to have been a number of people in the area who saw what happened. We really need them to come forward to help our investigation."

Anyone with information can contact us via Live Chat, or by calling 101, and quote 20WV/319479D/20.
