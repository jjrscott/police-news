One of our newest recruits is looking forward to fulfilling his boyhood dream of being a police officer... and provide proof that persistence pays off.

Ryan Dean suffered rejection in his initial pursuit of becoming a cop but the disappointment made him even more determined to achieve his ambition.

The 23-year-old has since been given an opportunity with us and successfully qualified as a Police Community Support Officer (PCSO) last year.

The Wolverhampton-based officer has now passed his PC assessment and is due to start in the new role next month.

Ryan is urging others to follow their policing career dreams - and not to be deterred if at first you don’t succeed.

He said: "I initially applied to join another force in 2017, but unfortunately didn’t make it. To be a police officer has always been a dream and it was a big blow at the time.

"But I went back to my role in the construction industry even more determined to do all I could to fulfil my ambitions. I made a vow to myself to work as hard as possible and become the best police officer I could if given the opportunity.

"I made the plunge again when I saw West Midlands Police were recruiting for PCSOs last year which I thought would give me a great insight into policing, improve my skills and give me a better chance of landing a role as a regular PC. I really threw myself into PCSO training. I started with the Low Hill neighbourhood sector in Wolverhampton last autumn and have really enjoyed it.

"It’s been great to get involved in the communities as a PCSO and rewarding to be able to make a difference.

"I’ve learned so much in a year and felt ready and prepared to become a PC. I was delighted to be accepted and can’t wait to begin the new role.

"Everyone has setbacks throughout life and I’m proof that if at first you don’t succeed, try again."
