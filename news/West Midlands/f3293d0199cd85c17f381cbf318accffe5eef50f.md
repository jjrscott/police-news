We are investigating a fatal collision in Kenilworth Road, Knowle, just after 9.30pm yesterday (Monday 23 November).

A 15-year-old boy who was driving a silver Renault Clio sadly died at the scene after the car flipped onto its roof. His family is now being supported by specialist officers.

A female passenger, also 15, was treated at the scene before being taken to hospital. Her injuries are not believed to be serious.

The driver of a second car, believed to be a grey Peugeot 206, has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He remains in police custody for questioning.

Detective Sergeant Paul Hughes, from the Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "This is an extremely tragic incident and our thoughts go out to the family of the young man involved.

"We are in the early stages of our investigation and still need to gather all available evidence.

"With this in mind I would ask that people do not speculate on the circumstances of the collision, especially on social media.

"This does nothing to help our investigation or support the families and others involved."

If anyone witnessed the collision or has dash cam of the vehicles just before and they have not yet spoken with police we would urge them to get in touch.

Anyone with information is asked to contact us via Live Chat at west-midlands.police.uk between 8am and midnight, by email at FL_COLLISION_INVEST@west-midlands.pnn.police.uk or call 101 anytime.
