We've launched a murder investigation after the discovery of a woman’s body at an address in Coventry.

Julie Williams, 58, was found at her flat at Emily Smith House, Riley Square, Coventry, just before 11pm yesterday (Sunday) after concerns were raised for her welfare.

The cause of her death is yet to be established, and a post-mortem is due to take place tomorrow.

Officers are also trying to find her son, David Williams, 32, who lived with his mother.

He was last seen on 20 October and then reported missing to police on Saturday evening (24 October).

Mr Williams is being treated as a missing person, and is not a suspect in his mother’s death.

Missing: David Williams

Det Insp Jim Mahon, from our Homicide team, said: “We’re still trying to establish exactly what happened to Julie, and are working to understand if her son’s disappearance is in any way linked to her murder.

“We’d ask for anyone who has seen Mr Williams over the last week, or who saw anything suspicious at around Emily Smith House in recent days, to get in touch.”
