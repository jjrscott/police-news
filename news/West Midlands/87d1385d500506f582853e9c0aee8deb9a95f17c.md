We are appealing for information following a carjacking in Highbury Park, just off Shutlock Lane in Moseley, on Monday 22 June.

At around 4.15pm a woman was returning to her black Land Rover Discovery Sport when she was approached by two Asian men.

One of the men pushed her to the ground and grabbed her by the throat, demanding the car keys before fleeing in the car.

Fortunately the woman was not seriously injured but was shaken by the incident.

If you recognise the men in the footage or have any information, we urge you to contact us via Live Chat at west-midlands.police.uk between 8am and midnight, call 101 anytime or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting crime reference 20BE/144169F/20.
