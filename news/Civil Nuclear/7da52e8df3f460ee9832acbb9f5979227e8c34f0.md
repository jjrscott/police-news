Officers from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC) played an important part in an EDF security awareness day in Hunterston last month, ensuring staff on site are aware of the CNC and the role officers play in keeping them safe.

CNC officers were on hand to run a stand at the security awareness day, with PCs John Dickinson and Lee Leyland facilitating a show and tell of all the equipment Authorised Firearms Officers have to carry on patrol. This proved very popular with visitors, who were keen to get up close to some of the kit on show.

Chief Constable Mike Griffiths and his staff officer Insp Sheree Owen were also on site during the event and went along to support it, with the Chief Constable meeting Station Director Colin Weir.

Over 250 people attended the event and EDF Security Manager for the site, Neil Hutchinson, thanked the CNC for the great support they provided. He said: “I believe the event here at Hunterston was a great success, with well over 250 attendees and a fantastic representation from our Management Team. I was thrilled to get such great support from CNC and Police Scotland.”

Chief Constable Mike Griffiths said: “I was pleased to attend this event while visiting the Hunterston site and was impressed with how the CNC worked with EDF staff from all departments to make sure the day was interesting and informative.

“Every community in the country has a neighbourhood policing team, which are the ‘bobbies on the beat’ for their local area and I think it’s important that the staff who work on the sites see us as their local officers. Awareness days like this allow us to show them what the role of the CNC is to protect the site as part of the site security regime.”
