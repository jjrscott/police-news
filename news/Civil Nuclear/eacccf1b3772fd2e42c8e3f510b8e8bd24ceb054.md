The Chairman of the Civil Nuclear Police Authority, Sir Philip Trousdell, is delighted to announce the appointment of Kenneth Kilpatrick to the role of Business Director.

The Civil Nuclear Constabulary is an armed police force, keeping the nation safe from harm by securing the integrity of civil nuclear material. It has a workforce of 1500 officers and police staff and an operating budget of £100m. The Business Director will provide leadership of the Constabulary’s core finance, planning and performance and procurement, facilities and estates and IT functions.

Sir Philip Trousdell said:

> Kenneth is an experienced chartered accountant who currently leads the CNC’s Finance, Planning and Performance Department. He has a wealth of experience that I believe will be core to meeting the future challenges the CNC will face, he will play a key leadership role in the senior executive team and I look forward to working with him.

Kenneth Kilpatrick said:

> CNPA is constantly having to evolve to face the challenges in a changing industry and I feel very fortunate to have been appointed Business Director and to be in a role where I can help set the direction for the committed police officers and police staff to deliver their core mission and protect the civil nuclear industry from terrorist attack.

Kenneth will take up the role on 29 September 2014.
