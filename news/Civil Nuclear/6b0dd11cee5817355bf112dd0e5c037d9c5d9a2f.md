Sgt Andy Bailey and Senior Project Manager Sarah Charters both received commendations for their roles in the Griffin Park Tactical Training Centre project. Both Andy and Sarah dealt with a number of challenges that the project presented with professionalism, dedication and integrity throughout.

Clare Chambers, Health and Safety Advisor, was commended for the part she played in supporting and delivering health and safety advice at an strategic, tactical and operational level during an unprecedented global health pandemic. Clare’s hard work and dedication has helped ensure CNC employees stay safe.

Chief Constable Simon Chesterman said: “It was a privilege to recognise the excellent work and commitment of these three members of staff in ensuring that the CNC continued to deliver our vitally important Mission.

“It was good to be able to thank them personally for their achievements and I am extremely proud of them and all of our employees for continuing to ensure nationally critical infrastructure, and ultimately the general public, remain safe.”
