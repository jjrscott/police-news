On Sunday 18 June, Supt Glenn McAleavey, PC Amanda McAleavey and PC Andrew Bailey swam 2.4 miles, cycled 112 miles and then ran a marathon (26.2 miles) around the Lake District to raise nearly £1,500 for Cancer Research in memory of PC Phil Mitchell.

Phil, aged 54, sadly lost his battle with cancer in July last year. He joined the CNC in September 2012 and served as a firearms instructor at Sellafield, having previously served 30 years as a firearms instructor with West Yorkshire Police.

Glenn finished the gruelling challenge in 12 hours 34 minutes, Andrew in 13 hours and 28 minutes and Amanda in 13 hours 32 minutes.

Supt Glenn McAleavey said: “We are all proud to have completed the triathlon, in respectable times too, and we’ve just about recovered! Finding enough time for training on top of our CNC roles and our other commitments was a struggle but something we were determined to do and I am pleased we have raised some money in Phil’s memory for such a worthwhile cause.

“Phil lost his battle with cancer after a courageous fight and he had such a positive impact on people as a friend, colleague and teacher, so it was a pleasure to complete the challenge in his memory. I hope we have shown Phil’s family just how much he is still missed by his friends at CNC.”

Andrew Mitchell, Phil’s brother, said: “Congratulations on your outstanding efforts. The family are touched and feel that Phil would be proud to have such true friends, although he probably would have said that he could have beaten you!”

There is still time to sponsor Glenn and the team, please visit their (Just Giving page)[https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/Glenn-McAleavey1[ to donate to Cancer Research.
