The Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC) provides a dedicated site armed response capability for the nuclear industry, with operational and support units based at licensed nuclear sites, and is looking to recruit a new Assistant Chief Constable.

The CNC has a work force of 1,500 officers and police staff and an operating budget of Â£100 million, is nationally based and is currently going through a major transformation programme designed to drive people, process and systems improvement to support the operation. We are looking for an Assistant Chief Constable that is able to bring a track record of dynamic and innovative leadership within an operational armed police setting, with the ability to engage effectively with a wide range of stakeholders and partners.

You will bring substantial firearms command experience in the rank of Chief Superintendent or above together with a successful track record of managing police officers and police staff and ideally, counter terrorism experience. Whilst it is not an essential requirement, it would be seen as advantageous for you to have successfully completed the Strategic Command Course.
