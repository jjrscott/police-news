The visit to the site, which is just up the road from the school, saw the Year 4 pupils take a tour around the Dungeness B interactive exhibition centre and the power station to learn about where their electricity comes from.

The eight and nine year olds were able to see the top of the two reactors and the turbine hall, where enough power for over 1.5 million homes is generated.

They then met with officers from the CNC, who explained about their role in protecting the site and showed them their police kit, before the pupils had the chance to try on some themselves, including body armour and police hats.

Insp Mike Wilkinson, Operational Unit Commander at Dungeness B, said: “This was great to get an opportunity to meet the children after their tour of the station.

“As well as learning about where their electricity is generated and see some impressive sights like the turbine hall, we then had the chance to get to spend some time with them and help them understand the importance of police work at the site.”

Steve Coates, plant manager at Dungeness B, said: “At EDF Energy we welcome many schools into our power stations. The feedback we receive from teachers is that the visits engage students in STEM [Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths] and bring a new dimension to the subjects they study at school.”
