CNC Temporary Assistant Chief Constable (T/ACC) Duncan Worsell has received an MBE from His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales during an investiture at Buckingham Palace.

The award was in recognition for T/ACC Worsell’s services to policing.

Duncan has worked for the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC) for over 25 years. For the last five years he has been responsible for a complex operational division containing over 800 police officers and staff, based at high profile sites such as Sellafield and Dounraey, as well as four EDF nuclear power station sites.

Speaking after the investiture Duncan said: “I am delighted and very proud to have received this award. It is an enormous privilege to be one of the leaders of the CNC. I have the pleasure of working with some fantastic people, and this award is also recognition for the hard work they display on a daily basis.”

Duncan’s entire career has been spent in public service. He began his working life at 17 and prior to joining the CNC served with the Royal Navy.
