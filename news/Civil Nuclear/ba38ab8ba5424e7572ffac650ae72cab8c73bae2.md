A new Director of Corporate Services takes up their role at the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, with Patsy Northern joining our Executive Team.

Patsy joins us from the Ministry of Justice and has spent the last 20 years of her career working in senior roles in government, including at HM Prison Service; Department of Health and Social Care; and HM Court and Tribunals Service. Her background is extensive in the areas of commercial, commissioning and leading complex and novel projects and programmes and organisational change.

The post of Director of Corporate Services will oversee Finance and Business Efficiency, Procurement, Estates and Facilities, IT and all commercial activity for the CNC, as well as leading on the development and implementation of the Business Strategy.

Patsy Northern said: “I am really excited to join the CNC and look forward to working with an organisation that has so much to be proud of and so much potential. I am pleased to have the opportunity to play a part in an organisation with such a vital role in protecting national infrastructure and counter terrorism.”

Chief Constable Simon Chesterman said: “It is my pleasure to welcome Patsy to her new role and am confident that she will prove to be a valuable member of my Executive Team. She has a wealth of experience to bring to the CNC and I am confident she will make a real contribution to the organisation.”
