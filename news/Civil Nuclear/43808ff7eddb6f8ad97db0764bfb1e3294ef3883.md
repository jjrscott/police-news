The Society of Occupational Medicine (SOM) has recognised the CNC with a special commendation for an Outstanding Contribution by an Employer to Workplace Health and Wellbeing in their inaugural Occupational Health and Wellbeing annual awards.

The awards, which took place in Bristol, recognise organisations and individuals who have made workplace health a priority in their day to day operations and the CNC was one of only six organisations and people recognised by the society.

Richard Saunders, Director of People and Organisational Development said: “This special commendation is testament to the importance that the CNC places on employee health and wellbeing, and the investment that it has made in developing the holistic internal occupational health and wellbeing service that is available to all our employees.

“Our aim now is to build on this award and ensure that employee health and wellbeing is recognised as the ‘golden thread’ that runs throughout all that we do in the CNC.”
