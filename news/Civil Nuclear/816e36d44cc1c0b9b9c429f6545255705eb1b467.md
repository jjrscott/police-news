From:
 Civil Nuclear Police Authority and Civil Nuclear Constabulary

As an armed police force carrying out a vitally important infrastructure role in policing, the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC) is looking for people to join us as Authorised Firearms Officers at several of our sites across the country.

As a serving or retired member of the Armed Forces, you have a wealth of experience and skills and are used to carrying out a vitally important role.

Have you thought about the CNC as a career?

We have recently launched a dedicated military area on our jobs website where you can discover more about what we offer and read case studies from our officers who have joined us after serving in a variety of roles in the military.

We play a vital role in counter terrorism and offer world-class firearms training to our officers. We can help you continue to develop the skills you already have while developing new ones. And all in an environment you’ll be familiar with and while continuing to be an important part of protecting the country.

We are proud to hold a Bronze Award in the Armed Forces Covenant Employer Recognition Scheme (ERS) and are currently working hard to achieve our silver.

The ERS recognises the commitment and support that UK employers offer to defence personnel. The Bronze Award is given to organisations who have pledged to support the armed services, have signed the Armed Forces Covenant and promote that they are armed forces friendly and employ reservists, armed forces veterans, cadet instructions and military spouses and partners.

If you haven’t thought about a career with the CNC before, whatever your background, then visit our cnc.jobs website to find out more. #ExceptionalAwaits
