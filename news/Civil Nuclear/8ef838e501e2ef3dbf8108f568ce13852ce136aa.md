New CNC jobs website launched

Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC) Chief Constable Mike Griffiths, CBE, has launched a new CNC recruitment website.

The website gives an insight into what it’s like to work for the UK’s most unique police force.

The new website has been designed to highlight the wide range of career opportunities available within the CNC. It also provides applicants important information and advice about entry requirements and enables them to apply for roles in the CNC across the UK.

CNC Chief Constable Mike Griffiths said: “We attract people from a diverse range of career paths and backgrounds and this new website reflects our values and culture very well.

“The website allows people thinking about joining the police a chance to explore what we can offer them, and what we want from them.

“On the website some of my colleagues describe what they do on a day-to-day basis and this gives potential applicants a good insight into the sort of work we do.

“The CNC operates across the UK and the website allows potential applicants a chance to explore what each location has to offer them and their family.

“We are always on the look-out for talented people who want to make a contribution to keeping the country safe. If you think this could be you, have a look at the website and find out.”

The CNC has 1,500 officers and staff and is responsible for protecting civil nuclear facilities in the UK and nuclear material in transit. All the CNC’s frontline police constables and sergeants are armed.
