 Civil Nuclear Police Authority and Civil Nuclear Constabulary

PC Darryl Street was based at our Sellafield Operational Police Unit and tragically died as a result of a collision on the A66 near Baron’s Hill.

Darryl joined the CNC in October 2019, after serving in the Cumbria Police force for a number of years. He took part in our first ever Transferee Course and was an excellent officer, who was a popular member of the Sellafield unit. He will be much missed by all who knew him.

Chief Constable Simon Chesterman said: “Darryl was a dedicated and committed police officer, who had spent years of his life serving and protecting the community. Although we only had the pleasure of his experience and commitment for just over a year at the CNC, his loss is keenly felt by all of his colleagues and friends.

“Our deepest condolences go to Darryl’s family for their loss. Both the CNC and the Civil Nuclear Police Federation remain in close contact with them and will continue to offer support and any help we can at this extremely difficult time.”

The investigation into the cause of the collision is being carried out by Cumbria Constabulary, who will also be releasing a tribute to Darryl from his family on their website
