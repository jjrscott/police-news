Not many women would be brave enough to shave off their crowning glory for charity.

But then Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC) police constable Elaine Rosie is no ordinary woman.

Elaine, who has been a PC with the CNC for 27 years, cut off her ponytail so a wig could be made for a child with cancer and then shaved the rest of her hair off to raise money for Maggie’s Highland Cancer Centre.

Family, friends, CNC colleagues and Dounreay staff supported her through donations to enable her to raise an impressive £4,070. The money will allow Maggie’s to support more and more cancer affected families throughout the Highlands.

Elaine’s colleague Karen Tadd knows how important that support is. She has survived cancer twice, and Maggie’s Highland supported her and her family through a very difficult time.

Karen and Elaine would like to thank everyone who kindly donated and supported Elaine’s Big Shave. It’s not too late to donate, you can still support this fantastic cause through Elaine’s Just Giving page
