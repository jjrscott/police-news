On 19 June 2014, pupils at Pennyland Primary School in Thurso, Scotland, met with officers from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary to learn more about the role of the police. The class had been working on a project entitled “people who can help us” and the CNC were happy to help.

During the visit, the officers spoke of the differences between the CNC and the local Police Scotland force. Inspector Adam Shone who was one of the officers in attendance said:

> Many of the children are aware of the Nuclear site the CNC protect at Dounreay, as being a big local employer, a lot of their parents and family members work there. It was great to get an opportunity to help them understand the importance of police work, and to assure them that their parents and other workers on site are protected by the CNC.

During the visit the children tried on police hats, jackets and various other police kit, as well as having the opportunity to sit in a CNC patrol vehicle where they had the chance to turn on the lights.
