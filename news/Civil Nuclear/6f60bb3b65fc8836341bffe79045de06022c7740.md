As the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC) celebrates its 10th year since being formed on 1 April 2005, an officer has received a Chief Constable’s commendation for raising over £70,000 for charity over the decade.

Sgt Neill Dearden is the training supervisor for all CNC training courses for new recruits and has been involved in every training course since the very first one was run in 2005.

During this time, he has overseen the training and development of over 1,100 new recruits and has encouraged each class of recruits to take part in a charity event of some kind, providing a real team building opportunity as well as raising funds for local and national charities.

Fundraising events which Neill and recruits have taken part in during the decade include a bike ride to Paris; the Coast to Coast challenge; climbing Mount Kilimanjaro; the Ridgeway and Thames Path walk; climbing Scafell Pike six times; stretcher carrying through Cumbria, and numerous 1,000 mile challenges, half marathons and 10K runs.

Commending Sgt Dearden for his efforts, Chief Constable Mike Griffiths said: “I was proud to be able to acknowledge all the hard work Sgt Dearden has put in over CNC’s first decade by, not just in training our recruits to become part of the CNC family, but also in raising over £70,000 for charity.

“His dedication in giving up his free time to arrange and take part in these charity events while encouraging others to raise money in their own time for a number of excellent causes is an example to us all.”

Sgt Dearden said: “Although I am delighted to receive a commendation from the Chief Constable, I wouldn’t have been able to continue to fund raise without the support of the CNC and the willing participation of the 1,100 plus recruits I have had the pleasure of working with over the last 10 years’.

“Each and every one of them should be incredibly proud of their achievements.”

Some of the recipients of Sgt Dearden’s fundraising have included; the British Heart Foundation; Mencap; Help for Heroes; National Police Memorial; National Police Treatment Centre; Cancer Research; Child Brain Injury Trust; Great North Air Ambulance; Chiltern Air Ambulance; Helen and Douglas House; 42 Commando Memorial Appeal; West Cumberland Hospital Children’s Ward; St Bees Lifeboat; St Bees Scouts; Moor Row Primary School; Abingdon Riding School for the Disabled; Wantage Silver Band; Stanford Pre School; Oxford Animal Sanctuary; and many other local causes.
