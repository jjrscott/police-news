Vic Emery OBE, the Chairman of the Civil Nuclear Police Authority (CNPA), is pleased to announce that the appointment of Industry Member Gwen Parry-Jones OBE has been extended for a further two years. The extension was approved by Minister for Energy and Industry Jesse Norman in May.

Gwen Parry-Jones joined the CNPA Board in June 2014 and the two year extension means she will now be in post until 31 May 2019.

Vic Emery OBE said: “I am delighted that Gwen’s appointment has been extended. She has proved a valuable asset to the Authority since joining as an Industry Member and I look forward to continuing to work alongside her for the next two years.”

Gwen began her career as a reactor physicist and has since held a variety of positions within the nuclear industry. In 2007, Gwen became the Plant Manager for the Pressurised Water Reactor site at Sizewell B and in 2008, she was appointed as the Station Director at Heysham 1 Nuclear Power Station, being the first woman in the UK to hold either of these two posts.

Gwen subsequently undertook the role of Campus Project Director, to further develop the training and skills framework for EDF Energy. In 2012 Gwen returned to EDF Nuclear Generation as Safety and Assurance Director and is now Generation Development Director. She is also a Fellow of the Institute of Physics.
