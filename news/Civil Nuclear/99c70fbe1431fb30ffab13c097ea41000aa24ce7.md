Attacks in the UK and abroad remind us all of the terrorist threat we face, which in the UK is considered as ‘severe’, meaning an attack is highly likely.

Police and security agencies are working hard to protect the public but it is also important that communities remain vigilant and aware of how to protect themselves if the need arises.

This short public information film sets out practical steps that you can take to stay safe in the rare event of a firearms or weapons attack.

Read this leaflet with more information to help you stay safe.
