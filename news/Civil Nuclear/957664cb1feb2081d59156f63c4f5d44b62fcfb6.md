Ten CNC officers have begun a three month attachment to the British Transport Police frontline, providing additional visibility and patrols at key railway stations.

After receiving full training from BTP in their patrol strategies and procedures, the officers, all from the Strategic Escort Group, will spend the next three months working alongside the British Transport Police Firearms Unit in railway stations in the capital.

The arrangement is as a result of the Chief Constables of both forces working with the Association of Chief Police Officers (now known as the National Police Chiefs’ Council) to come to an agreement to supply the CNC constables while BTP review their own armed capability.

CNC Chief Constable Mike Griffiths said: “This is a great opportunity for our officers to increase their skillset and work in a different AFO role alongside colleagues in another national police force.

“Last year we sent 28 officers to support the NATO policing operation and this and the BTP attachment are both good examples of supporting our colleagues in Home Office and other national forces.”
