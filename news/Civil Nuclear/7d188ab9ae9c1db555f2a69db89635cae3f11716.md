The latest group of recruits to pass the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC) 16 week initial recruitment course have been welcomed into the CNC by Deputy Chief Constable Simon Chesterman at their graduation ceremony last Friday (11/11).

The newly qualified authorised firearms officers came from a wide range of backgrounds. Some recruits had previously served in the armed forces, while others have come from civilian backgrounds, such as property development, including one person who had re-joined the CNC after having previously left the force to join the British Transport Police several years earlier.

Deputy Chief Constable Chesterman said: “It is always a great privilege to welcome new recruits into the CNC.

“Passing this initial recruitment course is a significant achievement. The standards which recruits have to meet are challenging, firearms training is rigorous and must meet the national standards set by the College of Policing.

“Becoming an authorised firearms officer means you have to demonstrate a willingness and ability to put yourself in harm’s way to protect the public. Our training is designed to give our officers the ability and confidence to do this.

“I wish them the best of luck in their careers as authorised firearms officers in the Civil Nuclear Constabulary.”

All the recruits have successfully passed the CNCs rigorous 16 week initial recruitment course, which included an intensive nine weeks of firearms training and courses on English criminal law, Scottish criminal law, UK civil nuclear regulations, first aid and police procedures.

The newly qualified authorised firearms officers will be deployed at civil nuclear sites across the country.
