The Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC) has a new Assistant Chief Constable, with Louise Harrison taking up the role from Monday 17 February.

Louise has 27 years’ experience in policing, during which time she has undertaken a variety of uniformed and specialist-based roles. Her most recent role was as Strategic Regional Lead Officer within the Counter Terrorism North West collaboration for the Prevent strand of the CONTEST strategy.

Louise joins the CNC from Merseyside Police, where she had previously been a Strategic Firearms Commander and also the Local Policing Commander for the town of St Helens. Early in her policing career Louise served as a front-line authorised firearms officer and a sergeant in the mounted section amongst other roles.

CNC Chief Constable Simon Chesterman said: “Louise is a highly respected police officer and has a reputation for having an inclusive style of leadership, which will suit the CNC. I am delighted that such a high calibre officer has chosen to join the CNC and I am very much looking forward to working with her.”

Assistant Chief Constable Louise Harrison said: “I am delighted to have been given this opportunity to join the CNC. I had some experience of working with CNC police officers in my previous role during operation Temperer and I was impressed with their professionalism and positive attitude. The CNC is a great organisation and I look forward to helping the force achieve its ambitions.”
