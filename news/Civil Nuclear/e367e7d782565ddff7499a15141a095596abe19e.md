 Civil Nuclear Constabulary and Civil Nuclear Police Authority

The Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC) has opened a Twitter account. @nuclearpolice is the CNCs Twitter handle. The Constabulary’s first tweet was to publicise the launch a new campaign to recruit police officers.

CNC Deputy Chief Constable Simon Chesterman said: “Having our own Twitter account will enable us to give the public more of an understanding of what we do.

“It will also help us to keep in touch with local communities and enable us to provide advice and share information with the public, as well as reach out to potential recruits.”

The new CNC Twitter account can be found on the handle @nuclearpolice.

The CNC is the armed police force in charge of protecting civil nuclear sites and nuclear materials in England, Scotland and Wales, who are governed by the Civil Nuclear Police Authority (CNPA). The CNC employ over 1,500 police officers and members of staff across the UK’s nuclear sites.

Working in partnership with the civil nuclear industry, national security agencies and regulatory bodies, the CNC will deter any attacker whose intent is the theft or sabotage of nuclear material and deny access to it. If material is seized or high consequence facilities are compromised the CNC will recover control of the facility and regain custody of the material. We police each nuclear site in line with Nuclear Industry Security Regulations.
