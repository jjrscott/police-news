The Civil Nuclear Police Authority (CNPA) held their Strategic Conference last month at Bisley training centre, near Brookwood in Surrey.

The conference, which takes place annually, is an opportunity for members of the board of the CNPA to discuss strategic issues affecting the Authority and the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC) and make vital decisions regarding the current position of the nuclear industry and its impact on the CNPAs strategic priorities for 2015/18.

Stakeholders of the CNPA were also invited, with representatives from EDF energy, the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority and the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), the CNPAs sponsoring government department, attending.

The stakeholders were given a guided tour of the facilities used by the CNC at the Bisley site to observe officers in training; this included a short presentation on the history of the Bisley site by Andrew Mercer, Group Chief Executive of the National Rifle Association, and a tour of the Short Siberia and Melville firearms ranges to observe officers in training.

The tour concluded with a visit to the newly refurbished Honourable Artillery Company building, where the group was given a presentation on the Strategic Escort Group and a demonstration on the Firearms Training Simulator.

The feedback from conference attendees was very positive and the input received during the tour of the facilities formed a useful background to discussions at the Strategic Conference that afternoon, where stakeholders also presented their view of the nuclear industry for the next 10 years and DECC updated on the Government’s energy policy.

The CNPA Chairman Sir Philip Trousdell said: “It was extremely useful for the CNPA members to watch some highly professional training and meet a cross-section of officers. It provided context for their strategic discussions later in the day and was a useful reminder of the high standards which the CNC consistently produce.”
