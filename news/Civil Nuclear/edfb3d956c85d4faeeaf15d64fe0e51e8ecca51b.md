 Civil Nuclear Police Authority and Civil Nuclear Constabulary

Sir Craig Mackey joined the Authority as an Independent Member in June after a long and distinguished policing career which saw him made a Knight Bachelor in the 2018 New Year Honours, having already received the Queen’s Police Medal in 2009.

His police career began in 1984 when he joined Wiltshire Constabulary, moving next to Gloucestershire Constabulary as Assistant and subsequently Deputy Chief Constable, before moving to Cumbria Constabulary as their Chief Constable. He retired from the Metropolitan Police Service in 2018 after a six-year tenure as Deputy Commissioner.

Sir Craig has a BSc. Hons degree in Economic and Social policy and a Postgraduate Diploma in Applied Criminology. He has extensive experience of major change and transformation programmes, as well as a strong background in providing strategic leadership and improving operational performance.

Vic Emery, CNPA Chairman, said: “I am delighted to welcome Craig to the Civil Nuclear Police Authority. He brings a wealth of experience and knowledge from several policing environments and roles and will contribute greatly to the Authority.”

Sir Craig said: “I worked closely with the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC) and Sellafield Ltd closely when I was Chief Constable of Cumbria Constabulary so already have knowledge of the nuclear industry and the unique policing role that the CNC carry out.

“I am pleased to be joining the CNPA as an Independent Member and look forward to working with them and the CNC to ensure their nationally important policing function is delivered.”
