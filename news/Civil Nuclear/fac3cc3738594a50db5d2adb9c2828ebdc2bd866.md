The Chairman of the Civil Nuclear Police Authority (CNPA), Vic Emery OBE, welcomes a new Authority member.

Sue Scane joined the Authority as an Independent Member in July.

In her career at Oxfordshire County Council Sue helped to get the Oxfordshire City Deal, which aims to maximise the science facilities throughout the county, including Harwell, Milton Park and Culham.

Sue is a Non-Executive Director of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) and serves on the boards of the Church of England’s Oxford Diocese and the Didcot First town promotion group.

Vic Emery, CNPA Chairman, said: “I am delighted to welcome Sue to the Civil Nuclear Police Authority. Her extensive experience and knowledge will contribute greatly to the Authority.”

Sue Scane said: “It is a great privilege to be asked to serve as a member of the Civil Nuclear Police Authority. I have spent most of my career in public service and this role gives me an opportunity to continue contributing by helping the CNC to carry out their vital role of keeping the public safe.”
