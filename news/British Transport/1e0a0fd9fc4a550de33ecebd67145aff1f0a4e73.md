Detectives are appealing for witnesses after it was reported a large group of football fans sexually assaulted passengers and were racially abusive on board a train from London to Worcester.

On 22 December a group of around 20 football fans boarded the 6.22pm Great Western Service from London Paddington and began to chant racially abusive comments in front of families and children.

They were also seen to sexually assault a number of women on board the train.

It is believed they were Chelsea fans.

The group, who were all men, left the train at Worcester.

Officers are appealing for anyone who witnessed what happened to get in touch so they can assist the investigation.
