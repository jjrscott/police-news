Assistant Chief Constable Sean O'Callaghan said:
"I'm confident that the public will act responsibly and comply with the requirement to wear face coverings on the rail network as we all try to control the spread of the virus. I reiterate that everyone should avoid public transport if at all possible. For those who do need to travel, our officers will continue to patrol the rail network and help keep passengers and rail staff safe. Our policing approach will remain the same - engaging with the public and encouraging them to follow the rules of the railway."

Further information

BTP has no powers regarding the National Rail Conditions of Travel, which is a contract between the train operators and the passenger travelling. If a passenger does not comply with the conditions set, the train company can refuse entry onto the service.

If our officers encounter passengers not wearing a face covering on the network, they will engage with passengers and encourage them to comply with the National Rail Conditions of Travel.
