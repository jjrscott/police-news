Detectives are appealing for witnesses after a disabled woman fell onto the tracks at Westbury station on Monday (16/09).

Officers received a report on 16 September that a woman had fallen onto the tracks in her wheelchair around 12.20pm that afternoon.

The 47-year-old woman from Herefordshire was taken to hospital by paramedics where she was treated for a head injury. She remains in hospital but thankfully her injuries are not life-threatening or life-changing.

Following further enquiries, a 48-year-old man from Herefordshire was arrested that evening (16/09) on suspicion of endangering railway safety.

He has been released on bail while the investigation continues.

Detective Constable Marc Farmer said: "We are currently working to establish the full circumstances behind how the woman came to fall on the tracks in her wheelchair.

"We know there were a number of people on platform three at the time of the incident who may have seen the woman in the minutes leading up to her fall.

"I'd urge anyone who hasn't already spoken to police to come forward and assist us with our investigation. You can do so by texting 61016 or calling 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference 305 of 16/09/19.

"Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
