The family of Gareth Delbridge, 64, who very sadly died on the railway at Port Talbot on Wednesday (3rd July) are today paying tribute to the 'most loving husband, father, brother and grandad.'

They said: "Gareth was the kindest and most loving husband, father, brother, grandad and great-grandad. He loved life, work and his holidays - but most of all, his family.

'"We are devastated to have lost Gaz in such tragic circumstances, and both he and Spike will be missed so sadly by all of their family and friends.

"We'd like to thank all of the emergency services , Tata Steel, and everyone else for their messages of sympathy and support at this difficult time.

"We would be grateful if people could not speculate any further on the incident and allow the investigation to take place, and give us the space and privacy we need to grieve our loved one."

Both the families of Mr Delbridge and Mr Lewis will not be issuing any further statements or comment to the press.
