Detectives are appealing for witnesses after a serious assault at Edinburgh Haymarket station last night.

Officers were called to Edinburgh Haymarket station at 9.55pm last night (20 February) following reports that two men had been assaulted on platform two.

Paramedics attended and a 58-year-old man was taken to hospital, whilst a 32-year-old man sustained facial injuries.

A man has been arrested and a report submitted to the Procurator Fiscal.

**Detective Inspector Brian McAleese from British Transport Police said:** "I would urge anyone who may have seen anything or the events leading up to this incident to get in touch with us as soon as possible to assist with our enquiries".

"You can text 61016 or call 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference 661 of 20/02/20. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."

**NOTE TO EDITORS** - Please note that this case is active for the purposes of the Contempt of Court Act 1981. On the recommendation of the Procurator Fiscal, please use this rather than our earlier appeal.
