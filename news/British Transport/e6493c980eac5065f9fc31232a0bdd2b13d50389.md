A 34-year-old woman, who was arrested in connection to the Nottingham station fire, has today been charged.

Gemma Peat, of Wilford Crescent, Nottingham, was re-arrested in Derby this morning (25/01) and interviewed in relation to the fire on 12 January last year.

After consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service, Peat was charged with one count of Arson with Intent or Being Reckless to Endanger Life. She has been remanded to custody to appear at Nottingham Magistrates' Court on 26 February.

Since the fire on 12 January 2018, detectives have worked continuously on the investigation and have conducted extensive enquiries, which have been supported by Fire Investigation specialists from Nottinghamshire Fire & Rescue.
