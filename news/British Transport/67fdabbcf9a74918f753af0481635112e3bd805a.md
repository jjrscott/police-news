Detectives investigating a stabbing at Clapham South Underground station are today renewing their appeal for witnesses.

On Friday 7th February at around 3.50pm, officers were called to Clapham South station following reports of a stabbing.

Paramedics also attended and a 16-year-old boy was taken to hospital where he received treatment for a number of stab wounds.

Thankfully, his injuries were not life-threatening, and he has since been discharged.

Enquiries remain ongoing, and there have been no arrests yet in connection.

**Detective Constable Mike Ganly said:** "This was a serious incident of violence which took place in the middle of the afternoon in a busy area.

"We know there were many people in the area at the time who may have seen something of significance, and I'd urge them to get in touch with us as soon as possible. Any information, no matter how small could be useful to our investigation.
