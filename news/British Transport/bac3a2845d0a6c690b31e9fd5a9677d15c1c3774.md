Do you recognise this man?

Officers would like to identify him after a 19-year-old woman was sexually assaulted at Bounds Green Underground station.

On 10th October at around 10.30pm, a man followed the woman onto the escalator and tried to engage her in conversation.

After moving away onto the platform, the man cornered the woman and sexually assaulted her.

Thankfully, the woman was able to board the next train and lose sight of the man.

Officers believe the man in the CCTV images may have information which could help their investigation.
