At just before 22.15hrs this evening (Friday 7 September 2018), BTP officers were called to an incident at Baker Street Underground Station.

It appears a lady was walking along the platform, pushing her child in a buggy, whilst looking up at the indicator board. She didn't realise how near she was to the edge of the platform and accidentally pushed the buggy wheels over it. She, the buggy and the child fell onto the track. The father jumped down to help them.

When they saw a train coming, all three were extremely fortunate in being able to move into a pit under the track and the train passed safely over the top of them.

Amazingly none of them were seriously hurt, but as a precaution they were taken to hospital for check-ups.
