BTP officers who arrested a man after tube passengers were threatened with a knife at Vauxhall station are appealing for further information.

The incident happened at 5am on Saturday 11 May.

Initially, a 21-year-old man from London was ejected from Lightbox nightclub in South Lambeth Place.

He then left the area but allegedly returned with a knife and threatened the club's doormen.

He is then reported to have travelled to the entrance of Vauxhall station where he threatened three members of the public with the knife.

Officers attended and arrested the suspect after searching the wider area. He was searched and no knife was found.

The man has since been released on bail until Wednesday 5 June with strict conditions not to enter the railway or attend Vauxhall station or Lightbox nightclub.

Officers would like to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident.

They would especially like to speak to anyone who witnessed a knife being procured near the nightclub or disposed of in the area.

Witnesses can contact BTP by texting 61016 or by calling 0800 40 50 40 and quoting reference 108 of 11/05/19.

Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
