Detectives are appealing for witnesses after a man and his daughter were assaulted at Buchanan Street Subway station in Glasgow last night (17/08).

At around 9.30pm, the victim, a 53-year-old man, was travelling with his daughter when a group of ten men began shouting abuse at them on the platform.

The victim was then assaulted, causing him to fall onto the tracks and lose consciousness.

His daughter, a 22-year-old woman, was also assaulted.

The first victim was helped up onto the platform by members of the public and taken to hospital by ambulance. His injuries are not life-changing or life-threatening.

His daughter also attended hospital to be checked over, and thankfully wasn't seriously injured.

The suspect is described as a white man in his late twenties, of medium build, and around 6ft tall. He was unshaven with dirty blonde hair, wearing a white t-shirt with an emblem on the sleeve and dark ripped jeans. He also had tattoos on his arms.

The group left the station at around 9.40pm from the North exit.
