Do you recognise these people?

Officers investigating an assault at Gloucester railway station are today releasing a CCTV image in connection.

At 11pm on Saturday 5 December, three people were waiting outside the station when they were approached by a man and a woman who pretended to steal the group's shopping bags.

When challenged on this, they became aggressive and assaulted the three victims. One of the victims, a woman, is reported to have been kicked by a group of people while on the floor.

Officers believe the people in the images may have information which could help their investigation.

If you recognise them, or have any information, please contact BTP by texting 61016 or calling 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference 662 of 05/12/20.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
