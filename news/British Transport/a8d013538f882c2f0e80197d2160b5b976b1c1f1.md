A serving British Transport Police officer has been dismissed without notice from the Force today (8 September) following a public misconduct hearing.

PC Mahbub Ahmed, based at Stratford station, attended the hearing at the PSD Rooms, on Toft Green, York, where he answered allegations that he breached the standards of professional behaviour, namely use of force and authority, respect and courtesy.

PC Ahmed was on duty when he had an altercation with a man in Westfield shopping centre on 4 June 2018, striking him with his baton and using captor spray. The independent panel found that his actions **_ _** were disproportionate and unjustified and as such amounted to gross misconduct.

**Detective Superintendent Peter Fulton, Head of BTP 's Professional Standards Department, said:** "PC Ahmed's actions were completely inappropriate, and he brought discredit on the service. The public expect our officers to uphold the law and protect them from harm, and PC Ahmed's actions threatened to undermine that confidence.

Officers are expected to **_ _**exercise self-restraint and use reasonable levels of force when it is appropriate to do so, however in this ** __** particular situation PC Ahmed's reaction was unnecessary and inexcusable. I **_ _**support the decision of the independent panel to dismiss him with immediate effect."
