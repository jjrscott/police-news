British Transport Police (BTP) is appealing for witnesses following a series of thefts from locations in and around Peterborough.

A blue generator and water pump were stolen between November 18 and November 19 from land near Hurn Road, Peterborough.

Tools and equipment were stolen between November 23 and 24 from land near Lincoln Road, Peterborough.

Over 700 metres of copper cable and machinery was stolen between November 27 and 30 from land near Bourne Road, Essendine, Stamford.

Enquiries into the thefts and whether they are linked are ongoing and investigators would like to speak to anyone who saw any vehicles or unusual activity in the area on the days in question.

Local households and businesses are asked to check their CCTV systems unless they have already been visited.

The total value of property stolen is estimated to be in the region of Â£40-50,000 and anyone offered tools, equipment or copper is asked to contact British Transport Police by calling 0800 40 50 40 or texting 61016.

Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111.

Officers are also asking any witnesses who have not already spoken to police to get in touch.
