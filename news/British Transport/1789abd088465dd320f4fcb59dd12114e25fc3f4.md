Do you recognise this man?

Officers investigating an incident where a private hire car driver was threatened with a knife are today releasing dash-cam footage in connection.

On 6 January at around 5.30am, a man ran towards a private hire car at Euston station and jumped over the bonnet and onto the roof.

The driver left the car in fear of his own safety, and the man jumped back onto the bonnet and tipped a packet of crisps across the vehicle.

He then entered the driver's side of the car, and the driver entered the passenger side to challenge him.

The man then pulled out a knife and made several attempts to attack the driver.

Thankfully, the victim was able to fend off the attack having taken the man's walking stick from him.

The man then ran off, stealing the victim's wallet which he'd taken from the car.

Officers believe the man in the dash-cam footage may have information which could help their investigation.
