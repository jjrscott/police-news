BTP officers investigating a failed attempt to set fire to a police car at Hull Paragon Interchange are today releasing CCTV images.

The incident happened at 1.15pm on Monday 1 April.

Two men are reported to have opened the fuel cap of the empty vehicle - which is owned by BTP - and put a lit cigarette in the fuel tank.

Fortunately, the car has a diesel engine and did not catch fire.

Officers believe the men in the images may have more information that could help their investigation.

Anyone who recognises the men is asked to contact BTP by texting 61016 or by calling 0800 40 50 40 and quoting reference 1900026748.

Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
