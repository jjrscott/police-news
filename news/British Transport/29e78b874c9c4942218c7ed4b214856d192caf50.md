Do you recognise these four young men?

Detectives investigating a robbery at Benfleet station would like to identify them in connection.

On 22 July at 6.20pm, four young men approached the victim and asked to ride his electric scooter.

As they were sat by the cycle racks, one of the young men showed the victim the handle of a knife and asked for his Gucci rucksack.

The victim, fearing for his safety, handed it over.

The group then boarded a C2C service towards Southend, taking the bag and the scooter with them.

Officers believe the young men in the CCTV images may have information which could help their investigation.

If you recognise them, or have any information, please contact BTP by texting 61016 or calling 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference 382 of 22/07/20.

Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
