Do you recognise these men?

Detectives investigating a knife-point robbery on a train East Sussex would like to identify them in connection.

On 18 November at around 11pm, the victim, a 17-year-old young man, was travelling on a train from Gatwick Airport to Preston Park.

He was approached by two men who tried to engage him in conversation for a short time. One of the men was noticeably intoxicated.

They became increasingly more threatening and reached into the victim's jeans as the train was approaching Burgess Hill, trying to take his wallet.

The victim put his hand on his pocket to try and stop them, and one of the men pulled up his top and told him he had a knife.

The victim handed over his wallet, and the man then took out the knife and told him to hand over his phone too.

The victim was threatened further as he left the train.

It's believe the two men boarded the train at East Croydon and left at Preston Park.

Detectives believe the men in the CCTV images may have information which could help their investigation.
