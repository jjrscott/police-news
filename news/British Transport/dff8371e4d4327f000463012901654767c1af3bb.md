Officers were called to the line close to East Didsbury railway station on Sunday, 24 June, shortly after 9am following a report that a person had been struck by a train.

Colleagues from the North West Ambulance Service also attended but sadly a man was pronounced dead at the scene.

The incident is not being treated as suspicious and a file will be prepared for the coroner.
