**Update at 4:00pm on Friday 28 August:**

Inspector Mike Edwards, British Transport Police said:
"Overnight and this morning our officers have continued working with our partners to respond to the major incident on the railway line near Lllangennech.

"Colleagues from Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service have extinguished the fire and we are now progressing the investigation at the scene with Office of Rail and Road and the Rail Accident Investigation Branch.

"I can reassure those in the local community that we have worked hard with partners to make the scene of the incident safe.

"This has enabled colleagues at Natural Resources Wales and their specialist teams to fully assess the environmental impact and advise DB Cargo and Network Rail when the clean-up of the site can begin."
