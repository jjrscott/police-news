Do you recognise this man?

Detectives continuing to investigate a sexual assault at King's Cross Underground station are releasing images in connection.

At 7.45am on Wednesday 18 November 2020, a young victim was sexually assaulted by a man on-board a Victoria line service at the North London station.

The man was captured on CCTV following another young victim at Oxford Circus Underground station later that day.

On 6 December 2020, it is reported that the same man was seen taking photos of young victims at Wembley Park Underground station.

Officers believe the man in the CCTV images may have information which could help their investigation.

Investigating officer, Robert Wilkes, said: "We are really keen to speak with the man in the images after a series of offences in which young victims have been targeted across the Underground network.

"If you recognise him, or have any information, please contact BTP by texting 61016 or calling 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference 2000109531."

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
