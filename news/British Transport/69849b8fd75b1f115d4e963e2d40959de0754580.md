British Transport Police officers are appealing for witnesses after a man was assaulted on a Tube train travelling between Waterloo and North Greenwich Underground stations.

The incident took place at around 1.10pm on Wednesday 16 December.

The victim was on-board an Eastbound Jubilee line train when two men and two women boarded the service and were arguing amongst themselves. It is reported the group sat either side of the victim and were shouting close to him, resulting in a spittle landing on him.

Feeling uncomfortable, the victim went to leave the seat, but one of the men blocked his exit. After the victim told the man not to spit on him, he was punched in the face several times resulting in facial injuries and his glasses breaking.

It is believed a passenger on the same carriage filmed the incident on their mobile phone. Officers would like to obtain any video footage, or speak to anyone who witnessed the incident, to help with their investigation.

If you have any information, please contact BTP by texting 61016 or calling 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference 257 of 16/12/20.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
