Officers investigating a bag snatch at Mexborough station in South Yorkshire are today appealing for witnesses.

On 16 March at around 11.50pm, the victim was waiting for a train in the shelter of platform one with her sister.

A man approached the victim and grabs her handbag from her shoulder with force, snapping the strap in the process.

The man then ran out of the shelter and onto the tracks and out of sight. He was described as a white man with a round face, wearing a hooded top and grey joggers.

A 33-year-old man was arrested in connection to the incident the next day, and has been released under investigation.

Officers are appealing for anyone who may have witnessed what happened or who saw anything suspicious in the area at the time to get in touch with them.
