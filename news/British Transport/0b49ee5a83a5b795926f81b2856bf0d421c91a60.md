BTP officers investigating an attempted burglary of a Costa Coffee at Doncaster station are today releasing CCTV images.

The incident happened between 2.40am and 3.05am on Wednesday 1 May.

A man is reported to have gained entry by smashing the window of the coffee shop with an object.

He left the store after being disturbed by a night security guard. He then headed in the direction of West Street.

Two men who are believed to have acted as lookouts then also left the area.

Officers would like to speak to the men in the images.
