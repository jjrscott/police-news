Do you recognise this man and woman?

Officers investigating an incident of theft and fraud in Hull are today releasing their images in connection.

On Saturday 30th November, a member of rail staff's wallet was stolen on the 17.05pm service from Kings Cross to Hull.

Two of their bank cards were then used by three people in several shops, including McDonalds and Sainsbury's, in Hull.

All three people travelled to the various shops on bicycles, and over Â£300 was spent fraudulently in total.

Officers believe the two people in the CCTV images may have information which could help their investigation.

 If you recognise them or have any information please contact BTP by texting 61016 or calling 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference 188 of 01/12/19.

Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
