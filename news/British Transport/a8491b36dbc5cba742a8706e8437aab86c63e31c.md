Officers investigating a fight between football fans on board a train from Derby to Crewe have released images of seven men they would like to identify in connection.

The fight occurred on Saturday 24 August and started shortly before 7.45pm on platforms 2 and 3 at Derby station before continuing on board the 7.44pm service to Crewe.

It is believed the fight took place between Leeds United and Derby football fans, and one of the men left the train at Chesterfield.

A number of passengers will have witnessed the incident both on the platform and on the train and officers are asking them to come forward with information.

If you recognise any of the men please contact BTP by sending a text to 61016 or by calling 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference 153 of 25/08/2019. Or you can ring Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
