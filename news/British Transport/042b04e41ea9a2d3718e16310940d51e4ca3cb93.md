Officers were called to an area of line close to Winchester station on Monday, 25 June, shortly before 11.45am following a report that a person had been struck by a train.

Colleagues from South Central Ambulance Service also attended but sadly a woman was pronounced dead at the scene.

Officers are working to identify the person and contact their next of kin.

The incident is not being treated as suspicious and a file will be prepared for the coroner.
