Detectives investigating an outraging public decency incident which involved an off duty officer being assaulted are today releasing CCTV images in connection.

On 30 January on the 20.39pm train from Redhill to London Bridge, a man was reported to have sat opposite a woman in an otherwise empty carriage and began touching himself inappropriately while looking at her.

He was confronted by an off duty officer as he left the train at Coulsdon South station. He then assaulted her as she tried to detain him, before jumping over the ticket barriers and leaving the station.

The officer attended hospital and fortunately wasn't seriously injured.

Following a number of enquiries, the man is believed to be linked to a number of other outraging public decency incidents on the railway.

Officers believe the man in the CCTV images may have information which could help their investigation.

If you recognise him or have any information please contact BTP by texting 61016 or calling 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference 434 of 30/01/21. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
