Do you recognise this man?

Officers investigating a sexual assault on-board a Victoria line Underground service between Vauxhall and King's Cross are today releasing CCTV images in connection.

At 9.20am on Wednesday 28 October 2020, a man approached and sat opposite the victim on-board the Northbound Victoria line service.

The man then leaned forward and looked at the victim before she stood up and faced away from him. At this point, the man sexually assaulted the victim, who then confronted the man.

Officers believe the man in the CCTV images may have information which could help their investigation.

If you recognise him, or have any information, please contact BTP by texting 61016 or calling 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference 133 of 28/10/20.
