Were you at Ince railway station on the evening of Monday 9 November?

Officers are today appealing for witnesses after a man died at the station last month.

At just before 11pm on Monday 9 November, British Transport Police (BTP) were called to Ince railway station following reports of a casualty on the tracks. Paramedics also attended, however sadly a man was pronounced dead at the scene.

The incident is not being treated as suspicious and a file is being prepared for the coroner, but officers would like to speak to anyone who was at the station on the evening of 9 November that may have information.

Prior to the incident, the deceased was seen briefly talking to man on the station's platform at 9.35pm. This man in particular is asked to contact BTP as he may have information which could assist officers with their enquiries.

Any witnesses or anyone with information is asked to contact BTP by texting 61016 or calling 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference 529 of 09/11/20.
