BTP and colleagues from Thames Valley Police responded to a report of an incident at Milton Keynes Central station at 10.39am 21 October 2018, following a member of staff being told explosives were allegedly on board.

The train was searched and the report was found to be unsubstantiated. A 50 year old female has currently been arrested on suspicion of causing a bomb hoax and officers continue to investigate.

Any suspicious reports can always be made by calling British Transport Police on 0800 40 50 40 or texting 61016.
