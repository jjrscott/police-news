Officers are today appealing for further witnesses to come forward after a racially aggravated incident on board a train from London St Pancras to Bedford.

On 9 December at approximately 9.20pm, a large group of youths began causing a disturbance on board an East Midlands Train.

As the service was held in Bedford while staff waited for police, a man began shouting racist abuse towards a number of passengers.

He got off the train and continued to be racially abusive to another passenger, before assaulting another member of the public.

A 50-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence and common assault.

Officers are urging passengers who witnessed the incident, or who took video footage, to get in touch as soon as possible to assist the investigation.

If this was you, or you have any information, please contact BTP by texting 61016 or calling 0800 40 50 40 and quoting reference 499 of 09/12/2018.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
