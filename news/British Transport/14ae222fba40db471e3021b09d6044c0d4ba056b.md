Detectives from British Transport Police have today arrested three people in connection to the murder investigation at Hillingdon London Underground station.

This afternoon, a 21-year-old man from Uxbridge and a 19-year-old man from Wembley were both arrested on suspicion of murder in central London.

Earlier this morning, an 18-year-old woman from West Drayton was also arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender.

All three remain in police custody for questioning.

Tashan Daniel, 20, died on 24 September after he was stabbed at Hillingdon Underground station.

Detective Chief Inspector Sam Blackburn said: "We have been working around the clock to trace those responsible for Tashan's death and this is a positive step in the ongoing investigation.

"I'd like to thank Tashan's family for their patience and strength and once again extend our deepest condolences to them. They are continuing to be supported by specially trained family liaison officers.

"I know the local community and many people across the country have been truly shocked by this senseless and unprovoked killing, and we will continue to work tirelessly to make sure those responsible face justice."
