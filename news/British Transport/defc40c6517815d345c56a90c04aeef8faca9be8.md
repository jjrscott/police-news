Do you recognise this woman?

Detectives continuing to investigate an incident involving a knife at a London DLR station are releasing images in connection.

Just before 9.30pm on Sunday 20 September, a woman was stood on the platform at Langdon Park DLR station as a train approached. As the victim alighted the train, the woman ran down the platform and hit him.

The woman is then reported to have pulled out a large knife concealed within her clothing and lunge at the victim with it. The pair then wrestled for control of the knife which resulted in the weapon falling on the floor before the victim picked it up and ran out of the station as the woman chased him.

BTP Detective Constable, Hannah Ayling, said: "This was a violent attack at a prominent public place. Thankfully, it is not believed the victim sustained any serious injuries, but this could easily have not been the case.

"We're encouraging anyone who recognises the person in the images, or anyone that was at the station that evening, to contact us as soon as possible.

"If you have any information, please contact us by texting 61016 or calling 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference 2000064928.

"Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
