British Transport Police (BTP) officers have made a seizure of cocaine at Edinburgh Waverley train station which has an estimated value over Â£8,000.

 The seizure was part of an operation by the BTP's County Lines Taskforce to tackle drugs on the railway network, and to protect children and vulnerable adults who are often exploited by gangs into selling or moving drugs.

 Detectives arrested two men, aged 25 and 27 suspected to be concerned in the supply of class A drugs. The males were arrested at Edinburgh Waverley Railway Station, a report was sent to the procurator fiscal and the men appeared at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Wednesday.
