The family of Esme Berry, 16, who very sadly died near to Keynsham station are today releasing this photo to the media.

They are now requesting privacy as they come to terms with their tragic loss, and will not be commenting further.

British Transport Police were called at 12.44pm on 31 August to Keynsham station. The incident is not being treated as suspicious.
