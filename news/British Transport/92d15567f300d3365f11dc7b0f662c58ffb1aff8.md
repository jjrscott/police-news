Do you recognise this man and woman?

Officers investigating an incident of abuse towards a dog at Birmingham New Street station are today releasing these CCTV images in connection.

On 31st August at around 7.20pm, a man and a woman were on platform 9A with their dog.

The man was seen to hit the dog a number of times, and a video shared on social media showed the man grabbing the dog by its legs and aggressively flipping it over onto its back.

The woman he was with swore at a member of the public who had noticed the abuse and threatened to drag her off the train.

Officers believe the man and the woman in the CCTV images may have information which could help their investigation.
