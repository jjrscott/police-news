British Transport Police are today appealing for further information following a report of railway obstruction at Dodworth railway station, South Yorkshire.

The incident happened at 7.10pm on Sunday 25 October.

A black plastic rubbish bin lid was thrown onto the tracks. The train driver was forced to stop the train and remove the item.

Officers wish to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time and who may know more information about the incident.

They would like to remind everyone of the dangers of interfering with the railway, and the importance both BTP and train operators place on the safety and security of everyone using trains and stations.

Anyone with information can contact BTP by texting 61016 or by calling 0800 40 50 40.

In both cases, quote reference number 51 of 26/10/20.

Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111.
