Do you recognise this man?

Officers investigating an incident of arson are today releasing CCTV images in connection.

On 4 April shortly before 11pm, a man got off the train at Oxford Parkway and was directed to a nearby bus stop by a security guard having got off at the wrong station.

The man proceeded to the car park where he smashed the window of a Mercedes with a rock, climbed in it and set fire to it.

The security guard noticed the car was on fire and came out to call the fire service, who arrived to put out the blaze which completely gutted the vehicle.

When the security guard returned into the station, he found the same man then eating his dinner at his desk. He was ejected from the station.

Officers believe the man in the CCTV image may have information which could help their investigation.

If you recognise him or have any information please contact BTP by texting 61016 or calling 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference 367 of 04/04/20.

Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 anonymously.
