Officers are appealing for information after two trailers worth of asbestos waste were dumped on the railway close to Humberside Airport.

The waste is believed to have been dumped overnight, between the 10th and 11th April, at Melton Ross yard.

Alongside the asbestos waste is the inside of porta cabins and office equipment, and it is estimated it may cost up to Â£20,000 to safely remove from the railway.

The lock of the railway gate had been deliberately cut to gain access to the area.

It is being linked to an incident on March 23rd where an arctic trailer load of office equipment was dumped at the same location.

PC Michelle Pidgen said: "This was clearly a deliberate attempt to gain access to the railway to dump potentially harmful waste, with absolutely no regard for the money, time or effort it will cost others to clean it up.

"I would ask anyone who knows who is responsible to get in touch with us as soon as possible."

Anyone with information is asked to contact BTP by texting 61016 or calling 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference 139 of 11/04/19.
