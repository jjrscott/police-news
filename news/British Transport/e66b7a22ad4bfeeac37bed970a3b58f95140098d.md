British Transport Police officers are appealing for witnesses after an assault on-board a southbound Northern line service.

At just before 1.30pm on Saturday 19 December 2020, a woman verbally abused and kicked two passengers.

She was then approached by an off-duty police officer who identified themselves as an officer. The woman then assaulted the off-duty officer, pulling hair from the victim's scalp as she did so.

If you witnessed the incident, or have any information, please contact BTP by texting 61016 or calling 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference 215 of 19/12/20.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
