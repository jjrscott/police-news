Do you recognise these men?

Detectives investigating a serious assault at Barnes station are today releasing these CCTV images in connection.

On 7 November at around 12.25pm, the victim, a 52-year-old man, asked two men to wear face coverings on board a train.

The two men took exception to this and kicked the victim as he was leaving the train at Barnes station. They then attacked him on the platform with a weapon believed to be a knuckle duster.

The victim was taken to hospital where he received treatment for several broken ribs and a punctured lung.

Officers believe the men in the CCTV images may have information which could help their investigation.
