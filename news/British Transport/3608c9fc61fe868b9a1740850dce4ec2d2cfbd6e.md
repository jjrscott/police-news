Sean O'Callaghan, Assistant Chief Constable at British Transport Police, said:

"The Government's instruction is clear - stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives. As has been the case throughout the pandemic, our officers will conduct high-visibility patrols to reinforce this message as well as support rail staff and passengers, ensuring those who need to use the railway are safe.

"Officers will continue engaging with passengers, asking questions to establish the circumstances of their journey and explaining the regulations which are in place to keep all of us safe. Those identified as not having a lawful reason to be away from their home can expect to receive a fixed penalty notice."

"I encourage anyone planning to leave their home under an exemption to consider whether travelling is really essential, and if it isn't please remain local. This is a difficult time for all of us, but these restrictions are in place to protect the NHS and save lives."
