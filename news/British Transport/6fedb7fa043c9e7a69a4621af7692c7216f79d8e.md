Detectives have today arrested two men in connection to the death of a man at Queensbury Underground station in the early hours of Sunday morning (10/03).

Two 23-year-old men, both from North London, were arrested on suspicion of murder this afternoon, after contacting police.

They are currently in police custody.

Florin Pitic, 20, and from Hendon, suffered a serious head injury following an altercation at the station at around 12.30am.

Despite the best efforts of medical staff, he very sadly died a short time later in hospital.
