Detectives are today appealing for witnesses after a man was assaulted on a train from London Bridge last night (16/11).

Between 8pm and 9pm last night, the victim asked a man to stop behaving anti-socially onboard the delayed 7.59pm London Bridge to Gravesend service.

The man then assaulted the victim, knocking him unconscious and breaking his leg.

He was taken to hospital by ambulance, where he is being treated for his injuries.

The train terminated at Dartford due to the incident.

DS Allan McTaggart said: "I'd appeal to anyone who witnessed this incident or believes they may have information to get in touch with us as soon as possible.

"This was a particularly nasty assault and one we are taking extremely seriously."

Anyone who witnessed the incident is asked to contact BTP by texting 61016 or calling 0800 40 50 40 and quoting reference 26 of 17/11/18.
