Do you recognise any of these four men?

Officers would like to identify them in connection to seven bike thefts across the Surrey area.

Between 20 April and 25 July 2018, one bike was stolen from Epsom station, one from Worcester Park, two from Leatherhead and three from Ashtead station.

The bikes had all been locked and secured in bike racks.

Officers believe the men in the CCTV images may have information which could help their investigation.

If you recognise them, or have any information, please contact BTP by texting 61016 or calling 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference 179 of 07/02/19.

Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
