At 4.24pm yesterday (26 February) British Transport Police were called to South Ruislip Underground station following reports of a disturbance.

Officers attended the scene, alongside colleagues from the London Ambulance Service, and a 14-year-old boy was taken to hospital with a stab wound to his abdomen. His injuries are not thought to be life threatening.

It was initially believed there were two further victims, but following further enquiries, it has been confirmed that one other male, aged 16, later presented at hospital with a minor injury.

Both teenagers have since been discharged.

A third person, who is also believed to have been involved, has not yet contacted police and officers would encourage him to do so.

A 15-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of GBH at an address in Beaconsfield.

Officers investigating the incident are appealing for witnesses to get in touch. Anyone who was at the station at the time is asked to contact BTP by texting 61016 or calling 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference 415 of 26 February.
