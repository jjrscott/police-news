British Transport Police (BTP) officers have made a seizure of heroin and crack cocaine worth an estimated £60,000 in Wigan.

On Wednesday 13 January, BTP's County Lines Taskforce stopped two people at Wigan North Western railway station who, enquiries revealed, were travelling from Liverpool to Aberdeen via Wigan.

The pair were searched and found to be in possession of large quantities of heroin and crack cocaine with a suspected street value of over £60,000.

A man, aged 37, and a woman, aged 36, were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply.

Both appeared at Wigan and Leigh Magistrates' Court on the morning of Thursday 14 January where they were charged with possession with intent to supply.

The seizure was part of an operation by the BTP's County Lines Taskforce to tackle drugs on the railway network, and to protect children and vulnerable adults who are often exploited by gangs into selling or moving drugs.
