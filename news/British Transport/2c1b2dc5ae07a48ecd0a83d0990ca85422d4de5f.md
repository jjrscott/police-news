Officers would like to identify him after a man was left with a fractured eye socket following an assault in McDonald's, Waterloo station.

On 4 October at approximately 12.10am, the victim was ordering food in McDonald's when a large amount of chips were thrown at him and his colleague.

He asked those involved to stop, and a young man then punched him in the face, which caused him to fall to the floor.

The victim was treated in hospital for a fractured eye socket.

Officers believe the young man in the CCTV images may have information which could help their investigation.
