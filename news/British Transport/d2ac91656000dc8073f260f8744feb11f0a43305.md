Officers at British Transport Police are issuing a warning after several recent incidents of trespass in the Perthshire area.

The incidents have occurred on and near to a railway viaduct at Bridge of Earn.

Police have received several reports since 30 May of multiple teenagers trespassing in the area. One, a 16-year-old boy, has been charged with trespass in connection to an incident on 30 May.

**Inspector Ross Kean from British Transport Police** , said: "With schools currently closed, I would strongly urge parents to check where their teenagers are going and remind them of the extreme dangers posed by the railway.

We see hundreds of people taking risks on and around the railway every year, resulting in tragic consequences or life-changing injuries. Both of these outcomes are avoidable.

Let us be clear, we will actively pursue and take positive action against those who fail to comply with the simple instruction not to trespass."

Anyone who spots someone trespassing is asked to get in touch by sending a text to 61016 or call 0800 40 50 40. Always ring 999 in an emergency.
