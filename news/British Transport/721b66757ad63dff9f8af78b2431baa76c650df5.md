Detectives are appealing for witnesses following a knife point robbery at Durrington-on-Sea station.

On 25th September at around 8pm, four men approached two teenage boys at Durrington-on-Sea station, and robbed them at knifepoint.

They showed the pair a knife and threatened to stab one victim unless he handed over his phone.

The suspects were two white men and two mixed race men all wearing dark tracksuits and around 18-years-old.

They are believed to have approached the station from nearby Chesterfield Road.

Officers believe many people were in the area at time and would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident or saw the group of men nearby to get in touch with them as soon as possible.

Anyone with information is asked to contact BTP by texting 61016 or calling 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference 639 of 25/09/19.

Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
