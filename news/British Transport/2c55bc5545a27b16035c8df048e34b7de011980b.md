Do you recognise this man?

Officers would like to identify him after an off-duty police officer was left with a broken leg following an altercation at Letchworth Garden City station.

On 11th May at around 12:50am, a verbal altercation took place between two men involving threats of violence on the 11.51pm Kings Cross to Cambridge service.

The off-duty officer identified himself as a police officer and tried to intervene. He attempted to remove one of the men from the train at Letchworth Garden City station, but he punched the officer to the face causing him to fall to the floor.

The two men then began to fight each other, falling onto the officer as he lay on the floor.

The officer suffered a broken leg which will require weeks off work, and minor facial injuries.

Officers believe the man in the CCTV images may have information which could help their investigation.

If you recognise him, or have any information, please contact BTP by texting 61016 or calling 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference 41 of 11/05/19.

Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
