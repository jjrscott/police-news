Do you recognise this man?

Officers investigating an assault at Cwmbran railway station are today releasing this image in connection.

At just after 7pm on Wednesday 21 October 2020, the victim was walking down the platform at Cwmbran railway station when he was approached by two men. One of the men asked to use the victim's cigarette lighter and the other confronted the victim before assaulting him.

Both men continued to assault the victim on the station's platform and one of them pushed the victim's mother to the floor when she attempted to help her son.

Thankfully, neither victim was seriously injured.

Officers believe the man in the image may have information which could help their investigation.
