The family of Michael 'Spike' Lewis, who very sadly died on the railway in Port Talbot yesterday morning (3rd July), have today payed tribute to him.

They said: "He was known by everyone, and loved by everyone.

"We would like to thank everyone so much for their support during this difficult time and ask that we are now given the space we need to grieve."

The family have issued this photo of Michael, 58, who was known as Spike by his loved ones and from North Cornelly, Wales.

They would like to request further privacy from the press while they come to terms with this tragic loss.
