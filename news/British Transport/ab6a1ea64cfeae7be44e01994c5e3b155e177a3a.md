Detectives investigating two robberies in the West Midlands are today releasing an image of a man they would like to identify in connection.

On 19th November shortly after 1pm, a man was surrounded by six young men on the pathway that connects West Bromwich Central Tram Stop and Dartmouth Street tram stop, during the incident he was assaulted and hit in the face with a handgun.

He was robbed of his mobile phone, bank cards and cash. A knife and a machete were also seen during the incident.

The victim, a 19-year old man, was taken to hospital where he was treated for concussion.

Shortly after on the same day, in the area of Lodge Road Tram Stop, a 26 year-old man and a 30-year-old man were approached by six young men. They threatened to stab the pair and robbed them of their mobile phones, and a video game.

Five men aged between 16 and 21 have been arrested in connection to the incident and released on bail while enquiries continue.

Detectives believe the man in the CCTV image may have information which could help their investigation.
