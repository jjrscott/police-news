Detectives investigating a stabbing at Meridian Water station last night (24 September) are today appealing for witnesses.

Last night at around 7.15pm, officers received a report of a stabbing on board a train travelling from Stratford.

Armed officers attended along with paramedics, and a 18-year-old man was taken to hospital where he remains.

His injuries are currently believed to be life-changing.

There have been no arrests.

**Detective Chief Inspector Paul Langley:** "This was a shocking act of violence on board a train, which has left a young man with life-changing injuries.

Thankfully incidents like this on the railway are rare, but passengers can expect to see a number of reassurance patrols in the area this weekend.

I would urgently like to appeal to anyone who may have witnessed the incident, or anything suspicious in the area at the time, to get in touch with us as soon as possible to assist our investigation.

Anyone with information can text BTP on 61016 or call 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference 486 of 24/09/20. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
