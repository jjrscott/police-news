Do you recognise these men?

Detectives investigating a violent incident involving a number of weapons are today releasing these images in connection.

On 27 December a group of youths left a train at Abbey Road station at around 4.45pm.

They chased a second group out young men out of the station, two of them brandishing knives and another pulling what is believed to have been a firearm from his waistband.

They chased the group out of the station and then returned and tried to board another train. The train was held and they then also left the station.

Officers believe the men in the CCTV images may have information which could help their investigation.
