Sean O'Callaghan, Assistant Chief Constable at BTP, said:
"The measures announced yesterday by the Prime Minister are there to save lives which is part of the work our officers do every day. We are supporting rail operators and those key workers making their journeys home tonight by deploying 500 officers across the rail network nationally. They will be patrolling stations, supporting railway staff and reminding the public of the urgent need to follow the government advice - only those making essential journeys for work should be using the Tube and rail network.

"We strongly urge the rest of the public to do the right thing and help us save lives by staying at home and slowing the spread of the virus."
