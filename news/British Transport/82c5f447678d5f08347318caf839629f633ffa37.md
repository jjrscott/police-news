We are appealing for information after a woman was assaulted on board a train between Newport and Cardiff.

Detectives would like to hear from any witnesses to the incident, which occurred between 3pm and 3.20pm on Saturday 5 May.

One man has been arrested on suspicion of common assault and is currently helping us with our enquiries, but we are now appealing for anyone who was on the train - the 12.22pm GWR service from Reading to Swansea - to come forward.

Detective Sergeant Guy Ellis said: "The victim, a 46-year-old woman, was sat with a child when the assault took place. Clearly this was a distressing incident, both for her and the child, and it is vital that we speak to anyone who was on that train.

"The attack took place on a sunny Saturday afternoon during bank holiday weekend, which meant the train was particularly busy, so I am convinced other passengers would have witnessed what happened.

"You may not realise it, but it's possible you may have seen or heard something which could prove vital to our investigation."

A 46-year-old man from Cwmbran has been arrested and interviewed by investigating officers, and released on police bail pending further enquiries, until Tuesday 29 May.

**If you were on the 12.22pm Reading to Swansea service on Saturday 5 May - particularly between Newport and Cardiff - or have any information that could assist us with our enquiries, please call 0800 40 50 40 or text 61016 ****quoting reference** **399 of 05/05/2018.** **Information can also be passed to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.**
