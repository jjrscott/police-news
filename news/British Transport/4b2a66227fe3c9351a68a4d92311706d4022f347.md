Do you recognise this man? Officers would like to speak to him in connection with an assault at Purley station.

At approximately 10.15pm on Monday 19 February, the victim - a 65-year-old man - had just got off a train and was leaving the station when a man double shuffled through the ticket barriers behind him to try to avoid paying.

When challenged over his behaviour, he punched the victim on the left side of his face, causing his glasses to fall to the floor. After bending down to pick up his damaged glasses, he was again punched in the face.

Officers believe the man shown in the CCTV image might have information which could help with the investigation.

Do you know him or his current whereabouts? Anyone with information should contact British Transport Police on 0800 40 50 40 or text 61016, quoting reference 1800012343. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
