A man has this morning appeared in court (8 November) charged in connection with a series of sexual offences in the Mansfield area.

Steven Kavuma, of The Woodlands, Langwith, has been charged with six counts of sexual touching, three counts of outraging public decency, and one count of stalking involving serious alarm or distress in connection with incidents on Robin Hood Line trains between Mansfield and Langwith.

Following a joint investigation between BTP and Nottinghamshire Police, the 19-year-old was also charged with five further sexual touching incidents in Mansfield town centre between 27th October and 5 November.

Kavuma appeared at Mansfield Magistrates Court today where he did not enter any plea.

He has been remanded in custody and will next appear at Nottingham Crown Court in December.
