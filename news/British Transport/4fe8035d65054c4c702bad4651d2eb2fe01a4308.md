BTP officers are today releasing CCTV images after a man was pushed onto the rail tracks at Stockwell station on the London Underground.

The incident happened at 2.30am on Sunday 30 June.

Following a conversation between the two men, the suspect punched the victim then pushed him onto the tracks.

The victim, aged in his 50s, was helped back onto the platform by a friend.

Officers believe the man in the images may have information that could help their investigation.

Anyone who recognises him is asked to contact BTP by texting 61016 or by calling 0800 40 50 40 and quoting reference 72 of 30/06/2019.
