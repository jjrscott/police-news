Do you recognise these men?

Officers investigating a racist incident on a train between Cannon Street and New Cross in London are today releasing their images in connection.

On 13 July at around 8.45pm, the victim walked past a group of men in Cannon Street station where they began to cat call her and make uncomfortable comments.

The victim boarded a train to New Cross and the men sat in the same carriage. Here, they subjected her to racist abuse and threats of rape.

Officers believe the man in the CCTV images may have information which could help their investigation.

If you recognise them or have any information please contact BTP by texting 61016 quoting reference 579 of 13/07/20.
