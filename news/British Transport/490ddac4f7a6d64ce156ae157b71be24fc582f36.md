British Transport Police (BTP) is appealing for witnesses following a theft at Berwick station in Northumberland.

The incident happened at 3.48am on Wednesday 4 March.

Four men are reported to have entered the station and used a small explosive to damage a cash machine and remove its contents. A large amount of cash was stolen and the suspects then fled the scene in a white jeep.

Officers from BTP's Major, Senior and Organised Crime Team were at the station yesterday, analysing the scene and conducting house-to-house enquiries.

At the same time they were, and continue, to pursue a number of positive lines of enquiry.

Investigators ask any witnesses who have not already spoken to a police officer to get in touch. They wish to speak to anyone who witnessed anyone acting suspiciously in the area around the time of incident.

Witnesses can contact BTP by texting 61016 or by calling 0800 40 50 40. In both cases, quote reference number 51 of 04/03/20.

Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously by dialling 0800 555 111.
