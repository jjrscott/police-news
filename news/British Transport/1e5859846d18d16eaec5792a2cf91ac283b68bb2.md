Senior officers at British Transport Police (BTP) have today authorised the Force's use of Section 60 stop and search powers under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act.

The powers have been authorised at stations within central London, as well as hub stations in the wider area including Euston, London Bridge, Liverpool Street and Kings Cross.

The authority for Section 60 begins at 12pm today (13 June), lasting until 10pm. It covers BTP jurisdiction and the 50 meter area surrounding those stations.

**Assistant Chief Constable Sean O 'Callaghan said:** "The decision to implement Section 60 powers is never taken lightly but is done so, based on intelligence, to remove as many dangerous weapons as possible from the network and prevent serious violence.

"Everyone has a right to protest peacefully, but we have information to suggest there are people travelling to London today intent on causing harm and likely to carry weapons on them to do so.

"We are confident that this authority is justified and that it will make any protest activity considerably safer for everyone throughout the rest of the day."

"We would encourage anyone using the railway network to reach out to us if they see something that concerns them. You can contact us by discreetly sending a text message to 61016 or by calling 0800 40 50 40."
