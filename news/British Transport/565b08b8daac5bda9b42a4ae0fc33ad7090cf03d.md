Two pickpockets have been jailed after they were caught red-handed dipping into a woman's purse at Piccadilly Circus Underground station.

Plain clothed officers, part of British Transport Police' proactive theft team, witnessed the two men acting suspiciously, walking closely behind the victim.

As soon as the men tried accessing the woman's bag, to steal her phone and bank cards, they were arrested and have since been sentenced in court.

Chief Inspector Stuart Middlemas said: "This is a very good example of how we operate as a Police Force, and particularly how we police the theft of people's property, which we take very seriously.

"Our specialist teams, like the proactive theft team, often wear plain clothes when patrolling, so even when you can't see us, we're still there, on hand and ready to respond."

The incident happened on Wednesday 9 December.

Both men were sentenced on Wednesday 20 January.

Walid Ferragh, 22, of Garratt Terrace in Wandsworth, London, was jailed for 16 weeks, which was extended to 38 weeks in prison for breaching a previous suspended sentence.

Abdul Boumssaid, 24, of no fixed address, was jailed for 14 weeks and handed a Â£200 fine for possession of cannabis.
