British Transport Police have seized drugs worth £1,300, nearly £10,000 in cash and weapons from a house raid in Paisley this week.

A male aged 29 and a female aged 26 were arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of a controlled drug after a Drug Search Warrant was executed.

During the search, which included a police specialist drugs dog, herbal cannabis worth approximately £1,300 was recovered as well as edible cannabis items, £9,855 in cash, and weapons.

Both have been released on Police Undertaking and are expected to appear at Paisley Sheriff Court next month.

 BTP Detective Sergeant David Ferguson said: "This result shows how we have been working to actively reduce the supply and possession of drugs in Scotland. We are committed to disrupting this activity which is having a negative impact on communities throughout Scotland."
