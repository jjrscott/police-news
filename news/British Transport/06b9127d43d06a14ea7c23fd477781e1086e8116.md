Officers investigating a fight which led to an off-duty BTP officer being assaulted on the London Underground are today appealing for witnesses.

On 10 December at around 10.40pm, the officer was on a Southbound Victoria line train at Kings Cross when it became apparent two women were fighting in another carriage, causing the tube doors to open and shut.

The officer tried to intervene and a man, who was believed to have been travelling with one of the women, became violent and punched him in the head repeatedly.

He received a black eye and concussion. There have been no arrests.

Officers believe there were a number of people on the tube who will have witnessed this incident and have not yet spoken to police.

They are appealing for any witnesses, or anyone with information, to come forward and assist the investigation. You can text 61016 or call 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference 515 of 10/12/20. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
