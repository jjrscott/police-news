BTP officers investigating a robbery at Manchester Victoria station are today releasing CCTV images.

The incident happened between 4.39pm and 5.04pm on Monday 22 April.

Three men are reported to have confronted the victim, a man in his 40s, in the station's toilet.

One of the men, an 18-year-old from Ramsbottom, is reported to have pushed and repeatedly punched the victim.

He was later arrested for the offence and has since been released while officers carry out further enquiries.

During the assault, the two other men reportedly stole the victim's wallet and left the station.

Officers believe the men in the images may have information that could help their investigation.

Anyone who recognises them is asked to contact BTP by texting 61016 or by calling 0800 40 50 40 and quoting reference number 1900033542.

Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
