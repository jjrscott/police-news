Detectives from British Transport Police are appealing for witnesses after a serious incident at Isleworth station yesterday (17/12).

At around 2.45pm a firearm was discharged outside the station following an altercation between a group of men.

It is believed some of the men were on bikes and others on foot, and officers are keen to find out more about their movements before and after the incident.

They believe motorists with dash cam footage from the area may hold vital information.

DI Darren Gough said: "I'd like to appeal to drivers who were in the vicinity of Isleworth station before and after this time to check their dash cams as soon as possible.

"If you believe you have footage which may have captured these men, please come forward and help us with this investigation.

"I would also like to reassure the public that we believe this to be an isolated incident, and that we are doing all that we can to find the perpetrators."

Any witnesses or anyone with information is asked to contact BTP by texting 61016 or ringing 0800 40 50 40 and quoting reference 369 of 18/12/18.

Alternatively they can call Crimestoppers anonymously 0800 555 111.
