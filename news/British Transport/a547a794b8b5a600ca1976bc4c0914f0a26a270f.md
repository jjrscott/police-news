No further action is to be taken against a 42-year-old man from Oldham who was arrested on suspicion of fraud and handling stolen goods on 15th February.

Following an investigation into a bike theft in West Yorkshire, 101 bikes were seized from the man's address.

During searches, a bike involved in a theft at Huddersfield station was recovered and returned to rightful owner. Following a number of extensive enquires, the 42-year-old man was ruled out as a potential suspect in this enquiry.
