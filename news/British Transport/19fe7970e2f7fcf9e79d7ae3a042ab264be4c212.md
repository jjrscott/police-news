Do you recognise this man?

Detectives investigating an indecent exposure in front of a schoolgirl are today releasing this image in connection.

On 4th February shortly after 4pm, the victim, an 11-year-old girl, was travelling on the Bakerloo Line from Baker Street.

The carriage emptied and a man sat opposite her, exposing himself, before leaving the train at Queen's Park Underground station.

Officers believe the man in the CCTV image may have information which could help their investigation.

Detective Inspector Dan Holmes said: "This is clearly an incredibly concerning incident and we are keen to identify this individual as soon as possible.

"The victim was understandably distressed by what happened, and her and her family are being supported by specially trained officers.

"We take reports like this very seriously and I'd urge anyone who recognises this man to get in touch with us as soon as they can by texting 61016 and quoting reference 276 of 02/03/20."

 Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
