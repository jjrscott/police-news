Detectives investigating an assault on board a train from Edinburgh Waverley to Dunblane are today appealing for information.

On 17 November, shortly before midnight, three men boarded the service at Linlithgow and pushed the victim following a verbal altercation.

After arriving at Polmont at approximately 11.50pm, the victim was followed off the train by the three males, one of whom head-butted him.

The victim fell to the ground and another one of the men kicked him in the head.

The three suspects re-boarded the service and then left the train at Falkirk Grahamston.

Officers believe a number of other passengers took pictures and videos of the incident, and they'd like to appeal to them, or anyone else who witnessed it, to get in touch as soon as possible.

Anyone with information is asked to contact BTP by texting 61016 or calling 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference 769 of 17/11/18.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
