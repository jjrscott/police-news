An internal investigation has seen a West Mercia Police officer issued with a final written warning for misconduct following a hearing chaired by an independent legally qualified chair.

The hearing, held over one day (Monday 21 December) found a case proven against allegations that the Shropshire based officer had breached the Standards of Professional Behaviour after sending a number of inappropriate and derogatory messages he had exchanged via WhatsApp, on and off duty. It was also found that he failed in his duty to report inappropriate behaviour of a colleague.

He was found to have breached the following Standards of Professional Behaviour:

\- Equality and Diversity

\- Authority, Respect and Courtesy

\- Discreditable Conduct

\- Reporting Improper Conduct

\- Off-duty conduct

Misconduct Hearings are subject to an appeals process.
