Officers in Bromsgrove are appealing for information following a burglary and vandalism at the Bromsgrove Sporting Colts Clubhouse at Barnsley Hall Playing Fields, Bromsgrove.

This incident is reported to have happened between at some time on Saturday night (27 June).

The offenders have caused significant damage to the window shutter by pulling it off the wall, have broken the frame and locks on two high security doors as well as braking into the storage unit door. Two items were stolen from the property, one of which was an industrial style grass cutter.

PC Hillbrook said: "This is a mindless and selfish crime and will not be tolerated.

"The destruction of this community based centre by these vandals has caused a lot of understandable upset and anger locally at an already challenging time for the community.

"We have launched an investigation and are asking local residents to help by contacting us if they are aware of any suspicious activity in or around the centre over the weekend."

Anyone with any information is asked to contact West Mercia Police on 101 quoting **22/53239/20**
