Yesterday morning (Wednesday 10 March), officers from Kidderminster SNT conducted joint unannounced visits with Trading Standards, Immigration and H&W Fire Services (MATES: Multi Agency Targeted Enforcement Strategy) to a number of commercial premises.

PC Matt Ling from Kidderminster SNT said: "We visited three supermarkets and stores within the Kidderminster town area, following reports of counterfeit and illicit tobacco being sold.

"A significant amount of counterfeit tobacco was seized by Trading Standards and following a search of a vehicle associated with one premises, we found and seized an extendable baton.

"Operations like this prove that working in close partnership with our partner agencies we are able to prevent criminal enterprises from continuing their distributing their products such as tobacco and alcohol."
