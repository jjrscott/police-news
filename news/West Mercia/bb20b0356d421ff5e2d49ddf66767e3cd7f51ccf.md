Malvern police officers are appealing for information or witnesses following a fail to stop road collision on the A449 at Newlands.

The incident took place around 6.40am on Friday 24 January when a cyclist, who was travelling towards Malvern, was knocked off his bike by a passing vehicle. He suffered fractures to his fingers as well as bruising. The driver of the vehicle failed to stop at the scene.
