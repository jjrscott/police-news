Officers are appealing for any witnesses to come forward and help with their investigation into a report of a man being injured when a bottle of bourbon has been thrown at his car.

The incident happened earlier this morning (Sunday 21 February) at around 6.20am on Kidderminster Road at the junction with Willow Close, near to Sanders Park in Bromsgrove.

As the victim was driving to work, he saw three men in dark clothing, one of the men is believed to have thrown a bottle of bourbon at his car, an orange Toyota Aygo. The bottle has broken the driver's side window of the car and as a result the man has received multiple deep cuts to his face. The victim has been taken to hospital where he requires surgery.

If you were in the area between 6am to 6.30am and saw the incident or three men in dark clothing acting suspiciously, or have doorbell or dash-cam footage from around that time in Kidderminster Road and the surrounding area officers would like to hear from you.

You can contact us via 101, the website or by emailing - craig.tennant@westmercia.pnn.police.uk referencing 101i of 21 February.
