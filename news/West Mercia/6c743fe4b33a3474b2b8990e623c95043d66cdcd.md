Police investigating the death of a man in Worcester have named a man his 30s.

James Dean, 34 years old and from Worcester was found in cardiac arrest by members of the public around 8am on Saturday 14 March.

James' family have been informed of his death.

Officers were called to a property on Lowesmoor in Worcester after James was discovered in a communal hallway. Despite the best efforts of the emergency services, sadly Dean was pronounced dead at the scene.

His death is being treated as _unexplained_ at this time and an investigation has been launched with a post-mortem being conducted tomorrow.

Detective Inspector Tony Garner said: "We are looking into James' death and working into establishing exactly what has happened as there is no obvious explanation as to how he has sadly lost his life.

"If anyone was in or around Lowesmoor around 8am on Saturday morning, or has any information that may help with our enquiries, we would ask they get in contact with us."

Anyone with information should contact West Mercia Police on 101 quoting reference 150s of the 14 March. Alternatively, information can be passed to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. ** **
