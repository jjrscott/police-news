We have received a number of reports of indecent images being published on an international website, without the individuals consent.

These images are being hosted on an worldwide platform and this makes it much harder to be able to get the pictures removed, meaning prevention is the best technique to practice.

 If you think you might be at risk of personal images being shared we encourage you to keep your malware up to date, change and create strong passwords for all applications and logins. Be conscious who you may have shared images with and how you store images on your devices.

We want to reassure you that we are here to help and want to encourage anyone affected by this to get in contact with us.

DI Tony Garner from Worcester station said "We are working with the Regional Organised Crime Unit and our Cyber Crime teams to investigate these crimes, we hope to prosecute those responsible.

 "We are still investigating which apps and how the images are being taken from the devices. While we understand this might be embarrassing to come forward about such sensitive issues, we encourage anyone affected by it to contact us and report it, this will allow us to ascertain how many people this has affected."

Please contact us on 101 if you feel you or someone you know has been a victim to this.
