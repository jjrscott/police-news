**A county lines drug dealer has been jailed after he was caught with heroin and crack cocaine at Hereford Train Station on Monday 14 September.**

David Dudley, 55, of no fixed abode (Birmingham), was caught by Herefordshire's Proactive CID Team with 15 wraps of heroin and 20 wraps of crack cocaine and was arrested and charged.

He was charged with two further offences of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs between 6 - 14 September, after further evidence established that he had travelled to Hereford to supply crack cocaine and heroin.

On Tuesday 17 November he was sentenced to 33 months' imprisonment at Worcester Crown Court after pleading guilty to four counts of drug trafficking offences.

Herefordshire Detective Sergeant Nick Strutt said: "I hope this sentence sends a clear warning to those who are involved in county lines drug dealing not to come to Hereford!

"Where we have information or intelligence to suggest county lines drug dealing is taking place we will act on this and take robust action to disrupt their organised crime network.

"We work closely with our partner agencies, to tackle serious and organised crime, such as county lines under our campaign - Protect.

He continued: "Protect is West Mercia Police's response to tackling serious and organised crime and those who cause the most harm in our communities to protect people from harm."
