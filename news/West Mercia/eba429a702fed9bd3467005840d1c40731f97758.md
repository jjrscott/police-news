Today the NSPCC has released figures that show a rise in the number of child sex offences recorded by police forces across the country.

The figures show the number of offences recorded by West Mercia Police has increased by 54% over five years. Last year, 1,821 child sex offences were recorded compared to 1,179 offences recorded in 2014/15.

The rise is consistent with other forces in the region.

Head of Crime and Vulnerability, Chief Superintendent Damian Barratt, said: "Our absolute priority is safeguarding those who are vulnerable and there is no doubt that this includes children, over the past few years we have worked diligently with our partner agencies to make sure we protect those who are at risk of harm.

"Over the past few years more than 18,000 people across the counties covered by West Mercia Police have been trained to know the signs of exploitation and vulnerability and what to do if they suspect a child or vulnerable person is at risk. This training has been delivered to professionals whose role brings them into contact with children and young people and encourages them to report any concerns they may have.

"We have teams dedicated to protecting vulnerable people with officers specially trained to deal with the sensitivities of these complex investigations and have teams who work on child exploitation across the force with officers working closely with safeguarding partners to proactively investigate those exploiting children and young people through child sexual exploitation and wider criminal exploitation.

"We know that high profile cases both locally and nationally have given victims the courage to come forward and report non-recent child sex abuse and would always encourage anyone who is or has been a victim to report this regardless of when the offence took place. Even if they do not wish to pursue the offence through the criminal justice system we can ensure we put them in contact with support networks."
