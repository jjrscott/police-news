We have arrested two men on suspicion of theft following a vehicle stop and search this morning (Tuesday 2 February) in Ludlow, Shropshire.

At around 1.20am officers stopped a suspicious van on Dun Cow Road and, following a search of the vehicle, found several items in the back including a motorbike and lawnmower which are believed to have been stolen.

A 26 year-old man from Stourport and a 23 year-old man from Bewdley were arrested on suspicion of theft and currently remain in custody in Shrewsbury.
