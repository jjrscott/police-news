On Saturday 23 November, during the town Christmas light switch on celebrations, Kevin Machin, 53 and of no fixed address was seen causing a disturbance near to St Stephens Church on Church Green West in Redditch Town Centre.

"Sergeant Jane Gilkes said: "Machin's bad behaviour meant that he was in breach of a Criminal Behaviour Order, issued by Redditch Magistrates Court in 2017 and he was arrested. At court, a suspended prison sentence from a previous similar conviction was invoked resulting in Machin being sent to prison for 16 weeks.

"SNT officers are aware that the conduct of disruptive people such as Machin has a negative effect local people's lives around Church Green. The Safer Neighbourhood Team will continue to take positive action with offenders and encourage the community to report any concerns."
