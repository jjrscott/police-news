#### West Mercia Police is supporting the Home Office's 'Something's Not Right' campaign, aimed at protecting victims of child abuse.

The month-long campaign launched on Tuesday, 17 November, encourages children and young people to recognise different forms of abuse, report it and get help.

The campaign, which is in partnership with charities including the NSPCC, Barnardo's and The Children's Society, will see animated adverts aimed at secondary school pupils aged 13+, running across Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook.

Young people will be directed to a dedicated page on the NSPCC service Childline where they can access information and seek support.

Evidence has suggested that young people faced a greater risk of sexual abuse, criminal exploitation and domestic abuse due to the impact of coronavirus.

West Mercia Police's Head of Vulnerability and Safeguarding, Detective Superintendent Damian Pettit, said: "We know that for some children and young people the enhanced restrictions during the pandemic has put them at greater risk of suffering abuse, whether that be sexual abuse, physical abuse or criminal exploitation.

"By raising awareness and understanding we can help build confidence in encouraging victims to speak to a trusted adult about the abuse and ensure they get the support they need, as well as enable us to take action against the abuser and stop further suffering.

"We know that adverse childhood experiences, which includes abuse and exploitation, have a significant impact on children in later life and it's vitally important we all play a part to help safeguard those who are vulnerable."

Nationally, the monthly average number of Childline counselling sessions about domestic abuse and abuse increased by 20% and 22% respectively in April-July 2020, compared to pre-lockdown levels. The Internet Watch Foundation revealed that there were almost 9 million blocked attempts to access child sexual abuse material during the first month of restrictions alone. This trend has continued, with the charity revealing that in September, they received a 45% increase in calls reporting child abuse material online.

The campaign will help victims understand what may be happening to them and provide advice on how to report concerns to a trusted adult such as a teacher.

'Something's Not Right' has been developed in close collaboration with the NSPCC, Barnardo's, The Children's Society, Internet Watch Foundation and the Marie Collins Foundation.
