Officers are appealing for witnesses following an assault on Thursday 1 October 2020.

The assault happened at the nature reserve off May Lane, Hollywoood around 6pm. Officers are keen to identify the three men in the CCTV images who may be able to help in the investigation.

PC Marshall said: "This was brutal attack on an elderly victim in her late 60s while she walked her dog in which she was kicked and punched several times. We would like to hear from anyone who saw a group of three young men in May Lane or in the nature reserve between 5.30pm and 6pm on October 1 who are described as all white, possibly all with bicycles. One of the bikes the victim describes as having orange wheels."
