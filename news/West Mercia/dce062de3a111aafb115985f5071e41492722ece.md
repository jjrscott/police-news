We are appealing for witnesses following a fatal collision in Oswestry on New Year's Eve.

At around 11.30pm on Thursday 31 December a red Peugeot was on the B5069 when it left the road. The driver, a man in his twenties from Oswestry, sadly died at the scene.

A passenger in the car suffered serious injuries and was taken to North Staffordshire Hospital where he is in a stable condition.

We are keen to speak to anyone who may have seen the collision or has dash-cam footage of the incident.

Anyone with information is urged to contact police on 101 quoting reference 822i of 31 December. Alternatively information can be passed anonymously using the Tell Us About section of our website here.

For more information on submitting footage of potential road offences or incident visit our website here.
