We are appealing for any information and any witnesses to come forward following a fatal road traffic collision near the Pinvin Crossroads in Worcestershire.

Around 9.50pm on Sunday 6 September, a blue Mercedes Sprinter mini bus with three occupants was travelling west on the A44 about half a mile west of the crossroads and has collided with an arctic lorry travelling east. There was significant damage to both vehicles and sadly one of the occupants of the mini bus, a man in his 20s was killed in the collision and our thoughts are with his family and this very difficult time.

The driver of the mini bus, a man in his 30s, is in hospital with serious injuries and has been arrested for causing death by dangerous driving.

The driver of the lorry and the second passenger in the mini bus were taken to hospital for lesser injuries and have since been released.

An investigation is underway to establish the exact circumstances of the collision. If you have any information or have dashcam footage that could help with our enquiries, please call us on 101 and quote incident number 678i of 6 September 2020.

Alternatively information can be passed through the online reporting function on West Mercia Police website under the section Tell Us About https://www.westmercia.police.uk/
