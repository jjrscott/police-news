South Worcestershire officers recently took part in the Home Office's national commitment to tackle knife crime - Operation Sceptre, in which a range of activities were undertaken across the county between Monday 9 November to Sunday 15 November.

The week of activities included educational, preventative and enforcement initiatives alongside officers from British Transport Police (BTP).

Throughout the week officers raised awareness of the dangers of carrying a knife through virtual school visits, as well as using the knife detecting arch at Worcester Foregate Street train station.

Sergeant Simon Hallam, West Mercia Police said: "One knife incident is one too many, and although we have low levels of knife crime across the county compared to other areas of Britain, the more we can do to stop knives getting into the wrong hands and being used in crime the better."

"The use of the knife arch enabled us to educate the public. We will continue to work closely with BTP and other local agencies, such as the local authority, schools and voluntary organisations, as part of a multi-agency approach with everyone playing their part to help tackle knife crime."

He continued: "It's not about criminalising children and young people involved in knife crime, it's about making sure they have support and guidance to find an alternative route, helping to make their life, and the lives of those around them, much safer."

There are number of ways people can report concerns for a young person and the possibility they are involved in knife crime. There are several charities that can be used to report anonymously such as Crimestoppers. You can call them 0800 555111 or visit www.fearless.org where you can raise concerns and also find out more information on the stark consequences of knife crime.
