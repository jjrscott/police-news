We can confirm that sadly a body has been recovered this morning following the search for Hereford man Tim Webb who went missing on Friday 21 February.

Inspector Simon Arinze said: "We are sad to report that a body has been found during our search and rescue operation of the River Wye this morning, near to the Hereford Tennis Courts.

"Although formal identification has yet to take place, we believe the body discovered to be that of Tim Webb. Tim's family and close friends have been informed and specially trained officers are supporting them at this tragic time.

"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the public who shared our appeal and who have sent well wishes to the family."
