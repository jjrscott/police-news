Police are appealing for anyone with any information or who witnessed a serious assault in Kidderminster last weekend to please come forward.

Officers were called to the Comberton Hill area on Sunday 8 December around 12.30am where a man in his 30s had been reportedly assaulted. His injuries were severe and included serious head trauma requiring urgent medical treatment.

The man had been in a bar (likely in the Comberton Hill area) watching a televised boxing match and between 12am and 1am where he believes was attacked after he left. Due to his injuries the victim is unable to be sure where the assault happened or provide further information or details.

Officers investigating this serious assault would like to speak to anyone who maybe saw anything suspicious in that area, has any dash cam footage or who has any information to please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting incident number 29s of the 8 December 2019
