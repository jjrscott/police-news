Police have given a teenage victim of an assault in Telford a voucher to buy a new bike.

On Thursday 11 March PCSO Amy Newbrook visited Joe Cowans, aged 15 from Sutton Hill, to give him the Â£250 gift voucher which had been secured through the Community Fund.

Joe lives with Autism and was sadly assaulted on Tuesday 23 February at around 1.30pm in the park near his home by two other boys. He was extremely distressed by the incident and suffered a seizure needing medical treatment.

PCSO Newbrook met with Joe and his mum, Susan, to give them the voucher alongside a SmartWater kit, supplied by our We Don't By Crime initiative. The SmartWater kit can then be used to mark the bike and registered to help to keep the bike safe once it has been purchased.

PCSO Newbrook said: "It was an absolute pleasure to visit Joe and his mum and to see how excited he was about receiving the voucher and the marking kit as well.

"It is such a joy to be able to give something back, through the Community Fund, to someone who has suffered a really traumatic ordeal. We hope that the new bike will give Joe a revived feeling of confidence and happiness."

Anyone with information on assault can call 101 quoting reference 00269i of 23 February. Alternatively, if you have information but don't feel comfortable speaking to police, you can speak to the independent charity Crimestoppers. It is 100% anonymous, they never ask your name and they cannot trace your call or I.P address. You can contact them online or by calling 0800 555 111.
