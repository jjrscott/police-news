Opening hours at our police station front counters are changing in light of the enhanced Covid-19 restrictions.

Front counters are open to the public allowing them to call for appointments with police officers, report crime and ask for advice.

All West Mercia Police front counters will now be open from 10am to 2pm every day.

Superintendent Rik Klair said: "It is right that we change our opening hours in light of the current restrictions. We will continue to monitor the situation both nationally and locally over the coming weeks and will look to return to normal opening as soon as we are able to. We'd like to thank the public for their on-going co-operation at this time.

"I'd also like to remind people that a range of incidents can be reported to us directly via our website. Remember, if it's not 999 you can report it online."

Incidents such as antisocial behaviour, theft, criminal damage, suspected Covid-19 breaches and road traffic collisions can be reported here These reports are handled and prioritised in exactly the same way as calls to 101. Reporting online helps to free up call lines, ensuring that we can prioritise emergencies effectively.
