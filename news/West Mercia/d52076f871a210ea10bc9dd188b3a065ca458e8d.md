We are appealing for witnesses and a driver following a collision in Dawley, Telford yesterday.

Between approximately 8.30am and 8.45am on Duce Drive on Tuesday (10 November) a cyclist and a car have been in collision.

We are appealing to the driver of a car believed to be a silver Skoda in the area at the time to get in contact to help with our investigation.

The 25 year old cyclist has fallen from his bicycle onto the curb injuring his shoulder, knee and elbow.

If you saw the incident or have dashcam footage please contact PC Symonds on 07967 303 795 reference 169i10Nov.
