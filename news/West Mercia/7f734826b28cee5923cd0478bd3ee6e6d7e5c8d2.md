Sergeant Glenn Jones said: "Police were called at around 8.15am on Saturday 12 October to reports of an RTC involving a motorbike on the A449 at Worcester between the Six Ways roundabout and the Blackpole exit.

"When officers arrived they discovered a person on the grass verge and a damaged motorcycle nearby. Officers were able to determine that the victim, a man in his 20s had sadly died. The man's next of kin have been informed.

"An investigation is underway and I would ask the public if they have any information, dash cam footage or witnessed the incident which may have happened between 8pm on Friday 11 October and 8am on Saturday 12 October to please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting incident number 175s of the 12 October 2019."
