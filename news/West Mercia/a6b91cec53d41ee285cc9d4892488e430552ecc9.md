West Mercia Police are appealing for witnesses following a traffic collision on A458 Much Wenlock to Bridgnorth.

At around 11am today (22/1) a Vauxhall Corsa was travelling towards Bridgnorth when the vehicle collided with a road maintenance worker.

The 56 year old pedestrian has suffered multiple injuries including a fracture to his leg, arms and injuries to his face. He was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, where he is receiving treatment for his injuries.

PC Simon Fearn "Although the exact circumstances of this incident are not understood at this time, It was very foggy this morning along the road where the incident took place. I would like to remind road users to drive appropriately to road and weather conditions.

"I am appealing for witnesses who may have seen it or have dash cam footage. Please call me with any information on 01743 237483 and reference 195 of 22 Jan."
