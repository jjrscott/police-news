We are appealing for witnesses following a collision in Shrewsbury last Friday.

At around 5.45pm on Friday (6 November) on Sundorne Road three cars, a white Mercedes AMG C, red Skoda Fabia and a blue Renault Clio, were involved in a collision.

The driver of the Mercedes, a 32-year-old man, was taken to hospital for treatment, his injuries are not believed to be life-threatening. The drivers of the other two vehicles received minor injuries.

The collision has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) as police had been in pursuit of the Mercedes.

We are keen for anyone with dashcam footage to submit this to us via Operation Snap on our website or anyone with information is encouraged to contact Sgt Stephen Hastie on 101 quoting reference 0419 i 6 November.
