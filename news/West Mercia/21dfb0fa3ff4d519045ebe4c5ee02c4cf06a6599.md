We are appealing for anyone who witnessed a robbery on Sunday 7 March in Redditch to please come forward.

The incident happened at the junction of Fordbridge Close and Middle Piece Drive around 8pm when a man was approached by another man demanding his wallet and phone.

Detective Constable Tom Pritchard said: "The victim was able to grab the man who was threatening him at which point the attacker has then run away. The suspect is described as 6 foot tall, stocky build, wearing a black jacket with the hood up, a face mask and had a strong Birmingham accent.

"A replica BB gun was found at the scene and seized by officers and I would ask that anyone who recognises the replica gun or who was driving past the junction on Sunday who may have witnessed the incident or have dash cam footage, please contact us via 101 or get in touch with us online and quote incident number 00570i of 7 March 2021."
