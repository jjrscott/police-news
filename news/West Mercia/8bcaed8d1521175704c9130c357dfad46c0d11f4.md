We're appealing for witnesses after a dog attack in Telford.

Around 1pm on Monday 11 January a woman was walking her dog in Woodside when an agitated pitbull approached her and bit her dog. Due to the dogs state the woman was fearful it would attack her.

The pitbull, which had black and white markings similar to a dalmatian, appeared to be on its own without anyone in control of it.

Officers are keen to identify the owner of the dog.

Anyone who knows who the dog belongs to or has information about its whereabouts is asked to get in contact via the Tell Us About section of www.westmercia.police.uk or alternatively information can be passed anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
