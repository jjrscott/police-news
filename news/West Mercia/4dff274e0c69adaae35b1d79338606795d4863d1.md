A man has been given a football banning order after he made racist comments at a football match.

On Friday (13 November) Shaun Clare, 40 from Waverley, Woodside, pleaded guilty at Telford Magistrates' Court to racially aggravated public order after he made racist comments to a football player.

The comments were directed towards a Leyton Orient football player when the team played AFC Telford United at the Telford ground in March 2019.

Clare was given a three year football banning order and a £330 fine. He was also ordered to pay £135 to the CPS and a £33 victim surcharge.

Detective Sergeant Andy Dawson said: "We're pleased that Mr Clare has taken responsibility for his abhorrent actions and pleaded guilty to racially abusing a Leyton Orient player. His actions were not that of a genuine football fan and West Mercia Police has shown we will not tolerate such behaviour. I'd especially like to thank the fans of Telford United, who stood up to him at the time, and also assisted our investigation and helped bring him to justice. Racism has no place within our communities."
