We are appealing for witnesses to a sexual assault on Lickey Hill, Bromsgrove near to the Visitor's centre.

The incident happened between 7.30am and 8am this morning (17 December) about 250 metres from the visitors centre, up a steep bank in woodland on Lickey Hill.

The victim, a woman in her 30s who was walking her dog, sustained minor injuries and was left shaken following the incident.

The offender is reported to be a man wearing coat who smelled very strongly of urine.

Detective Sergeant Ian Standing said: "We take reports of this nature very seriously and a thorough investigation is underway while the victim is being supported by specially-trained officers. I want to reassure the local community that extra patrols will be in the area and highly visible and detectives are working hard to find this man.

"I would urge anyone who may have witnessed this incident or saw anything suspicious on and around the Lickey Hill area this morning to please come forward.

"If anyone has any information that could help police with their enquiries please call 101 quoting incident number 0113s of 17 December 2019.

Alternatively, you can contact independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their website www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
