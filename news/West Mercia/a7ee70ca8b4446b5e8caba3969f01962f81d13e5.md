Hereford police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was attacked by a large crossbreed dog in Aylestone Park.

It is reported that the brown dog attacked and injured the local woman who was walking her four month old boxer puppy through the park on Wednesday 16 October between 5pm and 6pm. The dog caused injuries to the woman and her puppy, who were both helped during the incident by several by members of the public. The puppy suffered injuries to its neck and the woman suffered an injury to her arm and fingers.

PC Wayne Hurley said: "We've been making local enquiries into this incident and we're really keen to hear from anyone who can help us to identify the owner of the dog."

Anyone with information that could help locate the dog and its owner are asked to call West Mercia Police on 101, quoting incident reference number 0790S of 16 October 2019. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or at www.crimestoppers-uk.org
