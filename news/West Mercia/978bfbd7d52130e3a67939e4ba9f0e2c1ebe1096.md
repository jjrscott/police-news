**At around 12.30pm on Thursday 23 January, officers carried out a tactical intervention on a car just outside Redditch.**

Detective Inspector Andy Bailey said: "A planned police operation to stop a car suspected of ferrying drugs was carried yesterday on Redditch Road.

"The operation was performed by officers form the North Worcestershire Operational Policing Unit (OPU) and the North Worcestershire County Lines Team. 'County Lines' activity involves a group from a large urban area travelling to smaller locations to sell drugs and collect cash.

"The two suspects in the car were quickly and decisively detained and arrested. A search of the car produced a quantity of drugs, cash and mobile phones.

"The two people arrested were one man in his 20s from Smethwick and one woman in her 20s from Oldbury and are both suspected of being part of a County Lines gang bringing drugs into Redditch and Kidderminster.

"The criminal exploitation of vulnerable people, which includes county lines, has been a priority for our teams for a long time and our officers are working continuously to disrupt and dismantle drugs supply and protect the young and vulnerable people who are exploited by them in our communities."
