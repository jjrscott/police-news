The body of a man found on the Clee Hills in South Shropshire has been formally identified.

Richard Hall, who was 70 and from Perton in Staffordshire, was found on Friday (14 August) on Brown Clee Hill.

A 21-year-old man had previously been arrested on suspicion of murder.

Today, Mr Hall's family has made the following tribute:

'Richard was a wonderful man in every single way. A massive loss to the family and everyone that knew him. An inspiration to many, taken away from us far too soon.'

Moses Christensen, 21, from Oldwinford, Stourbridge has been charged with murder and possession of a bladed article in a public place and is due to appear at Hereford Magistrates' Court by video link on today (Tuesday, 18 August).
