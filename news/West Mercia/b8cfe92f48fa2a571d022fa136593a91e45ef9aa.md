We can today (Thursday 22 October) confirm that the body found near Copyholt Lane, in Bromsgrove, on Friday 16 October has been formally identified as Zobaidah Salangy.

The 28-year-old went missing from her home in Bromsgrove on March 29 and an investigation into her disappearance has been ongoing since. Copyholt Lane was closed for some time but the road will be reopened today as we prepare to leave the scene.

Detective Chief Inspector Mark Peters: "Our police officers have been searching tirelessly for Zobaidah and although this is a very sad discovery, we hope this will now give some closure to her loved ones.

"We would like to thank the community for their patience and support whilst we carried out searches."

Three men have been charged with offences in connection with her disappearance; Nezam Salangy, aged 42, of Austin Road Bromsgrove, who has been charged with murder, Mohammed Ramin Salangy, aged 29 from Adamscroft Place, Cardiff, and Mohammed Yasin Salangy, aged 32, also from Cardiff were both charged with assisting an offender.

A trial has been set for 16 March, 2021 at Worcester Crown Court.
