Four people have been arrested following disorder in Brookside, Telford on Tuesday 1 September.

Whilst officers were patrolling the Burford area at around 2.30pm, a disorder occurred leading to a number of police officers being assaulted.

Three men all aged 18 were arrested on suspicion of violent disorder and assaulting an officer whilst a 31-year-old woman, was arrested for violent disorder. All the suspects are from the Telford area and remain in custody at this time.

Superintendent James Baker said: "This incident is unacceptable. My colleagues were on patrol, keeping the community safe - we do not come to work to be assaulted. This type of behaviour will not be tolerated in Telford and we will be increasing the number of uniformed patrols in the area.

"This was undoubtedly a very distressing incident for anyone who witnessed it and I am pleased we made four arrests, having gained control of the incident quickly.

"Our staff are committed to keeping the public safe and these events will not deter police from patrolling the area and continuing to their jobs. All our officers are dedicated to their roles and we will continue to engage with the communities we serve and be there when they are in need."
