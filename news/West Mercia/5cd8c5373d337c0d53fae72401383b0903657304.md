We are appealing for the public's help to find wanted man Tyrone Ellis.

Tyrone is 19 years-old from Kingstone in Herefordshire and is wanted for robbery and breaching a criminal behavioural order.

He also has links to Clehonger and surrounding areas.

If anyone sees him or knows of his whereabouts they should call 101. Alternatively, if you have information but don't feel comfortable speaking to police, you can speak to the independent charity Crimestoppers. It is 100% anonymous, they never ask your name and they cannot trace your call or I.P address. You can contact them online or by calling 0800 555 111.
