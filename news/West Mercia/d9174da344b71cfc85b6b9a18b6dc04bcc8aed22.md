Thank you to everyone who shared our appeal to find Peter Tew who was missing in Ludlow. He has now been found.

Peter was found with his two dogs by search teams last night. Despite the cold temperature he was talking to offices before being taken to hospital as a precautionary measure.

Thank you to everyone involved in the search and to everyone who shared our appeal.
