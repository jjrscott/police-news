**Fifty five year old Martin Saberi has today (Thursday 11 March) received a life sentence being a minimum of 24 years and 10 months in prison for the murder of Amy Griffiths in January 2019, the wounding of another woman and weapon possession.**

In February 2021, Saberi, from Brackley Close, Wallington, Surrey, pleaded guilty to the charge of murder and Section 18 wounding at Worcester Crown Court and was sentenced today, again at Worcester Crown Court.

The body of Amy, who was 51, was discovered by police officers at her flat in Chalverton Court in Droitwich on 14 January 2019. She had head and throat injuries and sadly, was declared dead at the scene.

Saberi was arrested by police officers in Hackney, London on Thursday 17 January, just three days later.

Detective Chief Inspector Carl Moore of the West Mercia Police Major Investigation Unit said: "Martin Saberi is very obviously a dangerous and violent individual and today's sentence reflects the horrific nature of both offences he pleaded guilty to, in which he attacked two women with a knife in completely unprovoked and unforgivable incidents.

"Amy was a much loved, much respected person who so many people have spoken warmly of and i know she is deeply missed by those whose lives she touched.

"Amy's family do not wish to make a statement and would ask that their privacy be respected as they continue to process the loss and be allowed to grieve. However, I hope today's outcome will provide some comfort to both them and Amy's friends far and wide, that justice has been done and that it will provide a small measure of closure knowing Saberi will spend so many years in prison."
