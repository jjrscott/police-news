Inspector Andrew Holliday said: "In August we launched an investigation after a distraught dog owner contacted us after their beloved pet sadly had to be put down having been attacked by another dog.

"It is our duty to investigate that death and to ensure that there isn't a dog that could be a potential risk to its owners, the wider public and other loved pets. We attended an address as part of this investigation, acting on a court issued warrant, and this did result in the seizure of an animal to support the investigation.

"Sadly we have not had any cooperation from the owner of the suspect dog and despite arrangements to meet yesterday (Sunday 20 December) they failed to attend. Once we have had that conversation we are hoping we will be able to conclude our investigation and return the dog to them.

"The dog is currently being cared for by the force, he appears very happy and and his tail is very much still wagging".
