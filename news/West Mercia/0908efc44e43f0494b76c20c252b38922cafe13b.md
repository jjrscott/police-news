We are appealing for any information relating to a reported robbery and assault in Bromsgrove on Sunday 26 July.

At around 9.20pm three young men aged between 15 years old and 17 years old approached a number of children in Sanders Park Skate Park and attempted to steal their bikes.

The suspects are all white, wore dark clothing and two of them were wearing thick puffa jackets with one of them arriving in the park on a small pink children's bike that was left at the scene. The suspects have tried to steal three bikes but have only succeeded in stealing one. During the robbery they have assaulted two of the victims.

PC David Hanson said: "This was cruel and violent robbery of children and their property. The one bike that they did steal was a grey mountain bike with green writing on the side with the brand name of the bike 'Claud Butler'. The bike also has a damaged gear lever. The suspects approached the park from the Willow Road direction onto the park and left going alongside the tennis courts.

"We would very much like to hear from anyone who witnessed the robbery or can help identify the stolen bike or suspects. If you have any information please call is us on 101 quoting crime number 22/62415/20 or online here https://bit.ly/338RMhd"
