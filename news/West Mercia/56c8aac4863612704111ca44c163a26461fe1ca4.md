A man pleaded guilty at court to murder and to a Section 18 wounding yesterday (15 February).

Martin Saberi, aged 55 and from Brackley Close, Wallington, Surrey, entered a guilty plea to the charges at Worcester Crown Court yesterday and will be sentenced on 11 March.

The body of Amy Griffiths, who was 51, was discovered by police officers at her flat in Chalverton Court in Droitwich on 14 January 2019. She had head and throat injuries and sadly, was declared dead at the scene.

Saberi was arrested by police officers in Hackney, London on the night of Monday 14 January and first appeared in court on Thursday 17 January.

Detective Chief Inspector Carl Moore said: "This was an extremely violent attack and we are pleased to see the defendant plead guilty to both Amy's murder and as well as a vicious attack in London."
