We would like to thank the public for their support of our earlier appeal to locate wanted Worcester man, Badar Ul Haq.

Earlier this evening Badar Ul Haq, who was wanted for stalking offences and a breach of bail, handed himself into officers at Worcester Police Station where he is now in custody.
