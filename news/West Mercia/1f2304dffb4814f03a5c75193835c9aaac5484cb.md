Four people are currently in custody at Worcester Police Station for drug offences.

A vehicle was stopped on the M5 Motorway at just before 12pm on Wednesday 8 July after information was shared by Merseyside Police.

A large quantity of Class A drugs were recovered with an estimated street value of Â£25,000* was discovered.

Four men aged 21, 25, 35 and 22 from the Liverpool area were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply controlled drugs and are currently in police custody.

Detective Inspector Jack Taylor said: "These arrests highlight how we work with other forces to target those who use our road networks for criminal activity. I want to reassure the public that we continue to work tirelessly to disrupt and stop the distribution of drugs both locally and nationally.

"We also continue to work closely with our local communities to listen to their concerns and act on their information. We are committed to tackling organised criminal activity to help keep people safe from harm."
