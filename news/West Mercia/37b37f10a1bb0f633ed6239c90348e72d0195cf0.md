We are appealing for witnesses to a single vehicle fatal collision on the M5 northbound between junctions 8 - 7 on Saturday (7 September).

The incident happened at around 8.30pm when a Black Vauxhall Corsa driving along the M5 northbound, between junctions 8-7, is believed to have come off the road and onto the hard shoulder before moving across the three lanes and colliding with the central barrier.

Sadly, the driver, a man in his 50s, was pronounced deceased at the scene. His next of kin has been informed.

Road closures were in place while emergency services were in attendance.

PC Karl Lacey from West Mercia Police said: "While investigations are ongoing to establish the circumstances surrounding this collision, we are appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the collision or has dash-cam footage of the incident to please come forward.

"Our thoughts remain with his family at this difficult time."

Anyone with any information or dash-cam footage is asked to contact West Mercia Police on 101 quoting incident number 774s of 7 September 2019.

Alternatively, information can be given anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
