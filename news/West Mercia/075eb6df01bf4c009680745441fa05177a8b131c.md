A kind donation made at Malinsgate Police Station in Telford has led to children in hospital over the Easter weekend receiving an Easter egg.

On Thursday, police at the station were visited by Morrison's community champions Jessica Clay and Becky Gibson who wanted to donate boxes of Easter eggs to police officers and staff.

While the kind gesture was welcomed, officers felt they wanted to donate the chocolate eggs to local children who may go without this Easter.

On Saturday, police contacted the children's ward and children's cancer ward at the Princess Royal Hospital who were delighted to receive the Easter eggs to be given to children in the wards.

Telford local policing commander, Superintendent Jim Baker, said: "The donation was a lovely gesture and we're incredibly grateful to both Jessica and Becky for thinking of us.

"However, we just felt we couldn't take the Easter eggs for ourselves and wanted to make sure those in our local community who may otherwise go without benefited from their goodwill and we're really pleased staff at the PRH were delighted with the delivery, and hope the children receiving care enjoyed the treat."

Dawn Walder, Play Specialist at The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust(SaTH) said: "We'd like to say a huge thank you to the police in Telford for thinking of us and our young patients. Being in hospital over Easter isn't much fun at the best of times, but in the current situation, these acts of kindness really do make a difference."

Morrison's Community Champions Jessica and Becky said: "We wanted to donate Easter eggs to all the key workers in and around Telford, to show our support and gratitude. Although Malinsgate police station were unable to accept them, we are happy they were donated to a worthy place and were able to cheer up the children at the hospital."
