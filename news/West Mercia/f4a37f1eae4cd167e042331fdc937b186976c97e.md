On Sunday 5 March officers were called to investigate reports a car stolen earlier in the day had been spotted parked at a car park in Bidford-on-Avon.

Sergeant Lee Baker said: "Officers quickly identified the vehicle as a car that had been stolen following a car key burglary at a home in Evesham. The car engine was still warm and a search of the vehicle revealed the car key as well as other potential evidence.

"With a description provided by a member of the public officers approached two men who matched the description they had been given. The two men tried to run and escape however officers quickly caught and detained them and both were arrested.

"One of the men arrested from Cambridge and in his late teens was wanted for various other offences and the other man also in his late teens from Surrey was arrested and bailed to appear at a police station on 4 May 2020.

"This was a great example of teamwork involving local officers, the Dog Unit and the Local Priority Policing Team working with the public after a victim's home was broken into and then their car stolen. I would like to thank them all for a job well done."
