Assistant Chief Constable Rachel Jones said: "We are currently experiencing technical issues with our call and recording systems. This has led to some delays in responding to calls.

"However, we are prioritising 999 calls, as you would expect, so please be reassured that the appropriate police response is still in place for all emergencies.

"Please only use the 999 number if you call is an emergency. For non-emergencies you can still use our online reporting system here https://www.westmercia.police.uk/ro/report/

"We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience whilst we address the issue."
