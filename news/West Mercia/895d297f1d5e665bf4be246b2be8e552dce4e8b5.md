We can confirm that sadly a body believed to be that of Chris West has been found at the Bromyard Downs.

Chris, who was 44 years-old, went missing from Bromyard on Friday 29 May.

Detective Constable Andrew Curson said: "We are sad to report that Chris was found on Sunday 31 May and has now been formally identified. His family has been informed and specially trained officers are supporting them at this tragic time.

"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the public who shared our appeals and helped in our search for Chris."

Chris' death is not being treated as suspicious.
