We are appealing for information after a motorcycle was stolen from a car park on Wolverhampton Road, Kidderminster.

At around midday on Sunday (27 September) two men on a scooter attempted to steal a Silver Yamaha motorcycle from the car park at The Island Pool, a woman intervened and received a minor injury to her arm which did not require medical treatment.

The two men then left the car park.

A few minutes later the two men returned and the motorcycle, registration MT10 SAM was stolen and they fled towards Wolverhampton along the Wolverhampton Road.

They are described as around 5ft 11ins tall, of medium build wearing green biker jackets and dark coloured helmets.

If you have any information or have seen the pictured motorcycle since Sunday please contact DC Sarah BYTHEWAY from Kidderminster on 01562 826192 quoting reference 22/82683/20
