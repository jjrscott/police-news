Officers are appealing for information following a sexual assault in Hereford.

At around 3.40pm on Wednesday 10 March a teenage girl was walking through an underpass that goes underneath Victoria Street (from the Sainsbury side to Tesco) when she became aware of a man trying to speak to her.

The man, who is described as around 6ft tall and in his early 20s, then sexually assaulted her. He left the scene when a member of the public walked into the underpass.

The suspect is described as wearing a face mask, hoody, a black puffa coat and is slightly chubby. It is believed he had walked from the direction of Tesco.

Investigating officer, Police Sergeant Mark Jones said: "While incidents like this are extremely rare, officers are in the area supporting and reassuring the local community and an investigation is under way.

"We would like to speak to anyone who may have seen the suspect or recognises the description of him. Anyone with information is urged to contact 101 quoting reference 526i of 23 March, or alternatively information can be reported online through the Tell Us About section of our website."

Anyone who believes they may be a victim of a sexual assault and needs support can contact West Mercia's Victim Advice Line. It is a free, independent and confidential support service. People can call 0800 952 3000 or visit the Victim Advice Line and do not have to have reported the offence to the police.
