Police are highlighting top tips to help keep you and your home safe this summer and decrease the number of potential burglaries.

During the hot weather people understandably like to have their windows and doors open, however this can make a home more vulnerable to intruders.

Here are some top tips to keep your home secure when also trying to keep cool in the hot months:

 * Ensure ALL windows and doors are locked when you leave your property
 * Ensure ground floor windows and doors, and easy accessible upper floor windows are locked at night
 * Ensure ladders are locked away/down at all times
 * Remove opportunities for burglars to hide by increasing lines of sight at the front of your property by trimming hedges and trees

 * Grow prickly hedges, roses around the perimeter of your back garden, these are known as defensive plants and provide a level of deterrence

 * Security light; install a dusk to dawn outside security light (at head height by front and back doors) this will enhance levels of surveillance/vision and will deter potential offenders
 * Intruder alarm systems and CCTV are effective in crime prevention and will improve levels of security at the property. Please note they should not be used in lieu of basic security measures
 * Secure side gates, ensure they are well maintained and keep them padlocked at all times
 * Keep valuables out of sight and away from windows and doors
 * Join your local neighbourhood watch
 * Wheelie bins and tools can be used to gain access to your home, keep wheelie bins out of view (ideally back garden) and lock away tools in a safe place
 * Clear or hide heavy _loose_ debris from garden areas such as bricks, slabs etc. as these can be used to access your home
 * Ensure sheds are padlocked at all times, shed alarms can be used to protect your shed
 * Ensure garage doors are secured and locked at all times
 * Ensure your property is marked to increase the likelihood of it being recovered in the event of theft, use products such as Smartwater and advertise the fact your property is marked by using stickers in windows
