We are aware that criminals are pretending to be police officers are again attempting to defraud people in North Worcestershire in a scam known as 'Courier Fraud'.

Detective Chief Inspector Gerry Smith said: "Following several successful and unsuccessful attempts in the last few days to defraud people in the Kidderminster and Stourport area, I would also ask the public to get in touch with elderly and vulnerable friends and family to warn them of the risk and to _**know what to do.**_

"Always remember that **no police officer** from any force or department will **ever** ask you to hand over money or transfer funds, regardless of their name or unit. I would like to reassure the community in Wyre Forest and across North Worcestershire that we are investigating these crimes and want to hear from anyone who has been contacted in this way"

"This scam is very elaborate, extremely convincing and cruel. If you think someone is trying to scam you, tell someone straight away. Don't be pressured. Give yourself time to stop and think.

"If the crime is still in progress, because for example, you have recently provided bank details or handed over cards or cash or are going to visit your bank or the caller has arranged for someone to visit your address to collect items, you should call the police to report this on 101. In an emergency dial 999."

"Please remember **the police will never contact you asking for your bank card, details, cash or ask you to go to a bank to withdraw cash**. If someone does, it's a scam - provide no details and hand nothing over, hang up, wait ten minutes then call 101."
