**Rural & Business Crime Officer Paul Crumpton has been holding property marking events around the north of the county in rural villages to promote Safer People and Safer Homes/Businesses.**

Pictured is Paul at Kington Farm Supplies who are a large supplier of machinery, feed and equipment to the farming and equine communities across Herefordshire.

"Promoting **We Don't Buy Crime, Rural Matters** and **Stop that thief initiatives** I offer bespoke crime reduction advice to farmers and can provide **Rural Matters** signage.

"All of the material and advice is designed to target the property owner and hopefully reduce the risk of becoming a victim of crime."

The manager of Kington Farm Supplies, Alan Dixon said: "We welcome your presence and would welcome you back the future; every bit of advice helps."

This evening Paul will be at Bridstow Village Hall giving a presentation to the Rural Community on staying safe. There will be lots of tailored and useful advice and tips to stay safe at home, work, online and personally.
