West Mercia Police are supporting the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) mobile phone campaign taking place 16 - 29 March, by targeting motorists who continue to use their handheld mobile phone at the wheel.

Distraction behind the wheel is such a significant contributory factor with regards to road collisions and this campaign demonstrates a willingness by police forces across the UK to tackle the issue of mobile phone use.

** ** Motorists caught using a handheld mobile phone while driving face a £200 fine and six points on their licence. Drivers caught twice face a lengthy ban - which could also then lead to a £1,000 fine. While new drivers - those who have passed within the last two years - face having their licence revoked if caught just once.

Over the past 3 years 4 people have been killed in road traffic collisions where mobile phone use was recorded as a contributory factor, with an additional 14 people suffering serious injuries. Last year 931 motorists in West Mercia were caught using their phone whilst behind the wheel.

Superintendent Mel Crowther for West Mercia Police said: "Driving while distracted by a mobile phone is completely unacceptable and puts everyone on the roads at risk of serious harm. Motorists should already be aware that using a mobile phone while driving is illegal. It's concerning that we still have drivers out there who are willing to risk driving whilst distracted and

West Mercia Police will be using this campaign to clamp down on this dangerous behaviour."
