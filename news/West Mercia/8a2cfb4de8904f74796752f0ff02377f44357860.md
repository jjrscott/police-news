A man has died after he fell from a bridge in Telford.

Yesterday (Sunday 14 February), a man in his 20s fell from a bridge on to the A442 at Stirchley Interchange. Sadly, he died as a result of his injuries.

The road was closed for several hours to allow emergency services to deal with the incident.

The death is not being treated as suspicious and there is not believed to be any third party involvement.

Detective Inspector Joanne Woods said: "This was clearly a tragic incident that has left the family of the man absolutely devastated and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time."

Enquiries will now be carried out on behalf of the Coroner and any witnesses can contact West Mercia Police online via the Tell Us About section of www.westmercia.pnn.police.uk using reference 00259_I_140202021.
