Police are continuing their search of a property in Saddlers Walk, Worcester.

The searches relate to the death of a woman last year and enquiries are ongoing to establish circumstances surrounding her death.

A cordon has been in place around the house since Thursday, August 6, whilst officers continue their investigation.

We are aware of local concern that we are searching for a body - this is not the case and we currently only searching inside the property.

A 42-year-old man was arrested on Wednesday 5 August and has since been released under investigation.
