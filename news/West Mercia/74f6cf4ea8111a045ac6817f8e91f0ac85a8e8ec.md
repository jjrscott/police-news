Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was reportedly in a collision with a vehicle outside Shrewsbury Train Station on Thursday 14 November.

It is believed the woman, who is in her 30s, was crossing the road at around 8.15pm when a silver vehicle, which was travelling through the traffic lights from the Castle Foregate direction towards Smithfield Road, was in collision with her.

The vehicle failed to stop and continued in the direction of Smithfield Road. The woman, who was still in the road, suffered a serious injury to her ankle. A second vehicle was then also in collision with the woman, however, this vehicle stopped at the scene.
