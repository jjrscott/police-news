We are appealing for witnesses or information after a woman was assaulted in Rubery.

The victim, a woman in her 40s, was returning to her parked car on Monday 14 December on New Road when she was involved in a disagreement with a man and woman in another car.

The man and woman then got out of their vehicle, which was possibly a Vauxhall Astra or Rover. It is reported that the man then spat out food toward the victim and the woman threw a drink over her and hit her in the face.

PC Christopher Evans said: "As part of our ongoing enquiry into this incident we would like to appeal to anyone who was in the area at around 10.40am and saw the incident or the suspects to please get in touch with us."

The female suspect is described as white, in her 30s and pregnant. She has long dark hair and was wearing a long black coat. The man is described as white, also in his 30s, with a goatee beard and brown hair. He was wearing a black top.

Anyone with information can report it here on the West Mercia Police website or call 101 quoting incident 22/105622/20 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
