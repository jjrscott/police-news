We are appealing for information following a single vehicle collision yesterday (3 July) on Astwood Lane, Redditch.

A white Peugeot Partner van has been seen to swerve onto the opposite lane, before drifting back onto the correct side of the carriageway. The van has then stopped after colliding with a tree on the verge.

The 72 year old driver was taken to the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham where he remains in intensive care.

If you saw this incident or have any information regarding it please contact us on 101 quoting reference 411I 020720.
