Police are appealing for witnesses to a road incident in Shrewsbury where a driver failed to stop.

At around 11pm on Saturday 19 September, on The Mount, two people were walking away from the town centre towards the Shelton traffic lights when a small dark car collided with a traffic code which then struck the victim.

The woman suffered injuries to her leg and was taken to Royal Shrewsbury Hospital where she is currently in a stable condition.

The driver of the vehicle did not stop at the scene and officers are keen to locate them.

Anyone with information or dash-cam footage is urged 101 quoting incident 00237i 21092020 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800555111. Alternatively information can be passed through the online reporting function on West Mercia Police website under the section Tell Us About https://www.westmercia.police.uk/
