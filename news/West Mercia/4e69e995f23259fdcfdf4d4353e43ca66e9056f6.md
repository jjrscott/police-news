Officers are appealing for any witnesses and anyone with any information to come forward following a serious assault on Friday 5 June in Worcester.

A man from Worcester in his late 40's was seriously assaulted by four people on Bransford Road in Worcester near to the Rushwick Roundabout at around 8.40pm. As a result of the attack the victim required hospital treatment for a head injury but has since been discharged.

Detective Sergeant Edward Jones said: "The victim was wearing blue jeans and a khaki/brown jacket and was riding his bicycle. He was aware he was being followed by a small silver vehicle from Bransford Road towards the Rushwick Roundabout A4440 before turning off the roundabout down a small side road. It was here that the attack happened.

"We are appealing for any witnesses who may have seen what happened or may know something about the incident or those involved. Any information can be given directly to Detective Constable Wood by calling 01905 331187. Alternatively, information can be passed to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
