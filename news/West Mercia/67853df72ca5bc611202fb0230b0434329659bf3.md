Officers are again appealing for information and any witnesses to come forward following a collision in Stourport on Tuesday 23 June around 9.45am, in which a car and a bicycle collided.

PC Cadwallader said: "The collision happened around 9.45am on the Gilgal, a one way system in Stourport.

"It would appear a car was travelling on Vale Road when it then turned right onto the Gilgal as the bicycle was approaching from the opposite direction and turning left onto the Gilgal.

"The car, a grey Ford EcoSport and the bicycle have then reportedly collided at low speed.

"The cyclist, a woman in her late 70s was seriously injured and is in hospital receiving medical care. While her injuries are not life threatening they are severe and she continues to receive treatment.

"Officers will be out and about in the local area on Tuesday morning to speak to local people as part of our on-going investigation.

"I would ask anyone who witnessed the incident or who was in the area and may have dashcam fitted to their vehicle to please contact me on 101 and quote incident number 144s of 23 June and ask for details to be sent to PC Cadwallader."
