On Friday 24 July Shrewsbury Safer Neighbourhood Team executed three misuse of drugs act warrants at various locations across the town.

An address in Monkmoor saw a 28 year old man from the address arrested on suspicion of possession of class C drugs, following a small quantity of suspected Class C subutex tablets being seized. He has since been released under investigation.

Two further addresses were searched in the Battlefield area of Shrewsbury, teams located a small quantity of suspected Class B cannabis at one of the addresses. Resulting in two men in their twenties being given cannabis street cautions.

Sergeant Rebecca Thomas from Shrewsbury SNT said "These search warrants were obtained to respond to the concerns about drugs supply in Shrewsbury.
