West Mercia Police are working with Worcester City Council to encourage the community of Worcester to get their bikes marked FREE at one of our four events, across the city centre.

Chief Inspector Gareth Morgan said: "I would strongly advise cyclists, who do cycle to work or the shops, to come along to one of our four events and get their bike marked for free. Additional to this, at selected events we will be giving free Smartwater kits for people to mark their property in their home."

"We take protecting peoples' bicycles and homes very seriously, and want to do all we can to protect your property. We would also encourage all cyclists to consider purchasing a strong, rigid, bike-specific lock such as a 'D' lock to prevent their bikes from being stolen. We can provide you with more advice for how to keep your property safe when you visit us at one of our events."

Come and speak to us and get your bike marked on Friday 23 & Saturday 24 October, 10am -4pm, at Angel Place (pop-up police gazebo), to book a place email Michael.Simpson@westmercia.pnn.police.uk ***free Smartwater kit for the first 50 people.**

Or, Monday 26 October, 9am - 11am, at Foregate Street Train Station, to book a place email community.safety@worcester.gov.uk

Wednesday 28 October, 2pm - 5.30pm at Shrub Hill Station, to book a place email community.safety@worcester.gov.uk

All our events will follow covid-19 social distancing guidelines at all times.

If you have any information regarding stolen cycles you can call independent charity Crimestoppers in confidence on 0800 555111.
