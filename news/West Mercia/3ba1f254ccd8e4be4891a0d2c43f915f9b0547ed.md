We are appealing for witnesses to an incident involving a pedestrian and a motorcyclist in Hereford.

At around 7pm on Monday 22 March near the Asda petrol station, a man in his twenties was crossing the petrol station exit road towards St Margaret's Road when a red and white motorbike rode past nearly knocking him over.

Anyone with information should contact 101 quoting reference 00589i of 22 March. Alternatively, if you have information but don't feel comfortable speaking to police, you can speak to the independent charity Crimestoppers. It is 100% anonymous, they never ask your name and they cannot trace your call or I.P address. You can contact them online or by calling 0800 555 111.
