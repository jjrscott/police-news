West Mercia Police are searching for a driver who injured a police officer with his car in Wythall on Tuesday 28 January.

At around 7.20pm an officer was alerted by a member of the public to two men acting suspiciously on Three Oaks Road. The officer went to speak to one of the men, who was in the driver's seat of a light coloured car. As the officer lent in the car reversed and he was dragged with it for around 70 yards (64 metres) before he fell to the floor.

The vehicle then turned round, picked up another man, before driving at the officer who, thankfully, was able to jump out of the way. The car then drove away from the area.

Chief Inspector Edward Hancox said: "It is completely appalling for a police officer to be injured whilst carrying out their duty. An investigation is underway to identify the driver and his passenger and I would urge them to do the right thing and come forward.

"Thankfully the officer didn't suffer life threatening or changing injuries and we are offering him our full support."

As part of this investigation West Mercia Police are asking anyone who witnessed the incident to call 101 quoting incident number 612s of 28 January.

Information can also be given without giving your name by calling the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website www.crimestoppers-uk.org
