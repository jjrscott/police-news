Police have arrested four people on suspicion of attempted murder following an incident in Stourport-on-Severn.

Officers arrested three men aged, 48,18,21 and a 21-year-old woman yesterday (Monday 14 December) in relation to an attack which happened at around 10.45pm on Friday 11 December, in Crossway Green. All four have bailed.

We are still appealing for witnesses to the incident and are keen to speak to a motorist who we believe stopped to help.

Anyone with information is urged to contact 101 quoting reference 701i or 11 December or call Crimestoppers on 0800 555111. Alternatively you can report information online anonymously through our Tell us about section
