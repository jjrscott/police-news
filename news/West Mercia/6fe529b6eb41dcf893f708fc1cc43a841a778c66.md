Officers are appealing for information following an incident on 15 July on Rough Hill, Redditch.

A woman was driving her car on Rough Hill around 5pm when a white Audi A3 has stopped suddenly in front of her. The male driver has left his car and verbally abused the victim through her passenger window. When he has made his way back to his car, he has reportedly punched the passenger door of the victim's car as she has tried to drive around him.

The suspect has then followed the victim to her home address and caused a great deal of distress and fear.

If you witnessed the incident please get in touch with us on 101 and quote log number 00544i of the 15 July 2020.
