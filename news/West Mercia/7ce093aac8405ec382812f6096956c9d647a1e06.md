We are appealing for information and releasing a CCTV image following an attempted burglary in Worcester.

The incident happened between 12pm and 1pm on Saturday 19 December at The Merchants House, South Quay when a man threw a rock through a window causing significant damage and then attempted to gain entry to a flat.

We are appealing to anyone who might recognise this man, who we hope can help us with our investigation.

Anyone with information is asked to report it online here or call West Mercia Police on 101 quoting crime reference number 22/107997/20.

Alternatively, information can be given to the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via the website.
