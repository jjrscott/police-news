At around 8.20am this morning (Wednesday 10 February) we received reports of a serious collision on the A448 in Stone near Kidderminster involving a pedestrian and an HGV.

One person was fatally injured in the collision and sadly man in his 40s, died at the scene.

The collision resulted in the closure of the A448 which then remained closed for several hours.

If you witnessed the incident, have dashcam footage or have any information that can help officers with their enquiries, please contact us via our online reporting function on West Mercia Police website here. We are especially interested in hearing from anyone who saw a pedestrian on the footpath running adjacent to the main road near to Stone between 8am and 8.30am.
