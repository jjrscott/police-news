We are appealing for witnesses after an altercation between two men in Redditch on Thursday 16 July.

At around 1pm on Birchfield Road two vehicles were nearly involved in a collision and one man is reported to have driven at the other driver when he tried to take photos of the number plate.

Fortunately there were no injuries or damage to the vehicles. However police are asking for anyone who saw the incident or has dashcam footage to come forward.

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting incident 00300 of 16 June or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
