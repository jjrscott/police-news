Officers are appealing for witnesses and information following a reported robbery on Alcester Road in Wythall on Friday 20 March.

PC George Bednall said "At around 11.15am on Friday 20 March two women were approached while in their car by four men, maybe in their mid-20s, in balaclavas and wearing all black who attacked them and stole several items.

"This was a particularly violent and scary unprovoked attack on two innocent women and while the victims didn't suffer serious injury they were understandably upset and shaken.

"I would ask that any witnesses to please come forward and to please get in touch now by calling 101, quoting incident number 170s of the 20 March."
