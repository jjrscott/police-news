We are appealing for witnesses to a serious collision near Ross-on-Wye in Herefordshire.

It happened on the A40 in Pontshill around 12.35pm today (6 December) and involved a blue Honda HRV and a grey Mercedes A200.

Both drivers sustained injuries in the collision with one of the drivers suffering serious injury and was taken to hospital by air ambulance which landed nearby.

Officers are keen to speak with anyone who saw the incident or has dash cam footage of the incident . Anyone with any information is asked to call West Mercia Police on 101 quoting incident number 036s of 6 December 2019
