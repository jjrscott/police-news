West Mercia Police is investigating a report of a suspicious incident in Hollywood yesterday evening (Friday 27 September).

At around 6pm, a 15-year-old girl was walking on The Innage when she noticed a man standing on the pavement next to a vehicle.

The male spoke to the girl, before getting into the vehicle and trying to get her to do the same.

The victim declined and ran off. She was not injured.

Det Sgt Iain Standing of West Mercia Police said: "We treat all reports of this nature seriously and this was an understandably upsetting experience for the victim.

"A number of enquiries are currently ongoing and patrols have been increased in the area to provide reassurance for the community.

"We are keen to identify the vehicle, described as a black Volkswagen van. The driver is described as a man with grey hair and blue eyes, who was wearing an orange waterproof jacket.

"If anyone witnessed the incident or recognises the description of the vehicle or the driver, please call West Mercia Police on 101, quoting incident number 662s of 27 September 2019. "

Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website
