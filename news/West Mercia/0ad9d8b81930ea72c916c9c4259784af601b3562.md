We are appealing for witnesses following a serious collision on Wednesday 4 December in Rednal involving a pedestrian.

At around 11am a pedestrian was crossing the road that leads to the car park between the Subway and Co Op stores on New Road, Rednal. A grey car, a Mitsubishi colt, driving along New Road reportedly struck the victim, a lady in her 80s whilst she was crossing the road.

The victim's injuries were serious and she was taken to hospital.

If anyone saw the incident or has any dash cam footage please contact West Mercia Police on 101 and quote incident number 0208s of 4 December 2019
