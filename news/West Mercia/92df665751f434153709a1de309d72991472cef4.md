A Rednal man has been sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty to three charges of robbery and three charges of possession of a bladed article in a public place following crimes in Rubery earlier this year.

Two robberies took place on September 3, one outside the Lloyds Bank on New Road and one outside the Rubery Late Night Pharmacy. The third robbery happened on September 4 at the Famous Cooking Chinese Takeaway on Bristol Road South.

West Mercia Police arrested Christopher Randall, 28, of Stilthouse Grove, Rednal shortly after and on December 19 he appeared at Worcester Crown Court, where he entered a guilty plea. He was sentenced to five years imprisonment for the robbery offences with an additional 14 months to be served concurrently for the possession of offensive weapon offences.

Investigating officer DC Claire Masters said: "These were very alarming incidents for the victims and we are pleased that, following our quick and thorough investigation, justice has been done for them."
