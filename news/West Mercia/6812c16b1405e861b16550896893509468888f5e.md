A venue in Telford has been fined £10,000 after breaching COVID legislations.

Police were called at around 4.45pm today (Friday 25 September) to reports of a post wedding party taking place at Stafford Park in Telford.

When officers attended they found around 120 people at the property.

Chief Superintendent Paul Moxley said: "The majority of our communities are adhering to the new COVID legislation and laws and are acting very responsibly. It is therefore unacceptable that a minority of people are continuing to disregard the rules and as a consequence a £10,000 fine was given to the organisation hosting the wedding party in Telford today.

"It is believed that around 120 people were attending the event in Stafford Park, all of whom left the venue when we attended and spoke to them. Therefore no fixed penalty notices were given to the guests."

Chief Superintendent Moxley continued: "We are taking a robust enforcement approach towards those who choose to intentionally break the law and in order to help suppress the virus and protect everyone, where people are clearly breaching the regulations they will be given a fine."
