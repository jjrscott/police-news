**Officers are appealing for information following a fire at a trading estate near Droitwich and the subsequent discovery of a large cannabis farm.**

On Thursday 30 April at around 5am, Hereford and Worcester Fire and Rescue Service attended a fire at a property in the Rushock Trading Estate on the A442. Fire officers called for police attendance when the property was found to contain a very large cannabis farm inside.

The electrical fire it believed to have been started by the equipment growing the plants which were in a number of specifically designed tents inside the property.

Sergeant Andy Wright from West Mercia Police said: "Thankfully these drugs never made it onto the streets and the plants and the growing equipment that survived the fire will now been destroyed.

"West Mercia Police is dedicated to tackling drug supply in the community and we will not tolerate drug dealing nor will we allow properties to be used for the production of cannabis.

"I would urge anyone who has seen any suspicious activity around Rushock Trading Estate over the last few months to please get in touch so that we can bring the offenders to justice."

Anyone with any information is asked to call West Mercia Police on 101 quoting incident number 0060s of 30 April 2020. Alternatively you can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
