West Mercia Police have recovered a body from the River Avon in Evesham.

Following reports of a man in the water yesterday morning (Wednesday 20 November) a search by police and other emergency services was conducted throughout the day. At around 4.45pm the body of man in his 30s was found and was pronounced dead at the scene.

The cause of death is not yet known and the man has been identified by police and his family have been notified.
