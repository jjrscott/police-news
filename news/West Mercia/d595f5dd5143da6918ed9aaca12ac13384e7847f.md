We are appealing for witnesses following a fatal collision in Hereford on Sunday evening (1 September)

Officers were called at 6.15pm on Sunday to reports that a motorbike and a green Deutz Fahr tractor collided on the A465 near Allensmore, Hereford.

Sadly, the two people travelling on the motorbike, a man in his 40s and a man in his 30s, were both pronounced deceased at the scene.

Ambulance and an off-duty GP were also on the scene.

Road closures were in place while emergency services were in attendance.

PC Sam Davies from West Mercia Police said: "Our thoughts remain with the victim's families at this difficult time."

She continued: "While investigations are ongoing, we are appealing for any witnesses who may have been in the area at the time of the incident and may have dash cam footage to please come forward."

Any witnesses are asked to contact West Mercia Police on 101 quoting reference 553s of 1 September 2019.

Alternatively, information can be given anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.

Issued by Alex Gale, Communications Officer at 12.25pm on Tuesday 3 September 2019
