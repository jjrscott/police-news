We can confirm that sadly a body was recovered from the river on Saturday 21 March following the search for Hereford man Michael Burbage who went missing on Monday 16 March.

Inspector Catherine Taylor said: "Unfortunately I have to report that a body was found during our search and rescue operation of the River Wye near Hoarwithy Bridge, Kings Caple on Saturday 21 March about 3pm.

"Although formal identification hasn't yet taken place, we believe the body of man discovered in the river to be that of 72 year old Michael Burbage from Hereford. Michael's family have been informed and specially trained officers are supporting them at this very upsetting time.

"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the public who shared our appeals and our thoughts and wishes go to Michael family's at this very difficult time."
