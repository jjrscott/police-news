A cordon in the Battlefield Road area of Shrewsbury has now been lifted following a report of a man with a firearm.

Around 4pm this afternoon police received a report a man was on the roof of Tesco Extra in Battlefield Road with what was believed to be a firearm.

A cordon was in put in place while officers carried out a search of the area.

The search has now been completed and it is believed the call was made in good faith.

Superintendent Jim Baker said: "We take all reports involving firearms incredibly seriously and as such armed officers were deployed to the area and a cordon put in place.

"An extensive search has been carried out by officers on the ground, the police helicopter and a fire and rescue service drone and we're satisfied the call was made in good faith and have been able to discount the information we initially acted on.

"I'd like to thank members of the public as there was an increased police presence in the area with some disruption to local residents. The cordon has now been lifted however regular patrols will continue to be carried out in the area to offer reassurance to the local community."
