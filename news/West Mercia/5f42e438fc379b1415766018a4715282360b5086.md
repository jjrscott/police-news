We are issuing a fresh appeal for witnesses to a collision in Malvern on Wednesday, 27 January and have released a CCTV image of the vehicle we believe was involved.

At around 5.30pm on Abbey Road a man in his seventies was struck by a vehicle and the driver failed to stop. The pedestrian suffered serious injuries to his leg and was taken to Worcestershire Royal Hospital but has now left and is home in a stable condition.

We believe a silver Ford Fiesta with a 2005 number plate was involved in the incident.

PC Hughes said: "We are keen to speak to any passers-by, or motorists who had driven down the road around the time of the incident. This will have been extremely traumatic for the victim who is fortunately now back at home recovering. We take these incidents very seriously and urge anyone with information to come forward."

Anyone with dash cam footage or information should call PC Hughes on 101 ext 7733404 quoting reference 00049i of 27 January, or alternatively report online using the Tell Us About function of our website.
