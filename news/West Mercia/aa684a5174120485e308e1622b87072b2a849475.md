Detectives investigating a robbery in Shrewsbury are appealing for witnesses.

The robbery happened around 3.30pm yesterday afternoon (Saturday 13 March) in Monkmoor Road.

A man, in his 80s, was withdrawing cash from the cashpoint outside Monkmoor Post Office and Newsagent, when a man in his 20s approached him and pushed him, causing him to drop the money. The offender then picked the money up and made off.

It's believed the offender was on a bicycle.

Officers are carrying out enquiries and appealing for witnesses.

Detective Sergeant Darren Stacey, said: "Thankfully the victim in this robbery was not injured, but it is clearly an upsetting incident. We're asking anyone who was in the area on Saturday afternoon and saw a man on a bike, or may have information that may help with our enquiries to identify him, to get in contact with us."
