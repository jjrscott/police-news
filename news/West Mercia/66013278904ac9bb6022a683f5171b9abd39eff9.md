Five youths have been arrested after a man was stabbed in Brookside last week.

The assault happened around 7.10pm on Thursday 6 February in Bembridge. A 26 year old man was taken to hospital with stab wounds.

Five boys aged between 12 and 16 have been arrested on suspicion of assault and have been released on police bail.

Enquiries are on-going and police are continuing to appeal for witnesses.

DS Adrian Jones, said: "If anyone has any information that may help with our enquiries we would ask them to get in contact with us. The assault happened around 7.10pm on Thursday evening in Bembridge in Brookside, if anyone has CCTV or was driving in the area and has dash cam and has not yet spoken to us we would urge them to get in contact."

Last year police launched an initiative in Telford that sees police work with other agencies to identify and support young people on the periphery of knife crime. The Steer Clear Programme sees police work with Telford & Wrekin Council, West Midlands Ambulance Service and charity organisations to raise awareness of the consequences of knife crime and provide alternative opportunities to young people.
