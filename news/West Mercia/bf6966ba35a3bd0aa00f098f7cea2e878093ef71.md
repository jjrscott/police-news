We are appealing for witnesses or information following a burglary in Ross on Wye in the early hours of Monday morning (28 October 2019).

Detective Inspector Rob Davies said: "At around 2am officers responded to calls of a reported burglary at a commercial premises on the Haigh Industrial Estate.

"The suspects stole a number of shotguns and it is suspected they may have had a vehicle parked nearby in order to make their escape.

"I would like to reassure the community that a thorough investigation is under way and my team and I are reviewing a number of lines of enquiry.

"I would ask anyone who may have witnessed the burglary, seen anything suspicious in the area between 11pm and 3am or has any information that could help with our investigation to please call West Mercia Police on 101, quoting incident number 038s of 28 October 2019."
