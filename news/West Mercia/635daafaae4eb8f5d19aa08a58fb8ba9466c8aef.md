Two West Mercia Police officers have today (Thursday 7 November) been charged following the death of Dalian Atkinson in Telford in 2016.

The incident was referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (then known as the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC)) who carried out an independent investigation into West Mercia Police's contact with Mr Atkinson prior to his death.

The IOPC subsequently referred the case to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for a charging decision and today they have authorised a charge of murder against one officer, with unlawful act manslaughter as an alternative offence. A second officer has been charged with assault causing actual bodily harm (ABH).

Chief Constable Anthony Bangham said: "Our thoughts continue to remain with the family and friends of Dalian Atkinson at this difficult time.

"We understand the need for answers, however, as court proceedings are now underway it would not be appropriate for us to make any further comment regarding the circumstances of Mr Atkinson's death.

"The officers involved have a right to a fair trial and we will continue to make sure they have the appropriate support throughout the forthcoming criminal justice process."
