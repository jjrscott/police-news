Officers are currently responding to a road traffic collision on the A49 at Leominster.

We received the call to the collision, which involved a car and a fuel tanker, at just after 8.50am this morning (Saturday 26 December).

The road is currently closed while emergency services deal with the incident.

While there are not believed to be any serious injuries, the road may be closed for some time and we would ask you to seek an alternative route.
