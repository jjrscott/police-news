### A Telford man has been given a criminal behaviour order banning him from requesting money from people in Shropshire.

On Friday (25 September) Armadeep Rana, 31, of Far Vallens in Hadley, was given a three year order at Telford Magistrates Court after the court found beyond reasonable double that he had engaged in behaviour that caused or was likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to any person.

The court also considered that making the order will help in prevent further such behaviour.

Local Safer Neighbourhood Sergeant Steve Tandy said: "We know that Rana's behaviour has caused considerable distress to the local community and hope this order will give them some reprieve. If Rana breaches the order he will face arrest and I would ask anyone who has information that he has breached the conditions to let us know."

The order prohibits Rana from:

\- Knock on doors of any residential property with the County of Shropshire with the intention of requesting money from the occupants of that property.

\- Approach members of the public and request money from anywhere within the County of Shropshire.

\- Be within the boundary of any residential property within the County of Shropshire without express permission from the owner or occupier of that property.

The order will be in place for three years until 25 September 2023.
