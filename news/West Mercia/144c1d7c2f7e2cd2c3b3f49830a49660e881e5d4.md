**Police statement regarding police investigation into maternity services and provision at Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Hospital Trust**

Assistant Chief Constable Geoff Wessell from West Mercia Police said: "Today, 30 June 2020, we have met with NHS Improvement, The Department of Health and the independent reviewer to discuss complaints made against Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Hospital Trust in relation to maternity services and provision. The independent review is ongoing.

"We can confirm that a police investigation will be conducted to explore whether there is evidence to support a criminal case either against the Trust or any individuals involved. The investigation is now live so we are unable to comment any further at this time."

If anyone has any information in relation to this issue, who hasn't already been in touch with the review team can do so through the Major Incident Public Portal _https://mipp.police.uk/operation/22HQ19D84-PO1_ or by calling 101.
