Chief Constable of West Mercia Police, Anthony Bangham, has issued a statement following the announcement of the new lockdown for the country as we continue to work together to prevent the further spread of Covid-19.

Chief Constable Bangham said: "Over the last year the vast majority of people in our communities have kept to the rules and I am confident that they will continue to do so through this new phase of the pandemic.

"West Mercia Police will continue to be visible across our villages, towns and cities working with our partners to do all we can to prevent the spread of the virus. As the public would expect, we will respond firmly, but fairly, using all the powers available to us to take action against those people that flout the laws and knowingly put others at risk.

"Policing across West Mercia will continue unabated throughout the lockdown and as the Prime Minster outlined yesterday help is available to anyone whose home is not a safe place to be. We would like to emphasise that we are still here for you 24/7."

We are awaiting the official regulations from the Government and will share them on our website and social media channels as soon as we can.
