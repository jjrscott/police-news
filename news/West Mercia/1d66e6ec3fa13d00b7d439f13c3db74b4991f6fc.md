We are appealing for witnesses who may have seen an incident in the car park at Lidl, Hadley on Tuesday (14 July).

At around 6.15pm on Tuesday a woman was assaulted by a man known to her when he drove his car into her, colliding with her hip, before he then dragged her into the car while psychically assaulting her.

It is believed there were people in the car park at the time and a member of the public approached the victims, we are keen to talk to them as we believe they have information or footage that might help our investigation.

If you have any information please get in contact with PC Sian Evans via 101 quoting reference 599 of 14 July.
