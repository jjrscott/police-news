Detectives are appealing for information following a sexual assault in Worcester on Wednesday 15 July.

At around 5.15pm a man entered a property in Blakefield Road, St John's, and sexually assaulted a woman.

The suspect is described as white with a tanned complexion, aged between late 30s and early 40s and approximately 5ft 11in tall. He had stubble on his face with acne-type scarring and a shaved head. He was wearing a black puffa style jacket and blue jeans.

Detective Sergeant Dan Fenn said: "While incidents like this are extremely rare, extra patrols are in the area today supporting and reassuring the local community and an investigation is under way. Specially trained officers are supporting the victim.

"We would like to speak to anyone who may have seen the suspect or recognises the description of him."

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting 00591_I_15072020
