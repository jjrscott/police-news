An arrest has been made following our appeal regarding an attempted robbery in Bromyard on Tuesday (24 November).

On Monday (23 November) evening a man entered the Premier shop on High Street and threatened the cashier with a knife, before leaving the shop.

A 16-year-old boy from Bromyard has been arrested on suspicion of robbery and also on suspicion of possession of a Class B drug with intent to supply (cannabis).

Thank you to everyone who shared our appeal.
