Joint patrols between police and The Children's Society's Climb programme are helping safeguard children and young people at risk of Child Criminal Exploitation in Shropshire.

The Climb programme was launched last year, thanks to funding from West Mercia Police and Crime Commissioner John Campion, and supports children and young people aged 10 to 17 across the counties covered by West Mercia Police.

The service offers early help to support young people who are at risk of being exploited, including into county lines operations.

 To help identify those at risk at an early stage staff from Climb have carried out joint patrols with Shrewsbury Safer Neighbourhood Team throughout The Quarry in Shrewsbury.

Shrewsbury Safer Neighbourhood Inspector Saf Ali said: "Our officers already carried out patrols throughout the Quarry as part of their regular patrols and it seemed to be a good opportunity for staff from Climb to join our officers at key times so that where we do identify concerns a young person may be at risk of being exploited we can ensure they are getting support at an early stage to help prevent this.

"The joint patrols have proven to be a great success so far and we have been able to engage with a number of young people and offer early intervention."

Police say there is no specific information to suggest those looking to exploit children and young people specifically target The Quarry however as it is a place where people gather it offers an opportunity to offer reassurance and early help.

Police and Crime Commissioner John Campion said: "I'm committed to improving the lives of young people, so I'm pleased that the Climb project has been able to work with West Mercia Police. Together we have the power to reduce the risk of young people being exposed to criminality or exploitation by intervening where possible and building resilience within these young people.

"Patrols like these are so important, as the trauma these individuals can experience in their lives leaves them vulnerable, which greatly increases the risk of them being exploited or entering the criminal justice system."

Jessica Whitfield, Service Manager at The Children's Society, said: "Sadly, criminals have continued to target and take advantage of vulnerable children since the pandemic at a time when they may be feeling lonely, worried about family finances and feeling there is little chance to escape problems and dangers at home.

"We have welcomed the opportunity to join these patrols, which are a valuable opportunity to spot the warning signs of grooming and exploitation and ensure we can offer children at risk the help they so desperately need.

"Our Look Closer campaign encourages everyone to report any concerns about a child to the police and be vigilant for signs of exploitation which could include anything from a child seeming frightened or angry to being seen with large amounts of cash or appearing under someone's control."

The joint patrols will resume and continue on a regular basis when the current Covid-19 restrictions allow.

This week, The Children's Society's national Prevention programme launched a Look Closer Awareness Week. It is encouraging people to keep a particular eye out for children who may be at risk in public spaces which continue to be open or in use during lockdown. These include parks, supermarkets, takeaways and banks, as well as taxis and trains - all places where it may be easier for criminals to groom children and exploit them into illegal activity in plain sight. The charity says the internet is also a public space and is encouraging everyone to look out for signs of exploitation when they are online after evidence of an upsurge in online grooming during the first lockdown. It wants parents and carers to be alert for risks to their children, including when they are using social media and chat functions in online games.
