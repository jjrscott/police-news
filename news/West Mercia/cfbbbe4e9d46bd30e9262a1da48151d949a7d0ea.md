Students in Shrewsbury have been given the opportunity to support their local policing team.

Over the past few months the local Safer Neighbourhood Team has been working with the University of Chester to build links between students at the Shrewsbury campus and police.

Now, a student at the campus has been given the opportunity to join the Safer

Neighbourhood Team as a volunteer, providing support to the team as well as a valuable insight into life as a student in the town.

Shrewsbury Safer Neighbourhood Inspector, Saf Ali, said: "The opportunity will be a great opportunity for the successful candidate to gain real life experience as police officer, engaging with members of the public and supporting the work we do.

"The great benefit for us is it will give us an insight into life as a student in the town and what we can do to best assist as well as help us share crucial messages about to help keep students safe while they are studying in Shrewsbury."

Police and Crime Commissioner John Campion said: "I have been pleased to support this interesting opportunity that will no doubt give this student an invaluable experience, but will also benefit the force when it comes to communicating with community members of this age.

"As Commissioner, I think it's so important that we find ways to engage with the younger generation and give them a platform. By working together we can really make a difference and have a greater impact within our communities."

The University of Chester said: "The University of Chester is pleased to be able to support Shrewsbury Safer Neighbourhood Team which offers students a great volunteering experience and is also a great way for the University to become more involved with all sectors of the local community."
