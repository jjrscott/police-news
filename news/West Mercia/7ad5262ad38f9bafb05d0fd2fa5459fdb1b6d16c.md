Police are investigating the deaths of two men in Shropshire.

At 4.15pm yesterday afternoon (Thursday 22 May) police were informed a man had been found dead in a field in Knowle Sands Caravan Park in Bridgnorth. It is believed the man, who was 67, died after being assaulted.

A short time later the body of a man, in his 70s, was found on a track off the B4555 Bridgnorth to Eardington. There is not believed to be any third party involvement in his death.

It is believed the deaths are linked and police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths.

Detective Chief Inspector Mark Bellamy said: "This is clearly a very tragic incident that has seen two men lose their lives and our thoughts are with their family and friends at this difficult time. We do believe the deaths are linked and at this stage are not looking for anyone else in connection with them."
