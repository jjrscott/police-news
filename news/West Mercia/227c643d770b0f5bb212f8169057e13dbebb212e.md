Officers are appealing for the public's help to locate a 32 year-old man who has gone missing from Worcester.

James Bannister was last seen at around midnight on the morning of Friday 19 February in the Fownes Hotel, Worcester, before leaving the hotel on foot.

James is believed to have links to Birmingham and Somerset and we are growing increasingly concerned for his welfare.

James is white, with long dark hair, a long beard and was wearing a beanie hat. He is about 6 foot tall, average build and was last seen wearing a long dark coat and dark jeans.
