In response to a photograph circulating of WMP officers posing with guests at a large wedding in Telford, West Mercia have issued a further statement:

Chief Superintendent Sue Thomas said: "We were called to an event in Telford and a number of wedding guests were spoken to after concerns were raised about inappropriate driving. Enquiries are still ongoing in regards to potential offences.

"With regards to the officer's engagement with the wedding party, we acknowledge that the officers should have taken a more proactive approach regarding social distancing, both to the wedding guests and themselves, and they have been spoken to in relation to this, as their actions do not reflect our expectations.

"As part of their engagement with the wedding party, the officers agreed to pose for a photo but were not making any kind of statement.

"The wedding reception was not held within the West Mercia Police area and, as such, we are unable to comment around the response to the actual gathering. However, we do take the concerns of the public very seriously and we are committed to engaging with and educating residents and but where necessary we will use enforcement powers to ensure the safety of the public."
