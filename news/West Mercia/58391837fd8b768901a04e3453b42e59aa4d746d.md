We are appealing for witnesses after a teenager was robbed in Telford on Saturday 25 July.

At around 5.50pm on St George's Road near Donnington Wood roundabout a 13-year-old boy was threatened by two men who took his phone, bag and some cash from him.

The offenders were described as around 18-years-old, between 5ft 8ins and 5ft 10ins, with short black hair. One wore a black tracksuit, the other wore a grey tracksuit and was of slim build. Both men spoke with an Irish accent.

Anyone with information should contact West Mercia police on 101 quoting incident 718 of 25 July. Alternatively information can be passed anonymously to Crimestoppers by calling 0800 555111.
