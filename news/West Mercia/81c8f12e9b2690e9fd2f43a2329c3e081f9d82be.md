We are appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Bromsgrove on Sunday 14 March.

At around 7.25pm a man has entered a store on Deansway and approached the counter brandishing a knife at the shop worker.

The offender eventually left with a quantity of cash.

If you saw the man in the CCTV image we are keen to speak to him as he may be able to help our investigation.

If you have any information about this incident please contact the team on 01527 586365 quoting reference 524i 14 March.

Alternatively, if you have information but don't feel comfortable speaking to police, you can speak to the independent charity Crimestoppers. It is 100% anonymous, they never ask your name and they cannot trace your call or I.P address. You can contact them online or by calling 0800 555 111.
