We would like to thank the public for sharing our appeal for missing man Kyle McLeod-Finch.

We are pleased to say that officers have located Kyle and he is safe and well. Kyle, from Stourport, went missing this morning causing great concern for both family and officers.

Thank you again to everyone who helped in our appeal.
