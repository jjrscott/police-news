Five people have been arrested after drug warrants were carried out in Brookside in Telford.

Officers carried out the raids in Burford and Blakemore at around 5pm on Thursday 30 July.

Two men, both aged 18, and a 15-year-old boy, were arrested outside the address in Burford and a man and woman were arrested inside. The 15-year-old has since been released while the rest remain under investigation for drugs supply offences.

Class A and B drugs, phones, cash and other drug paraphernalia were seized during the operation.

A police drugs dog made a positive indication at the Blakemore address and a bag of white powder was seized for testing.

Inspector Barry Spencer said: "We have been carrying warrants such as this based on intelligence as part of a wider operation throughout Telford to tackle drug dealing and organised crime in the area.

"This was an incredibly successful raid with some positive results, having arrested several people on suspicion of supplying drugs in Telford.

"We are committed to doing everything possible to prevent people becoming victims of those involved in drugs and organised crime to ensure Telford is a safe and pleasant place to live and work.

"We hope this serves as a warning to others that the distribution of drugs will not be tolerated."
