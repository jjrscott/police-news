A woman from Birmingham has today (22 October) begun a 10 year prison sentence after she was found guilty of manslaughter at court yesterday (21 October).

Cordelia Farrell, 38 years old from Dainton Grove, Birmingham was handed the sentence this morning at Worcester Crown Court after standing trial for the murder of Wayne Coventry. The jury found her not guilty of murder but subsequently found her guilty of manslaughter.

37 year old Wayne was killed when, following an altercation at his home in Bromsgrove on Monday 14 October 2019, Farrell took a knife and stabbed him in the chest and he sadly died at the scene.

Following the assault, Farrell fled the house and handed herself in on 19 October at a police station in Birmingham. She was later charged with murder.

In addition to the ten year prison term, Farrell was also given an 18 month sentence for aggravated bodily harm to run concurrently and has been told she will serve at least two thirds of her total sentence.
