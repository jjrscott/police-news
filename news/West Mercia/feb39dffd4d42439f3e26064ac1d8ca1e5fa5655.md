We can confirm officers are conducting a search at a property in Smorral Lane, Corley, Warwickshire, as part of an ongoing investigation into the death of Jesse Richards in 2009.

Five men were jailed in connection with Jesse's death in 2009 but his body has never been located. Searches continue at the site and a cordon remains at the scene.

Detective Inspector Mark Peters said: "Our officers remain at the scene and I would like to take this opportunity to again appeal to members of the public who may have information that could assist us in our search for Jesse."

Anyone with any information is urged to call 101 quoting 204-s-220620.
