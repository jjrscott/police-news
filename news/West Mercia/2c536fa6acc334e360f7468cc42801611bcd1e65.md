**As part of our response to adapting to how we work remotely and safely during these testing times, the Regional Cyber Crime Unit are hosting weekly livestreams to help individuals and businesses keep themselves protected against Cyber Crime.**

To cater for demand and security, the platform is now being updated to YouTube Live.

**On Mondays and Fridays 10:00am - 10:30am** (excluding bank holidays) we will be hosting live 'Cyber Security Awareness Training' presentations via YouTube Live. Presentations are suitable for everyone, including internal staff, as the information shared is non-restricted and public facing. We will be utilising the new advice from the NCSC and Cyber Aware to educate end users on the 6 top tips to protect them from Cyber Crime along with what their business can be doing also to best protect themselves as an organisation.

LiveStream dates are below -

Viewers can sign up via Eventbrite to get the relevant secure link to the presentation and get access to the included information pack.
