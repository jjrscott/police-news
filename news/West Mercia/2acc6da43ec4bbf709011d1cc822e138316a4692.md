A motorcyclist died yesterday afternoon (Monday 27 April) following an incident on Primsland Way in Droitwich, Worcestershire.

At around 4pm a police officer was travelling in a marked police car to an emergency when a Yamaha scooter, travelling ahead of them in the same lane, collided with a tree.

The motorcyclist, a 21-year-old from Worcester, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene and the road remained closed for around 6 hours whilst the emergency services, including the police helicopter, responded to the incident.

Superintendent Steph Brighton said: "We are aware that there is some natural speculation in the community surrounding the circumstances of this incident and the proximity of a police car.

"The officer was responding to a separate incident at the time. However, due to the proximity of the police car we have referred the matter to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, as is standard practice.

"We cannot even begin to imagine how difficult this is for the young man's family and our thoughts are with them and his friends."

Any witnesses to the collision, that haven't yet spoken to officers, are asked to contact West Mercia Police on 101, quoting incident number 419s of April 27.
