We are appealing for any information and any witnesses to come forward following a fatal road traffic collision in Hereford.

Between 11.30pm and 3am, the car which had two occupants inside, was travelling between Mordiford and Dormington and appears to have left the road at Clay Hill Pit in Hereford. The car has finally settled in a roadside orchard.

Tragically, a 23 year old man and a 17 year old girl inside the car were killed.

Chief Inspector Edd Williams said: "Our thoughts are very much with the family and friends of both victims at this extremely difficult time.

"An investigation is underway to establish the circumstances of the collision. If you have any information please call us on 101 and quote incident number 184 of 24 July 2020.
