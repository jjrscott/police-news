A man has been arrested in connection with a death in Telford today (Saturday 20 March).

At around 12:30am we were called by the ambulance service following the death of a woman in her fifties at her home in Malinslee.

A 40-year-old man from Telford has been arrested on suspicion of murder and currently remains in custody.

We would like to reassure the community that this is believed to be an isolated incident.
