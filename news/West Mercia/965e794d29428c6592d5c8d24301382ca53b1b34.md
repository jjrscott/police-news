Staff at a shop in Redditch have been praised by a senior police officer after their actions helped in the arrest of a person suspected of attempted robbery.

Inspector Mark Chappell said: "On Monday 6 January 2020 officers were called around 11pm by staff at the McColl's store in Church Hill Centre, Redditch in response to an attempted robbery. The suspect had demanded money from the till as well as cigarettes and produced what appeared to be a mock firearm.

"Even though the staff were understandably scared they were able to provide the police with a clear description of the suspect and following local enquires by officers the person, a woman in her 30s from Redditch was arrested at her home. A BB gun was also seized.

"I would like to commend the staff for their bravery and their coolness under pressure dealing with what will have been a very unsettling incident and I'm pleased to say that an offender has been arrested and is in custody."

If you witnessed the incident or have any information please call 101 and quote incident number 715s of 6 January 2020.
