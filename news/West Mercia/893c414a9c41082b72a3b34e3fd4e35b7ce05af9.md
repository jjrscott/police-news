On Sunday 20 December police attended a report of around 40 - 50 people gathering in Malvern Quarry car park. Officers asked those in attendance to disperse and the organiser was issued with a Â£10,000 fine.

South Worcestershire Safer Neighbourhood Chief Inspector Gareth Morgan, said: "I've been really pleased with the co-operation and understanding we've had from members of our community in relation to the Covid-19 regulations so far and it is disappointing we have had to attend such a gathering and issue a fine to the organiser.

"The restrictions that have been placed on us have meant it has been a difficult year for everyone in particular the strain of changed plans for many at Christmas."

He continued: "We want everyone to be able to enjoy the festive season, but please do so safely and within the regulations.

"It is now as important as ever we all do our bit to stay safe and protect ourselves, our family and our friends."

Malvern is currently placed in Tier 2 (high alert).
