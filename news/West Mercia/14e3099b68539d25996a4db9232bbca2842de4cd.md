We are appealing for any information relating to a reported robbery and assault in Redditch on Monday 1 March.

At around 3.30pm a man in his 40s has approached a woman and forced her to the ground taking her mobile phone and hotel key card, near to the bus stop and outside the church at the Matchborough Centre on Matchborough Way.

The man is described as white, wore a dark blue long sleeved hooded jacket and a dark blue body-warmer. He had a bald head with a goatee style beard.

The victim, a woman in her 40s, was wearing a white puffer style coat and black trousers with white stars.

She has received minor injuries during the attack.

We would very much like to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident especially those that where on a nearby bus at the time and may have witnessed the incident.

Anyone with information is asked to report it online here or call 101 quoting crime number 00380_I_01032021.

If you have information but don't feel comfortable speaking to police, you can speak to the independent charity Crimestoppers. It is 100% anonymous, they never ask your name and they cannot trace your call or I.P address. You can contact them online or by calling 0800 555 111.
