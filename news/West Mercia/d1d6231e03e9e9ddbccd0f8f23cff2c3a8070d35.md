We're appealing for witnesses after a woman was assaulted in Ironbridge.

The incident happened around 11.30am on Saturday 16 January on The Lloyds in Ironbridge.

The woman was pushed to the ground and punched by a cyclist after she requested he slow down and cycle with more consideration.

The cyclist is described as a white male, approximately 60 years old with grey hair and a grey beard. He was wearing a black full cycle suit and riding a black bike with lime green brake cables.

Officers are appealing for witnesses to the incident.
