We are appealing for witnesses following a road traffic collision on Blackpole Road, Worcester earlier today (Friday 24 April).

The incident occurred at just before 10am when a police car and a private ambulance working for the NHS were in collision. The police officer, who was driving the police car, sustained injuries which are not believed to be life threatening and was taken to hospital. He is expected to be released later today. The ambulance driver and his passenger did not require hospital treatment.

The road was closed while the emergency services responded to the incident.

Investigating officers are appealing for information from the public including dash-cam footage.

Sergeant Dan Bate said: "We are keen to speak with anyone who may have seen the collision on Blackpole Road so we can get a better understanding of what happened.

"We would really like to hear from anyone who might have dash-cam footage from the area at the time of the incident."

Anyone with information should email Sergeant Dan Bate on daniel.bate@westmercia.pnn.police.uk quoting incident number 138s of 240420.

Alternatively, if you want to give information but don't want to give your name you can call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 11 or use their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org
