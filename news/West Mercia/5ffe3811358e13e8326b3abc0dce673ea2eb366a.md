Two men have been arrested in Shropshire after sheep were stolen and an appeal has been launched to find the animals' owner.

At around 1.30am this morning (Tuesday 5 January) a vehicle failed to stop for officers on the A454 near Bridgnorth. Following a pursuit the car was stopped and police found four sheep in the vehicle which are believed to have been stolen from a local farm.

The two men, aged 28 and 23 from Wolverhampton, were taken into custody where they currently remain.

Inspector Nikki Roberts said: "I am really please we managed to rescue the sheep and now we just need to reunite them with their proper owners. I ask all nearby farmers to check their livestock to ensure none are missing and if they are contact us. Hopefully we can get the sheep home soon.

"Fortunately sheep stealing is quite rare in the area unlike other parts of the country and we believe this is an isolated case, however we take all rural crime extremely seriously and understand the impact the theft of livestock can have on farmers and their livelihoods. "

If you have information or are missing any livestock please call 101 quoting reference 21i of 5 January or report through the Tell Us About section of our website here.
