This afternoon the Government announced that the area we serve (Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Shropshire & Telford and Wrekin) will all be within Tier 3, effective from 00.01hrs tomorrow (Thursday 31 December).

We understand this will be disappointing, particularly as for some it will mean changing New Year's Eve plans, but we are asking the public to be responsible and to mark the end of 2020 in line with the restrictions.

Deputy Chief Constable Julian Moss said: "As much as many people may want to be out celebrating the end of the year we all need to follow the restrictions a bit longer and have our New Year celebrations the '2020 way' to help us get back to "normal" as soon as possible.

"We are sure that the vast majority of our communities will respect the rules, as they have since March, and we continue to be thankful for their support, community spirit and care for those around them.

"Those that put others at risk of this deadly virus by committing serious breaches, such as organising large gatherings and parties for New Year's Eve, can expect a visit from our officers and a Â£10,000 fine.

"Each year we have additional resources in place for New Year's Eve to support our communities in enjoying the celebrations safely. In that respect, this year is no different and extra officers will be on patrol throughout the evening and early hours."

The tier 3 restrictions can be found on the government website here.
