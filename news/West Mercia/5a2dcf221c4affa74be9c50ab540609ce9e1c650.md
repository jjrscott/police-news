Police are appealing for witnesses and dashcam footage of a fatal collision on the M50 eastbound near Ledbury.

At around 12.20am on Monday 31 August a Jeep Cherokee was involved in a collision and a man in his thirties sadly died at the scene.

Our thoughts are with the man's friends and family at this difficult time.

Anyone with information is urged to contact police on 101 quoting incident 121i of 31 August or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111. Alternatively information can be passed through the online reporting function on West Mercia Police website under the section Tell Us About https://www.westmercia.police.uk/
