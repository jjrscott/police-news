Five people were arrested in connection with county lines drug supply in various operations across Hereford during a national County Lines Intensification Week that took place between Monday 14 September and Sunday 20 September.

Considerable quantities of drugs and cash were seized by police during the week of intensification.

Three men have been charged and remanded to custody and two men have been bailed.

Detective Sergeant Nick Shutt, of Herefordshire Proactive CID, said: "Tackling serious and organised crime, such as county lines, is a priority for us and we will continue to do all we can to target those exploiting children, young people and vulnerable adults under our campaign protect."

Protect is West Mercia Police's response to tackling serious and organised crime and those who cause the most harm in our communities to protect people from harm.
