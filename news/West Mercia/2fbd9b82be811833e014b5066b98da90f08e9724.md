We are appealing for the public's help in locating Johnny Cash who is wanted in connection to a kidnapping offence which happened in Evesham.

Cash, who is 20 years-old, also goes by the names of John Doran, Josh Connors, Michael Connors and Johnny McCain.

It is believed he may currently be in the Staines area.

If you have seen Cash do not approach him and call 101 with information. Alternatively, information can be passed to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
