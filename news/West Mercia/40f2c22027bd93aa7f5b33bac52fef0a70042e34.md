We are appealing for witnesses to an incident in Lowesmoor, Worcester, that happened at around 2pm on Sunday 5 January.

The incident involved people within two vehicles, a red BMW and a black Audi.

It is believed there were at least two men in the black Audi and one man and a woman in a red BMW.

It is believed that an altercation and threats were made between the men in the vehicles, and that they maybe known to each other.

The investigation is ongoing.

West Mercia Detective Sergeant Sam Bache said: "We are appealing for any witnesses to this altercation so that we can better understand the circumstances."

She continued: "If you have any information, no matter how insignificant it may seem, please call West Mercia Police on 101, quoting 22/1604/20 of Sunday 5 January."

Alternatively, information can be passed to the independent charity Crime stoppers by calling 0800 555 111 or via their website.
