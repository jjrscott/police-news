Officers are investigating racist comments made on social media towards a 17 year old from North Worcestershire.

Inspector Lee Page said: "The comments were reported to West Midlands Police earlier today and the case has been handed to West Mercia Police as the victim lives in our policing area.

"I can confirm that officers are thoroughly investigating these abhorrent comments and we have made contact with the victim and the victim's family.

"I share the opinion of all right minded people that these narrow minded and disgusting comments have no place in society."

"I would encourage anyone who is or has been a victim of a hate crime to get in touch with police or report here https://www.report-it.org.uk/"
