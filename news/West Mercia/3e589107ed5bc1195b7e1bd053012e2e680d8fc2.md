We are appealing for witnesses including dash-cam footage following a video that has circulated on social media involving two vehicles appearing to drive dangerously along the A49 from Leominster towards Hereford at the Junction with the A417.

The incident occurred on Monday 4 November at around 5.05pm.

We have identified the driver of one of the vehicles and he has been served with a notice of intended prosecution.

We would like to appeal to the public for help to identify the other vehicle and its driver in the incident.

Sergeant Tim Hargraves said: "This was an appalling piece of driving captured on dash-cam which could have resulted in a serious or fatal road traffic collision. West Mercia Police is committed to reducing road casualties and there is no place for this standard of driving on our roads.

"Any further information that can assist us with our on-going enquiries would be welcomed."

Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting incident number 186s 051119.

As part of Operation Snap, members of the public can report and submit videos showing potential traffic offences online: www.westmercia.police.uk/operationsnap. This can range from driving dangerously or carelessly to overtaking on solid white lines, using a mobile phone while driving, ignoring traffic lights or dangerous driving around other road users, such as horse riders and cyclists.
