Police are appealing to the public for help in learning more about an assault that happened at a club in Redditch.

In the early hours of Sunday 17 November, at around 1am, an 18 year old man was reportedly assaulted at the Abbeydale Social Club in Redditch.

The victim was assaulted by an unknown man and when knocked down was then repeatedly attacked whilst he was lay on the floor unconscious. As a consequence of the assault the victim received a wound to his jaw that required treatment in hospital.

At this time, officers believe this to be an unprovoked attack on a young man who was enjoying a night out with family.

We would like to hear from anyone who saw the assault or who has any information that can help. You can call 101 and quote incident 31s of the 17 November 2019 or you can get some information to us anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on on 0800 555 111.
