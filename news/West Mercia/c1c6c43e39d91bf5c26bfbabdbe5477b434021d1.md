We are appealing for witnesses following a collision north of Hereford in Lyde, this morning (Tuesday 29 December).

At around 6.15am on the A49 near to the junction with Church Road in Lyde, three vehicles, a white Fiat 500, a black Honda Civic and an HGV were involved in a serious collision.

The driver of Fiat 500, a man in his 50s, was taken to hospital for treatment and while his injuries are serious they are not believed to be life-threatening. The drivers of the other two vehicles received minor injuries with one attending hospital as well.

The road remains closed while investigation and recovery work continues and is likely to remain closed for several hours.

We are keen for anyone with dashcam footage or who witnessed the collision to please contact us on 101 quoting reference 00072i of the 29 December 2020.
