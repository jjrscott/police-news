Police are appealing for witnesses following a collision at Moreton-on-Lugg, Hereford, where a woman sadly died.

At around 1.50pm on Tuesday 8 December a Nissan Micra was travelling along the C1120 towards the A49 when the collision occurred.

Police Sergeant Andy Wortley said: "The vehicle was travelling along the road when it was in collision with a bridge which crosses over the River Lugg.

"While investigations are on-going to establish the circumstances surrounding this incident, we are appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the collision or has dash cam footage to come forward."

Sadly, the driver, who was in her 80s and the only occupant in the vehicle, died at the scene and our thoughts are with her family and friends at this very difficult time.

Anyone with information or footage is asked to report it here on the West Mercia Police website or call 101 quoting incident 301i of 8 December or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
