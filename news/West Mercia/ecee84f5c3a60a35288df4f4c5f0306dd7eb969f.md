West Mercia Police has thanked members of the public in Hereford as officers dealt with an incident last night on Greyfriars Bridge in the city centre.

At 6.25pm last night (Friday 13 December) police were called to the city centre following concerns for the safety of a man on the wrong side of the railings on Greyfriars Bridge.

Officers attended and spoke to the man, who was subsequently brought to safety.

To allow police to deal with the incident road closures were put in place.

Chief Superintendent Tom Harding has thanked members of the public who were affected for the disruption caused.

He said: "I know the incident in Hereford city centre last night undoubtedly caused disruption. Closing roads in circumstances like this is not something we do lightly but was necessary to not only ensure the safety of the individual but emergency services dealing with the incident and wider members of the public.

"I would like to thank the public for their understanding and patience as we dealt with the incident, which thankfully was resolved safely. The support of members of the public is incredibly important to us and something we're incredibly grateful for and never take for granted."
