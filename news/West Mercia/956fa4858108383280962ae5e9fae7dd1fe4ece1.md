We are appealing for witnesses and anyone with any information to please come forward following a robbery and assault yesterday (Wednesday 31 March) in Dawley, Telford.

Around 2pm a man entered Eyton Stores in Eyton Road and demanded the member of staff hand over cash from the till. The suspect has then stabbed the member of staff however fortunately the wound is not life threatening.

A man was later arrested on suspicions of assault and robbery and later bailed.

Detective Sergeant Steve Goddard said: "I would like to reassure the community in Dawley that we are working hard to identify the offender and we would like to speak to anyone who recognises the man in the image as we believe he can help with our enquires. Local people can expect to see an increased police presence as our investigations continues."

If anyone has any information that help police, please call 101 and quote log number 337i of the 31 March 2021 and ask to speak Detective Sergeant Steve Goddard or any officer dealing with this case.

If you have information but don't feel comfortable speaking to police, you can speak to the independent charity Crimestoppers. It is 100% anonymous, they never ask your name and they cannot trace your call or I.P address. You can contact them online or by calling 0800 555 111.
