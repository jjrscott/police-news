Officers are appealing for anyone with any video footage from a phone or vehicle dash cam to please come forward following a robbery in Catshill, Bromsgrove in June.

On 9 June, around 9.15pm at the **Catshill Baptist Church** on Milton Road the victim and their partner were approached by a group of men and women, some on bicycles who when they prevented the couple from driving away, reportedly attacked them. The victim's phone was stolen before all the suspects left the scene.

A number of witnesses have already contacted the police however we would ask again that anyone who witnessed the incident and who may have any video footage from a dash cam or mobile phone from the area on that date, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting 698s of 9 June 2020.
