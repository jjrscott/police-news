We are appealing for witnesses following a collision at the weekend on the M42 westbound.

At around 8.15pm on Sunday (14 March) on the carriageway between junction 3 (Portway) and junction 2 (Hopwood Services), of the M42 a white Audi A3 has left the motorway and collided with signage before continuing down the embankment.

The driver and a passenger exited the vehicle with non-serious injuries but were taken to the Queen Elizabeth hospital as a precaution. A third man aged 18 years-old from Derbyshire unfortunately, despite life support treatment from the Ambulance and Fire teams, died at the scene.

PC Rich Allen from Operations Patrol Unit said "This is a sad incident and our thoughts are with the family and friends of the deceased man.

"We are appealing for anyone with dash cam footage of the area around the time of the incident to submit this to us via Operation Snap on our website to help with our investigation.

"If anyone has information or saw this collision take place to contact me on 01527 583766 quoting reference 562i 14 March"
