A man has been arrested and drugs seized by police.

In August, a car was stopped in Shrewsbury with a quantity of cannabis found inside.

On Monday (30 November) police visited an address in Porthill to arrest a man in connection with the find.

Once inside the property police discovered what is believed to be cocaine and cannabis worth thousands of pounds. Cash was also seized by officers.

A 21-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply.

It's believed the drugs were intended to be sold to children and young people.

Detective Sergeant Alex Sullivan said: "This is a significant amount of drugs, which we believe were intended to be sold to children and young people, taken off our street and is part of our on-going effort to pursue those involved in exploiting children and young people as part of our Protect campaign."
