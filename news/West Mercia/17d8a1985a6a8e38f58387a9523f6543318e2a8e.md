Officers in Telford are issuing a warning about the additional dangers of taking an illegal drug known as GBL/ GHB.

On Wednesday (17 March) police were called to an incident in Wellington. Officers found a 29-year-old woman in a life-threatening condition, it's believed she had taken GBL that had been mixed into orange juice.

On Sunday (14 March) police were called to Priorslee, after a 36-year-old man died. It's suspected that he had also consumed GBL mixed with orange juice.

Detective Inspector Rich Roberts, of Telford CID, said: "Our enquiries are very much in the initial stages and it may be that these incidents are not connected but we want people to be aware there may be a bad batch of GBL circulating, or that it causes an adverse reaction when mixed with orange juice.

"If anyone has taken the drug and falls ill then they should seek medical attention immediately. The dangers of taking drugs are well known and all drugs pose a risk to those who take them but I would like to reiterate this additional danger."
