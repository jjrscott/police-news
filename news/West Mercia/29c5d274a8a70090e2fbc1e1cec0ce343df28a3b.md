The family of a woman who died in Upton-upon-Severn on Saturday (16 November) have paid tribute to her.

Sarah Hopkins, aged 25, was found unresponsive in Causeway Lane. Her death is currently being investigated by West Mercia Police.

Speaking today (Wednesday 20 November) her family said: "We are absolutely devastated to announce that Sarah was taken from us at just 25 years old.

"Sarah was a popular, well known and well liked member of Upton-upon-Severn's community and she will be so sorely missed.

"Sarah was a bright, funny and intelligent girl with a beautifully sarcastic sense of humour. Sarah loved being bold and colourful and expressed it through her clothes and body art.

"She was passionate about animals and loved and absolutely adored her 'doggos'!

"It is tragic to know that Sarah was at the beginning a fresh positive chapter in her life having recently started a wonderful new relationship.

"We are heartbroken and will miss Sarah always."

Her family and friends have asked that their privacy is respected at this difficult time.
