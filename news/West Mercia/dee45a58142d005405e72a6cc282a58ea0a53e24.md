We are re-appealing for information and releasing a CCTV image following a distraction burglary in Redditch.

The incident happened on Tuesday 1 December between 4.30pm and 5pm when a lady opened her front door to a man who said he worked for the water board. He entered her home on Cedar View and distracted her before taking money and jewellery.

We are appealing to anyone who might recognise this man, who we hope can help us with our investigation.

PC Richard Britton said: "It is believed that the suspect also entered a number of neighbouring addresses and tried several others before targeting the victim.

"This has understandably been a traumatic experience for the victim. We are appealing for any information relating to the incident."

Anyone with information is asked to report https://www.westmercia.police.uk/ro/report/ or call West Mercia Police on 101 quoting incident number 459i of 1 December. Alternatively, information can be given to the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via the website.
