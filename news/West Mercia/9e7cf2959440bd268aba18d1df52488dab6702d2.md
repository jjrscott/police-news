We are appealing for witnesses to a single vehicle fatal collision in Whitbourne yesterday morning (Monday, 2 September).

The incident happened at around 10.50am when a Volvo heavy goods lorry, driving along the A44/Bromyard Road at Whitbourne in the direction of Bromyard, is believed to have come off the road and collided with chevron boards and trees.

Sadly, the driver of the lorry, a man in his 50s, was pronounced deceased at the scene. His next of kin has been informed.

Road closures were in place while emergency services were in attendance.

Sergeant Matt Digger from West Mercia Police said: "While investigations are ongoing to establish the circumstances surrounding this collision, we are appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the collision or has dash cam footage of the incident to please come forward.

"Our thoughts remain with the victim's family at this difficult time."

Anyone with any information or dash cam footage is asked to contact West Mercia Police on 101 quoting incident number 204s of 2 September 2019.

Alternatively, information can be given anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
