The family of a man who died in a collision in Kidderminster has paid tribute.

A red Mitsubishi Trojan pickup was travelling along the A451 Stourport Road at around 11.40pm on Tuesday 10 September when it is believed to have hit a wall and rolled onto its roof.

The driver - 27-year-old Kristian Richards - was pronounced deceased at the scene.

Following his death, Kristian's family has released the below statement: "My boy Kristian was taken from me and his sister Stacey.

"Kristian lived in the moment all his life until his tragic death. He loved massively and was loved by so many.

"Kristian had just become an uncle to his sister Stacey's daughter Mila who was born on 8 September. He got to see a picture but never got to hold her as we planned to visit her in Germany.

"Kristian's grandad passed away on Tuesday 10 September and Kristian was on his way to meet me at grandad's to say goodbye but lost his own life on the way.

"Kristian's own father died when he was nearly three and now he leaves his three girls, Lacey-Jo, 11, Millee, six, and Olivia, two. He treasured time with his girls.

"He worked hard, played hard, and was a funny, happy, and loving boy. He had so many friends and a lovely family that were there with him through thick and thin.

"Stacey and I want everyone to remember Kristian laughing, dancing, singing and acting the fool - enjoying and living life in the moment.

"Our lives won't be the same again without his hugs to hold us or beautiful smile."
