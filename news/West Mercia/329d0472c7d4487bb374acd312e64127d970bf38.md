Officers are still appealing for the public's help in locating a man missing from Telford.

We are now also releasing a CCTV image of 59 year-old Steven Johnson who was last seen near to the Shakespeare Inn, in Coalport, at around 7.40pm on Friday 19 March.

The 5ft 9in tall man was wearing dark clothing, if you saw him or were in the area between 7pm and 10pm please can you check your dashcam footage or CCTV to see if you saw Steven.

PC Jamie Farrelly of Malinsgate Station said "We are growing more concerned for the welfare of Steven and are appealing to all members of the community to check their dash cam footage if they were driving in the Coalport vicinity on Friday 19 March.

 "Please contact 101 if you can help with our enquires."
