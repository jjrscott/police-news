A man has been arrested and a knife and drugs seized as part of an investigation into county lines drug dealing in Redditch.

The man, aged 29, was arrested yesterday (Wednesday 30 December) in Woodrow by officers from North Worcestershire's County Lines team, who were responding to concerns around drug dealing in the area.

A knife and quantity of what are believed to be Class A drugs were seized by police.

Detective Inspector Gerry Smith said: "The associated harm with county lines such as criminal exploitation, cuckoo-ing and street violence is far-reaching and we will not stop in our efforts to relentlessly pursue those involved."

The 29-year-old, from Birmingham, has been released pending further enquiries.

The arrest is part of West Mercia Police's Protect campaign, aimed at tackling serious and organised crime together with partner agencies.
