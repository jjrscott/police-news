Updated News Post

A negotiator is at the scene of an ongoing incident on Park Street in Kidderminster.

At around 3am this morning (Tuesday 28 January) officers attended a private address within Park Court where a man was threatening to harm himself.

No one else is in the building with him and surrounding properties have been evacuated as a precaution.

Local Policing Chief Inspector Helen Kinrade said: "We appreciate the local community's patience whilst we respond to this ongoing issue and are particularly thankful for the understanding of those who have been evacuated from their homes on this cold day.

"Our priority is, of course, bringing the matter to a safe resolution and a negotiator is at the scene. Firearms officers are also in attendance but this is very much as a precaution only and the local community need not be alarmed.

"A road closure remains in place on Park Street and we're asking drivers and pedestrians to avoid the area."
