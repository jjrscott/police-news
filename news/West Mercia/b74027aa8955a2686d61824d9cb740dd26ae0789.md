#### A man has been sentenced to 20 years for child sex offences.

David Boulton was given the sentence on Tuesday, 17 November, at Shrewsbury Crown Court after he had previously pleaded guilty.

The 60 year old, from Langland Road in Oswestry, had been charged with 21 offences including rape of a child under 13, sexual assault, causing/inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity and making indecent images.

The sentencing follows an investigation by Shropshire's Protecting Vulnerable People (PVP) team.

Detective Inspector Mat Crisp, said: "This was a particularly disturbing case and I'm pleased this man will now face a considerable amount of time in prison for his vile actions.

"It can take great courage for victims of abuse to come forward and I hope that this sentence sends a positive message to any victims who may have doubts about speaking out that we can achieve outcomes such as this, which helps provide some comfort for the victims and their families.

Earlier this week the Home Office launched 'Something's Not Right' aimed at protecting victims of abuse, whether physical, sexual or exploitation.

The campaign, in partnership with the NSPCC, The Children's Society and Barnardo's encourages children and young people to recognise different forms of abuse and report it.
