Detectives are investigating a burglary in Cradley after a significant amount of cash was stolen from an elderly woman.

Police are appealing for witnesses after being called at approximately 2.45pm yesterday (Friday 3 April) to reports that three men had broken into the home of a 92-year-old woman on Chapel Lane.

One of the men spoke to the victim and claimed to be from South West Water while the other two searched the property.

Inspector Robin Davies said: "This would understandably be a very harrowing experience for the victim but thankfully the lady is not hurt or too traumatised by the incident.

"It is extremely upsetting to see an elderly person targeted during a time when we are encouraging the public to help each other. This criminal behaviour will not be tolerated and we urge residents to take extra care at home and to call us if they have information that could lead to arrests."

Anyone with information should call West Mercia Police on 101 quoting incident 311s 030420 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
