In recent months there have been a number of reported catalytic converter thefts from vehicles in the West Mercia Police force area.

On Thursday March 11 officers were made aware of attempted catalytic converter thefts in the Warndon Villages area of Worcester.

Chief Inspector Tanya Beckett said: "I'd like reassure the community that we are working hard to prevent such crimes and will be increasing our patrols. We are aware of these thefts taking place across our force area, not just in Worcester.

"There are steps motorists can take to try and reduce the chance of your vehicle being targeted by thieves. If you do notice any suspicious activity where individuals are pulling up next to cars and interfering with a vehicle we would ask you to get in touch with us."

It can take a thief less than three minutes to remove a catalytic converter from its housing on the car exhaust pipe but there are a number of ways the public can protect their property.

**Tips on how to protect your vehicle:**

 * Keep your vehicle in a garage if you can
 * If you park it on a driveway, install motion activated lighting
 * Otherwise, park in a well-lit, populated area
 * Locks are also available that can be fitted to your converter

Since September there has been a spate of these types of incidents particularly in South Worcestershire. Catalytic converters have expensive components, including platinum, which make them attractive to thieves.
