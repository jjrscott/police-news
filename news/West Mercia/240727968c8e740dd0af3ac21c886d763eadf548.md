Eight men have been arrested today (Wednesday 12 February) as part of an investigation into a series of burglaries across Worcestershire, Shropshire and South Birmingham.

Warrants were carried out in South Birmingham in the early hours of this morning by officers from both West Mercia Police and West Midlands Police; they form part of an investigation into 45 burglaries/attempted burglaries that took place between 17 December 2019 and 7 February 2020 when car keys and a total of 26 cars were stolen.

As a result of the police activity today a 16 year old from Dudley and a 17 year old from Weoley Castle, Birmingham were arrested on suspicion of dwelling burglary.

Six people were also arrested on suspicion to commit dwelling burglary:

 * 17 year old from Bartley Green, Birmingham
 * 18 year old from Rednal
 * 20 year old from Turves Green, Birmingham
 * 18 year old from Rubery
 * 18 year old from West Bromwich,
 * 24 year old from Ladywood, Birmingham

All eight currently remain in police custody.

DC Kirsty Hill from West Mercia Police said: "Burglary can have a significant impact on victims and their families and I hope that this dedicated operation reassures our communities that we take these crimes seriously and will work with our neighbouring forces to ensure a coordinated and joint response to tackling them. Ten of the stolen vehicles have been recovered so far and our investigation very much still continues."
