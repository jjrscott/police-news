Following a fatal collision on the M42 on Sunday 14 March the family of Harvey Blount has paid tribute to the 18-year-old.

The family has spoken of the bright and loving person with a smile for everyone: "It is with the heaviest of hearts that we have to announce the sudden passing of our son Harvey Blount, he is the beloved son to Sally and Jody; and brother to Tayler and Daisy.

"Sadly, He was involved in a car accident on Sunday evening returning to his RAF base after visiting his Mum for Mother's Day. We as a family are crest fallen and beside ourselves with grief at this difficult time.

"Harvey was a bright, loving person who had a smile for everyone. We were so proud of him and he always saw the good in everyone. He took on life with ease and made the most challenging things seem like nothing.

"We will miss him forever and the pain will never go away. We can't put into words how much we love you. Lots of love from the family xxx"

The family have asked that their privacy be respected during this very sad time for them all.
