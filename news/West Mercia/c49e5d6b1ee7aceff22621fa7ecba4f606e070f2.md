Police arrested four people for drug offences following a warrant in Wellington.

Officers carried out the warrant on last Friday (4 December) at Watling Street and arrested a boy 16, a woman 43, and two men aged 43 and 20, on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs. All four have since been released under investigation.

During the warrant we seized a large quantity of drugs, phones and cash from the property.

Sergeant Steve Tandy has said: "Our officers work tirelessly to tackle the supply of drugs and drug related crime throughout the county.

"We ask that members of the public who witness what they believe to be drug dealing or are concerned about suspicious activity contact the police on 101 or contact their local Safer Neighbourhood Team.

West Mercia Police is currently running 'Protect' - a campaign aimed at tackling serious and organised crime underpinned by Pursue, Prevent, Protect and Prepare.

Pursue - disrupt and prosecute those involved in serious and organised crime.
