We are appealing for information following a break in at Droitwich Leisure Centre.

Offenders gained entry to the centre on Briar Mill between 10.35pm and 10.45pm on Friday, November 27. While they were on the premises 16 Technogym spin bikes were stolen from one of the studios.

Police Constable Dean Bowen said: "We are appealing for anybody that was in the area around that time on Friday evening to think back and please get in contact with us if they saw anything suspicious.

"In particular, we would like to hear from anyone who saw a white Mercedes Luton Box van approaching the leisure centre and then leaving a short while later."

Officers believe three men were involved in this burglary. The driver and another one of the suspects were wearing gloves and light coloured clothing. A third man was wearing dark clothing.

If you have any information on the incident, saw any suspicious behaviour in the area or are aware of any Technogym spin bikes for sale that do not seem legitimate, please contact PC Dean Bowen on 07870 151013 or report online via the West Mercia Police website under the section tell us about. quoting reference 241i of 28 November.
