We can confirm that sadly a body has been found in the search for missing Zobaidah Salangy.

The 28-year-old went missing from her home in Bromsgrove on March 29; this morning (Friday 16 October), at approximately 11.30am, officers carrying out searches as part of the investigation into her disappearance discovered a body near Copyholt Lane in Bromsgrove.

Whilst formal identification hasn't yet taken place Zobaidah's next of kin have been informed.

Detective Chief Inspector Mark Peters "This is a tragic development in our investigation and our thoughts are with Zobaidah's family and friends.

"Copyholt Lane will be closed for the next few days whilst our work continues and I'd like to thank the local community for their patience and support."

Three men have been charged with offences in connection with her disappearance and a trial has been set for 16 March, 2021 at Worcester Crown Court.
