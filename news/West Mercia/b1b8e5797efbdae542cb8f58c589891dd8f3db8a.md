Officers are appealing for witnesses after a road traffic collision involving a bus and a pedestrian in Worcester on Monday (August 3).

The incident happened at just after 12.30pm on Foregate Street when it is believed the pedestrian, a man in his 40s, stepped in front of the bus. The road was closed while emergency services dealt with the incident.

Although a number of witnesses have already spoken to officers, anyone who has not yet made contact is asked to get in touch.

Sergeant Matt Digger said: "We'd like to thank the witnesses we've already spoken to and the bus driver who has assisted fully with our investigation but if there is anyone else who saw the incident we'd ask them to contact us."

The pedestrian was taken to Worcestershire Royal Hospital with injuries not believed to be life changing or life threatening.

Anyone with information is asked to contact West Mercia Police via the Tell us About section on our website or call 101 quoting 287 of 03082020.
