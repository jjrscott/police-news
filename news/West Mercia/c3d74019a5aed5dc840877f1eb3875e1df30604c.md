Officers investigating an incident on the Blackpole Road in Worcester in which a shot was fired at a police car are asking the public if they have any dash cam footage of the incident.

Chief Inspector Gareth Morgan from the local policing team said: "At around 12noon yesterday (Tuesday 10 March) a dark blue Volvo XC70 estate failed to stop for our officers. As a result there was a short pursuit along the A449 and onto the Blackpole Road before the Volvo collided with two stationary cars.

"As part of the investigation we're eager to hear from anyone that was travelling along this route yesterday lunchtime that may have dash cam footage of the incident or who was in the area when the vehicle came to a stop.

"Let us know if you have footage or information by calling 101 and quoting incident number 257s of March 10. You can also give details without giving your name by calling the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or by visiting their website.

"I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank the community for the messages of support we've received following our actions yesterday. I'd also like to reiterate that crimes involving firearms are rare in the area and this is thought to be an isolated incident."

Three men, aged 19, 20 and 21 and from Warwickshire, were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder in connection to the incident. They currently remain in custody.
