Earlier today police received information that a man was thought to be in a vehicle, in possession of a machete, at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital, in Mytton Oak Road, Shrewsbury.

Officers attended, including armed officers, and carried out a search of the hospital and surrounding area which proved negative.

Officers will remain in the area to offer reassurance.

Superintendent Bennett said: "We know that a significant police presence can cause concern, especially at locations such as hospitals, and I would like to reassure local residents that a search of the area has been carried out, but that at this time nothing untoward has been identified. Officers will however remain in the area into the evening to carry out patrols and to provide reassurance to the local community."
