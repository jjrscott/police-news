Around 1am on the morning of Sunday 22 March, officers were called by Kidderminster General Hospital on Bewdley Road after a large group of teenagers smashed the glass doors and entered the hospital, setting off the alarms.

The group then proceeded to set off fire extinguishers and break equipment around the hospital. ** **

Inspector Dave King said: "At this very challenging time for our health care system and wider emergency services it is unacceptable for anyone to tamper, destroy or in any way hamper the effectiveness of hospital equipment or ambulances.

"An investigation is under way and I would urge the public if they have any information to please come forward and get in touch. This behaviour will not be tolerated and I call on the support of our community in identifying the culprits. If you have information, caught anything suspicious on your car dash cam footage between 12.30am and 2am please call us on 101 and quote incident 0020s 22 March 2020."
