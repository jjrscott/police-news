A woman has been charged with murder following an incident in Hereford.

Laura Van Marle, aged 40, of no fixed address, was today (Sunday 27 September) charged with the murder of 69-year-old Susanna Van Marle. She was also charged with causing grievous bodily harm to a 73-year-old man.

Both charges relate to an incident which occurred yesterday (Saturday 26 September) at approximately 2am at an address on Finchers Corner in Cradley.

Detective Chief Inspector Leighton Harding said: "Our thoughts are with Susanna's friends and loved ones following this sad incident. The family are being supported by specially trained officers and have asked for privacy during this difficult time."
