A mobile police station will be out and about this weekend to reach local people in Ironbridge and outlying areas to offer support and assistance.

Chief Inspector Mark Reilly of West Mercia Police said: "As part of our ongoing effort to support our community during what is a very challenging time, officers from South Telford Safer Neighbourhood Team will be operating our mobile police station at several points across the Ironbridge area over the weekend.

"Members of the community who have been directly and indirectly effected by flooding will be able to come and chat to our team who will be able to answer their questions, provide assistance and address any concerns they may have.

"Below are the times and locations of the mobile police station and we look forward to seeing you."
