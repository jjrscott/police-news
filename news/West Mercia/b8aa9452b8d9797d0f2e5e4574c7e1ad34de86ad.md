A body has been recovered from the River Teme and is believed to be Daniel Berry from Ludlow.

The 42-year-old went missing on Sunday 20 December and officers have been carrying out searches of the area. Sadly at around 11am on Sunday 10 January a body was found during a search of the river however formal identification has not yet taken place.

Our thoughts are with his family at this difficult time.
