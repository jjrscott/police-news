Police attending an incident in Park Street have arrested a 52 year old man on suspicion of firearms offences.

We anticipate he will be taken to hospital by ambulance as a precautionary measure.

Officers remain on the scene but hope to soon allow neighbouring residents into their properties and re-open the road.

Local Policing Chief Inspector, Helen Kinrade said: "We are pleased to have brought this incident to a safe resolution and I would like to thank any residents affected for their patience."
