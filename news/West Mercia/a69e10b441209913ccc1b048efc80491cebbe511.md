West Mercia Police is seeking people who live or work in Herefordshire, Shropshire, Telford or Shropshire to have their say in how their local force operates by joining a key committee.

The Chief Constable and the Police and Crime Commissioner for West Mercia are looking for citizens with a good understanding and experience of public sector legislation and guidance, and who are politically neutral, to sit as members of the Joint Independent Audit and Standards Committee.

The Committee will review and scrutinise the affairs of the organisations, looking at issues such as risk management, internal control and corporate governance, as well as overseeing audit arrangements and reviewing financial statements. Meetings are normally held on a quarterly basis during the working day.

Successful appointments will initially be for a two year period, from November 2019 to November 2021, and in return committee members will receive training and an annual allowance of at least Â£2,000, plus expenses for travelling to West Mercia Police's headquarters in Hindlip, Worcestershire.

Police and Crime Commissioner John Campion said "The Joint Audit Committee provide independent scrutiny, transparency and help to give the public confidence of the standards in place. This is a great opportunity for local people to play an important role, in ensuring their communities get an efficient and effective service. "

Applicants are required to be over the age of 18, live or work in the West Mercia area and be able to attend meetings at least four times per year

The closing date for applications is 5pm on 31 October 2019. To apply, go to www.westmercia.police.uk/careers and click on Police Staff. Contact Elizabeth Hall on 01905 331669 for more information.
