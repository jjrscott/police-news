#### A murder investigation has been launched after a man was shot in Telford.

Earlier today (Tuesday 13 October) just after 12.10pm police responded to reports of a shooting in the Bridges Business Park in Horsehay.

Emergency services attended and a 20-year-old man was found with gunshot wounds.

He was treated by paramedics at the scene but sadly died as a result of his injuries.

A murder investigation has been launched.

Telford Policing Commander, Superintendent Jim Baker, said: "This is clearly a very serious and tragic incident that has seen a young man lose his life and our thoughts are very much with his family and friends at this sad time.

"There is currently a scene guard in place at the business park and an increased police presence in the area as we carry out our enquiries and I would like to thank local residents and businesses for their co-operation and understanding for any disruption as we do this.

"At the current time we do not believe there is any risk to the wider public, however, there will be officers on patrol in the local area to offer reassurance.

"A murder investigation has been launched with a number of initial lines of enquiries and we would ask anyone who has information they think could help with our investigation to let us know, or report this information to Crimestoppers anonymously."

Information can be reported to West Mercia Police on 101 quoting reference 00239_I_13102020 or online under the Tell Us About section at www.westmercia.police.uk Alternatively information can be reported anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
