Police officers went to the scene of the incident at around 5.10pm yesterday (Thursday 16 July). One man was injured with lacerations to his torso.

Detectives investigating believe there are a number of witnesses to the incident and are keen to speak to anyone who may have seen what happened and the events leading up to the disorder.

They are particularly interested in speaking with anyone who may have captured footage or images on their mobile phone, or may have CCTV.

Detective Sergeant Daniel Fenn said: "Unfortunately a man in his 40s has significant injuries after being stabbed on Main Road in Kempsey yesterday evening.

"We are appealing for any information in particular any CCTV, mobile phone videos, vehicle dash cam or photos of the incident that may help us with our investigation."

I would also like to reassure the community that we will have our safer Neighbourhood Team in the area throughout the day and would encourage anyone with any concerns or information to speak to them."

A 17-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of robbery and GBH. A 29 year old woman, a 34 year old man and an 18-year-old women have all been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender and are in police custody.
