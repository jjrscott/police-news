A local man has appeared at court after stealing a bike from a fenced off area at a business on Waterworks Road in Worcester.

The theft of the pushbike was reported to West Mercia Police last Tuesday (5 May) and CCTV revealed that 22-year-old Ben Wilde, of no fixed abode, climbed over the fence at the property at around 7.15pm on Friday 1 May and took the bike.

DC Carl Shenton said: "We were pleased to be able to identify and apprehend Wilde quickly and that, in less than a week, he had been put before the courts. We'd also like to thank the local community in Malvern in their support of our investigation."
Wilde was sentenced to 14 weeks, suspended, by Kidderminster Magistrates Court on Saturday (9 May) and has since been recalled to prison.
