Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, our volunteers have still been on hand to support the force and spread a little happiness across the community.

Lorraine Parker, a volunteer with Evesham Safer Neighbourhood Team, has dedicated two years to volunteering with our Citizens in Policing programme. Lorraine was delighted to be asked to decorate the tree at Evesham Station, a small gesture, yet one that helped to spread a little festive cheer following a very demanding year for West Mercia Police.

Sergeant Emma Burrows, of Evesham Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: "Lorraine is a very valued member of our team, and her support demonstrates the amazing ongoing help that the volunteers have provided throughout 2020."

West Mercia Police has a total of 347 volunteers, ranging from Special Constables and Police Support Volunteers to Community Support Volunteers and Cadets.

Lorraine said: "The role has exceeded my expectations in broadening my horizons and making a valuable contribution to society. If you are thinking of becoming a Police Support Volunteer, don't hesitate take the first step on this exciting journey."
