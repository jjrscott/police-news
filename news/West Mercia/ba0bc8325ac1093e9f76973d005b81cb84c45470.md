David Parry who is 84 years old and from Kidderminster was sentenced on 5 February at Worcester Crown Court to 27 months in prison for Indecent Assault. The charges relate to offences between 1984 and 1985.

At the time of the offence Parry was a headteacher in the West Midlands.

Following the sentencing, Detective Constable Chris Dee from West Mercia Police said: "Parry abused his position of trust as a teacher in the very worst possible way.

"I would like to praise those who came forward and to all those who gave evidence against him. It is down to their bravery he was sentenced and is going to prison.

"I hope this case reassures anyone who has been a victim of sexual abuse, either non-recent or current, that West Mercia Police is committed to providing help and support to victims and bringing offenders to justice. We will thoroughly investigate, no matter when the abuse took place. There is help and support available, so please don't suffer in silence."
