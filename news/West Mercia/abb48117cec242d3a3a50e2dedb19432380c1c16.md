At around 10.55 this morning (Monday 7 September) a police vehicle was involved in a collision in Hereford.

The collision happened on Kings Acre Road and involved a Peugeot, driven by a member of the public, and a police BMW. A parked blue van was also damaged in the incident.

Thankfully no one was seriously injured, however both the driver of the Peugeot and a police officer were taken to hospital for a check-up.

A road closure was in place between the Bay Horse Inn and Wyevale Garden Centre for around an hour and a half whilst the vehicles were removed and debris cleared.

The police vehicle had been responding to concerns for the safety of a woman and was travelling on blue lights. The force's Professional Standards Department have been alerted, as is standard practice.

Anyone who has dash cam footage or witnessed the collision is asked to call West Mercia Police on 101 quoting incident number 00183i of 7 September 2020.
