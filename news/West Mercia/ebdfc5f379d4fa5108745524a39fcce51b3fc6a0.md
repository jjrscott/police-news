Police are urging van drivers to take extra caution during their deliveries following a theft in Wolverley.

At around 3.15pm on Monday 8 December a van was stolen from Hayes Road whilst the driver was outside the vehicle. A 4X4 pulled up alongside the delivery vehicle and a man got out and entered the van and drove off in the direction of Knight Road.

Officers searched the area and liaised with neighbouring forces and the van was found discarded in Dudley.

There have been a number of similar incidents in the Worcestershire in the last two weeks which has sparked the plea to drivers to follow police advice.

Chief Inspector Ed Hancox said: "We are seeing an increase in this type of offence, which is not uncommon for the time of year. With more of us doing our shopping online; home deliveries are increasing and it is clear these delivery vans are being specifically targeted. There are a number of ways you can ensure your van and the contents are safe. Always remove the keys and lock the doors once you have retrieved the items. Where possible park in places with high visibility. Take your valuables such as your phone out of the vehicle with you.

"By following these tips you can minimise the chances of being targeted by these offenders and the chance that they will be successful should an attempt be made to steal vehicle or its contents."

Anyone with information is urged to call Crimestoppers on 0800 555111 or to report anonymously on the Tell us about section of our website.
