At around 5.30pm on Monday 27 January officers travelling along the A441 in Redditch identified a vehicle associated with car key burglaries across West Mercia.

The officers detained all four suspects who were travelling in the car.

Detective Inspector Sarah Squires said: "The four men were arrested on suspicion of burglary. All four men from the West Midlands are in their late teens and were released on police bail. It is believed these four individuals are connected to more than 30 recent house and vehicle burglaries across Worcestershire and Shropshire, as well as in the West Midlands.

"Our investigation into all four suspects and any possible linked offences is ongoing and I would like to reassure the public that we are working hard to help protect their property. Where burglaries have been committed we are committed to investigating thoroughly, returning property and possessions that have been stolen and making West Mercia a safer place to live and work."
