Police investigating an assault in Hereford have released an image of a man they would like to speak to.

At around 1.30am on Friday 18 October the victim, a 20-year-old man, was walking along Commercial Road when he was approached by a group of men. He was assaulted, causing him to suffer a broken jaw.

Following the incident an investigation was launched and numerous enquiries have been carried out to ensure that justice is done. As part of the investigation detectives are now keen to speak to this man, who was captured on officer's body worn video as they patrolled in Hereford on the night of the assault as he may be able to help the investigation.

This man, or anyone who recognises him, is asked to contact West Mercia Police on 101 quoting crime number: 22/97457/19. You can also give information without giving your name by calling the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or by visiting their website.
