West Mercia Police offers the following security advice:

 * Keep jewellery and money in a safe place and locked up if possible. Consider installing a safe at home which is securely fixed to the floor or wall. See www.securedbydesign.comfor police approved safes.
 * Make sure your home is kept secure at all times: keep windows and doors locked, switch lights on when going out to make your home looks occupied, use burglar alarms and install security lights on the outside of your property.
 * If you are unsure about a visitor to your door, ask their name, who they work for and if they have a contact number you can call to check. Ask them to return later while you make these checks.
