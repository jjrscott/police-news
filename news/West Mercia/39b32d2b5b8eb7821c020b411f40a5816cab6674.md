Following the Government's announcement yesterday on the change in tiers for some areas of the country, Chief Constable Bangham said officers will continue to police the three counties of West Mercia according to the current restrictions, engaging with communities and enforcing where necessary.

It was announced that from tomorrow (Saturday 19 December) Herefordshire would move from Tier 2 into Tier 1 whilst Worcestershire and Shropshire will remain in Tier 2.

Chief Constable Bangham said: "We must all continue to follow the regulations for the area in which we live.

"I know this has been a difficult year for everyone and there may be the temptation to socialise in areas with lesser restrictions but I would urge people to exercise restraint. We do not want to stop people from enjoying the festive period but I urge you to think carefully about your plans and stick to the rules to keep each other safe.

"In many areas of our force, we share a border with Wales and I recognise there will be concerns about how the differing rules will be managed, particularly for those who live on the border. Herefordshire is the only area in the UK being reduced from Tier 2 to Tier 1. I ask those in Wales and neighbouring counties to respect the effort that the communities of Herefordshire have made by continuing to avoid unnecessary travel into Herefordshire.

 "We will use our enforcement powers where it is necessary and appropriate and where serious breaches take place that put others at risk of this deadly virus."
