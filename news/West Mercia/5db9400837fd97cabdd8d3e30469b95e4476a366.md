Updated News Post

We are appealing for members of the public to stay back from flood barriers in Bewdley.

Emergency responders who are monitoring river levels in the town are aware that some members of the public have moved the nearby protective fencing aside in order to gain closer access to the barriers and it is not safe to do so.

Superintendent Mark Colquhoun from West Mercia Police and on behalf of the multi-agency flood response, said: "Safety remains our number one priority and we would firstly ask people not to move the protective fencing near to the barriers which are in place for safety reasons.

"We would also advise that people in the local area whose properties are potentially at risk of flooding consider making alternative accommodation arrangements as it is likely water levels will continue to rise. This advice also applies to residents of local caravan and park home sites."

A rest centre has been set up at Wyre Forest House, Stourport Road, for anyone who may need it.

Officers from West Mercia Police and Hereford & Worcester Fire and Rescue Service have been in the town throughout the day along with colleagues from other agencies to inform those people whose properties may be at risk from flooding and to offer advice and support.
