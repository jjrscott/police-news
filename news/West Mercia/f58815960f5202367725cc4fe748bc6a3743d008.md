A 36 year old man from Kidderminster was this week sentenced to nine years in prison for nine counts of theft of property, house burglaries and theft of a motor vehicle.

Anthony Moffat, of No Fixed Address, appeared at Worcester Crown Court on Monday (January 29) where he pleaded guilty for the crimes, which were committed between June and July last year

Moffat targeted properties and residents in Shropshire, Worcestershire and across the border to North Powys and was arrested on 21 September 2019 following an investigation lead by the Proactive team at Shrewsbury station.

Det Ch Insp Mike Nally said "We are delighted to see such a good result from the hard work of our team bringing this perpetrator to justice. Our officers in Shrewsbury worked efficiently and effectively and supported officers from our border force Dyfed Powys to bring together a strong case to put before the CPS.

"This sentence should be seen as a warning to others that crimes are taken seriously and force borders do not hinder these investigations."
