Today (Wednesday 9 September) the Prime Minster has announced that gatherings over six people will be illegal (with a few limited exemptions) from Monday 14 September.

What do the new rules mean?

 * Social gatherings of more than six people will not be allowed
 * This applies to private homes, both indoors and outdoors, and public places like parks, bars and cafes.
 * It does not apply to schools, workplaces, weddings, funerals or organised sports teams (there will be more exemptions announced by the Government before Monday).
 * Groups larger than six will be dispersed by police. Failure to comply with an officer's efforts to engage, explain and encourage will see a £100 fine, doubling on each further offence up to £3,200.

Speaking after the Government's announcement Chief Superintendent Sue Thomas, said: "Nationally we're starting to see a rise in infections and so it's vital that each and every one of us plays our part in reducing the spread of Coronavirus by following the regulations and guidelines the Government have put in place.

"Over the last seven months the vast majority of people across Herefordshire, Shropshire and Worcestershire have done the right thing and adhered to the guidelines and we are sure this will remain the case. However, we will continue to be visible in our communities and we will speak to those seen breaking the rules. Where it's appropriate to do so we will use our powers and enforce the fine."

The full details of the legislation can be found on the Government website linked at the bottom of the page.
