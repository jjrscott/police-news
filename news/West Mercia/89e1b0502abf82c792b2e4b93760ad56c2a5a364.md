Human remains have been found in the search for Judy Fox.

Detective Chief Inspector Mark Bellamy said: "Today (Friday 10 July) we have been carrying out searches near The Lloyds at Coalport as part of our investigation to find Judy Fox after concerns were raised for her welfare on Sunday 14 June.

"As part of these searches we have found human remains. Formal identification has not yet been carried out but we are keeping Judy's family informed of this development and continue to support them at what must be a truly awful time.

"Officers remain in the area and The Lloyds is closed between the junction for Legges Way and The Free Bridge."

Lucy Fox, 38, from Bernard's Hill, Bridgnorth has been charged with murder in relation to Judy's disappearance and was remanded in custody at a previous court hearing.
