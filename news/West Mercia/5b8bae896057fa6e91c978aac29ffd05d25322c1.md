A West Mercia Police officer is set to appear in court on Tuesday (14 July) charged with death by dangerous driving.

The charge is in relation to the death of a 53-year-old man from Worcestershire following a road traffic collision on 28 May, 2018.

The collision happened on the A449 from Worcester to Stourport-on-Severn. It involved a police car, responding to an emergency call and a car driven by the 53-year-old man.

The driver of the car suffered multiple injuries and sadly passed away on 11 June, 2018.

The incident was referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) which carried out an independent investigation into the matter.

The IOPC subsequently referred the case to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for a charging decision and PC Jamie Holloway was charged with causing death by dangerous driving.

He is set to appear at Kidderminster Magistrates Court on Tuesday, 14 July.

West Mercia Police Assistant Chief Constable, Rachel Jones, said: "Our thoughts continue to remain with the family and friends of the man involved at what continues to be an extremely upsetting and difficult time.

"As court proceedings are now underway, it would be inappropriate for us to make any further comment regarding the circumstances."
