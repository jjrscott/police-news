A misconduct hearing held by West Mercia Police found that a member of police staff who had previously resigned from her post, would have been dismissed from the force with immediate effect.

The hearing was conducted at Hindlip, Worcester, on Tuesday 24 November. The investigation related to a data protection breach where information was shared with a member of the public without a policing purpose and followed an investigation by the Professional Standards Department.

Superintendent Rebecca Love, Head of Professional Standards, said: "The hearing found that this member of staff's actions amounted to gross misconduct and breached the standards of professional behaviour in the area of discreditable conduct. Officers and staff are held to a high standard of professional behaviour both on and off duty, which the public rightfully expect. If they fall below these standards, they discredit the service and impact on the trust and confidence of our communities, which we cannot allow.

"Even though the member of staff had resigned prior to this hearing the panel found that the member of staff would have been dismissed with immediate effect. They will also be placed on the College Of Policing Barred List and will not be employable within the UK Police Service."

The outcome of the misconduct hearing is subject to the normal appeals process.
