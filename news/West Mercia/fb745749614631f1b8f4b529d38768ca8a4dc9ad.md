**With National Road Safety Week taking place this week, West Mercia Police is encouraging all road users to take simple steps to keep themselves and others safe on the roads.**

** ** The theme for this year's national week of action, organised by road safety charity Brake, is 'No Need to Speed' and West Mercia Police are encouraging motorists to think about their speed and to always travel within the speed limit. Speeding, as well as inappropriate speed can have a devastating impact on the safety of road users, increasing the risk of a collision and the severity of the consequences.

Over the past 3 years* in West Mercia 130 people have been killed and 1037 seriously injured in collisions where speeding or inappropriate use of speed is noted as a contributory factor.

Supt Mel Crowther, West Mercia Police comments: "There are many local residents in our region whose quality of life is affected by people speeding through their community and families that unfortunately know far too well the devastating consequences that speeding and collisions can lead to. Supporting Road Safety Week this week is an important way of us raising awareness of the dangers of speeding and travelling at an inappropriate speed. Enforcing the speed limit is a key priority for West Mercia Police and takes place 24/7.

Apart from the obvious consequences if you are involved in a collision, if prosecuted for speeding, the minimum penalty is a Â£100 fine and 3 penalty points. Reduce your speed and do your bit to keep our communities safe."
