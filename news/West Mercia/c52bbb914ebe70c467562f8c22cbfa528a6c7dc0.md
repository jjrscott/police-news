Officers investigating a burglary at the Royal Enfield in Redditch pub on Monday 27 July would like to hear from anyone who has any information or witnessed anything suspicious. They would also like to speak two men they believe can help in their investigation.

The burglary happened at around 3am when the glass in one of the rear doors was smashed and someone made their way into the pub before leaving the way they came in.

PC George Mcmillan said: "We are keen to speak to the two men pictured as they may have information that can help our enquiries. One of the men is white, tall, around 40 years old with short grey hair and stubble. He was wearing a black jacket with a white logo on his chest and dark coloured trousers. The other man is also white, around 30 years old with very short dark blonde hair, stubble and was wearing a black t-shirt with a black jacket and a pair of dark shorts. He had a small tattoo on his lower left leg and was wearing dark trainers with white soles, possibly Nike.

"If you recognise either of these men please get in touch with us by calling 101 and quoting 0077i of the 27 July 2020."
