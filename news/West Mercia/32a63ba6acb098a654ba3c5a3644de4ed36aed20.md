Paul Stevens, 60, Dyffryn Ardudwy, Gwynedd, North Wales has today been sentenced at Warwick Crown Court (Monday 11 November 2019) to nineteen years in jail for non-recent child sexual offences. These were committed whilst working as a teacher at a school in Worcestershire between 1982-1991 against three male victims.

He was convicted of ten charges of indecent assault on a child and five charges of indecency with a child.

Following today's sentencing, Detective Inspector Mark Walters from West Mercia Police said: "Paul Stevens abused his position of trust as a teacher in the worst way possible by preying on vulnerable children.

"I would like to praise the victims who came forward and gave evidence against him. It is down to their courage and bravery that he has now been sentenced to nineteen years in prison for his despicable crimes. My hope is that today's sentence will provide the victims with some sense of closure.

"I also hope this case reassures anyone who has been a victim of sexual abuse, either non-recent or current, that West Mercia Police is committed to providing help and support to victims and bringing offenders to justice. We will thoroughly investigate, no matter when the abuse took place. There is help and support available, so please don't suffer in silence."
