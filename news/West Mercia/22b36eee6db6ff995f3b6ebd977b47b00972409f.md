Bewdley residents are being advised that water levels are expected to rise in the town later today (19 February 2020)

The flood barriers at Severnside North and Severnside South are expected to hold, however, the barriers at Beales Corner may not withstand the rising water levels and could be 'out-flanked'.

It is possible that properties may be affected by floodwater and, if necessary, a rest centre would be established to accommodate residents who have to leave their properties.

Emergency response partners including West Mercia Police, Hereford & Worcester Fire and Rescue Service, Worcestershire County Council, Wyre Forest District Council, the Environment Agency and health partners are working to keep people safe and are closely monitoring the situation locally. Officers from a number of these agencies will be in the community offering advice, support and reassurance.

Superintendent Mark Colquhoun from West Mercia Police and on behalf of the multi-agency flood response, said: "Safety remains our absolute priority and as such we are keeping a very close eye on Bewdley today and we expect that some properties will be at risk of flooding, particularly if the Beales Corner barrier is 'out-flanked'.

"We will have officers in the town speaking to residents whose homes may be at risk of flooding. We will also put road closures in place as necessary."

Information regarding the flooding including road closures, will continue to be given on social media by the Environment Agency, local authorities and the emergency services, and via local news or radio channels.
