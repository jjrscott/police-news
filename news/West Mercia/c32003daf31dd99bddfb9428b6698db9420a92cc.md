**We are appealing for any witnesses who may have seen a sexual assault or a group of around 5 men acting suspiciously in Fort Royal Hill in the early hours of this morning (Sunday 22 September). *Updated**

Detective Sergeant Dan Fenn said: "This was a serious sexual assault which happened between 3am and 4am on Sunday morning in (22 September) at Fort Royal Hill when a man in his 20s was attacked by between four and five other men in Fort Royal Hill after having walked from the town centre.

"The victim received several injuries including a head injury for which he received medical treatment by paramedics. We are providing close support to him and his family from specially trained officers.

"While incidents like this are extremely rare, extra patrols are in the area today supporting and reassuring the local community and an investigation is under way to find these men and bring them to justice."

Anyone with any information that could help police with their enquiries is asked to call 101 quoting incident number 163s of 21 September 2019.

Alternatively, you can contact independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their website www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
