An investigation has been launched after a burglary took place at an address in Wishaw Close, Redditch whilst the family were home.

At around 11:20 last night, (Thursday 6 August), the family heard their dog barking at something, they then discovered that their home had been entered through an unlocked patio door and two thieves had stolen cash, a wedding ring, a watch and a camera.

It's thought the thieves and been disturbed by a toddler and that they had covered her mouth to prevent her from raising the alarm.

Chief Inspector for the area, Ed Hancox, said: "This must have been an incredibly distressing experience for the whole family and a full investigation is underway. The little girl was extremely brave and we will be doing all we can to support her and her parents.

"We will be carrying out house to house enquiries in the area but we are asking anyone that saw or heard anything suspicious in the area last night to give us a call.

"It is rare to have a burglary of this nature in Redditch and we understand that this will be alarming to the local community and as such we will be carrying out additional reassurance patrols in the area."
