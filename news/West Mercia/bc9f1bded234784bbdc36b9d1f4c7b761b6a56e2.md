**A Worcestershire motorist has been given a nine month prison sentence following being found guilty of two counts of Perverting the Course of Justice.**

The offence took place following three charges of speeding over a 6 month period in 2018 on the A40 at Pencraig and the A4103 at Fromes Hill, Herefordshire and on the M5 motorway in Worcestershire.

Ex Magistrate Karen Harvey, previously of Malvern, Worcestershire, had denied all three offences despite use of police ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) photographic and video evidence and had gone to extensive steps to try to deceive the police and evade justice. Harvey was sentenced at Warwick Crown Court on 30 March 2021.

Sergeant Wortley of West Mercia Police said: "There are many local residents in our region whose quality of life is affected by people speeding through their community and families that unfortunately know far too well the devastating consequences that speeding and collisions can lead to. Enforcing the speed limit is a high priority for our force and so is ensuring that those who choose to lie about such offences do not evade the law."
