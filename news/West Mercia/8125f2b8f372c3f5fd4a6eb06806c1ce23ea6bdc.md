We are appealing for witnesses following an incident on Poplar Road, Winchenford, Worcestershire on Friday 22 May.

At approximately 3.40pm on Friday (22 May) a 62-year-old man who had been cycling along Poplar Rad was found by a passer-by after falling off his bike.

The cyclist received bruising and bleeding to his legs and went by ambulance to the Worcester Royal for further tests and scans.

We are keen to speak to the driver of a grey van thought to be a class 2 or 7.5 tonne, which had Excel Logistics written on the side. The driver was described as a white man, between 40 - 50 years of age, bald but with a beard. We believe this driver may have seen what happened or may have information regarding the incident the cyclist was involved in.

Anyone with information who may have seen the incident are encouraged to contact PC Venn from Bromsgrove station on 101 quoting reference 477s220520.
