A man and woman from Worcester have been charged with fraud and money-laundering offences after a woman in her 70s had a significant amount of money withdrawn from her bank account.

As part of the police investigation Rudy Francis, aged 42 and Rebecca Ralph, aged 39, both of Painswick Close, Worcester were arrested in the city yesterday (Thursday 19 November) and later charged with fraud by false representation, possession of criminal property and conversion of criminal property.

The alleged fraud is reported to have taken place between July and November this year.

Both Francis and Ralph will appear at Kidderminster Magistrates Court this morning.
