Officers are appealing for information after a serious collision near Kidderminster yesterday (28 July).

At 12.45pm a car (a Ford Focus) was travelling north on the A449, when near to the junction with Caunsall Road in Cookley, it has reportedly swerved onto the opposite carriageway into the path of another vehicle (a Mazda 2 GT Sport).

The cars have collided resulting in extensive damage to both vehicles, forcing the closure of the road for several hours.

The driver of the Ford was taken to hospital to treat their injuries however they are not thought to be life threatening. The passenger in the Mazda was also taken to hospital for treatment to their injuries.
