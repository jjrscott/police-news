On Wednesday 17 June a warrant was executed at an address in Bilston, Wolverhampton, by West Mercia proactive CID with support from West Midlands Police.

A 22-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of modern slavery offences and conspiracy to supply Class A drugs. He has been released under investigation, pending further enquiries.

Detective Sergeant Luke Papps, from Worcester Proactive CID said: "This warrant forms part of an ongoing County Line investigation by the South Worcester Proactive Team into a drug line running from the West Midlands into Evesham.

"This is an ongoing effort to proactively target those responsible for running drug lines into South Worcestershire. The team have been working jointly with West Midlands Police and local policing teams in Evesham to reduce the harm caused by drug related crime and disorder."

"The criminal exploitation of vulnerable people, which includes county lines, has been a priority for West Mercia Police for a long time and our officers are working continuously to disrupt and dismantle drugs supply and protect the young and vulnerable people who are exploited by them in our communities."
