A Former Worcester teacher has been sentenced today (Friday 18 September) at Worcester Crown Court to spend six years and six months in prison and ordered to sign the sex offenders' register for life after being found guilty of rape of a female 16 years or over.

Michael Leydon, 61, of Westlake Gardens, Worthing, West Sussex was found guilty by jury on Thursday 20 August.

Following the sentencing, Detective Constable David Hadley said: "The sentence reflects the severity of this type of crime and I hope it will offer some comfort to the victim, who has shown great courage and strength in coming forward in reporting this to us, throughout the investigation and in giving evidence in court.

"I hope this conviction will provide reassurance to other victims of sexual offences, giving them the confidence that they will be believed and listened to by specially trained officers and that we will do everything to bring offenders to justice."

"If you are a victim of a sexual offence you can report it to police on 101 or via West Mercia's Victim Advice Line on 0800 952 3000 or in an emergency dial 999."

Following the sentencing the victim, who wishes to remain anonymous, said she hopes "this case will provide other victims who find themselves in a similar position with the strength and confidence to speak to the police. And, to reassure them that they will be believed and supported throughout."

Anyone who is a victim of any sexual assault who feels they may need support can report it to police on 101 or for those who may not want to contact the police they can contact West Mercia's Victim Advice Line, which is a free, independent and confidential support service. People can call 0800 952 3000 or visit www.victimadviceline.org.uk. In an emergency please call 999.
