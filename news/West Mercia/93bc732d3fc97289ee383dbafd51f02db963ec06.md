We are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with dash cam footage to please come forward following the theft of a car on Tuesday 19 January.

A white Audi Q3 and a number of other personal items were stolen from a house Booton Court in Kidderminster between 6am and 6.45am.

Detective Constable Natalie Vaux said: "We are asking people in the area to please check their CCTV, home security such as doorbell cameras and dash cam recorders. I would also like to hear from a couple of people out early walking their dogs who may have seen a man in the area acting suspiciously.

"I would also like to reassure people that while officers are out and about patrolling our communities day and night and keeping us safe, please remember to make sure your home or business, sheds and garages are made secure and locked up especially at night and if you see anyone acting suspiciously please contact the police on 101 or if you believe a crime is in progress and in an emergency, call 999."

If you can help with our investigation please report any information online here or call 101 and quote incident number 00045i of 19 January 2020. Alternatively information can be passed to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
