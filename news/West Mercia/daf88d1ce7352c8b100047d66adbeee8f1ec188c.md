Fraudsters are back in action claiming to be from the police, banks and fraud squads in order to extort money from the vulnerable in both North and South Worcester.

Police have received several reports of residents receiving calls from someone giving the name Mark Andrews claiming to be from the force and trying obtain money.

Detective Inspector Kirsty Hickling said: "No West Mercia Police Officer will ever contact you and request you withdraw or transfer funds for any purpose, regardless of what unit they are from or role they claim to perform.

"There are many aliases used by these fraudsters but Mark Andrews is the latest one we have been aware of and we would ask members of the public to share this message that if you are called by someone using this name and claiming to be from the police it is fraudulent. Anyone who receives these calls should call us and let us know and pass on the information to their friends and relatives."

Anyone who receives these calls hang up and report it immediately to Action Fraud at www.actionfraud.police.uk or 0300 123 2040."

If the crime is still in progress, because for example, you have recently provided bank details or handed over cards or cash, or the caller has arranged for someone to visit your address to collect items, you should call the police to report this on 101. In an emergency dial 999.
