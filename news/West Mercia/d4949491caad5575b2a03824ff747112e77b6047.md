Police are appealing for witnesses to a fatal collision in Shrewsbury.

At around 8.15pm on Friday 21 August two vehicles were involved in a collision on Shrewsbury Road in Cockshutt. The incident involved a blue Ford Fiesta and white Ford Kuga. A man in his fifties suffered serious injuries and was taken to North Staffordshire Hospital for treatment where he sadly died yesterday (Sunday 23 August).

Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time.

Anyone with information or dashcam footage is urged to contact police on 101 quoting incident or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111. Alternatively information can be passed through the online reporting service under the section Tell Us About https://www.westmercia.police.uk/
