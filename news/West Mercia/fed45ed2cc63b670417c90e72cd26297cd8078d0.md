#### Police investigating a murder in Telford have recovered a burnt out vehicle, believed to be linked to the shooting.

Around midday yesterday afternoon (Tuesday 13 October) a 20-year-old man was shot in the car park in the Bridges Business Park in Horsehay. He sadly died as a result of his injuries.

Formal identification has yet to take place, however, next of kin has been informed.

Last night, a burnt out vehicle was located in the Wrekin car park in Wellington.

Detectives believe the vehicle - believed to be a grey Skoda Karoq registration YB69 MUP - is linked to the shooting.

A murder investigation has been launched and detectives are appealing for witnesses.

Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Chief Inspector Mark Bellamy from West Mercia Police's Major Incident Unit, said: "We have a number of lines of enquiries that we are following and are keen to hear from any members of the public who have information that could assist in our investigation.

"In particular anyone who may have seen, or has dash cam footage of, a grey Skoda Karoq, registration YB69 MUP, in Telford between 11am and 11pm yesterday, or anyone who visited the Bridges Business Park between 11am and 1pm yesterday.

"We know there is speculation about the identity of the man who died however I must stress formal identification has yet to take place and until this has happened we are not in a position to name other than to say his next of kin has been informed and we have specially trained officers working with his family to offer support as our enquiries continue."

An increased police presence remains in and around Horsehay today (Wednesday 14 October) as officers carry out enquiries and offer reassurance to local residents and businesses.

Information can be reported to West Mercia Police on 101 quoting reference 00239_I_13102020 or online under the Tell Us About section at www.westmercia.police.uk
