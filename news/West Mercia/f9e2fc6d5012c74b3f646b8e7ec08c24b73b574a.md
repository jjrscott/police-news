On Thursday 1 October, while a family were out at a popular beauty spot in the West Midlands, their dog was a snatched by a man who got in a waiting car and drove away.

The family reported the theft of 'Coco' to West midlands Police who in turn contacted West Mercia Police.

Following intelligence provided by a member of the public, officers in Pershore yesterday (13 October) identified a vehicle at a location near the town and upon closer investigation, identified the missing dog.

Head of Public Contact, Superintendent Rik Klair said: "Officers identified the car which had been reported to us earlier in the day as a vehicle connected with the attempted sale of suspected stolen dog.

"The officers who had seen the car then saw a distressed and scared dog matching the description of Coco and safely secured her while enquiries were made locally. An investigation into theft of Coco is ongoing.

"It was nice to be the bearer of such good news early this morning to a family who have had very upset children at losing their furry friend. Our officers checked Coco's microchip and then drove him back to the family and reunited them.

Roz Pearce, Coco's owner said: "I can't thank West Mercia Police enough for everything they have done and to the officers whose keen eyes spotted the car and then Coco. For them to rescue her and return her to us was something of a storybook ending and the whole family thanks them for this early Christmas present."
