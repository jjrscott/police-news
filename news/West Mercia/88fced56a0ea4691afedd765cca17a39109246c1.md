Police are appealing for witnesses after a man threatened several people in Ludlow.

At around 5pm yesterday (Monday 20 April) the man threatened to stab a man and woman along Temeside before swearing at to elderly women.

He is described as white, around 25-years-old, with blonde hair and a fringe. He wore a zip up cream top, black trainers and blue latex gloves.

We are keen to speak to the victims and any witnesses to these incidents and urge anyone with information to contact 101 quoting incident 0467S 200420 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
