Officers were called around 12pm on Sunday 5 April to a suspected catalytic converter theft at Worcester Royal Hospital.

A member of the hospital staff who had completed their shift noticed a strange noise from the car when it was started and a colleague nearby in the car park reported the same thing. They believed their catalytic converters had been removed and called the police. There has been a recent increase in the theft of catalytic converters from vehicles due to a rise in the value of the precious metals they contain.

Detective Inspector Jack Taylor said: "The staff members' cars appear to have been targeted by thieves who have stolen the catalytic converters from their vehicles. I cannot emphasise enough how disappointing it is at a time when our health care professionals are risking their lives to look after us that they would be targeted in such a manner. I can reassure the victims and the wider public that we are fully investigated this incident and that our officers are working hard to protect the whole community from such crimes. **We will also be increasing our patrols in these areas over the coming days and weeks in order to warn and deter potential offenders.**

"Investigators are working closely with our partners at the hospital and I would like to hear from anyone who noticed any suspicious activity in the hospital car parks on either Saturday 4 April or Sunday 5 April around parked vehicles. Please contact us on 101 with any information and quote incident number 204s 5th April 2020."
