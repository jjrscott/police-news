We are appealing for witnesses or information following a report that a woman was assaulted by a man on a canal path whilst walking her dogs. The path was located between Canalside Street and Georges Lane North, and the assault took place on Monday 15 June at around 8.30pm.

The man is described as white, aged around 25-years-old, approximately 5ft 6in tall, with thick brown hair styled in a quiff, with brown eyes. He was wearing black trainers, black jogging bottoms and a black top. He was wearing a silver hooped earing with a leather tag from it, from his left ear and was walking a golden Labrador Retriever.

Investigating officer DS Jim Bryce said: "We are following a number of lines of enquiry as part of this investigation and we'd like to speak to anyone who may have seen this man or have any information relating to the incident. We believe that there were other people out walking along the canal path at the time and hope that someone can help us find this man."

Anyone with information is asked to call West Mercia Police on 101 quoting incident 725s 150620. Alternatively, information can be given to the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
