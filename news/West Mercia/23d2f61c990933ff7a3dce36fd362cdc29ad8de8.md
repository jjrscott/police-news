**West Mercia Police, working closely with colleagues in the Regional Organised Crime Unit (ROCU) is pleased to be bring you The Little Book of Big Scams. This book has been reproduced with the kind permission of the Metropolitan Police Service 's Cyber Crime Unit.**

The Regional Organised Crime Unit West Midlands Team leads the response for Serious and Organised Crime across the region, which includes Herefordshire, Shropshire and Worcestershire. The goal of the team is to reduce the impact of the most dangerous offenders and criminal groups in order to make our communities safer.

Detective Inspector Emma Wright who leads the fight against fraud for the Economic Crime Unit said: "Fraud has evolved over recent years and The Little Book of Big Scams seeks to address the challenges both the public and the police face in deterring and preventing these crimes.

"The book covers everything from fraud enablers, types of fraud and what to do if you get scammed. Many of the traditional frauds remain a threat to us all however the prevalence of the digital world now has opened the door to new types of online fraud and new types of risk.

"With organised criminals finding new ways to access our personal details and new ways to exploit most people's inherent trust in other people and what they tell them, it is more important than ever that we all arm ourselves with the best and most up to date knowledge available. It is only through doing this and working together that we will combat fraud in all it's forms."
