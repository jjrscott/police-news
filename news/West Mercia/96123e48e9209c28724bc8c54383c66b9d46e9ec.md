We are appealing for witnesses after a man was assaulted in Worcester.

The victim, a man in his 40s, was walking along St George's Lane North on Wednesday 10 March at around 6.25pm when a small silver van or car pulled up alongside him. It is reported that the motorist got out of his vehicle and punched the man before driving away.

PC Paul Cound said: "As part of our ongoing enquiry into this incident we would like to appeal to anyone who was in the area at the time of this unprovoked assault. Please get in touch with us if you saw the suspect or the incident.

"We'd also like to appeal to anyone who was driving nearby and has dash-cam footage in their vehicle or perhaps has CCTV on their property. The offender is described as white with short dark hair."

Anyone with information is asked to contact us via our online reporting page here quoting incident number 495i of 10 March or you can call 101.

If you have information but don't feel comfortable speaking to police, you can speak to the independent charity Crimestoppers. It is 100% anonymous, they never ask your name and they cannot trace your call or I.P address. You can contact them online or by calling 0800 555 111.
