Detectives are investigating a reported robbery at a social club in Bromsgrove on Sunday 5 January.

Detective Sergeant Standing said: "We were called to the Millfield and District Social Club around 11.30pm on Sunday 5 January following reports two masked men entered the club and threatened two members of staff, demanding money. The men were extremely aggressive and were able to make their way from the club with a quantity of cash.

"They were seen leaving on foot along Millfield Road towards the junction with Fox Lane and Sunningdale Road.

"I would ask anyone who has any information about this incident or who saw anything suspicious between 11pm and 11.40pm in and around the Millfield and District Social Club to please get in touch. I am particularly interested in hearing from anyone who has mobile or dash cam footage from around that time and along the roads mentioned. Please call 101 and quote incident number **0679s** of 5 January 2020 if you can help."
