We are appealing for witnesses to a collision in Bletchley, Shropshire.

At around 4.10am today (Monday 8 February) on the A41, a blue Ford Focus was heading towards Market Drayton when it left the road and overturned.

The driver, a 38-year-old woman from Stafford, was initially taken to hospital for treatment but has since been arrested on suspicion of driving whilst under the influence of drugs.

A passenger, a woman in her thirties, also suffered serious injuries and remains in Royal Stoke Hospital in a stable condition.

Anyone with information or dash-cam footage is urged to contact 101 quoting reference 00045i of 8 January, or alternatively information can be reported online through the Tell Us About section of our website.
