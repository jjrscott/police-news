Three children missing with their mum from Telford have now been found safe and well.

Last week police launched a search for Emma Davies and her three children who were missing from Telford.

The family has now been found and the children are back safe and well with their Dads.

A 30 year old woman has been arrested on suspicion of child neglect and a 33 year old man has been arrested on suspicion of obstruct police and child abduction. Both are currently in police custody.

Detective Inspector Joanne Woods said: "I'd like to thank members of the public for their help in our searches, we're pleased that the children have been found and are all safe and well and are now with their Dads."

Notes to editors:
