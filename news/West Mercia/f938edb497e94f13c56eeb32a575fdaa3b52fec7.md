Four people have been arrested for drug and trafficking offences after a warrant was carried out in Bridgnorth.

Officers attended an address in Six Ashes, on Wednesday 27 January, where they found a large cannabis farm and seized hundreds of cannabis plants.

A man, aged 52, was arrested on suspicion of the cultivation of class B drugs and two other men, aged 62 and 52, along with a woman aged 33, were arrested for the same offence as well as modern day slavery and human trafficking offences. The 62-year-old man and the woman were bailed while the other two men (aged 52) were released under investigation.

Detective Inspector John Weaver, from Shropshire Proactive CID, said: "This operation was carried out as part of our commitment to tackle serious and organised crime in Shropshire in order to help keep the public safe.

"The cultivation of cannabis does not just keep the drug supply going in the area but it also causes a disruption to the local residents. These cannabis farms bring associated harm and we will continue to carry out warrants such as this to disrupt the supply of drugs and minimise the impact on the community."

The warrant forms part of West Mercia Police's Protect campaign. 'Protect - tackling serious and organised crime together' is West Mercia Police's response to serious and organised crime underpinned by Pursue, Prevent, Protect and Prepare.

Pursue - disrupt and prosecute those involved in serious and organised crime.

Prevent - stop individuals from becoming involved in serious and organised crime.

Protect - increase levels of protection against serious and organised crime.

Prepare - reduce the impact of serious and organised crime.
