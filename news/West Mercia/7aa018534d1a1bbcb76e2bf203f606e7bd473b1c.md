We are appealing for witnesses or information following a report that a man was assaulted in Bye Street, Ledbury.

The assault took place outside the Pizza House at around 7pm on Sunday 12 July.

The victim, a man in his 40s, was outside the premises when the suspect ran over to him and kicked him - causing the victim to fall through an open door and bang his head on the door frame and stone floor. He suffered an injury to his head.

The suspect is described as approximately 6ft tall, of medium build with short hair. He was wearing a white t-shirt.

PC Lee Phillips said: We are following a number of lines of enquiry as part of this investigation and we'd like to speak to anyone who may have seen this man or have any information relating to the incident. We believe that there were other people in the area at the time and hope that someone can help us find this man.

"Anyone with information is asked to call PC Phillips at West Mercia Police on 07971 395405 or visit Ledbury Police Station quoting incident 22/57789/20. Alternatively, information can be given to the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
