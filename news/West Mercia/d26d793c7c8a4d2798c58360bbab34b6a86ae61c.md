We are appealing for witnesses following a serious incident of criminal damage in the area Quarry Road park on Tuesday 29 October between 5.30pm and 6pm.

PCSO Elena Daffurn said: "An elderly resident was disturbed by a loud bang at her window, followed by the front door bell being rung. When the door was answered no one was there, however she did hear three or four male youths shouting foul and abusive language towards her before leaving.

"As she returned inside her home shutting her front door, the entire outer front window pane shattered. The victim was left extremely shaken and distressed by the whole incident. We believe the damage was caused by an air rifle or possibly a firework dangerously aimed at her window.

"Incidents like this are very upsetting and leave local people, especially the elderly and the vulnerable understandably concerned and worried. I would ask that anyone with any information about the incident please call West Mercia Police on 101 quoting incident number 0568s of 29 October 2019."

Alternatively, you can contact independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their website: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/
