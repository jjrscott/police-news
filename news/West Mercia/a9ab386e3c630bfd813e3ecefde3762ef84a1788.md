We are appealing for witnesses following an incident at Rifle Range Nature Reserve in Kidderminster.

Between 9am and 10am on Sunday 15 November, it is believed a dog was attacked by another dog which was loose and off the lead.

Unfortunately the injured dog had to be put down later that day. We are appealing for anyone with information to contact PC Noke on 07773042032 reference 22/97603/20.
