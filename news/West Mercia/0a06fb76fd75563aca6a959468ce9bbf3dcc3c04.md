Police are appealing for two men who are believed to have witnessed an assault in Telford to come forward.

Between 7.30pm and 8pm on Wednesday 29 July a woman in her thirties was attacked along the footpath leading to St Quentin Gate near the shopping centre. The victim suffered serious injuries to her face and was taken to hospital for treatment.

A 44 year-old man from Telford was arrested on suspicion of assault on Thursday 30 July and has since been bailed until 20 August.

Police are appealing for any witnesses who may have seen the attack to come forward and are particularly interested in speaking with two men who are believed to have filmed some of the incident.

Anyone with information should call 101 quoting incident 643 of 29 July or Crimestopper anonymously on 0800 555111.
