Police are appealing for witnesses to a robbery which happened on a bus in Redditch.

Officers were contacted at around 2pm on 11 March to reports that money was stolen from the bus driver when it was stopping at Tanhouse Lane. Police have been carrying out enquiries but are now asking the public for help.

A man boarded the bus with a woman and as the pair were getting off the vehicle at Church Hill Clinic the man leaned over and stole a bag of cash from the driver before him and the woman ran from the scene.

Anyone with information is urged to contact 101 quoting incident 369s 100320 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
