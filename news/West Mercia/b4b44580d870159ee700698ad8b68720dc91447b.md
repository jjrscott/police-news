Police are appealing for information following burglaries on High Street, Rubery.

Overnight on Sunday 9 February and into the early hours of Monday 10 February two business premises were broken into. Offenders gained access to properties and items were stolen.

PC Andy Wright from Bromsgrove Patrol team said "I'm appealing for witnesses who may have seen anyone acting suspiciously in the area either the day before or overnight.

"I would also be keen to hear from those who may have information regarding these incidents. This follows an attempted break in a few weeks earlier.

"Please call us on 101 to report any information quoting reference 83S 100220 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
