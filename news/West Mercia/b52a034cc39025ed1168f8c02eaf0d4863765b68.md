A Hereford man has been charged as part of a West Mercia Police investigation into burglaries in Herefordshire and Monmouth.

Steven Locke, 52 of St Peters Close, was arrested at his home at around 7am yesterday (Tuesday 21 April) and has been charged with four counts of burglary.

The most recent burglary happened overnight between Saturday 18 and Sunday 19 April when antique china crockery was stolen from the home of a 91-year-old woman near Burcott.

Watches, a chainsaw, garden tools and cash were stolen in three other burglaries in Upper Lyde, Coldwells Road in Hereford and Osbaston in Monmouth between September 2019 and April this year.

Locke appeared at Hereford Magistrates Court this morning (Wednesday 22 April) and entered no plea. He has been remanded in custody and will appear at Hereford Crown Court during the week commencing 18 May.
