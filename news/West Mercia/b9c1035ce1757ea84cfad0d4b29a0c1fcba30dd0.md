A substantial number of cannabis plants have been seized after a concerned member of the public contacted us.

Officers visited a property on Drovers Way, Worcester yesterday afternoon (Thursday 18 March) to find the substantial grow of cannabis with over 150 plants.

Safer Neighbourhood Inspector, Dave Troth, said: "Acting on information from the community we have disrupted a large cannabis cultivation of over 150 plants in Worcester."

He continued: "We want to make our communities even safer and when members of our communities help us by providing this type of valuable information it enables us to tackle serious and organised crime together!"

If you are aware or think you know of any criminality such as this, or if you think someone is growing or selling drugs please contact your Safer Neighbourhood Team. If you have information but don't feel comfortable speaking to police, you can speak to the independent charity Crimestoppers. It is 100% anonymous, they never ask your name and they cannot trace your call or I.P address. You can contact them online or by calling 0800 555 111.
