Opening times at our police station front counters are reverting to our usual hours as we move into Tier 2 Covid-19 restrictions.

Front counters are open to the public allowing them to call for appointments with police officers, report crime and ask for advice.

All West Mercia Police front counters will now be open from 8am to 6.30pm Monday to Saturday and 10am to 4pm on Sunday.

Superintendent Rik Klair said: "We'd like to thank the public for their on-going co-operation over recent weeks and now that some of the recent restrictions have lifted it is right that we revert our front counters back to normal opening hours.

"I'd also like to remind people that a range of incidents can be reported to us directly via our website. Remember, if it's not 999 you can report it online."

Incidents such as antisocial behaviour, theft, criminal damage, suspected Covid-19 breaches and road traffic collisions can be reported here. These reports are handled and prioritised in exactly the same way as calls to 101. Reporting online helps to free up call lines, ensuring that we can prioritise emergencies effectively.
