**The family of Stuart Fletcher who sadly died on the B4362 at Shobdon following a road traffic collision on Friday 25 October 2019 have paid tribute to him.**

Stuart was a highly respected Butcher and extremely well known to shoppers around North Herefordshire. He opened his first shop in Pembridge in 1992. Over the years, he ran shops in Presteigne, Kington and Leominster, earning plaudits and prizes for the quality of his produce, which he insisted should never be compromised. He also had a successful Hog Roast business, further enhancing his reputation.

In the last 12 months, he has been driving for Lucton School, and derived great satisfaction, and popularity, from interaction with pupils, parents and staff alike.

Away from work, Stuart was a classic car enthusiast and a founder member of Cross Cruisers Custom and Classic Car Club.

He will be sorely missed by his family and many friends.
