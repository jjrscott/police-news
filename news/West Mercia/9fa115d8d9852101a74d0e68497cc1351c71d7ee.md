Police are appealing for help to identify a man in CCTV footage following an assault in Shrewsbury.

At around 7.30pm on Sunday 4 October a man in his thirties was assaulted leaving him with facial injuries in the Henry Tudor House pub on Barracks Passage.

We are keen to speak to the man in the CCTV as we believe he can help us with our investigation.

Anyone who has information or is able to identify the man should contact PC Shephard-Verlon on 07970543632 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.

Alternatively information can be passed anonymously on our website on the Tell Us About section.
