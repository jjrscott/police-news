Officers from across North Worcestershire together with partner agencies were out this morning targeting modern day slavery.

Inspector Dave King said: "This is vital work in safeguarding people being exploited by organised crime groups. Quite often vulnerable and abused people are transported to workplaces via the M5 (where we were this morning) and working with our colleagues from the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA) and Central Motorway patrol Group (CMPG) we are making sure this is as difficult as possible for them.

"Slavery is a gross exploitation of another human and we will continue to work hard to safeguard their welfare."
