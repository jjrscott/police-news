Detectives investigating a murder in Green Lane, Worcester are keen to identify a potential witness.

On Tuesday 9 March officers were called to an address in the street, sadly a woman in her 60s was pronounced dead at the scene.

Officers are keen to identify a man who walked past the property around 10.30am on the morning of the incident.

Detective Sergeant Grant Lawrence said: "We are trying to trace a man who walked past the property in Green Lane at around 10.30am on Tuesday 9 March. It's important to stress we do not believe this man was involved in the incident in any way and he is not suspected of any wrongdoing but we believe he may have walked past the property in Green Lane at the relevant time and we wish to speak with him in case he saw or heard anything that may assist with the investigation."

Officers have an image of the man which they may consider releasing if they're unable to identify him.

Detectives can be contacted through 101 quoting incident 164i of 9 March or via the Tell Us About section of the West Mercia Police website.

A 49-year-old woman has been charged with murder and is currently in custody after first appearing at court on March 11.
