Mark Edwards, who went missing form his home around 9pm on Friday night (5 June), has been found safe.

An exhaustive search was conducted through the night by several elements of both the police and fire service for 56 year old Mark Edwards.

Mark, from Bewdley, has mobility and sight issues and officers called on the support of NPAS (National Police Air Service) in the search which went on through the night.

Inspector Jake Wright said: "Early this this morning the helicopter search located Mark a fair distance from his home. Officers were directed to him and he was located and attended to by paramedics and then taken home.

"We would like to thank the public for their support in this appeal and to all our emergency services colleagues who together helped to find Mark and bring him home safely."
