Yesterday, Sunday 3 November, we issued an appeal to the public for information after a video had been circulated on social media showing an elderly member of the public being pushed over in Pershore and we can now provide the following update:

Sergeant Geraint Perkins said: "Following our appeal to the community over the weekend I'm pleased to say we have now been able to identify the man captured in the footage. Thankfully he was not seriously injured in the incident and is now being supported by our officers.

"I'd like to thank the public for helping share our appeal and for coming forward with information"

A 17-year-old boy was arrested in connection to the incident and has been released under investigation.
