Police investigating the murder of Tamba Momodu are continuing to appeal for dash cam footage.

Tamba was shot on Tuesday 13 October in the car park of the Bridges Business Park. Sadly, he died as a result of his injuries.

Last week, Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Chief Inspector Mark Bellamy appealed to anyone with information to come forward, either to police or Crimestoppers, to help find answers for Tamba's family.

Detectives are now appealing for dashcam footage from the afternoon of Monday 12 October in or around Holyhead Road, near to Ercall Lane in Wellington.

Detective Chief Inspector Mark Bellamy said: "We know that there would have been a number of vehicles in the area at the time as there is a school nearby and parents will have been collecting their children from school. If any parents do have any dash cam footage from the afternoon of Monday 12 October I would ask they get in contact."

Footage can be submitted via the Major Incident Public Portal
