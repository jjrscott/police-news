Officers are appealing for help following the reported theft of a car and bank cards at a premises on Redditch Road in Alvechurch.

On Friday 3 January the victim notified the police that she had received a call from her bank stating her bank cards had been used and checked to see her car had also been stolen. It is believed her car keys had been stolen from her coat while hanging in a cupboard at her workplace. It is not believed that the theft was carried out by any of the victim's colleagues.

Officers investigating the reported crime would like to speak to the two women in the CCTV images who they believe can assist in their investigation.

If anyone knows the identification and/or location of the women in the images please call West Mercia Police on 101 quoting **crime ref: 22/1072/20**
