Breaking News Post

Non-emergency crimes and incidents should be reported to us online in an accessible and convenient way.

If you have a non-emergency crime or incident to report, please use the force's website www.westmercia.police.uk wherever possible.

Simply go to the website and click on 'report' and then choose the appropriate section. If they are reporting a crime they will be directed through a series of short questions to establish some basic details of what has happened. Once the information is submitted it will be assessed and allocated to the appropriate team.

Types of incidents and crimes that can be reported online include:

 * Anti-social behaviour
 * Stolen or damaged property
 * Minor road traffic incidents (without injury)
 * Low level threats or verbal abuse
 * When you have been assaulted
 * Report an abandoned vehicle
 * Report minor online crime

Users reporting crime online will receive a crime reference number and will either receive an email, text or telephone call depending on the nature of their report.
