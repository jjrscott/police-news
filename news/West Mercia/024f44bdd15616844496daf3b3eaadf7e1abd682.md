We are appealing for witnesses following a collision in Evesham that has left a motorcyclist in a critical condition in hospital.

At around 3pm last Thursday (29 October) a white panel van and a black Suzuki motorcycle were in collision on the B4510 Offenham Road, Evesham.

The two vehicles were traveling in opposite direction when the van has turned right to cross the road, this is when the motorcycle has collided with the van.

The motorcyclist remains in a critical but stable condition at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham.

If you saw the incident or have dash cam footage please contact PC Rob Taylor on 07773042528 using reference 00318 I 29 October or online through www.westmercia.police.uk/TUA
