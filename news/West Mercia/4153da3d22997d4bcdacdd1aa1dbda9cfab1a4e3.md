Police are in attendance at a fatal collision on the M50 eastbound near Ledbury.

At around 12.20am this morning (Monday 31 August) a Jeep Cherokee was involved in a collision and a man in his thirties sadly died at the scene.

One lane remains closed but officers and other emergency services are working to reopen it.

Our thoughts are with the man's friends and family at this difficult time.
