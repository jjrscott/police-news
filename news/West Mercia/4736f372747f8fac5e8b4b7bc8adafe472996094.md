Telford police dispersed an unlicensed music event in Stafford Park on Monday 31 August.

At around 12.30am officers were called to the large gathering which had been advertised on social media channels. Approximately 100 people were dispersed from the event and given advice on social distancing laws and guidelines. The sound equipment was seized and the organiser reported for summons.

Superintendent Jim Baker said: "When officers attended this unlicensed event it was clear that social distancing was not being adhered to and the gathering was posing a risk to the health of all those attending. Therefore it was quickly dispersed and the sound equipment seized.

"To the organisers of this sort of activity, I strongly advise that you seriously consider the risks you're creating for everyone in attendance and the wider community.

"Restrictions on large gatherings and unlicensed events are still in place and we will continue to engage within our communities, taking enforcement action where necessary.

"I would encourage anyone thinking of attending such an illegal event to think twice and consider both the legal and health consequences.

"The public have been instrumental in reporting information that has led to gatherings such as this being dispersed. If such an event is taking place in your community and you fear it is in breach of regulations or is causing significant concern, please report it to police online or via 101. Only contact 999 in an emergency."
