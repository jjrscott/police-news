Police are appealing for witnesses following a non-stop collision in Shrewsbury.

At around 5pm on Thursday 24 September on the A488 near Lea Cross, a Volkswagen Polo was being driven on the wrong side of the road causing a collision with two other vehicles; a Vauxhall Astra and Volkswagen Scirocco.

The driver of the Astra suffered serious injuries and she was taken to Royal Shrewsbury Hospital. The Scirocco driver suffered minor injuries to his hip but did not attend hospital.

The driver of the offending vehicle failed to stop at the incident and police are keen to locate the motorist.

PC Simon Brenton said: "We are appealing to the public to help us locate the offending driver whose disregard for other's safety has left a woman seriously injured and another person hurt. They have also caused extensive damage to the vehicles involved and caused the road to be closed for some time.

"This type of dangerous driving will not be tolerated and we ask the community to help us find the offender whilst we continue our enquiries."

Anyone with information or dash-cam footage is urged to call 101 quoting incident 00474i of 24092020 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800555111. Alternatively information can be passed through the online reporting function on West Mercia Police website under the section Tell Us About https://www.westmercia.police.uk/
