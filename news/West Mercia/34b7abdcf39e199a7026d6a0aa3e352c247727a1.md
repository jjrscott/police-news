The incident happened at just before 9am at the junction of Bromyard Road and Broadway Grove when a grey Skoda Fabia estate collided with a wall.

It is believed the 72-year-old driver of the vehicle suffered a medical episode before the collision occurred. Sadly, he was pronounced dead at the scene. His next of kin has been informed.

Road closures were put in place while emergency services were in attendance.

PC Michael Boswell said: "While investigations are on-going to establish the circumstances surrounding this incident, we are appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the collision or has dash cam footage to come forward.

"Sadly, we can confirm that a man died - we have informed his family and our thoughts remain with them at this difficult time."

Anyone with any information or dash cam footage is asked to contact West Mercia Police on 101 quoting incident number 0092S of 20 April 2020.
