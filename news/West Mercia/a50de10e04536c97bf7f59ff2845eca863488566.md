We are appealing for witnesses following a collision on the M5 junction 4 at Lydiate Ash, earlier today (Tuesday 12 January).

It happened at just before 10am on the southbound carriageway and involved a lorry, a car and a pedestrian.

It is believed that a black BMW was travelling along the motorway when it struck the side of the bridge at junction 4 - the nearside of the carriageway - and came to rest in lane 1. It is understood the driver got out of his car and was then in collision with a white HGV which was travelling in lane 2.

PC Simon Carpenter said: "We'd like to thank the witnesses we've already spoken to but if there is anyone else who saw the incident or has dash-cam footage we'd ask them to contact us."

The BMW driver suffered serious injuries and is currently receiving treatment in hospital.

Any witnesses to the collision that haven't yet spoken to officers or anyone with dash-cam footage is asked to report the details on the West Mercia Police website under the section tell us about or via 101 quoting incident 00117i of 12 January.

SJ, Corporate Communications.
