We are appealing for the public's help in locating Steven Scarratt.

Scarratt is 29 years-old of no fixed abode, with connections to Evesham, Stourport and Oxford areas.

We want to locate him in relation to a number of offences, in particular theft from homes in Pershore, Evesham and Kidderminster.

If you have seen Scarratt, do not approach him and call 101 with any information.
