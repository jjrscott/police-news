Anti-Slavery Day, which takes place on Sunday 18 October, allows us to raise awareness of human trafficking and modern slavery within the three counties.

There are currently an estimated 40.3 million people trapped in some form of modern slavery in the world today, with 136,000 victims estimated in the UK.

The Modern Slavery Act 2015 is part of the UK Government's Modern Slavery Strategy, launched in November 2014. The strategy details a range of actions and priorities in fighting human trafficking in the UK and internationally.

Our officers follow the strategy to work on pursuing those responsible, preventing people from engaging in it, protecting vulnerable people from exploitation and preparing by improving victim identification and enhanced support and protection

We work closely with our communities to establish potential victims and perpetrators, our officers take part in training to enhance their understanding of modern slavery in order to better address and deal with situations they might find.
