We are appealing for information and witnesses to come forward following a collision on Sunday (February 21) involving a car and a bicycle.

The collision happened at 2.30pm on Studley Road, Redditch at its junction with Auxerre Avenue.

Sergeant Dan Bate said: "A white Citroen C1 and a bicycle were in collision and unfortunately the cyclist, a man in his 30s, is currently in hospital with critical injuries and is receiving medical treatment.

"Anyone with information or dash-cam footage is urged to contact 101 quoting reference 377i of 21 February, or alternatively information can be reported online through the Tell Us About section of our website."
