We are currently at the scene of a dog attack at a home on Braces Lane in Marlbrook.

The Boerboel's owners, a man and a woman, were bitten and require hospital treatment.

Firearms officers are in attendance and attempts are being made to secure the dog which is still in the property.

We would like to reassure the community this is an isolated incident and the increased police presence is a precautionary measure.
