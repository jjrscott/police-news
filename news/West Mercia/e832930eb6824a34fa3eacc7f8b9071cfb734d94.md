A man has been sentenced to 16 years imprisonment for historic child sexual abuse, in Worcester, during the 1970s and 1980s.

Philip Oliver, aged 70-years-old, of Wilson Road, Shurdington, Cheltenham was sentenced on Friday 20 September at Worcester Crown Court where he was found guilty of sexual intercourse with a child under 13, four counts of indecent assault and four counts of indecency with a child following a six day trial.

The offences were committed against one girl between the ages of four and fourteen years-old between 1972 and 1982 while Oliver was a resident in Worcester.

Detective Sergeant Michelle Cook of West Mercia Police, who led the investigation said: "The victim in this case has endured several years of trauma and distress because of what she went through at the hands of Mr Oliver.

"And, although there may be more tough times ahead, I hope this sentence will help her have a sense of closure after what she endured.

"I would like to commend the victim, who throughout the investigation has demonstrated great strength and courage in how she has conducted herself through this difficult and traumatic time."

She continued: "I hope this will encourage other victims to speak out in order to gain the justice they deserve and ensure that dangerous sex offenders are prevented from offending again. We want victims to know that we will treat their reports seriously."
