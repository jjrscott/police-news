Police are warning members of the public to be wary of donating cash to street charity collectors without checking they are genuine.

Officers received a reports of a 'distraction' type theft after an elderly man was targeted at a museum in Load Street, Bewdley, on Sunday 17 November, when a woman posing as a charity worker persistently requested a donation from him.

When the man agreed to make a donation she informed him that that she required his signature and needed it verifying with a document such as a driving licence, which then prompted him to produce his wallet. At this point she placed a clipboard over the top of the wallet and removed Â£200 from it without the victim noticing.

PC Chris Hillman said: "Genuine charity collectors will carry identification, charity collecting tins and will not ask the person donating for ID. I'd like to urge people to be vigilant if they are approached and asked to donate money."

Anyone with information on this distraction theft is asked to call West Mercia Police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
