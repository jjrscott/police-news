We can confirm that human remains have been found in Newland near Malvern, on Friday 12 June 2020, and sadly have been identified as missing man Matt Bone.

Matt was 26, when he went missing two years ago whilst visiting the Malvern Hills. He had checked into a local hotel - the Stanbrook Abbey on Friday 9 March 2018 and was reported missing on Sunday 11 March 2018.

Detective Inspector Beth Wells said: "We are sad to report that Matt Bone was found on Friday 12 June 2020 and has now been formally identified. His family have been informed and specially trained officers are supporting them through this tragic time.

"This is understandably an emotional time for Matt's family and our sympathies remain with his family and friends."

She continued: "I would like to take this opportunity to thank the public who shared our appeals and helped in our search for Matt over the past two years."

Statement from Matt's family: "Thank you to all who have supported us over the past two years, with special thanks to West Mercia Police and Missing People who have always acted with compassion and kindness throughout our difficult times. Matt may be gone but his light shines on."

Matt's death is not being treated as suspicious.
