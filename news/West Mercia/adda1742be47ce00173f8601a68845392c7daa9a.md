Following a West Mercia Police investigation, a man has been sentenced to prison for domestic assault.

Steven Lock aged 47 from Wharf Cottages, Ludlow Road, Leominster in Herefordshire appeared at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Friday 28 February where he was sentenced to a total of 11 years with 8 to be served in custody.

Lock had assaulted the victim, his partner, on several occasions and elected for a trial however he was convicted by a jury.

Following the sentencing, Detective Inspector Mark Peters said: "I hope that this conviction demonstrates our on-going commitment to victims of domestic abuse which so often takes place over an extended period of time prior to coming to the attention of police.

"The victim in this case has been extremely brave, and I want to commend her for her support and integrity throughout the investigation and trial.

"I also would like to say to any victim of domestic abuse to please come forward and to report it to the police by calling 101. If a crime is ongoing always call 999. We have specially trained officers working across West Mercia Police who will do everything possible to safeguard those who are vulnerable and victims of domestic violence and abuse."

If you have been a victim, or witnessed domestic abuse and do not wish to speak to the police, please contact the free-phone, 24 hour Women's Aid National Domestic Abuse Helpline on 0808 2000 247.
