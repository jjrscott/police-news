Police investigating a collision in Redditch are keen to trace a vehicle involved and are appealing for witnesses or information.

Earlier today (Wednesday 17 March) at around 5.20am, it is believed a cyclist was hit by a vehicle on Oakenshaw roundabout onto Rough Hill Drive. The cyclist, a man in his 30s, suffered cuts and a significant injury to his head. He was taken to hospital where he continues to receive treatment.

The vehicle failed to stop at the scene of the collision.

Officers are carrying out enquiries to trace the driver and would urge anyone with information to come forward.

Anyone with information is asked to contact West Mercia Police on 101 quoting reference 42i of 17 March or report the information online under the Tell Us About section of this website.

Alternatively, if you have information but don't feel comfortable speaking to police, you can speak to the independent charity Crimestoppers. It is 100% anonymous, they never ask your name and they cannot trace your call or I.P address. You can contact them online or by calling 0800 555 111.
