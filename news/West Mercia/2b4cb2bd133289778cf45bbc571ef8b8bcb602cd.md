Officers are asking if the public have any information regarding an incident which happened on Lickey Hills in Bromsgrove on 22 August.

At around 5pm on Saturday 22 August a family out walking on the Lickey Hills were approached by a chocolate brown Labrador dog without an owner nearby which then proceeded to knock over their small child.

A man was then seen by the mother reportedly watching and smiling at the uncontrolled dog which was then jumping on the family and children. The man was white, about 5ft 10" and in his late 20 or early 30s with dark brown or black hair and had brown wispy facial hair. He has a tattoo on his left hand, was wearing a light grey hooded top with the hood up and darker grey bottoms, with white Nike trainers.

PC Jinks said: "The man became abusive and threatening to assault the father when he eventually came to collect his dog. This was a very scary incident for all the family and we would very much like to speak to this man.

"If you witnessed the incident or have any information about the man or think you may know him, please call us on 101 and quote crime ref 22/71782/20"
