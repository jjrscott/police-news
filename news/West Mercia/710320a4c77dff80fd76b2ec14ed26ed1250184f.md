Officers are appealing for the owner of a games console to come forward following an arrest on 12 July.

A man in his 40s and from Kidderminster was arrested on suspicion of theft near to the Bonemill Waste Recycling Centre on Minster Road, Stourport on Severn on Sunday 12 July. The arrested man had in his possession a number of items including scrap metal, power tools and a kitchen sink.

Sergeant Malcolm Blythe said: "The man was arrested and released under investigation however we would very much like to hear from anyone who deposited an **old gaming console and games** that were likely in a white Primark 'bag for life' and probably discarded at the recycling centre on Saturday 11 July or the Sunday itself.

"The centre suffers from trespassing out of hours with people stealing items of scrap and electrical equipment and yes, sometimes even the kitchen sink! But while this may seem unimportant as it is 'rubbish' anyway, what many people may not be aware of is that the ownership of all items deposited to recycling are technically transferred to the council. More importantly in terms of public health, there are very real safety concerns for people trespassing on the site as dangerous items and unseen chemicals can be present and that is why there are specialist staff to identify and deposit these items safely."

"Anyone who saw anyone acting suspiciously at or near the centre on 12 July around 8pm or can identify the games console, please call us on 101 and quote 0075i of 12 July 2020."
