We are appealing for witnesses following a reported robbery in Kidderminster.

At around 2pm on Thursday 29 October a taxi driver dropped off a male passenger in Radford Avenue. A verbal argument then broke out between the taxi driver and the man.

PC Jordan Unitt, who is leading the investigation, said: "As the man left the taxi it is believed that he made racist comments before entering the taxi again through the passenger side. He then hit the driver and took a small bag of money from the vehicle before running off towards Baxter Avenue.

"No-one should have to tolerate this disgusting behaviour whilst doing their job and we are investigating this matter. The man was dropped off on a busy street corner at around lunchtime so I'm appealing for anyone who saw this incident to contact us."

The man is described as white, in his early 20s, around 6ft tall, and of a large build. He was wearing a black jacket.

Anyone with information is asked to report via our website or contact 101 quoting crime reference 22/92726/20. You can also give information without giving your name by calling Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
