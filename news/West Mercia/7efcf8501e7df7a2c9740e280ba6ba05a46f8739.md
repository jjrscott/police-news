Police are appealing for witnesses after a man in his 60's was reportedly assaulted in a supermarket car park on Coldfield Drive, Redditch.

The incident took place at 3.45pm on Tuesday 31 December when the man was walking across the car park and the driver of a silver Ford car shouted verbal abuse out of his window at the victim. The driver then got out of his car and made his way towards the man and then pushed him on his back.

The offender is a man described as white, aged approximately in his mid 20s and dishevelled in his appearance.

PC Helen Stark said: "Thankfully the man who was assaulted did not suffer any physical injuries but he was very shaken after the incident. We have made a number of enquiries into this incident and we would really like to speak to a lady who may have witnessed what happened. She approached the victim after the incident had occurred to check that he was okay."

Anyone with information is asked to contact PC 3566 Stark on 01905 747080 quoting reference 395s 311219 or alternatively information can be passed to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
