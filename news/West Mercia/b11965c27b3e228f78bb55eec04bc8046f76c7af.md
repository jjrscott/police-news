**Are you heading to a fireworks display or bonfire this weekend?**

Please mind where and how you park and make sure it's legal and not blocking people's driveways or general access to properties.

If noise is a problem unfortunately we have very limited powers to deal with it (the prosecuting body is your local authority) - there's more advice on our website.

As long as people follow laws on fireworks and their usage we also can't help with pets being distressed but the RSPCA has advice: rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/pets/general/fireworks

Please do contact us if there's a risk of harm to a person or damage to their property or there is a vulnerable person present (999 for emergencies, 101 for non-emergencies).

Thank you and have a great weekend!
