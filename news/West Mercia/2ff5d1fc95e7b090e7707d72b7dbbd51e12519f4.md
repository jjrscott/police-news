We are appealing for witnesses to an assault in Kidderminster.

The incident is reported to have happened on Lea Street at around 11pm yesterday evening (Monday 2 December).

A man was walking down Lea Street when he was approached by two men.

The two men are believed to have then seriously assaulted the victim and threatened him with a knife, taking his wallet and phone, before leaving the area in the direction of Kidderminster train station.

The victim, a man in his 60s, sustained head injuries and was taken to hospital for treatment. He has now been released from hospital.

Detective Constable Paul Lofthouse said: "This is believed to be an isolated incident, investigations are ongoing and we are appealing for any witnesses to this assault, which left a man requiring hospital treatment, to please come forward. If you have any information, no matter how insignificant it may seem, please call West Mercia Police on 101, quoting incident number 001s of 3 December."

Alternatively, information can be passed to the independent charity Crime stoppers by calling 0800 555 111 or via their website.
