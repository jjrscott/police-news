Following our earlier appeal for information after a sexual assault in Worcester this afternoon (22 July), officers have arrested a man.

At around 5.15pm a woman was walking along Grosmont Avenue in Worcester talking on her phone, when a man stopped her to ask her the time. He then attacked and sexually assaulted the woman before several members of the public intervened and the suspect ran off.

A man in his 40s has been arrested on suspicion of attempted rape and is in police custody at Worcester Police Station.

We would like to thank the public for their immediate support following our appeal.
