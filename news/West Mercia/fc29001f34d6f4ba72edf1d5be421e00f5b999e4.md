PC Rowan Boyle said: "As this incident shows we do act on information given us and I'd like to take this opportunity to publically thank those that did come forward.

"We do take bike thefts seriously as we know how vital they can be for work, socialising and physical and mental health. We will now make every effort to return these bikes to their rightful owners."

A man and a woman, both in their 30s and from Worcester, were arrested on suspicion of theft. They have been released under investigation pending further enquiries.
