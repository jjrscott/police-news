Police are appealing for witnesses after cash was stolen from The Court Leet Hungry House pub on Worcester Road, Bromsgrove.

The incident happened at around 6am on Tuesday, 19 November 2019, when people broke into the pub.

PC Dan Icke said: "We believe the individuals, who were wearing hoods, forced entry into the pub and removed cash from the gaming machines before leaving the scene.

"The incident happened on a busy main road and traffic would have started to increase around this time so I would appeal to anyone who may have seen anything suspicious to contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact West Mercia Police on 101 quoting incident number 0072s of 19 November 2019 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
