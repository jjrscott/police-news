Two men were found guilty of offences connected to county lines drug dealing when they appeared at Worcester Crown Court on Friday, 21 February.

On the 6 March both men were sentenced at Worcester Crown Court; Rubel Miah received five years and eight months in prison and Usman Shazad was sentenced to five years in prison.

Rubel Miah, who is 32 years old and from Taunton Road, Birmingham and Usman Shazad, 26 years old and from Brantford Road in Birmingham, were found guilty of conspiring to sell class A drugs in Malvern on 23 June 2018.

The pair were stopped by police officers in North Malvern Road and were found in possession of a number of mobile phones, cash and heroin. During the course of the investigation it was discovered that they had also travelled to Malvern on a number of previous occasions.

Sergeant Tandy said: "The drugs that the pair were supplying to Malvern was a well-established line that we believe had been ongoing for some time. We are determined to shut down county lines networks and this investigation is testament to that commitment."
