Today in Stourport, teams from Safer Roads, Roads Policing and Stourport SNT reacted to community concerns around the dangerous speeds some motorists are doing in and through Stourport.

PSCO Andy Stevens from Stourport SNT said "Following these legitimate concerns for their community's safety, Safer Roads conducted a very successful Road Safety operation in Stourport basing themselves in locations on Hartlebury Road, Lickhill Road and Bewdley Road.

"As well as the above operation Roads Policing Officers, Response Officers from Kidderminster and Stourport SNT were using laser equipment on the Discovery Road and Minster Road to record the speeds of motorists along the dual carriageway where one motorist today was recorded doing 90mph. Apart from the dangerous speeds some people felt were appropriate on a 70mph road, we stopped many other motorists and addressed concerns with their vehicles.

"It was very satisfying to be in the community preventing speeding, educating drivers as well as enforcing the law and I look forward to working with my colleagues in the near future in another successful operation keeping people safe and protecting road users and pedestrians from harm."
