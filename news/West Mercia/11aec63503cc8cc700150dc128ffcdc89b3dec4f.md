Police are warning the public to take extra care when using online sales sites after a man was robbed in Whitchurch.

At around 10pm on Sunday 28 June a man went to buy a Blue French Bulldog from an address in Kingsway after following up on ad he saw online. He met with two men and gave the owner cash.

The first man is described as white, around 35-years-old, 6ft, of a large build with tattoos and a goatee. He wore grey trousers, blue Nike trainers and a cap. The second man is white, around 5ft 2ins, with a ginger beard and wore all black.

When the victim went to leave another two men came out, who were both white wearing black clothing and caps, one armed with a weapon and demanded the victim return the dog to them. All four men spoke with a Liverpool accent.

When the victim gave the bulldog back he called the police as he left.

We would particularly like to hear from anyone travelling on the A41 and A525 between 9pm and 11pm on 28 June who may have dashcam footage that could help with our investigation.

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting incident 765s of 28 June or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
