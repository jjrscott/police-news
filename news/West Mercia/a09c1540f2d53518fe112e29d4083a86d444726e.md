We are appealing for witnesses to an assault in Callow Bridge Road, Rubery, at around 7.30pm on Saturday 4 January 2020.

A 16-year-old was walking with two friends when it is believed that a group of men followed them into an alleyway blocking their path.

The teenage boy was struck and entered the road briefly where cars have moved to avoid him.

One of the men in the group started to produce a bladed weapon. The weapon was not used during the assault and the victim was able to run away.

The group of men then left the area in the direction of 'St Chads Park'.

The victim sustained minor injuries and his smartphone was taken.

West Mercia Police Officer Dan Icke said: "This is believed to be an isolated incident and investigations are ongoing. We are appealing for any witnesses to this assault, which left a young-man considerably shaken by the ordeal, to please come forward.

If you have any information, no matter how insignificant it may seem, please call West Mercia Police on 101."

If you have any information, no matter how insignificant it may seem, please call West Mercia Police on 101, quoting incident number 0578s of Saturday 4 January.

Alternatively, information can be passed to the independent charity Crime stoppers by calling 0800 555 111 or via their website.
