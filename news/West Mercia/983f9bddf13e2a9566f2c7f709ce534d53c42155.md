**At around 10.20pm last night (27 August) officers were called by a member of the public following a reported assault on the High Street in Ross-on-Wye.**

Officers who attended the scene found a man with injuries which were reported to be from a chemical thrown onto him and he was treated at the scene by paramedics.
