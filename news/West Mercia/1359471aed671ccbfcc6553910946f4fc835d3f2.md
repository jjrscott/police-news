We currently have cordons in place at three locations in Worcester including the Diglis footbridge, Waterworks Road and Cheviot Close as part of an investigation into a serious incident. We would ask people to remain out of these areas whist we investigate.

As part of the investigation we are working closely with Herefordshire and Worcestershire Fire and Rescue Service and South Wales Police Specialist Search team who will be searching the River Severn in the Diglis area.

Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Chief Inspector Dean Jones, said: A 24- year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is currently in police custody. We believe this to be an isolated incident."

We have no further updates at this time.
