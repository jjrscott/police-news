A man has been arrested after a warrant was carried out in Telford this morning.

Earlier today police carried out the warrant at an address in Victoria Avenue in Wellington.

Drugs, believed to be crack cocaine and cannabis, were seized.

A 24 year old man was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply.

Detective Inspector Barry Spencer, from Telford Proactive CID, said: "Drugs and drugs supply blight our communities and we will continue to do all we can to disrupt the supply of them onto our streets.

"Despite the current restrictions we will continue our work to target those suspected of causing the most harm in our communities."
