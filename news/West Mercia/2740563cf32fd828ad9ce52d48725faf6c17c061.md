Around 3.30pm on Monday 23 March officers were called following a reported robbery in Shrubbery Avenue, Worcester.

The victim, a woman in her 30s from Birmingham was approached by a man with a large knife who took her gold chain and ran off in the direction of Barbourne Road, then leading onto Thorneloe Walk. Detective Constable Katie Miller said: "This was a very scary attack in which the victim was understandably upset and shaken.

"The suspect is described as a mixed race man, tall, of a thin build and his hair is very short and black. He was wearing a blue face mask, white clinical gloves, black jeans and a black or dark blue hoodie.

"I would like to hear from anybody who may be able to assist with our investigation and especially from anyone passing through the area in a vehicle equipped with a dash cam. If you have any information regarding the chain (as seen in the photograph) that was stolen or you were witnessed the incident please contact 101 quoting log reference 0405s of the 23 March 2020."
