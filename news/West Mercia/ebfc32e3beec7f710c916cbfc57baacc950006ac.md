We are urging anyone who is considering organising or attending an illegal rave to understand that these events will be dealt with robustly by officers, and those attending face the prospect of arrest.

Illegal raves have taken place in other areas of the country which has led to organisers being arrested.

Assistant Chief Constable Rachel Jones said: "We understand people's frustrations due to the current restrictions but have to stress an illegal rave is completely unacceptable and we will do all we can to prevent them from happening. We have comprehensive policing plans in place should a rave go ahead and anyone who attends could face the prospect of arrest and prosecution.

"I'd also ask anyone who is considering attending an illegal rave to remember that Covid-19 still presents a risk to our communities and attending a gathering like this poses a significant risk to those attending and their families' wellbeing.

"If anyone hears about an event like this taking place or has any intelligence about an event taking place, please get in touch with us so we can prevent it and ultimately help to prevent the spread of the virus. The key to stopping these events is early intelligence."

If you suspect an illegal gathering is being set up or there is suspicious activity in your local area which suggests a rave might be set up, please contact West Mercia Police via westmercia.org.uk, on 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
