Updated News Post

We are again appealing for witnesses following an incident on Poplar Road, Wichenford, Worcestershire on Friday 22 May.

At approximately 3.40pm on Friday (22 May) a 62-year-old man who had been cycling along Poplar Road was found by a passer-by after falling off his bike.

The cyclist received bruising and bleeding to his legs and went by ambulance to the Worcester Royal for further tests and scans. He has since been discharged however he still has injuries to his back which are expected to heal.

We would very much like to speak to the driver of a grey van thought to be a class 2 or 7.5 tonne, which had **Excel Logistics** written on the side.

The driver is described as a white man, between 40 and 50 years old, bald but with a beard. We believe this driver may have seen what happened, may have information regarding the incident or even dashcam footage which could help our investigation.

Anyone with information who may have seen the incident are encouraged to contact PC Venn from Bromsgrove station on 101 quoting reference 477s of the 22 May.
