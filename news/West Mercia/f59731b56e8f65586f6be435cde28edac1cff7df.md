Worcester Police Officers are continuing to enforce the 'Rule of Six' and the none wearing of face masks in regulated locations. Police have issued multiple tickets across the city including a house party, a birthday party in a commercial premise, outdoor gatherings as well as gatherings in private residential addresses.

We are actively patrolling the city and responding to reports of potential breaches.

South Worcestershire local commander, Superintendent Stephanie Brighton, said: "We know the vast majority of people are adhering to the Covid legislation, the wearing of face masks and the 'Rule of Six' and are acting incredibly responsibly.

"We are working closely with our partners and local community to help prevent the further spread of infections. Unfortunately there are a small number of people breaking the rules and where this is the case we will attend and if they don't comply with regulations we will use our powers which include enforcing with fixed penalty notices.

"It's pleasing to see that the majority of venues and the community of Worcester are compliant with the regulations but if anyone suspects that breaches are taking place we would ask them to report them directly to us."
