Police Dog Rosie has just completed her General Purpose Dog Course at West Mercia Dog School, Hindlip.

A National Crime Agency Dog Handler who unfortunately lost his previous police dog Lex to throat cancer, was in search of a new dog, when he approached West Mercia Dog School hoping they would be able to help.

Rosie had just been gifted to the force by her owner who had sadly been diagnosed with terminal cancer. She wanted the dog to go to a good home, having been advised that Rosie had good potential to be a working police dog, she reached out to West Mercia Police in August.

Following tests from the dog school instructors, Rosie was deemed suitable and her training began. The two were soon introduced - they were a 'pawfect' match! PD Rosie is now ready to be deployed with her NCA handler across the UK.
