One man has been arrested, and is currently in custody, after what was believed to be a firearm was seen in a house in Hereford.

In the early hours of this morning (Monday 16 September) a police response including a police firearm response and cordon was in place on Hinton Road, Hereford.

At around 7.30am officers arrested one man, aged 65, who remains in police custody.

The wider cordon has been removed, but a smaller cordon around the property remains while an investigation takes place.

Herefordshire Local policing commander, Superintendent Sue Thomas said: "Local residents may have seen armed officers in the area of Hinton Road, Hereford, and I want to reassure them that firearms incidents are extremely rare and we have arrested one man who remains in police custody.

"Local residents may see an increased police presence for some time this morning whilst we investigate."

She continued: "I would like to thank the local community for understanding our need to close the road for a number of hours during the early morning, the road is now re-opened."
