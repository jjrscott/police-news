Following a West Mercia Police investigation, led by Worcester's CID, three men were sentenced today (Thursday 9 January 2020) and imprisoned for the robbery of the Co-op supermarket on Davies Road, in Evesham.

They were found guilty after a two week trial at Hereford Crown Court in December 2019.

Reece Davies, 25, of Boscobel Avenue, Tipton, was jailed for eight years and six months for robbery.

Ashley Evans, 31, of Vale Street, West Bromwich, was jailed for eight years and six months for robbery.

On Sunday 7 July at around 10pm West Mercia Police received a call from the manager of the Co-op store, on Davis Road, describing how three men had attacked the premises, threatening staff at knifepoint before taking large sum of money. CCTV and house to house enquiries ensued.

During a warrant executed at a nearby home on Monday 8 July weapons and items pertaining to the crime were seized and individuals were arrested and charged.

Worcester CID, Detective Inspector Tony Garner said: "These men subjected innocent people who worked in the local supermarket to a horrific ordeal.

"Evans, Fellows and Davis planned and entered the Co-op store with a knife forcing staff to open the till and safe."

"The incidents have had a significant and lasting impact on the victims and their families. Businesses have been affected and the community shaken by the incident. The victims have shown great bravery in supporting this investigation and ensuring this conviction."

_*Latoria Lunnon, 21, of Hipton Hill, Evesham, was previously sentenced (13 December 2019) to a 12 month community order for concealment of criminal property._
