After being caught by our officers on the M5, two Birmingham men have been given prison sentences for drug offences.

Amar Ghalib, aged 38, of Maryland Avenue, Birmingham was sentenced to five years and seven months in jail for possession with intent to supply Class A drugs. Zishaan Imran, aged 26, of Heathfield Road, Birmingham, was sentenced to three years and six months for the same offence. Both appeared at Worcester Crown Court on Wednesday 10 February. The had previously entered a guilty plea to the charges.

The court heard that on 3 February, 2020, police attempted to stop the pair in a vehicle which was exiting the M5 junction 6 and heading towards Worcester. Imran and Ghalib tried to drive off and a package was thrown from the car. Officers were able to stop and arrest them both before recovering the package which contained heroin and cocaine; which had a street value of more than Â£3,000.

Detective Sergeant Luke Papps said: "We are extremely pleased that the work of the Worcester Proactive CID Team and the safer roads officers has led to these two men, and a significant amount of drugs, being taken off the streets.

"Tackling drugs and organised crime is a force priority and we will continue to relentlessly pursue those involved in these offences and the associated harm such as criminal exploitation, cuckoo-ing and street violence."

West Mercia Police's Protect campaign aims to tackle serious and organised crime together and is underpinned by a four P principle - Pursue, Prevent, Protect and Prepare.
