**Two brothers have been sentenced at Hereford Crown Court for charges relating to burglary and drugs offences.**

Hakiem Brown, 22, and Tyshane Brown, 24, both from Howard Court, Hereford, were involved in high level criminality in the town in 2018.

Hakiem Brown was found guilty of conspiracy to commit robbery by unanimous verdict and received a prison sentence of 45 months. Tyshane Brown was sentenced to four years for being concerned in the supply of class A drugs.

Following the sentencing on Monday (28 October), Detective Constable Jim Moore said: "I welcome this sentence as a demonstration that violence in our community will not be tolerated. Hakiem was found guilty of conspiracy to rob a taxi driver who was threatened at knife point. A tireless and intensive investigation was undertaken spanning several months in order to identify and convict Brown.

"Tyshane was convicted of supplying class A drugs into Hereford, taking advantage of vulnerable people and their addresses for his own gain. Over Â£3,000 in cash was seized from Tyshane and has been confiscated by police.

"Both brothers are serving lengthy sentences and the community can be reassured their criminal enterprise has been disbanded."
