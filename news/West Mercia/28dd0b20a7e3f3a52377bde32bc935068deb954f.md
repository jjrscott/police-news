Officers are continuing to carry out enquiries and are urging the victim, or anyone who knows who they might be, to get in contact with police.

Sergeant Geraint Perkins said: "Unfortunately, the victim hasn't been in contact with us and we haven't been able to find out who they are and I would ask them, or anyone who knows who they might be, to get in contact with us so we can make sure they are ok."
