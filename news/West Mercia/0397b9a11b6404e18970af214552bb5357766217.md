Following a virtual court hearing at Birmingham Magistrates yesterday (16 July) 26 year old Jordan Haddock from Ambleside Drive, Worcester has been charged with breaching a Domestic Violence Protection Order (DVPO)

DVPO's are granted to protect vulnerable people from harm, by breaching this he put a victim at risk. Haddock was sentenced to a month in Prison.

Detective Superintendent Damian Pettit said "DVPO's are not for discretionary compliance. West Mercia Police take all reports of Domestic Abuse seriously and will work with victims to ensure they are as safe as possible and free from abuse. A DVPO is one way in which police may do this.

"We welcome the approach taken by the courts in this case. I would like to thank the staff and officers involved in this case for their hard work in protecting the victim."
