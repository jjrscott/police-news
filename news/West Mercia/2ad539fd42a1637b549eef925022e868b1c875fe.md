With a major national incident currently in place for COVID19 and with national advice evolving rapidly, it's important we don't lose sight of the part we all have to play in staying safe.

West Mercia Police's commitment to road casualty reduction is ongoing and keeping the road network safe and operating is still an integral part of policing over the coming months.

The pressure being placed upon the NHS and emergency services is well known so a national campaign has been launched to encourage all road users to 'Take Extra Care' to reduce any additional strain onto emergency services.

We are encouraging all road users to 'Take Extra Care' over these coming weeks, particularly those of motorised vehicles that are still using the road network for essential work and supplies, but also those that may be walking or cycling for their one piece of exercise per day.

Statistics show over 160,000 people were killed or seriously injured on Great Britain's roads in 2019, an average of 440 a day. In all of these cases the police and possibly ambulance and fire would've attended.

To reduce the number of road casualties during this time the campaign is urging all road users to follow the Government guidelines and only travel when essential for work, supplies or as allocated exercise locally. The plea when travelling is to avoid all unnecessary journeys and to take extra care and not take any unnecessary risks.

Whether you are a driver, rider, cyclist or pedestrian - we can all play our part over the coming months by taking extra care on every journey.
