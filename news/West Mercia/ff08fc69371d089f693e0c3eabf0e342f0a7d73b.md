At around 6am officers were called after a man reportedly forced his way into a store in Cookley as staff opened the shop up at 5am and threatened the staff with a knife.

The suspect then stole a quantity of money and cigarettes and left the scene in a red car which has since been recovered.

Detective Inspector Lisa Duncan said: "The man is described as being of a slim build, around 6ft tall, dressed in all in black with a heavy black country accent.

"The investigation and search is ongoing and officers are conducting local enquiries.

"If anyone has any information or has seen a man matching the description please contact West Mercia Police on 101 and quote incident number 0061s of Friday 20 March 2020."
