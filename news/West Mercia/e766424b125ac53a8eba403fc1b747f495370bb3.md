Thank you to everyone who shared our appeal to help find two girls who were missing from home in Redditch.

We're pleased to report both girls have been found safe and well.

Inspector Lee Page said: "We are really very grateful to everyone who shared our appeal earlier today to help find the girls and are pleased to say they have been found safe and well."
