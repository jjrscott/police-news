COVID-19 has seen many businesses shutter their physical premises and move their operations online, as far as possible.

Internet shopping and home working have, almost overnight, become the norm. This shift in working practices is very likely to have changed the nature and priorities of the IT services and support which your business requires. For sole traders or small business owners, establishing exactly what new cyber security measures you need to put in place can seem like quite a challenge.

This guidance will help you determine how ready your business is for this digital transition and point the way to any new cyber security measures you should put in place.
