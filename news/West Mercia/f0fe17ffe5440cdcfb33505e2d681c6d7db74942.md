We are appealing for a possible victim of an assault near Vines Park in Droitwich to come forward.

Concerns have been received that an assault may have taken in the park at around 7pm last Friday (31 July) however no victim has come forward.

It's thought the victim was man but his age isn't known. It's not believed he suffered any serious injuries.

Speaking about the appeal DC Dave Wood said: "It is unusual for us to make an appeal when we have no victim identified but we have been made aware this incident might have happened and we want to ensure that, if anyone was assaulted, that they know they can come forward.

"If you were involved in this incident or perhaps witnessed it please get in touch. I am particularly keen to speak with the male who was attacked and a female member of the public who stopped to help the victim and filmed the offender."

Anyone with any information is asked to contact 01905 331187 and quote reference 00655_I_31072020.

Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
