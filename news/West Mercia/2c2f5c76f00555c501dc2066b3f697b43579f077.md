Officers are appealing for anyone to please come forward if they witnessed an assault in Bromsgrove on Wednesday 24 March.

The incident happened on Stoke Road in Aston Field between 4pm and 5pm when a man was seen to strike a woman he was with, who has then fallen to the ground. The victim has then stood up and walked with the man toward the Ladybird Pub.

Officers who attended the scene located the two people and a man in his 30s has been arrested on suspicion of assault and is in police custody.

The victim has reported that a vehicle was passing at the time of the assault and we are keen to hear from anyone driving along Stoke Road between 4pm and 5pm who may be able to help with the investigation.

Anyone with information is urged to contact 101 quoting reference 442i of 24 March or alternatively information can be reported online through the **Tell Us About** section of our website.

If you have information but don't feel comfortable speaking to police, you can speak to the independent charity Crimestoppers. It is 100% anonymous, they never ask your name and they cannot trace your call or I.P address. You can contact them online or by calling 0800 555 111.
