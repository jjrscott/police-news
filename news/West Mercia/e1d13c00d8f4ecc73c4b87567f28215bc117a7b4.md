The incident happened in the evening of Sunday 7 April 2018 when the three men entered the home of Jamie Jackson and assaulted him several times. His injuries were extensive.

Detective Constable Darren Holmes of Shrewsbury CID said 'We welcome the result and sentencing which reflects the viciousness of the attack on the victim and I hope that it brings some sense of justice to him."

The victim, Jamie Jackson also welcomed the sentences handed down, saying: "I must thank DC Darren Holmes of West Mercia Police for his support, professionalism and dedication this last 18 months at ensuring these men were brought to account.

"This has been a harrowing ordeal and one that epitomises the expression: 'being in the wrong place at the wrong time'. Not only was I publicly and falsely accused of being a cocaine addict, but I was falsely accused by these criminals of stealing Â£3,000 worth of cocaine, for which I received significant injuries. These include being left with a permanent facial scar, loss of feeling in part of my face and lip, a jaw that is held together with numerous metal plates and post-traumatic stress."
