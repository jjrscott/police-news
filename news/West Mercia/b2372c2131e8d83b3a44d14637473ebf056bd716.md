Officers are appealing for any information or witnesses to come forward following a serious assault in Rubery yesterday (9 September) at around 3pm.

The incident happened at Market Garden on New Road where a man was reportedly assaulted with an axe by two other men. The victim suffered head injuries however they are not thought to be life threatening at this time.

Detective Constable Melissa Jones said: "The victim was assaulted by two white men who were both wearing tracksuits. We know from our investigation that there were people walking past the garden centre/shop at the time and will have likely witnessed the attack or one of the suspects throwing plant pots at the victim as he ran off.

"If anyone has any information please call us on 101 and quote log number 00390i of 9 September 2020."
