West Mercia Police is appealing for witnesses or information after a transit van, trailer and two diggers were stolen from various sites in Hereford.

At around 2.40am on Monday 6 January, it is believed that entry was forced to Eagle Plant Hire, on Red Barn Drive, Hereford. Four men took a modified twin galvanised trailer.

Following this, at around 4.14am, a Ford Tipper transit van was stolen from the roadside in Gosmot Grove, Hereford.

The Ford Tipper was then seen to approach the site on Red Barn Drive from the direction of Yazor Road at around 4.25am. Two diggers were loaded onto the van and trailer.

The van and trailer exited the site at around 4.48pm driving along Yazor Road, Wordsworth Road, Westfaling Street and Brienton Road before turning right over the New Bridge and along the A456 Belmont Road continuing to Wales.

The vehicle pulled over for a short period of time at Allensmore at around 5am.

Officers would like to speak to anyone who witnessed either offence, or may have dashcam footage of the vehicle.

If you have any information which could help with the investigation, please call PC Johnson on 07773048377 or email ashlyn.johnson@westmercia.pnn.police.uk quoting incident number 075s of 6 January 2020.
