We're appealing for information, including dashcam footage, following a single vehicle RTC that happened this morning ( Tuesday 25 August) at around 9:15am.

A black Volkswagen Polo is believed to have drifted and rolled due to adverse weather conditions. One woman in her thirties was taken to hospital with minor injuries.

Lanes 1 and 2 of the M50 westbound near Junction 2 were temporarily blocked and have since been reopened.

If you have any information on this incident, please report online here, quoting reference number 00141_I_25082020.
