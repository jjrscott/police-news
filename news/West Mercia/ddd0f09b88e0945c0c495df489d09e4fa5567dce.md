Police are appealing for witnesses following an incident where a man may have been attempting to break into a number of cars in Redditch and was in possession a knife.

Inspector Carrie Solomon said: "On Sunday 10 November at around 2pm, officers were called by members of the public who witnessed a young man reportedly attempting several different car door handles on Cedar Road, Redditch. When challenged by the owners of one the cars the man produced a large, Rambo-style knife. The man swung the knife at the victims before running off.

"The suspect disappeared after running off toward Bridley Moor Road.

"He is described as being in his early twenties, slim build, about 6ft tall, wearing a black tracksuit and carrying a small black man-bag.

"If anyone witnessed this incident, saw the suspect or has any information, please contact the police immediately on 101 or 999 if it is an emergency and quote incident number 0384s of 10 November 2019."
