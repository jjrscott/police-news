A full and thorough investigation has been launched and a Hereford man arrested on suspicion of rape after an incident in the city yesterday afternoon (Thursday 19 November).

Shortly after 2pm we received a report that a woman in her 20s had been approached by a man in the St James' Road area and that she had been attacked and sexually assaulted. Officers were quickly in the area, searches were carried out and as part of our enquiries a 32-year-old local man was arrested on suspicion of rape. He currently remains in police custody.

Detective Chief Inspector Emma Whitworth said: "An investigation has been launched into this incident and we're appealing for help from members of the public as our enquiries continue. Additional officers are in the area to both carry out enquiries and offer reassurance. We understand this incident will be concerning to the wider community and we would like to reassure people that our detectives are carrying out a detailed investigation and we have put additional resources in the local area.

"The arrest was made quickly after the reports were made to officers. We'd like to thank the members of the public who stopped to help the victim. She is currently being supported."

Anyone with information should ring West Mercia Police on 101 quoting reference 340i of 19 November or report online under the Tell Us About section. Alternatively, information can be passed to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
