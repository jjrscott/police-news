Following a West Mercia Police investigation, led by Worcester CID, a 28-year-old man was found guilty by jury and has been sentenced to six years' imprisonment for sexual assault of a female by penetration.

Daniel Edwards, from Worcester, was convicted and sentenced today (Friday 31 January) at Worcester Crown Court following a trial that lasted five days.

The assault took place in 2014 and was reported two years later in 2016.

Worcester CID Detective Inspector, Tony Garner said: "We welcome the sentencing of Daniel Edwards. He has been found guilty of sexual assault by penetration of a female in 2014.

"The victim has shown incredible bravery in coming forward, and although there may be more tough times ahead, I hope this sentence will help her have a sense of closure."

He continued: "Investigating historic sexual offences, can be complex due to the nature of the investigation and I hope this conviction will encourage other victims of historic sexual offences to speak out in order to gain the justice they deserve.

"We want victims to know that they can contact police in complete confidence, we will treat their reports seriously, and this includes historic sexual offences."
