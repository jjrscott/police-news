A number of cannabis plants have been seized by police after a search at a premises in Oakengates, in Telford.

The warrant was carried out in Market Street by officers this morning (Thursday 14 January)thanks to public lead intelligence and a man aged 23 was arrested on suspicion of drug cultivation. He remains in custody and the investigation is still ongoing.

Sergeant Steve Tandy said: "We seized around 900 plants which will help disrupt the supply of this drug across cannabis supply in the town.

"These large scale cannabis growths are extremely dangerous. Not only do they support the supply of drugs in the area but they also cause a risk to the community. More often than not these sites have had the electrical wiring tampered with at the mains in order to gain free and higher levels of power. This, alongside the heat lamps needed to maintain the plants, causes a high risk of fire. The large amounts of water used to keep the plants also causes problems with condensation which can affect the neighbouring properties.

"I am extremely pleased with the results of this morning's operation and the hard work of both the Safer Neighbourhood Team and the Rural and Business Teams."

West Mercia Police is currently running 'Protect' - a campaign aimed at tackling serious and organised crime underpinned by Pursue, Prevent, Protect and Prepare. â€‹

Information about drugs and drug supply can be reported to the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
