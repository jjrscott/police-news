Areas of Worcestershire and Herefordshire continue to experience flooding with many roads closed across the two counties. Although in some areas river levels are dropping, they are set to rise again over the next few hours, peaking during the evening. Major incidents have been declared in both counties.

There are currently two severe flood warnings, meaning danger to life, for the Tenbury Wells area and two for the Ludlow area. Roads around Tenbury are virtually all impassable, with the only road open via Leysters.

Please do not venture close to swollen rivers and only go out if you absolutely have to.

The Environment Agency, West Mercia Police, Hereford an Worcester Fire and Rescue Service, local authorities and ambulance service are working together and residents in some areas may be evacuated evacuated this afternoon. We currently understand around 130 properties have been flooded in Tenbury and evacuations are taking place.

Flood barriers are in place throughout the region and more may be erected later today as necessary. Please avoid all unnecessary travel. Updates will continue on social media.
