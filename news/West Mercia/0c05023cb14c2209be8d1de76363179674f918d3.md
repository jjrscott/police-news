A 33-year-old man from Stourport has been convicted and sentenced at Kidderminster Magistrates Court for assaulting a police officer and for criminal damage.

Ernest 'Ernie' Taylor from High Street, Stourport received a 16 week prison sentence in relation to the charges of assault on an emergency worker (a police officer) and two counts of criminal damage.

Taylor was arrested after spitting at a police officer when they attended reports of a violent incident at High Street, Stourport on the 4 July.

Superintendent Mark Colquhoun said "Officers who come to work to protect the public and keep them safe shouldn't expect to be assaulted and when they are we will do everything in our power to investigate, prosecute and convict those responsible. In relation to spitting on or at a police officer, it is one of the most disgusting ways to behave and rightly this has been dealt with by way of a custodial sentence."
