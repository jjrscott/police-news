We are appealing for witnesses after two people died following a collision in Wythall, Bromsgrove.

The multi vehicle collision involving six cars happened at just after 4.40pm yesterday (Monday 22 February) on the A435 between junction 3 for the M42 and the roundabout at Becketts Farm.

Sergeant Leon Westwood said: "The collision happened when a black Honda Civic travelling south on the A435 towards the M42 was involved in a collision near to the petrol station, resulting in it crossing the central reservation into oncoming traffic on the northbound carriageway. Sadly, both occupants of the Honda were pronounced dead at the scene.

**"I can now confirm that the victims were Jolel Miah aged 50 from Birmingham and Mussammat Khatun aged 45 and also from Birmingham. Our thoughts are with their families and friends at this terribly sad time.**

"A number of paramedics attended as well as the Air Ambulance and one other member of the public travelling north is in a stable condition in hospital having suffered serious injuries."

If you witnessed the collision or have dashcam footage and haven't yet spoken to our officers please contact us on 101 quoting incident of 0440i of 22 February. Alternatively, information can be reported on the West Mercia Police website under the Tell Us About section https://www.westmercia.police.uk/
