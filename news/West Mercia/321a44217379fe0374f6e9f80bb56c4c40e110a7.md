Police are appealing for witnesses or information following a robbery at a shop in Belbroughton this morning (Monday 30th September).

At around 6.40am, two men entered the McColls shop on High Street and threatened staff. It's reported one of them was holding an axe.

The two men then stole a quantity of cash, cigarettes and scratch cards before leaving the shop.

There were no reported injuries.

Detective Constable Sonya Gibbs said: "The offenders are believed to be two men wearing gloves and with their faces covered. One of the men had a stocky build and was wearing quite a distinctive dark jacket with reflective stripes on the sleeves with white trainers that had a very noticeable luminous green heel.

"Thankfully, nobody was hurt but this was an understandably frightening incident and officers are supporting those involved.

"We have launched a thorough investigation to identify those responsible and a number of enquiries are currently ongoing.

"We are appealing for any information from the public, including any dashcam footage from local motorists who may have driven by at the time of the incident.

"Any information, no matter how small, may help us to identify the offenders."

Anyone with information which could help with the investigation can call West Mercia Police on 101 quoting incident 0061 of 30 September 2019.

Alternatively, information can be given anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or vial their website www.crimestoppers-uk.org
