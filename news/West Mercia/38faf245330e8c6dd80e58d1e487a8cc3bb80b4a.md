Were you on the A451 Stourport Road in Kidderminster at around 11.40pm yesterday evening (Tuesday)?

A red Mitsubishi Trojan pickup was travelling along the road when it is believed to have hit a wall and rolled onto its roof.

The driver - a man in his 20s - was pronounced deceased at the scene. The man's next of kin has been informed and will be supported by specially trained officers.

Officers would like to speak to anyone who saw the incident or who saw the vehicle and the manner in which it was being driven prior to the collision. They are also keen for anyone who has dashcam footage to come forward.

Anyone with information is asked to call PC Dan Harper at West Mercia Police on 101 quoting incident number 783S of 10 September.
