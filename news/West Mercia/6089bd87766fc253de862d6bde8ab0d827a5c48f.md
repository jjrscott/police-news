Criminals pretending to be police officers are attempting to defraud people in Worcester and surrounding areas, in a scam known as 'Courier Fraud'.

Chief Inspector Gareth Morgan said: "While this fraud type generally targets older, more vulnerable people we are receiving reports of younger people, some in their 30s falling victim to it. This shows that the criminals are adapting their approach and targeting a broader range of ages.

"I would ask the public to talk to each other; younger and elderly and vulnerable friends and family and warn them of this cruel scam.

"Always remember that **no police officer** from any force or department will **ever** ask you to go to your bank, withdraw money and hand over any funds, regardless of their name or unit. I would like to reassure the community that we are investigating these crimes and want to hear from anyone who has been contacted in this way."

"We are working closely with our local banks too and they are aware that this scam is targeting Worcestershire residents.

"This fraud can be very elaborate, very convincing and especially cruel. If you think someone is trying to scam you on the telephone, hang up, wait ten minutes then call 101."

"If the crime is still in progress, because for example, you have recently provided bank details or handed over cards or cash or are going to visit your bank or the caller has arranged for someone to visit your address to collect items, you should call the police to report this on 101. In an emergency dial 999."

"Please remember **the police will never contact you asking for your bank card or cash**. If someone does, it's a scam - provide no details and hand nothing over, hang up, wait ten minutes then call 101."
