Two men have been charged after a warrant was carried out in Shrewsbury.

The drugs warrant was carried out at an address in Pool Rise on Friday (26 June) morning.

A 36 year old man and a male youth were arrested on suspicion of conspiring to supply Class A drugs.

The warrant was a joint operation with Shropshire's Local Organised Crime Team and the West Midlands Regional Organised Crime Unit (ROCU) which saw ROCU officers also arrest a man in Birmingham.

In Shrewsbury, class A drugs, cash, phones and other property were recovered.

Dean Bailey, 36, Pool Rise in Shrewsbury and Shakib Miah, 28, of Wednesbury Road in Walsall have been charged with conspiracy to supply class A drugs. Both appeared at Wolverhampton Magistrates' Court on Saturday 27 June.

The youth has been released pending further investigation.
