Police investigating a fatal collision in Herefordshire are continuing to appeal for witnesses.

The collision happened on the A44 between Kington and Lyonshall just before 4pm on Saturday 12 September.

A pedestrian was struck by a tractor causing him to suffer fatal injuries. He has been named as Paul Simpson, who was 66, from Yewtree Court in Northampton.

Sergeant Tim Hargraves, said: "This was a tragic incident and our thoughts are with Paul's family at this incredibly difficult time. Paul was taking part in a charity walk along the Offas Dyke Path when he was struck and sadly killed by a green Claas tractor.

"Our enquiries are continuing and we're particularly keen to speak to anyone who may have seen him walking along the A44 shortly before the collision. He was carrying a rucksack and walking pole at the time."

Anyone who may have seen Paul or the collision is urged to contact OPU Hereford on 101 ext 7722068 quoting incident 461_I_12092020 alternatively information can be reported online.
