Appeal for information following an incident on Tuesday 26 May where a small dog was attacked.

The incident took place at the rugby club on Edgeley Road, Whitchurch, at around 6pm.

A lady was walking her Yorkshire Terrier when a larger dog believed to be a Staffordshire Bull Terrier ran towards the small dog and started attacking it.

Two men assisted in breaking up the fight between the dogs, one of which sustained injuries to his hands requiring treatment at hospital.

PC Diane Langford from Shrewsbury Patrol Team, "I am appealing to anyone who might have seen the incident to come forward. Call 101 with information, quoting incident number 799S 260520."
