A man has been arrested after three attempted robberies in Wellington.

At around 8pm on Friday 11 December a man went into Tesco Express in Haygate Road and demanded cash from the till. He made off empty handed.

A short time later just before 8.30pm the same evening a man called at an address in Herbert Avenue and demanded cash. He made off empty handed.

Just after 8.30pm a man went into the BP garage on Holyhead Road and demanded money from staff. He made off empty handed.

In all three attempted robberies, which police believe are linked, the suspect was armed with a knife and wearing a mask.

Detective Sergeant Jon Taylor, from Telford CID, said:

"Thankfully no-one was injured in these incidents however they were clearly incredibly distressing for those involved.

"Incidents of this nature don't happen often and we do believe that they are linked and a man has been arrested."
