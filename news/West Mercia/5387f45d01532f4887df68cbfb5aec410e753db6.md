One of West Mercia Police's Detectives, Simon Lloyd, travelled to Hampshire to walk 10 miles with the family, friends and those that supported the 'March for Matt' event on Sunday 8 March.

The walk took place at the Old Winchester Hill, in Hampshire, raising money for the Missing People charity who help and support the families of missing people and help with finding the missing people.

Today, marks the two year anniversary of Matt going missing and we are re-appealing in hope of finding him.

Matt originally from Portsmouth, had travelled to the Midlands; his last known whereabouts were Malvern Hills on Thursday 8 March 2018, he then checked in to the Stanbrook Abbey Hotel, Callow End, Malvern on Friday 9 March 2018. He has not been seen or heard from since this date.

Matt was reported missing on Sunday 11 March 2018 and a joint search was carried out of Stanbrook Abbey and its grounds by Police and Fire services in the week commencing 12 March 2018 however he was not found. We are re-realising the images of Matt, in hope someone may recognise him.

Matt was 26-years old when he went missing, and is described as white, around 5ft 7in tall, of slim build, with brown hair and bluey/grey coloured eyes. He is believed to have been wearing a dark green woollen jumper, beige hiking trousers and dark brown walking boots when he went missing.

Matthew's family would like anyone with any information to get in touch with 101, they said: "We are desperate to find Matt and ask people to think back to March 2018 and come forward with any information, no matter how small, that might help in the search for him.

"He is very much loved and missed by all who knew him and we find it very hard to understand how he could disappear without a trace - please get in touch if you can add anything at all to the enquiry."

Detective Inspector Beth Wells said: "Two years ago Matt went missing, and we believe this to be in Callow End area of Malvern. Our officers and Matt's family continue to be extremely concerned for his welfare and we are urging anyone who may have any information about his whereabouts to come forward.

"At this time we have no information to suggest he left the Malvern area. Anyone who sees Matt or has any information about his whereabouts is asked to call West Mercia Police on 101.

"We hope that this re-appeal will bring in some fresh information, so please take a couple of minutes to look at the images and share these with your friends and families so that we can find Matt."
