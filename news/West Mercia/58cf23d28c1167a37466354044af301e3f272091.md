The incident took place in the carpark next to Panda Chinese Restaurant at around 5.30pm, the victim was parked in a Citroen C1 when the offender approached her car and grabbed her wrists and threatened her, the girl beeped her horn to gain attention, a man stopped to ask if she was ok before the offender shouted at him.

If this was you or you saw the incident please contact PC Leanne Pickering on 101 quoting reference 515s 270420.
