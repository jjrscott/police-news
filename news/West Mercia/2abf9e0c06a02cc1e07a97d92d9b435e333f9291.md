Police are appealing for information after damage was caused to a number of churches in south Worcestershire.

It is believed the offences took place between Tuesday 5 November and Thursday 7 November.

On 6 November, stone memorials inside St Mary's Church in Elmley Castle were damaged. These include a 900 year old font as well as two other stone memorials - including the Savage Memorial, which is 600 years old and the Coventry Memorial, which is 300 years old.

During the same dates a number of magazines within St Barbara's Church, in Elmley Road, Ashton Under Hill, Evesham, were defaced and at St Michael's and all Angels Church, in Bricklehampton, Pershore, a brass candlestick was broken. Officers investigating these incidents believe they are linked.

PCSO Julie Pardoe said: "We would like to speak to anyone who may have information of these incidents to contact us. We would particularly like to hear from a male who was seen in the area on a pushbike with panniers."

Anyone with information on these incidents is asked to call West Mercia Police on 101 quoting incident number 327s of 7 November 2019.
