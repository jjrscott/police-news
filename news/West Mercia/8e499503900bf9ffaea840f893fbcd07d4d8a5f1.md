We are appealing for information and releasing a CCTV image following a theft inside a Worcester store.

On Thursday 25 February between 4.15pm to 4.30pm, a woman had been in the store on Tybridge Street, when it is understood that she left her purse and a shopping bag on the floor of an isle whilst looking at food items.

At around the same time it is believed a man has picked up the bag and passed it to a boy. The man and young boy where also with a second man and it is understood they all pay for their shopping, and leave the shop with the bag.

We are appealing to anyone who may recognise the two men pictured in the CCTV images as they may be able to help with our enquiries.

Anyone with information is asked to report it online here or call 101 quoting crime reference 22/14872/21.

If you have information but don't feel comfortable speaking to police, you can speak to the independent charity Crimestoppers. It is 100% anonymous, they never ask your name and they cannot trace your call or I.P address. You can contact them online or by calling 0800 555 111.
