We are appealing for witnesses following a three vehicle collision on the junction of the B4088 Evesham Road with Village Street, in Harvington.

The incident happened on Sunday 5 January at around 12.36pm when a Silver Honda Jazz was travelling Northbound in the direction of Alcester approaching the Harvington Cross. A silver Mercedes was travelling in a southbound direction in the direction of Evesham, towards the Harvington Cross. The third vehicle, a red VW Polo was also approaching the cross roads from Village Street.

Sadly, the driver of the Honda Jazz, a man in his 80s, was pronounced dead in hospital several days after the incident. His next of kin has been informed.

West Mercia Police Roads Policing Unit Officer, Steve Oliver, said: "Sadly, a man in his 80s has subsequently died in hospital from the injuries he sustained during this incident."

He continued: "Our investigations are on-going to establish what occurred at the Harvington Cross junction on Sunday 5 January. If you saw anything or have dash-cam footage of the incident please contact West Mercia Police on 101 quoting incident number 277s of 5 January 2020."

Alternatively, information can be given anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
