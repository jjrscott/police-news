We are appealing to drivers and people who may have been in the area following a sexual assault in Hereford.

In the early hours of Sunday 26 July at around 12.40am on Whitecross Road, Hereford, a man has approached a 24 year old woman who was walking along the pavement. When she declined his advances he has sexually assaulted her.

We are appealing to people who may recognise this man or have images of him from their dash cam footage.

If you have information regarding this incident or can help officers with their investigation please contact PC Dube from Hereford on 101 with reference 22/62337/20 .
