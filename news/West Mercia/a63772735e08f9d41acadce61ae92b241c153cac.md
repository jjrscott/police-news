The body of a man has been found in the River Severn at Shrawley, near Worcester.

A member of the public noticed the body on Friday 25 September and police officers attended the location along with fire and rescue crews.

A body was recovered from the water and while formal identification has not yet been made, officers strongly believe it to be that of Pavel Zukowski, who went missing on 16 September and was last seen in Great Witley.

Our officers are in contact with Pavel's family.

At this time the death is not being treated as suspicious.
