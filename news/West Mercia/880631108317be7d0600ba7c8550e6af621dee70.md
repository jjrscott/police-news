Officers are appealing for any witnesses or information following an attempted robbery in Kidderminster.

On Tuesday 21 July at around 2pm, the victim was leaving his home on The Deansway and about to get on his motorbike, when another motorbike with a rider and a passenger reportedly pulled up to his drive. The passenger got off the black Yamaha bike which had a burned out registration plate and approached the victim shouting and threatening him with a hammer, demanding he hand over his motorbike keys.

The victim passed him his keys however the suspect was unable to start the bike. The suspect got back on the black Yamaha motorbike he had pulled up on and they have driven off in the direction of Hurcott Road, throwing the victim's keys onto a grassy area at the end of the Deansway.

Both suspects were wearing dark clothing with one rider wearing a black helmet and the other wearing a red helmet.

If anyone witnessed the incident or has any information as to the identity of the two suspects, please call 101 and quote log 22/60659/20 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
