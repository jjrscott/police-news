Officers looking for Matthew Lavelle from Kidderminster have located him and he has been arrested.

The 37-year-old was wanted for a breach of a restraining order and recall to prison and was believed to be in Merseyside or Worcestershire.

He was located in Liverpool and will now be returned to prison.

Thank you to everyone for sharing our appeal.
