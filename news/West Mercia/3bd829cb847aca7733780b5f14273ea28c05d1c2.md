Breaking News Post

We are appealing for the public's help in locating wanted man Daniel Davies from Worcester.

Davies is wanted for kidnapping and assault and is suspected to be either in Worcester or Dudley, West Midlands.

He is 37 years-old, black, 6ft tall, bald with a large black beard. He has distinctive silver and gold teeth, several tattoos including on his neck, arms, tear drops tattooed under eyes and an anchor on his face.

We would ask the public to please call us if they have seen Davies or any information regarding his whereabouts as soon as possible on 101.

If you have information but don't feel comfortable speaking to police, you can speak to the independent charity Crimestoppers. It is 100% anonymous, they never ask your name and they cannot trace your call or I.P address. You can contact them online or by calling 0800 555 111.
