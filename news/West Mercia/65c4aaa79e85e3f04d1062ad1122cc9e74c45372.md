Five men have been arrested and a substantial number of cannabis plants have been seized after a concerned member of the public contacted us.

Officers visited an empty business in Queen Street, Droitwich yesterday (Sunday 28 February) to find the substantial grow of cannabis. Five men aged between 20 to 28 years-old were arrested on suspicion of production of cannabis.

Safer Neighbourhood Inspector, Alex Warner, said: "Acting on information from the community we have disrupted a large cannabis cultivation in Droitwich and have arrested five men on suspicion of production of cannabis."

He continued: "We want to make our communities even safer and when members of our communities help us by providing this type of valuable information we really are tackling serious and organised crime together!"

If you are aware or think you know of any criminality such as this, or if you think someone is growing or selling drugs please contact your Safer Neighbourhood Team. If you have information but don't feel comfortable speaking to police, you can speak to the independent charity Crimestoppers. It is 100% anonymous, they never ask your name and they cannot trace your call or I.P address. You can contact them online or by calling 0800 555 111.
