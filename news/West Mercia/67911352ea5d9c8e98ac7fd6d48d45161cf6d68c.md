Two people have been arrested in connection with county lines drug dealing in Shrewsbury.

Yesterday (Sunday 29 November) police were called to a report of a disturbance in Weir Road in Hanwood.

Enquiries led police to an address in Broxton's Wood in Westbury where wraps of heroin and drugs paraphernalia were found. A mobile phone connected to a county line coming into Shrewsbury was also seized by police.

A 22-year-old man and a 17-year-old girl were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply drugs. They have been released on police bail.

Detective Sergeant Steve Miller, from Shropshire's Local Organised Crime Team, said: "County lines drug dealing sees people come from outside the area come into rural towns to deal drugs, often preying on vulnerable people to use their address as a drugs den and using a dedicated telephone number as the 'line'.

"As part of our campaign to tackle serious and organised crime, we will work relentlessly to purse those involved to take out the line and arrest those involved."
