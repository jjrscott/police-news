Officers have sadly recovered a body in their search for missing Worcester man Iain Farrimond.

Detective Ollie Moore said: "Following formal identification and the next of kin informed, I can confirm that the body of Iain Farrimond was recovered from Gullet Quarry last night (Monday 23 March).

"Iain went missing on Friday 20 March and following an exhaustive search by rescue teams we have sadly recovered his body. His death is not being considered suspicious.

"Our thoughts are with his family at this terribly sad time and I would like to thank everyone who shared our appeals."
