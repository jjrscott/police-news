As part of Child Exploitation Awareness Day, we're reinforcing our commitment to help protect children and young people from exploitation.

The national day, which takes place today (Thursday 18 March) encourages everyone to think, spot and speak out against child criminal exploitation.

Within West Mercia we have a team of dedicated and specialist officers who work target offenders who are actively engaging in online sexual abuse and exploitation.

Under Operation Safenet the team specifically target those who:

 * Possess and distribute child sexual abuse material
 * Engage or seek to engage children in sexual activity either online or in the real world using the internet as a medium of communication to facilitate their abuse.
 * Engage with other likeminded people for the furtherance of their criminality

Detective Chief Inspector Gavin Kinrade, who leads the team, said: ** "**Since the team's inception we have carried out 800 targeted enforcement operations, made 562 arrests and 598 children have been safeguarded. This is vitally important for us, part of our force's vision of protecting people from harm and making children safe is one of core priorities.

"The team has had great success so far which we will look to build on, we are building a dedicated intelligence development capability which will see a dedicated detectives now solely focused on proactively developing intelligence linked to those engaging in these areas of criminality.

"The continued development of our own technology further equips us to track individuals and dismantle networks seeking to harm young people. While the new era of digital crime has presented challenges for police forces around the world, West Mercia Police and the detectives and staff that are committed to the protection of our communities, have been at the forefront.

"While a clear priority of my team is to hunt down online predators and those who abuse children we are equally dedicated to helping create an online world that is safe for children as there are so many benefits the internet offers for learning and enjoyment. I would also suggest anyone concerned about their own sexual thoughts or behaviour towards children, including those with concerns about their online behaviour, seek help immediately. This can be done through organisations such as Lucy Faithful.

"It is important that parents and guardians know what their children's online experience is, what is harmful, what they are at risk from that they know what signs to look for with their children. Get Safe Online has some valuable advice and the UK Government website also carries a lot of information useful to parents and educators alike.

"My message to the criminal fraternity exploiting the innocence of our children is a simple one; we are coming for you."

West Mercia Police also has two dedicated Exploitation and Vulnerability trainers who deliver bespoke training to frontline professional raising awareness of the signs someone may be vulnerable to being targeted by criminals looking to exploit them, and what to do if they are concerned.

Licensed premises, council staff, schools, haulage companies, drive-thru restaurants and post workers are among some of the professions and organisations who have received the training.
