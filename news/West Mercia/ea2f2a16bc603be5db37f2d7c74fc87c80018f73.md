An image has been released of a man we'd like to speak to after a taxi driver was the victim of a hate crime in Redditch last month.

At around 3.20pm on Thursday 16 June a driver was picking up a fare on Burrington Close in Redditch when his car was spat on and he was subjected to verbal racist abuse.

PC Lee Riley, who is leading the investigation, said: "No one should have to tolerate this disgusting behaviour whilst doing their job and we are investigating the matter. We hope that by releasing this image the man captured, or anyone who recognises him, will come forward."

This man, or anyone who recognises him, is asked to call 101 and ask for ext 773 3114. The incident reference number is 0413S 160620. Alternatively you can give information via the 'tell us about' section of our website.

You can also give information without giving your name by calling Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
