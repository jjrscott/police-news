A man from Malvern has been sentenced to more than 13 years in prison for raping an elderly woman in Upton-on-Severn.

Keith Brown, aged 55, from Blakes Lane, Guarlford in Malvern, was sentenced today (Wednesday 16 December) at Worcester Crown Court, to 10 years and 8 months in prison extended for 3 years to serve on licence for raping an 83 year old woman in her home.

Brown pleaded guilty on Monday 14 September to the rape which happened in the early hours of Thursday 13 August. He was also given a restraining order not to contact the victim for life.

Detective Inspector Tony Garner said: "This was a despicable offence on an elderly and defenceless victim. Following the report of the incident we mobilised every resource at our disposal from detectives to dogs teams in order to catch a vile sexual predator. All those involved in the investigation worked tirelessly to quickly apprehend Brown and in doing so we have prevented further people potentially becoming a victim to him.

"My hope is this conviction and sentence will provide some measure of closure for the victim who is an extremely brave and courageous woman. It will also reassure a local community and act as a warning to anyone else considering offending in this manner that West Mercia Police will not rest until you are caught and brought to justice."
