Following a collision between a pedestrian and a vehicle close to Shobdon Primary school in Leominster this morning a man believed to be in his 50s has sadly died.

The B4362 in both directions remains closed as a result however the school is open and the headteacher has asked parents to take their children in via the Pembridge side.

Further updates will follow shortly
