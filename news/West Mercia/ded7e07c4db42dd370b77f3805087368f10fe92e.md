Hereford police are appealing for information after a man was bitten by a dog as he walked along a footpath in the town.

It is reported that the black dog, which is believed to possibly be a Labradoodle, attacked and bit a local man at just after midnight on Wednesday 6 May.

The man was walking along the footpath next to The Hereford Academy high school when he noticed the dog was without an owner so bent down to check if the dog had a tag on its collar. As he got closer to the dog it responded by jumping and biting him in the face.

The man was treated by the ambulance service before being taken to hospital.

PC Kris Cooke said: "Obviously this was a very distressing incident for the man who was trying to locate the dog's owner. If anyone has information about this dog or currently knows of its whereabouts I would ask them to get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact PC Cooke via 101 ext. 772 2028 quoting incident number 7s 060520.
