We are appealing for witnesses and dash-cam footage following a distraction burglary in Whittington, Shropshire.

At around 8.20pm on Sunday 7 February a man in his eighties had his keys stolen from him his home near Whittington Road after two men knocked at his door.

There was an attempt to steal the victim's car but the offenders were disturbed and ran off in the direction of Station Road.

An 18-year-old man from Wrexham and a 32-year-old man from Shrewsbury have been arrested on suspicion of distraction burglary and have both since been bailed.

We are keen to speak to anyone in the area who may have seen anything suspicious, or motorists who may have caught the incident on dash-cam footage.

Anyone with information is urged to call 101 quoting reference 00570i of 7 February. Alternatively, if you have information but don't feel comfortable speaking to police, you can speak to the independent charity Crimestoppers. It is 100% anonymous, they never ask your name and they cannot trace your call or I.P address. You can contact them online or by calling 0800 555 111.

West Mercia Police offers the following security advice:

 * Keep jewellery and money in a safe place and locked up if possible. Consider installing a safe at home which is securely fixed to the floor or wall. See www.securedbydesign.comfor police approved safes.
 * Make sure your home is kept secure at all times: keep windows and doors locked, switch lights on when going out to make your home looks occupied, use burglar alarms and install security lights on the outside of your property.
 * If you are unsure about a visitor to your door, ask their name, who they work for and if they have a contact number you can call to check. Ask them to return later while you make these checks.
