Following an investigation by West Mercia Police, a man has been charged with two counts of being in charge of a dog dangerously out of control causing injury.

Ronald Tyler from Rednal Hill Lane, Rubery, was also charged with criminal damage following an incident on 14 August in Beacon View, where two dogs, believed to be German Shepherds, attacked a smaller dog. The injured dog later died.

The 65-year-old is due to appear at Kidderminster Magistrates Court on 22 December 2020.
