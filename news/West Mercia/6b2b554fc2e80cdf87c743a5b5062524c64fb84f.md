Updated News Post

The body of a woman has been found in the river Wye close to the Rowing Club in Hereford.

A member of the public noticed the body this morning (18 July) and fire crews from Hereford & Worcestershire Fire and Rescue Service were deployed to the location along with local police officers.

A body was recovered from the water and while formal identification has not yet been made, officers strongly believe it to be that of missing June Adams, from Bromyard. June went missing yesterday evening around 5pm and was last seen near Hereford train station.

Specialist officers are supporting June's family through what is an incredibly difficult and tragic time.

We would like to thank the public for their support and for sharing our appeal last night.
