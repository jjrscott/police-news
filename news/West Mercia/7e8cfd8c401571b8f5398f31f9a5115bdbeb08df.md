Three people in North Worcestershire have been issued with a Fixed Penalty Notice after failing to self-isolate following foreign travel where quarantine rules are in place.

Working with UK Border Force, officers attended two separate addresses in Iverley on 27 October and Redditch on 29 October following reports that individuals had breached the restrictions. Three adults were issued with a Fixed Penalty Notice for the breach.

Chief Inspector Ed Hancox said: "We know the vast majority of people are adhering to the Covid-19 legislation and we appreciate their support and cooperation.

"Unfortunately though there is a very small minority who are breaking the laws and where there are clear breaches, as there were in this case, we will take a robust approach to enforcement.

"I know the regulations are having an impact on all of our lives but it is important we all do our bit to stop the spread and help save lives.

"This virus affects us all in one way or another. My plea is that we continue to work together as effectively as we have been so far to minimise the impact on us all."
