Following the Government's announcement of the updated Covid-19 regulations, we've seen a change to the tier structure whereby Herefordshire will move from Tier 2 to Tier 1, as of today (Saturday 19 December).

We expect some people may travel to Herefordshire over the festive period to see loved ones or to socialise, however we ask that they follow the Government advice and stay local to where they live where possible. The regulations do outline that you must adhere to the restrictions for the area in which you live, even if you have travelled out of that tier. We look forward to welcoming all visitors back to Herefordshire when all restrictions are lifted and when it's safe to do so.

Here at West Mercia Police we are working hard with our partners to ensure all businesses and venues comply with the regulations; enforcing table service only, stop taking food and drink orders after 10pm and to close all services at 11pm. The rule of six still applies, indoors and outdoors. Hospitality can continue to serve food, only if they are providing a take-away service.

We will continue to work ensure the safety and welfare of members of our community, and where breaches are identified we will use our powers fairly and proportionately. We are communicating our approach to neighbouring counties and also working with our colleagues in Wales to ensure we continue to keep you as safe as possible.

Communities have worked hard to reduce the number of cases in Herefordshire and it is vital that we continue to stick to the rules that are in place to keep us all safe and quell the spread of the virus.

We wish all of you a safe and happy Christmas.
