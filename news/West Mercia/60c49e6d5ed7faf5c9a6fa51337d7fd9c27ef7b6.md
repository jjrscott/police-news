There is an increase in police and emergency service officers this morning (Monday 21 October) around the canal in Droitwich near to the Eagle and Sun Pub on Hanbury Road.

Unfortunately, a body of a 70-year-old man has been found in the water. The man's body will be recovered by police officials to be formally identified.

The death is not being treated as suspicious and a file is being prepared for the coroner.
