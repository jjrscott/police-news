Police are appealing for witnesses following a violent disorder in Telford.

At around 7.20pm on Tuesday (8 December) there was a collision near The parade in Donnington involving a silver Mitubishi 4x4, a silver Nissan Xtrail and a red Ford Focus. Several people exited the Nissan and the Ford with various weapons and initiated the disorder. Damage was caused to the Mitsubishi but no one suffered any injuries during the incident.

We believe there were several passers-by at the time who may be able to assist with the investigation.

Anyone information is urged to contact PC Whiting on 07929783272 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
