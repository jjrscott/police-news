We are appealing for witness to a serious incident which took place in Brookside in Telford yesterday (Thursday 23 July) at around 5.15pm.

A man in his 30s was assaulted and stabbed along the Bembridge Footpath after being pulled from a vehicle. He was taken to hospital where he was treated for non-life threatening injuries.

Police have arrested a woman aged 24 and a man aged 58, both from Telford, on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder.

Detective Inspector Jo Whitehead said: "An investigation has been launched and we are keen to speak to anyone who may have any information regarding this assault and urge witnesses to come forward."

Anyone with information should contact 101 quoting incident 519 or 23 July.
