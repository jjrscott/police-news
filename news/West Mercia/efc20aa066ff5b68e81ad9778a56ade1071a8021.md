Chief Superintendent Sue Thomas said: "Throughout the national response to Covid-19 we have been grateful that the vast majority of people across the communities we serve have followed the regulations and have done what they can to keep themselves, their family and their communities safe.

"Whilst we have all been able to have a little more freedom in the last couple of weeks it's important that we don't become complacent; Coronavirus is still a very real and deadly threat and we all need to play our part in controlling its spread.

"We are asking that the public to act responsibly and follow the Government regulations; wear face coverings on public transport and in shops and don't gather in large groups.

"There will remain a visible police presence across Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire to support compliance and , as we have throughout, we will focus on encouraging people to follow the regulations first and foremost and will issue fines only as a last resort."

You can report breaches to us online and we will use this information to help us identify if there are key problem locations so that we can support those business.
