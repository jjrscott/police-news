On Monday 28 September at 4.30pm, the Redditch local policing team executed a warrant at a factory unit in the Washford Mill Trading estate in Matchborough, locating a substantial cannabis grow.

Three men were aged 17, 24 and 26, who were living inside the property, have been charged with production of Class B Drugs and were remanded to appear in court today (30 September).

Officers discovered ten rooms specially designed for growing cannabis. It is thought they could be valued into the hundreds of thousands of pounds.

Sergeant Dave Roberts said: "I am very pleased with the outcome of the warrants and the arrests we have made. Drugs and drugs supply blight our communities and we will continue to do all we can to disrupt the supply of them onto our streets.

"Despite the current covid related restrictions we will continue our work hard to target those suspected of causing the most harm in our communities and to tackle serious and organised crime."

The warrant saw the local policing team in Redditch work closely with officers from with officers from the Local Policing Priority Team.
