Officers in Shropshire are appealing for witnesses to a fatal collision on the A49 in Felhampton yesterday (Tuesday 30 March).

The collision happened on the road between Craven Arms and Church Stretton just before 1pm when a motorcycle travelling towards Shrewsbury has collided with a car, a red Ford Focus travelling in the opposite direction. The motorcycle has also struck another car, a Red VW Polo.

The rider of the motorcycle, a man in his 70s suffered significant injuries, was taken to hospital where sadly, he later died.

The drivers of the other two cars received less serious injuries and were treated by paramedics at the scene.

We would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the collision or may have dash cam footage that can help with the investigation by reporting it online at https://www.westmercia.police.uk/
