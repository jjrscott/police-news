In the early hours of this morning (Thursday 19 December) two men have gained access to a convenience store in Hollywood, Birmingham.

At approximately half past midnight two offenders gained entry and stole a quantity of cigarettes, cash and alcohol. The offenders left the Spar store on Drakes Cross around ten minutes later.

PC Chris Dee from Redditch Station said "This store is located on a main road, with a high amount of traffic driving by. I would encourage any members of the public who may have seen anything or anyone in the area at the time to come forward.

"We are keen to speak to the man in the picture, as we believe he may have information that can help our investigation. Please contact us on 101 quoting 18s of 19 Dec 19"
