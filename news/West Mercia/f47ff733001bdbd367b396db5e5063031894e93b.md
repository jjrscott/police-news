Update from Deputy Chief Constable Julian Moss:

"Today (Wednesday 26 February) we have been responding to dynamic emergency situations on the River Severn in Shropshire and Worcestershire. The river levels in both areas and further downstream are very high.

"At Ironbridge the barriers are under stress on The Wharfage, and we are in the process of evacuating the majority of the properties from behind this barrier. We are waiting to see what happens overnight, and we are monitoring closely with colleagues at the Environment Agency, and an operational plan is in place with Shropshire Fire and Rescue should it be required.

"Last night we also evacuated a number of properties at Beales Corner, in Bewdley after the barrier overtopped.

"Our partners in both Ironbridge and Bewdley are working together speaking to residents, and virtually all who had previously chosen to stay in their properties have now decided to leave.

"We would like to reassure everyone that the emergency multi-agency flood response is currently on-going within the villages and towns across Worcestershire and Shropshire and will remain in place for some time to come.

"We also want to reassure people that whilst we are responding to dynamic and evolving situations in particular places, we recognise that there are many places that are still flooded and have been for some time. There are still teams on the ground in those places.

"The multi-agency response is set to continue for the next ten days as the flood waters are set to recede quite slowly and are likely to be topped up again with additional rain over the weekend and at the end of next week. We would therefore ask people to take this into consideration when making accommodation arrangements for themselves and any pets or livestock.

"We encourage everyone to heed the flood advice and remain vigilant around flood water.

"We understand the devastation and terrible impact this unprecedented situation has had on our communities. Please understand that different towns and villages across Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire are in different stages of the crisis to recovery journey, and this will mean that the multi-agency response may look and feel slightly different in different places. But please be assured that we care, we will be with you and we will endeavour to meet your needs.

"There is a robust multi-agency response in place; partners from Fire and Rescue Service, Environment Agency, West Midlands Ambulance Service, Highways England and the Police will remain in place and thank you once again to the community and our partner agencies.

"Herefordshire continues in its recovery phase and has flood recovery grants available to those effected in storm Dennis and Ciara. For information visit https://www.herefordshire.gov.uk/homepage/69/flooding_emergency or call 01432 260000.
