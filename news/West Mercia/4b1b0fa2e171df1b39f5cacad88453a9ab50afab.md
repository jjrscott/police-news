A man from Worcester was arrested on suspicion of attempted rape last night (22 July) at about 7.20pm.

The arrest quickly followed reports of a woman being seriously sexually assaulted in Grosmont Avenue, Worcester.

Detective Inspector Ed Slough said: "This was brutal and brazen attack on a woman which was witnessed by members of the public who came to her aid, forcing the suspect to flee and I would like to thank those passers-by who intervened.

"In a very short time following the assault, officers identified a man fitting a description provided to them and were able to arrest a man in his 40s and place him in custody at Worcester Police Station where he remains.

"Once in custody the man was further arrested on suspicion of trespass to commit a sexual offence. This arrest relates to an incident that happened on Wednesday 15 July at a house in Blakefield Road, Worcester.

"I would like to reassure people that our investigation into these two offences is ongoing and Safer Neighbour Teams are in the local area supporting the community."
