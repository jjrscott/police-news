We are appealing for witnesses following a collision at the junction of Old House Lane and Newtown Lane in Romsley, Worcestershire.

It is believed in the early hours of Saturday (7 August) a grey BMW registration WF56 AYY was travelling southbound on Newtown Lane when it crossed the junction before colliding with a wooden fence on the opposite side of the road and entering a field. It is also believed the vehicle collided with a tree.

The vehicle was later reported at around 3pm to us by a passer-by and unfortunately the single occupant a 24 year old man has been confirmed deceased in the vehicle by attending officers.

We are appealing to anyone who may have seen the collision or seen the vehicle prior to the collision it has travelled from the Birmingham area. Please contact Sgt Liam Bennett on 101 quoting reference 453 I 070820.
