A murder investigation has begun after police were called to reports of a seriously injured man at an address in Humphrey Avenue, Bromsgrove last night (Monday 14 October).

Police responded to the incident at around 10pm and sadly the man, in his 30s, was pronounced dead at the scene.

Detective Inspector Lee Holehouse said: "We are currently treating this as a murder investigation. We understand that this will be concerning to the local community but I would emphasise that we believe this to be an isolated incident. We will be increasing our presence in the area for your reassurance and peace of mind."

More information will be shared at a later time.
