Detectives are appealing for witnesses and any information following a serious assault that happened around 1.30am on Sunday 12 July.

Three people (two men and one woman) were leaving The Old Cock Inn pub in Friar Street, Droitwich when a white MG hatchback reportedly pulled up next to them and between four and five men got out. One man is reported to have thrown a bottle, hitting the woman and causing a serious injury while the other men attacked the two other victims.

Detective Constable Grant Lawrence said: "This unprovoked and brutal attack resulted in multiple injuries to all three victims, with one of the men suffering a broken nose and fractured cheek bone and the lady suffering a very serious head injury requiring significant medical attention.

"This was a very violent and terrifying assault which left two of the victims requiring hospital treatment. They have all since been discharged, however, I would ask that anyone who witnessed this incident to please contact us as soon possible by calling 101 and quoting log number 00082i of the 12 July 2020."
