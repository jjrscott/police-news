Officers are appealing for the public's help to locate a 34-year-old man who has gone missing from Redditch.

Richard Tate was last seen on Saturday 13 March in Redditch and we are growing increasingly concerned for his welfare.

He is around 6ft tall, with a shaved head; he was last seen wearing dark jeans, a black jacket and a black woolly hat.

We believe he may have travelled to Kent and has links with Redditch, Smethwick, Warwickshire and Kenilworth areas.

If you have seen Richard or have any information on his whereabouts please call us on 101.
