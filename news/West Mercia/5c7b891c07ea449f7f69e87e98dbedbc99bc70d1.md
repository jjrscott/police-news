Officers are appealing for witnesses following a fatal collision on the A44 Broadway Bypass.

PC Matt Hunt said: "Emergency services were called around 5.45am this morning (Monday 2 December 2019) to reports of a collision between two cars.

"One of the drivers, a man in his 40s driving a Blue Ford C-Max suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospital. Sadly his injures were critical and he later died. His family have been notified and officers are supporting them at this very sad time.

"The driver of the other car, a Grey Vauxhall Insignia suffered more minor injuries and was also taken to hospital. The road was closed for an extended period while we carried out vital investigation work.

"If you witnessed the incident, have dash cam footage or any information in relation to the collision please contact West Mercia Police on 101 quoting reference 68s of 2 December 2019."
