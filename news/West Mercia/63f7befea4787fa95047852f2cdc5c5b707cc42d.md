West Mercia Police and partner agencies continue to be in the affected flood areas across Shropshire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire to offer reassurance to the affected communities and monitor river levels.

It is anticipated that there will be further rainfall in the next 36 hours. With rivers levels remaining high and our catchments saturated all agencies will continue to monitor the impact.

We would like to remind residents and the community of the following advice:

 * Do not attempt to drive through flood water as this maybe deeper than expected.
 * Do not be tempted to walk, wade or swim in flood water.
 * Please be careful when re-entering your home after it has been affected by flooding as there are associated risks with electrics and contamination.
