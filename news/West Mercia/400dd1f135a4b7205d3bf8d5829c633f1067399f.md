At the beginning of the month West Mercia Police were made aware of a video circulating of Christmas tree lights being damaged outside a business in Hagley and, understandably, the local community were disappointed by the intentional damage to the village's festive decorations.

Officers have since identified the individual involved who has paid to replace the damaged lights and has sent a written apology to the owner.

Inspector Mark Chappell said: "Whilst in the grand scheme of things this was a relatively small incident we could see by the comments online that our local community were disappointed by this mindless damage. Therefore we took a proactive but proportionate approach to identifying the man involved and, we hope, returning some Christmas cheer to the village."
