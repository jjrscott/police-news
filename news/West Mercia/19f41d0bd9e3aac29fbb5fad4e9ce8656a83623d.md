A 24 year old man was arrested at the address and a large quantity of Class B drugs were recovered. A second address was searched by officers in Kidderminster where further evidence was recovered.

Detective Sergeant Luke Papps said: "This operation forms part of an ongoing County Line investigation by the South Worcester Proactive Team into a drug line running from the West Midlands into Evesham.

"As part of the investigation five men from the West Midlands have been arrested and currently released under investigation.

"The investigation has so far recovered over £8000 in cash, over ½ kg of Cannabis and a significant amount of crack cocaine and heroin.

"Numerous weapons have been recovered including machetes and a Taser.

"This is an ongoing effort to proactively target those responsible for running drug lines into South Worcestershire. The team have been working jointly with West Midlands Police and local policing teams in Evesham to reduce the harm caused by drug related crime and disorder."

The criminal exploitation of vulnerable people, which includes county lines, has been a priority for West Mercia Police for a long time and our officers are working continuously to disrupt and dismantle drugs supply and protect the young and vulnerable people who are exploited by them in our communities.
