West Mercia Police is appealing for witnesses following an attempted robbery at a shop in Pickersleigh Road, Malvern.

The incident happened at just before 11pm on Saturday 25 January.

A man wearing a long coat with the hood up and a scarf wrapped around his face, entered the shop and approached the till. He asked for cigarettes and a bottle of alcohol but when he was asked to pay he demanded that the till be opened. Others inside the shop noticed what was happening and challenged the man who has then ran out of the store.

Detective Sergeant Ed Jones said: "Fortunately, nobody was injured but staff and customers inside the shop were left badly shaken. Our enquiries are ongoing to trace the people responsible.

"If anyone saw the people either before or after the attempted robbery took place, or has any information about this incident, they should call 101 quoting incident 768s of 250120."
