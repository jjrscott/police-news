West Mercia Police is issuing a warning to the public to keep your family jewellery safe and secure.

It is not only important to keep Christmas presents out of sight of would be thieves this festive season but also to make sure that your car keys, money and jewellery are stored safely in your home.

Keep your family jewellery secure all year round by:

 * Keep the jewellery in a safe place and locked up if possible. Consider installing a safe at home which is securely fixed to the floor or wall. See www.securedbydesign.com for police approved safes.
 * Ensure that the jewellery is insured.
 * Consider storing high value items elsewhere such as in a bank deposit box; contact your bank for details.
 * Make a list of all jewellery stored in your house with a description of each item.
 * Photograph all pieces of jewellery against a plain background with the ruler next to them to give an idea of size.
 * Consider registering your jewellery with a registration company.
 * Make sure your home is kept secure at all times: keep windows and doors locked, switch lights on when going out to make your home looks occupied, use burglar alarms and install security lights on the outside of your property.

Detective Constable Debbie Whitehead said: "Family jewellery, such as wedding jewellery and family heirlooms can be very valuable in monetary terms but also hold high sentimental value."

"We would encourage everyone to take security measure to try to protect their jewellery such as securing valuable pieces in a safe and making sure items are photographed and insured."
