Emergency services were called around 10.20pm on Saturday 18 January to reports of a man found injured at a bar in Friar Street.

James Acheson-Hill who was 27 years old and from Worcester, was taken to hospital but sadly died the next day Sunday 19th January.

An investigation has been carried out and the death is not being treated as suspicious. A file has been prepared for the coroner.

Detective Constable Bev Hamilton said: "Unfortunately James died as a result of injuries he sustained after a tragic accident while exiting a bar in Friar Street.

"There are no suspicious circumstances and we want to convey our sympathies to the family and our thoughts remain with them at this heart breaking time."

James' family has paid tribute to him saying: "James was a devoted father to his son Eddie, a much loved brother to Niamh and a beloved son to us both.

"He was always thinking of others and putting them before himself. He had a great many friends which he was still in contact with from school and was a keen Liverpool FC supporter and would regularly go to Anfield with his friends to watch his team play.

"He loved his work as a senior applications engineer at Mazak in Worcester where his colleagues have described him as a 'rising star'.

"We would like to thank everyone for their kind wishes and sympathies and know James would be touched with all the love the family is receiving at this very difficult time."

The family have asked that their privacy be respected during this very sad time for them all.
