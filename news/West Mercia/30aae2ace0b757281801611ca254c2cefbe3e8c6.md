Officers and an forensic archaeologist remain in Frankley today (Friday 11 September) as they continue the process of respectfully recovering human remains found by telecom engineers yesterday.

Once recovered a post-mortem will be carried out to help determine how the person died. At this time their death is being treated as unexplained.

Detective Inspector Lisa Duncan said "I can confirm that the remains appear to have been in their location for several years. However, at this time we are keeping an open mind as to the cause of death as the investigation is in the very early stages.

"I would like to thank the local community for their patience and understanding as there is still a local road closure (Egghill Lane) and an increased police and media presence in the area. We hope to reopen the road soon.

"If anyone has information they think could be helpful to our investigation, please call 101 and quote incident number 00206i of 10 September 2020.
