Between 1pm and 1.30pm a member of the recycling centre staff was in collision with a Peugeot 3008.

The recycling centre was busy at the time, with queuing vehicles, the driver of the Peugeot appears to have ignored the road markings and queuing traffic before colliding with the member of staff dressed in high visibility uniform who was directing the traffic.

If you were at the recycling centre and saw this incident or have information please contact us on 101 quoting reference 22/58982/20. Alternatively report to us online www.westmercia.police.uk tell us about section.
