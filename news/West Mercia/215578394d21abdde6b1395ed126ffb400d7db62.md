We are appealing for the public's help to locate wanted man Kieran Stretton.

The 19-year-old, who has links to Evesham, Pershore, Cleeve Prior and Eckington areas of Worcestershire, is wanted for a breach of court bail.

If anyone sees him or knows of his whereabouts they should call 101. Alternatively, if you have information but don't feel comfortable speaking to police, you can speak to the independent charity Crimestoppers. It is 100% anonymous, they never ask your name and they cannot trace your call or I.P address. You can contact them online or by calling 0800 555 111.
