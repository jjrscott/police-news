On Monday 20 January 2020 at Redditch Magistrates Court, Sam Crawley from Redditch was given a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) starting from the 20 Jan 2020 and lasting two years.

Dan Hill, Community Harm Co-Ordinator (ASB) said: "The decision to hand down a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) to Crawley is the right decision given his persistent anti-social behaviour and drug taking in and around the town centre. He is a consistent nuisance to members of the public and shop staff and my team have worked hard to ensure he is removed from these areas."

"The provisions of the order prohibit him using (either by injecting, inhaling, smoking or consuming) any illegal drugs in any public place, he isn't allowed to enter the Kingfisher Shopping Centre, the Abbey Retail Park or the Trafford Retail Park including or any surrounding roads, car parks or open spaces at these centres.

"If he is seen in these locations he will be arrested."
