Police are warning against the dangers of shining laser beams at aircrafts, or any other vehicles.

It follows an incident on Monday where a laser was shone in the direction of a Boeing 737 when it was flying ten miles to the north west of Shawbury in Shropshire.

The beam did not hit the cockpit or pilots.

Shropshire Safer Communities Chief Inspector, Mark Reilly, said: "I cannot stress enough the dangers of shining a laser at an aircraft or any other vehicle. If the beam catches the pilot or driver in the eye they could be momentarily blinded with the consequences catastrophic."

It is an offence under section 1 of the laser misuse (vehicles) act 2018 to shine or direct a laser beam towards a vehicle with the maximum penalty imprisonment of up to five years, an unlimited fine, or both.

Under the act it is an offence to:-

 * direct or shine a laser beam towards a vehicle in such a way as to dazzle or distract, or be likely to dazzle or distract, the person driving, piloting, navigating or otherwise in control of that vehicle when it is moving or is ready to move; and
 * direct or shine a laser beam towards an air traffic facility, **or** to direct or shine a laser beam towards a person providing air traffic services, in both cases in such a way as to dazzle or distract, or be likely to dazzle or distract a person providing air traffic services.
