On 19 October 2019 we received a report of an incident said to have happened on Cruxwell Street directly outside the Halo leisure centre in Bromyard between 10.30pm and 11pm on Saturday 12 October 2019.

A man had parked his car on Cruxwell Street to collect a family member when his car was reportedly approached by several men. They then pulled him from his car and assaulted him.

The victim, a man in his 70s from Bromyard sustained facial injuries as a result of the assault and drove himself to hospital. He has since been released and his injuries are not believed to be life threatening or life changing.

Constable Watkins said: "This is believed to be an unprovoked attack and while no arrests have been made at this time, investigations are ongoing. I am appealing for any witnesses to this assault, which left this elderly man requiring hospital treatment, to please come forward.

One of the suspects is believed to be white, stocky build in his mid 20s.

"If you have any information, no matter how insignificant it may seem, please call West Mercia Police on 101, quoting incident number 846s of 12 October 2019"

Alternatively, information can be passed to the independent charity Crimestoppers by calling 0800 555 111 or via their website.
