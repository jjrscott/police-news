Officers are appealing for information and any witnesses to come forward following reports of a robbery in Spennells, Kidderminster on Tuesday 9 March.

The victims, a 16 and a 17 year old boy from Kidderminster were approached by two young men who reportedly threatened them and then stole a quantity of cash from the boys.

The robbery happened on Spennell Valley Road in Kidderminster around 3.30pm.

Detective Constable Simon Reilly from Kidderminster CID said:"Fortunately neither of the boys were harmed however they are both understandably shaken up. I would like to reassure the local community that we are working hard to identify both of the suspects.

"Both suspects are described as Asian men, one wearing a "Call of Duty" skull face mask, around 19-20 years old and about 6ft tall. He had a small, fluff-style patchy beard, wearing dark grey trousers, a windproof jacket and black Nike Airforce trainers. The other man is around 5'8" tall, stocky built and around 16 years old with medium length curly hair, acne prone skin and was wearing a long Nike puffer jacket and black joggers.

"Increased SNT patrols will have been visible in the area and we will continue to provide support to the community and I would encourage anyone with any information to please speak to us directly by calling 101 and quoting incident 403i of 9 March 2021. You can also report it here via our online reporting page"

Information can also be given anonymously to the Independent Charity, Crimestoppers, by calling 0800 555 111 or by visiting their website: www.crimestoppers-uk.org
