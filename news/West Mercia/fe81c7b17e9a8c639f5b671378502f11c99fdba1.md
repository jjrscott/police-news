Detectives investigating the murder of a man in Bromsgrove are appealing to the public for any information that may assist in their ongoing enquires.

Detective Inspector Lee Holehouse said: "Our investigation is on-going and we are following several lines of enquiries. However, I am asking the public to please get in touch with us if they witnessed anything suspicious between 9pm and 11pm on Monday evening in and around Humphrey Avenue in Bromsgrove.

"If you saw anything or have any information, no matter how small or irrelevant you feel it might be, please get in touch.

"Members of the family of the man killed have been notified and are being supported by specialist officers. Our thoughts are with them at this very distressing and sad time.

"Local residents may see an increase police presence in the area while investigations continue but I would like to reassure them that this is being treated as an isolated incident with no wider risk to the public."

A murder investigation was launched after police were called to reports of a seriously injured man at an address in Humphrey Avenue, Bromsgrove on the Monday night (14 October).

Officers and paramedics responded to the call at around 10pm however sadly the man, in his 30s, was pronounced dead at the scene.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact West Mercia Police on 101 quoting incident number 814s of 14 October or call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
