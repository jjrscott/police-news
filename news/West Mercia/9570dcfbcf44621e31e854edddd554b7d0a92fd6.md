On Tuesday 29 June at Kidderminster Magistrates Court granted a three year Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) against Ben Wilde aged 22.

This order was granted after an application by Worcester police as a result of Wilde's continual and persistent acquisitive crime in Worcester and Malvern.

The effect of this order prohibits him from being in possession of a bicycle without a valid and certifiable proof of ownership, stops him entering the Barbourne or Arboretum areas of Worcester, also stops him entering the identified areas of Malvern. He cannot be in any dwelling or on any property, including outbuildings or gardens without prior permission and is not allowed to enter any areas where access is clearly restricted.

DC Carl Shenton, Integrated offender management at Worcester station said:

"We applied for a CBO following the recent offending by Wilde and the high number of pedal cycle thefts, having acknowledged the significant impact on the victims and wider community.

"We hope the order will deter him from reoffending and enable better control of him in the community.

"The public are encouraged to report any breaches of this order to the police by reporting on our website."
