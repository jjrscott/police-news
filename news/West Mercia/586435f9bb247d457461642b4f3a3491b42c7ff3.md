A man has been arrested in connection with a cannabis farm found at a disused nightclub in Shrewsbury last year.

Last October a cannabis farm with an estimated street value of £1.2 to £1.6 million was found at the old Liquid Diva nightclub in Shrewsbury town centre.

Earlier this year five warrants were carried out in Shrewsbury and Birmingham with three people arrested.

Last night a 32 year old man was arrested in Kent on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of cannabis.

DS Andy Chatting, from the Local Organised Crime Team, said: "This was a large scale cannabis farm that has already seen a number of people arrested after warrants were carried out earlier this year.

"Keeping our communities safe is our priority and we will continue to take the necessary action against all of those suspected of being involved in this type of serious and organised crime."
