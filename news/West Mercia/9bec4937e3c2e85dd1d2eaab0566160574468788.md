A man has pleaded guilty to firearms offences after an incident in Bromsgrove last year which saw shots fired by police.

On November 3 police were called to reports of a man with a handgun. He was located in Birmingham Road and during the incident shots were fired by trained firearms officers.

Edward Mark Williams suffered gunshot wounds and was given emergency first aid by police at the scene before being taken to hospital where he received surgery. He has since made a full recovery and on Friday (18 October) pleaded guilty to firearms offences when he appeared at Worcester Crown Court.

The 55 year old from Malvern pleaded guilty to escaping lawful custody, two counts of possession of an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence and having an imitation firearm with intent to resist arrest.

Detective Superintendent Carl Moore said: "Thankfully incidents such as this are very rare in West Mercia and I am pleased Williams has been brought to justice for these extremely serious offences and the fear he caused.

"Our specially trained firearms officers are highly skilled and will only ever discharge their weapons as a last resort if it is absolutely necessary and I would like to thank the local community for their understanding and patience displayed while we dealt with this incident."

Williams is due to be sentenced on 2 December after a pre-sentence report.
