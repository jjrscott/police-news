At around 8.45pm last Monday night (20 July) in Barnsley Hall playing field, Bromsgrove a couple were assaulted while walking their dog.

The victim has spoken to a large group of teenagers requesting they don't ride the moped around on the playing field, then they approached the couple, before verbally assaulting them and then assaulting the 29 year old man pushing him to the floor. The 29 year old woman was also thrown to the floor and the verbal abuse continued.

We are appealing to anyone who might have seen the incident, have information about a large group of teenagers in or around the park to get in contact with PC Emma Tuberfield on 101.
