**A 57-year-old man from Redditch has been convicted and sentenced for assaulting a police officer and breaching a court order whilst serving a suspended sentence.**

****

Guy Turner received a 40 week (9 months) custodial sentence in relation to the charges of assault on an emergency worker (a police officer) and breaching a Criminal Behaviour Order at Kidderminster Magistrates' Court (2 June).

Turner was initially arrested on Tuesday 30 June at his home for breaching the Order. Once the arresting officers had secured him their vehicle he spat in the face of one officer which may have also entered their mouth.

Superintendent Mark Colquhoun said "Officers come to work to protect the public and keep them safe. They do not expect to be assaulted, and when they are we will do everything in our power to investigate, prosecute and convict those responsible. Spitting in an officer's face is an utterly disgusting way to behave and rightly this has been dealt with by way of a custodial sentence."
