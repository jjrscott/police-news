Two men have appeared in court charged with being concerned in the production of a Class B drug (cannabis).

They were charged with the offence following their arrests in Wylds Lane, Worcester, earlier this week.

Besart Qelia, aged 34 and Marku Pashk, aged 36, both of no fixed abode, appeared at Kidderminster Magistrates' Court yesterday (Wednesday 9 December) for a first hearing and were remanded.
