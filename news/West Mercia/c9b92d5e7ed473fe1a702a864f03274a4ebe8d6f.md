**South Worcestershire 's rural & business crime team recently (23 & 24 October) ran bike and home crime prevention events in Worcester City Centre. **

The events took place in Angel Place, and the team gave advice to more than 200 people about how to keep their homes, sheds and bikes secure.

During the events officers marked and registered 70+ members of our community's personal bicycles with Smartwater, gave out around 200 Smartwater house packs, along with flashing arm bands and high vis tags for cyclists, shed alarms and an additional 400+ purse bells to safeguard the people of Worcester from would be thieves.

Chief Inspector Gareth Morgan said: "I am pleased that so many people booked a slot to get their bike marked and that we could engage with so many people over the days to give advice and provide Smartwater, alarms and measures to keep our community safe. We take protecting people's bicycles and homes very seriously, and want to do all we can to protect your property."

Two additional events where led by Worcester City Council at Foregate and Shrubhill train stations on Monday 26 and Wednesday 28 October where an additional 80+ bikes were marked and registered with Smartwater.
