A pedestrian sadly died yesterday afternoon (Sunday 20 December) following a collision on Church Lane in Cookhill and investigating officers are eager to hear from witnesses.

An 83-year-old pedestrian, a local man, was outside St Pauls Church Hall when the collision, which involved a Nissan X Trail, happened at approximately 5.30pm.

West Midlands Ambulance Service attended but sadly the man was pronounced dead at the scene. His next of kin have been informed and will be supported by a specially trained Family Liaison Officer.

A 52-year-old Worcester woman was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. She has since been bailed to return to the police station at a later date.

Road closures were put in place whilst the emergency services responded. It was reopened in full at around 11.20pm.
