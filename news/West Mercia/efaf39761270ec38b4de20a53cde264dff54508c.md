A man who died in a collision on the M42 on Sunday (14 March) has been named.

At around 8.15pm on Sunday a white Audi A3 left the motorway and collided with signage before continuing down the embankment.

Sadly, 18 year-old Harvey Blount from Derby died at the scene. Harvey was an RAF personnel and was based at MOD St Athan in Cardiff.

His family are now being supported by specially trained officers.

We are still appealing for witnesses and dash cam footage following the incident at 8.20pm, between junction 3 and junction 2 of the westbound M42 carriageway.
