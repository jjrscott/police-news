We are releasing CCTV image of a woman we would like to speak to as we continue to investigate a robbery in Cleobury Mortimer.

The incident happened at around 10.50am on Wednesday, 21 August. A man was withdrawing cash from the ATM at Lloyds Bank, High Street, when he was approached by an unknown woman.

The woman is reported to have distracted him by asking for directions. When he responded she is understood to have become upset before pushing the man.

She then withdrew a quantity of cash from the man's bank account before leaving the town centre.

DC Nia Ward from Shrewsbury Police Station "We are keen to speak to the woman in the CCTV as we believe she may have information that can support our ongoing investigation.

"If you are the woman in the image or know her please get in contact, if you have any information regarding this incident call West Mercia Police on 101 quoting incident number 22/78027/19

"Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website."
