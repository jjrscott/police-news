The family of a man who recently died are appealing for the return of his war medals which were stolen from a property in Hampton Bishop, Hereford.

Arthur Grisbrook's family noticed his medals were missing on 6 September. It is believed the medals were stolen earlier that day or the day before.

Five medals in total were stolen - three are stars (Italy Star, Africa Star, 39-45 Star) and two are circular (Defence Medal, War Medal 39-45). All of the medals are for service during World War Two and are Royal Engineer medals on ribbons - they were all mounted in a frame which had floral decoration on it.

PC Nina Marshall said: "The medals hold great sentimental value to Mr Grisbrook's family and they are hoping for their safe return. We are following a number of line of enquiries in relation to this incident but we would appreciate hearing from anyone who may have seen these medals or knows anything about their whereabouts."

If you have any information that could help officers in their investigation, please contact West Mercia on 101 quoting reference 358S 130919 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
