Sergeant Ian Brogan said: "Emergency services were called this morning at 6.15 (Friday 25 October) following reports of a collision involving a pedestrian and a white Vauxhall Corsa near to Shobdon Primary School in Shobdon, Leominster.

"The pedestrian, a 55 year old local man, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene. His family have been spoken with and our thoughts are with them at this very sad time.

"The road currently remains closed as our investigation continues, however the school is open today with parents advised to approach the school from the Pembridge side.

"A 23 year old man from Hereford has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving in connection with the incident.

"If you witnessed the collision or have any information in relation to it please contact West Mercia Police on 101 quoting reference 083s of 25 October 2019."
