"So far, our enquiries have led to nine people being arrested and four vehicles being recovered. We're continuing to appeal for information from members of the public, if you have any information that may help with our enquiries, please let us know.

"We're incredibly grateful for the public's support so far, no matter how small or insignificant the information someone has may seem, it could prove crucial in our enquiries and help bring justice for Tamba's family."
