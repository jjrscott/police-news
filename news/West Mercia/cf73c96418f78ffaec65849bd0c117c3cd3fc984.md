Two teenagers have been jailed after a man was stabbed in Woodside, Telford.

On Monday 18 February 2019 Connor Shepherd and a 16 year old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were part of a group who stabbed the victim in an unprovoked assault.

The victim, a 17 year old boy, suffered significant injuries and required emergency surgery.

On Friday (18 October), Shepherd and the 16 year old were sentenced at Shrewsbury Crown Court after pleading guilty to grievous bodily harm and possession of a bladed article.

Connor Shepherd, 18 from Willowfield, and the co-defendant were both sentenced to five and half years imprisonment.

DC Tom Breakell from Telford CID said: "The actions of Shepherd and the co-defendant on the 18 February are inexcusable. Their actions have not only had a significant impact on the victim but their family as well. I hope the courts sentencing sends out a clear message to anyone who considers carrying knives in public that robust action will be taken against them.

"I would encourage any parent who fears their child is involved, or on the periphery of becoming involved, in knife crime to contact police, there are multiple agencies and dedicated staff who can help and hopefully prevent another needless assault like this."

Earlier this year West Mercia Police launched its knife crime strategy 'Calling Time on Knife Crime' which aims to take early intervention to provide support and guidance to those on the periphery of becoming involved in knife crime.
