Three men have been detained after it's believed a shot was fired at a police car this afternoon (Tuesday 10 March).

The incident happened at around 12pm in Cosgrove Close, near to the Blackpole Road in Worcester, when officers attempted to pull over a vehicle that had failed to stop for them. The vehicle also collided with a number of vehicles on the road.

Chief Inspector Gareth Morgan said: "Thankfully no one has been injured but this is obviously a very shocking incident for the local community and the officers involved. Firstly I'd like to reassure the public that there is not believed to be any threat to the public.

"Armed officers quickly responded to support the officers at the scene and the local Lidl store was evacuated whilst thorough searches were carried out there and in McDonalds, both as a precaution. It has now been fully opened and we'd like to thank shoppers and staff in the shop for their cooperation.

"Crimes involving firearms are rare in Worcestershire and this is thought to be an isolated incident. A thorough investigation has been launched and three men are currently in police custody."

The police helicopter was used as part of the investigation.

Officers are still in attendance and the Blackpole Road and Cosgrove Close remain closed in both directions.
