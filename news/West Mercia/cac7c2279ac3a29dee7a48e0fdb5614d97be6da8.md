Police are raising awareness of modern day slavery and human trafficking as part of national Anti-Slavery Day which takes place today (Friday 18 October).

This annual event was created in 2010 to raise awareness of the scale of human trafficking and modern slavery.

There are currently an estimated 40.3 million people trapped in some form of modern slavery in the world today, with 136,000 victims estimated in the UK. In 2018, 6,993 potential victims were found in UK. It is a crime in which people are treated as commodities and exploited for criminal gain.

Detective Sergeant, Mark Wilding, said: "It's really important that members of the public know what to look out for, as this could be happening in your workplace or community. People who look malnourished or who show signs of physical restraint, or who may live in dirty or crowded accommodation, working long hours for little or no money, could be signs that someone might be being exploited. They may be exploited in factories and farms, in restaurants and domestic servitude, or forced to commit crime or be sexually exploited."

If you or someone you know is being exploited, you can call West Mercia Police on 101 or 999 in an emergency or Crimestopper 0800 555 111.
