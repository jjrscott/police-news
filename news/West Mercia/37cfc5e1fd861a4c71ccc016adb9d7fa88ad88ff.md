A woman has been charged with murder in Shropshire.

In the early hours of Sunday 14 June police were informed there was a fire outside a house in Apley Park in Bridgnorth. No-one was injured in the fire.

Subsequent enquiries in to the fire led to concern for the welfare of a 65 year old woman at an address in Haughton Drive in Shifnal. Enquiries are on-going to locate her.

A 38 year old woman has been arrested on suspicion of her murder and has since been charged.

Detective Chief Inspector Mark Bellamy said: "I'd like to thank those residents who may have been affected by our searches and enquiries in this incident."

Lucy Fox, 38, from Bernard's Hill, Bridgnorth has been charged with murder and arson with intent to endanger life and is due to appear by video link at Kidderminster Magistrates Court, Thursday 18th June 2020.
