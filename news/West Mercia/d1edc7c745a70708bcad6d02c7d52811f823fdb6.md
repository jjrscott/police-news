We're appealing for witnesses after a man died in a collision in Wem, Shropshire.

The collision happened around 1.30am on Saturday 27 February on the B5065.

For reasons yet to be established a vehicle left the road and struck a number of trees before becoming partially submerged in a small body of water.

The driver of the vehicle, a man in his 20s, was pronounced dead at the scene.

Formal identification has yet to take place however his next of kin has been informed.

Enquiries are on-going and police are appealing for witnesses.

Any witnesses can contact West Mercia Police online under the Tell Us About section of www.westmercia.police.uk using reference 00132_I_27022021.
