Updated News Post

Three men are facing prosecution for driving offences after posting a video to social media.

Romell Henry from Dudley and Jamie Swingler from Telford, both aged 25 will attend court along with Richard Percival, aged 49, from Dudley. They will appear for two counts of aiding and abetting dangerous driving. **UPDATE: ** **Following a court update on this case, we can confirm that there is now no set date or court venue yet confirmed.**

Police received several reports from concerned members of the public who had seen a video of the three men driving through areas of Telford and Wrekin and Staffordshire in March of this year.

We would like to thank the members of the community who reported the video to us.

You can report dangerous driving to our officers involved in Operation Snap here.
