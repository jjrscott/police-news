We can confirm that sadly a body has been found during the search for missing Richard Saunders.

The 56-year-old went missing from his home in Worcester yesterday (Monday 19 October); and this morning (Tuesday) police made the discovery in Whitley Bay, in Northumbria.

Whilst formal identification has not yet taken place Richard's family have been informed and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time.
