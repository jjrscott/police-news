Officers investigating an assault that took place in Worcester on Sunday 6 October are appealing for witnesses.

The incident happened at around 7.45pm on Foregate Street close to the junction with the Tything when an unknown suspect is alleged to have thrown an egg at a 6-year-old girl who was with her mother.

The child sustained reddening to the face but was otherwise left unharmed. The mother of the child was left unharmed but shaken.

Sergeant Pete Frankish from West Mercia Police said: "We are appealing for witnesses that were in the area that may have seen or have dashcam footage of the incident that could help with our enquiries.

"We are aware of similar incidents last month in the city and although at this stage we don't believe them to be linked, we will investigate the possibility.

"We won't tolerate senseless behaviour such as this and will continue to patrol the area to ensure incidents of this nature do not happen again."

If you do have any information relating to this incident that could help with our enquiries, please call 101 quoting incident number 620s 061019

Alternatively information can be provided anonymously to independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
