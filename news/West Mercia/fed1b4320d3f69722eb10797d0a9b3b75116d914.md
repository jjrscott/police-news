Police were called at around 9pm on Friday 31 July to reports that possible human remains had been found near the River Salwarpe in Droitwich.

Most of the bones have been identified as animal except for one which is believed to be human and generations old. However further tests are being carried out and a cordon has been put in place whilst this takes place.

We would like to reassure residents the human bone is not believed to be linked to any ongoing investigations but enquiries are ongoing to determine the nature of findings.
