Two men have been found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm after a man was attacked in Bromsgrove.

Connor Kendall, aged 22 and his father Mark Kendall, aged 37, both of Breakback Road, were found guilty of section 18 assault and possession of a blade in a public place on Tuesday 24 November at Worcester Crown Court following an eight day trial.

The court heard that the pair had visited the victim's home address on 2 December 2019 following an earlier altercation and stabbed him several times.

Detective Sergeant Kelle Westwood, of the North Worcestershire CID, said: "Thankfully the victim has recovered from his injuries, however the circumstances of this case show just how seriously an altercation can escalate, when people choose to arm themselves with a knife.

"Tackling serious violence is a force priority for West Mercia Police. We remain committed to ensuring that offenders are brought to justice in order to protect our communities from harm. Both men will be sentenced on 8 January 2021 at Worcester Crown Court."
