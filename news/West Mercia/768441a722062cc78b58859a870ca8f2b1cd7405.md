Officers in Redditch are appealing for the public's help in locating David Allen who has been missing since Friday (2 April).

David is 64 years-old and was last seen just after midday in Washford Drive.

While officers believe he could still be in the local area, he does have links to Birmingham.

If you have seen David or know where he may be please call 101, quoting incident number 413i of 2 April as officers are growing increasingly concerned for his safety and for his welfare.
