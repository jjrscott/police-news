Emma Price, who was 38 and from Shifnal, died in a collision on the A5 at Burglington, near Shifnal on Friday 14 February.

Her family has released the following tribute:

**_Emma Linda Price_**

**_1981 - 2020_**

**_The bright beautiful vivacious and charismatic blonde you see in the photo sadly left us in a meaningless cruel tragic road accident last week._**

**_More than that she was a devoted wife, daughter, sister and granddaughter, a loving mummy to two young children and an amazing nurse, dedicating her life to her family and helping others._**

Enquiries into the collision are on-going and police are continuing to appeal for any witnesses, including any motorists with dashcam footage. Anyone with information should contact PC Andy Burrell on 101 ext 5785.
