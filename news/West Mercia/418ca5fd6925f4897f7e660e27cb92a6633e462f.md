Police are issuing another warning about courier fraud in Shropshire as the number of victims is increasing.

The appeal comes after a spate of courier fraud offences have taken place across the Shropshire area which have seen people conned out of thousands of pounds. Police are therefore urging the public to share the warning with their friends and family, in particular with those more vulnerable individuals, to help prevent them from being affected by these fraudsters.

Most recently on Thursday 5 November a man in his 80s, from Ditherington in Shrewsbury, was called by a man claiming to be Sergeant Harper from Scotland Yard and unfortunately defrauded the victim out of a large sum of money.

Chief Inspector Mark Reilly said: "Unfortunately we are seeing this type of crime more frequently and the recent spate of offences is causing significant concerns across the force.

"These offenders are targeting elderly or vulnerable people so it is really important for all of us to look out for each other and warn your friends and family not to transfer money over the phone or withdraw funds for any one claiming to be from the police force.

"Police officers will never ask you for your bank information or for you to transfer money. If you get a phone call of this nature please hang up and call us right away.

"If you have been a victim of this type crime please do not feel ashamed, anyone can fall victim to these fraudsters who can be very convincing. We are here to help so please report this to us."

We advise anyone who receives these calls hang up and report it immediately to Action Fraud at www.actionfraud.police.uk or 0300 123 2040.
