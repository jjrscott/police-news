Detectives are appealing for any witnesses to come forward following an armed robbery in Belbroughton, Worcestershire, this morning (5 October).

The incident occurred just after 6am this morning (5 October) at McColls on the High Street in Belbroughton. Two men entered the shop, one armed with a knife and demanded money was handed over. Both men made off with a quantity of cash and are believed to have entered a car waiting outside which then travelled away via Belbroughton Road.

The men are described as white however they were wearing hoods up over their heads and faces and were wearing facemasks. They were also wearing dark trousers and dark shoes, one had a dark Berghaus jacket and both were wearing dark gloves.

Detective Constable Martyn Dudley said: "We would like to hear from anyone who saw the men, witnessed the incident or saw a dark coloured car parked nearby the shop that we are interested in tracing.

"A short time before the offence took place there was a WHSmiths van parked outside the shop and after the offence a milk float drove past; we would be very interested in speaking with anyone who was driving past at the same times as these vehicles and also if anyone has any dashcam footage.

"Fortunately, no one was hurt in the robbery however the experience was extremely upsetting for the victim, a member of staff."

If you have any information that can help with the investigation, please call 101 and quote log number 00052i of 5 October.
