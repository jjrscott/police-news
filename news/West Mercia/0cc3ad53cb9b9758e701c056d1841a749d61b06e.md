We are appealing for witnesses following a fatal RTC on Goosehill Lane, Droitwich (off the B4090 towards Himbleton).

The incident happened yesterday (Monday 13 January) at around 2.50pm when a Black Peugeot 206 driving along Goosehill Lane, is believed to have come off the road and collided with a tree.

Sadly, the driver, a man in his 50s, was pronounced dead at the scene. His next of kin has been informed.

Hereford & Worcester Fire and Rescue Service were in attendance. Crews from Droitwich, Bromsgrove and Worcester fought the fire using hose reel jets and a fire investigation is now underway.

West Midlands Ambulance Service were also in attendance at the scene.

Road closures were in place while emergency services were in attendance.

Inspector Gavin Williams from West Mercia Police said: "While investigations are on-going to establish the circumstances surrounding this accident, we are appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the collision or has dash-cam footage of the incident to please come forward.

"Sadly, a man died, we have informed his family, and our thoughts remain with them at this difficult time."

Anyone with any information or dash cam footage is asked to contact West Mercia Police on 101 quoting incident number 374s of 13 January 2020.

Alternatively, information can be given anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
