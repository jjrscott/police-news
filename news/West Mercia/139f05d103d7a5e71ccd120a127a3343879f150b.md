Whilst I hope that all of us are able to enjoy some form of break over the Christmas period we will have officers and staff on duty 24 hours a day over the festive period working to keep us all safe from harm.

Not only am I proud of all our staff who play their part, but I am also very grateful for the support provided by our friends and families and the personal sacrifices that they make which enables us to come to work and provide the service that our public needs.

On behalf of West Mercia Police I would like to wish everyone a very happy Christmas and a safe and healthy New Year.

**Assistant Chief Constable Martin Evans**
