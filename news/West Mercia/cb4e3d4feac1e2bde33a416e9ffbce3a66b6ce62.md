**Update: The defibrillator has been returned to the cabinet - thank you to the public for sharing our earlier appeal. **

We are appealing for information following a life-saving defibrillator being taken from Gibbs Close, Lower Moor, Pershore. The community defibrillator was last seen within the protective casing at 11am on Saturday 19 December and reported stolen at 3.30pm on Sunday 20 December.

Inspector Tanya Beckett for the Safer Neighbourhood team covering Pershore, said: "This is a terrible crime that could be the difference between life and death for someone. The defibrillator has been taken from the Lower Moor community and we would like to see it returned as soon as possible.

"Equipment like this ensures that the community can help each other should someone have trouble with their heart in the area. The defibrillator that is accessible by the community enables the residents to act quickly to help their fellow members of the public. I would urge anyone with information to please get in touch with us."

If you have any information please report via 101 or www.westmercia.police.uk/report using reference number 00434_I_20122020
