A man has been sentenced to 24 years for child sex offences.

Darren Wheatley was given the sentence on Tuesday, 22 December, at Worcester Crown Court after he had been found guilty on Friday 18 December.

The 55 year old, from Lion Street, Kidderminster, had been charged with 20 offences of rape of a child under 13 and will be placed on the Sex Offenders Register for life.

The sentencing follows an investigation by Kidderminster CID.

Detective Sergeant Iain Standing said: "This was an especially disturbing case and I'm pleased this man will now face a considerable amount of time in prison for his vile actions.

"It has taken great courage and bravery for his victims to come forward and face the personal challenges of a trial.

"I also hope this conviction will provide reassurance to other victims of sexual offences, giving them the confidence to report their ordeal in the knowledge that they will be listened to and supported. Police will always investigate and do everything in their power to bring offenders like this to justice."
