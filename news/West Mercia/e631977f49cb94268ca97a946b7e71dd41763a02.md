Police investigating a burglary are appealing for the public's help to find a sentimental item of jewellery that was stolen.

The burglary happened at a house in Windermere Road, in Shrewsbury on Tuesday 22 October. Items of jewellery were stolen which were of sentimental value to the victim, some pieces have been recovered, however a 14ct gold necklace remains outstanding.

Officers are carrying out enquiries and would like to find the necklace so it can be returned to the victim.

To help find the necklace, which is part of a set, police have released an image of the matching bracelet.
