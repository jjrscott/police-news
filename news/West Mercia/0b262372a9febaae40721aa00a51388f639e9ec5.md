Officers are appealing for witnesses and any information regarding a serious assault in Worcester on Wednesday 2 September.

At around 6pm, officers were called to an incident on Bath Road at the junction with Stanley Street where a man was reportedly assaulting a woman.

Detective Sergeant Ollie Moore said: "This was a violent assault in which a young woman received significant but not life threatening injuries and required hospital treatment. We believe this to be an isolated incident in which a man, probably in his early 20s, was seen getting in a silver Toyota Corolla parked close by and then leaving the incident."

"Given the location and time of the day that this brutal assault took place, we would very much like to hear form anyone passing on the road who may have witnessed the attack and also anyone who may have dashcam footage of the incident.

"If anyone has any information, please call us on 101 and quote log number 00478i of 2 September 2020."
