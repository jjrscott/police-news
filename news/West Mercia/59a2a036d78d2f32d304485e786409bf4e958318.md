Officers searching for missing Hannah Gaunt can confirm that a woman found earlier today is 26 year old Hannah.

Detective Inspector Chris Percival said: "At around 8.30am officers located a woman in the Ash Path area of Hereford, close to Yazor Road in a critical condition but not in suspicious circumstances. Hannah was taken to hospital where she continues to receive urgent medical attention and is being supported by her family.

"I would like to thank the thousands of people, the communities and the media both in Hereford and further afield who from the early hours of this morning helped share our appeal to find Hannah."
