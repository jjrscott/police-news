**Updated at 16:00:** the cordon has now been lifted. Thank you to the public for their patience today.

A road closure is currently in place in Bewdley between the Kidderminster Road and the Gloucester Road whilst we respond to reports of grenades being found by workmen at an address on the Kidderminster Road.

As a precaution, a cordon has been put in place and surrounding properties have been evacuated whilst Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) operators respond and make the items safe.
