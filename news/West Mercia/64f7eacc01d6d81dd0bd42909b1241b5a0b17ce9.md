Detectives from Shropshire Protecting Vulnerable People Team are appealing to a member of the public who should be able to assist them with a domestic abuse investigation they are currently conducting.

The man was driving an open backed Land Rover and stopped to assist a lone distressed woman at the side of the road, described as blonde and in her thirties. It is then thought a car has pulled up which she then got into before it drove off.

This was along the road between the B4365 and Carpenters Lane near St Peter's Church, Stanton Lacy, Ludlow. It is believed the incident took place between Saturday 6 June and Wednesday 17 June.

Detective Inspector Mathew Crisp from Shrewsbury station said "We need to speak to the man who assisted the individual. I would like to reassure although the information is currently vague, we hope he will be able to add some clarity to the timeline and location which will help with the teams investigation.

"If you are this man, know of this man or saw this incident take place please contact us on 101 quoting reference 22/49970/20"
