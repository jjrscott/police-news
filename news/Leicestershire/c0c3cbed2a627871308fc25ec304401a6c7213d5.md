Police investigating an incident in Leicester where a man made a comment in front of a woman leaving her distressed and frightened have made an arrest.

The incident happened at around 3.30pm on Wednesday 11 November when the woman was walking along Victoria Park Road near to the health centre. A man approached her and as he passed by he made an abusive comment.

Officers released an appeal last month asking for information and released an image of a man they wished to speak to in connection with the incident. He has since been identified.

A 37-year-old Leicester man has been arrested on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence and harassment. He remains in police custody.

Enquiries are ongoing into the incident and anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101 quoting 20*597208.
