An operation last night (Wednesday 22 May) to test businesses selling alcohol to those under the age of 18 saw three fail.

As part of the operation, a total of nine off licence stores and pubs were tested in and around Coalville, Ashby, and Ibstock.

One of the businesses which failed to ask for relevant identification to test the purchaser's age, had also previously failed.

All three will now be spoken to and receive educational advice around the sale of alcohol.

A pass letter will be issued to all of the business managers who successfully passed, thanking them for their efforts to prevent underage drinking.

Sergeant Jon Sharpe from Coalville's dedicated neighbourhood team, said: "North West Leicestershire beat officers, with the assistance of volunteers, conducted a test purchase operation. Unfortunately three out of nine premises failed the test.

"We want to send a message to all licensed and unlicensed premises, to remind staff to conduct 'Challenge 25' checks. Further checks will be completed where, hopefully, an improvement will be seen.

"Test purchasing operations play a key role in ensuring that businesses operate within the law and it's clear from this operation that some need further education."

It is illegal to sell alcohol to anyone under the age of 18. Businesses can be prosecuted and fined for doing so and their licence could be at risk.

The Challenge 25 scheme enables a business to request identification from anyone they believe to be aged 25 years or under and request valid proof of age.
