Officers are appealing for information after a man and a woman were reportedly assaulted near Shepshed on Sunday 31 January.

Around 4pm the couple walked on the footpath leading away from Butthole Lane to the Loughborough side of the M1.

It is reported that they were then confronted by a group of three teenagers who were verbally aggressive and threatening.

One of the teenagers pushed the man and punched him in the face causing minor injuries.

Passers-by then reportedly intervened and the group left on foot towards Loughborough.

All three men are described as white and the attacker is described as white, around 16-18 years-old, six foot tall, with a slim build, brown eyes and brown hair with a light moustache. He was wearing a navy blue tracksuit.

Detective Constable Jim Chaplin is particularly keen to speak to the people who reportedly intervened.

He said: "The actions of the people passing by potentially prevented a far more serious situation. We are very keen to hear from them to try and identify those involved.

"It was still light when they reportedly made their way towards Loughborough and we would like to speak to anyone who may have seen the group."

Anyone with information should contact 101 quoting incident 383 of 31 January.
