A man has been found not guilty of the murder of a man in Leicestershire.

Benjamin Bracegirdle, 41, had been charged with the murder of 40-year-old Micheal McNee after emergency services were called to an address in Chestnut Court, Mountsorrel, Loughborough, on 22 May.

Mr McNee was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

Today, Tuesday (1 December), following a trial lasting two weeks, a jury found Mr Bracegirdle not guilty of the charge.

Mr Bracegirdle has been released from custody.
