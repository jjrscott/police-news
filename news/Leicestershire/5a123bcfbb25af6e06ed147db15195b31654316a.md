Officers are appealing for witnesses after a boy was threatened and had his bicycle stolen on Glenfrith Way.

The incident happened at around 6.20pm yesterday (Wednesday 26 August) opposite one of the entrances to Glenfield Hospital.

The victim, 14, was riding his bike in the direction of Anstey Lane/Krefeld Way when he saw two youths up ahead of him - one was on a bicycle. When he crossed the road near to Gilroes Cemetry one of the youths followed him and pushed him off his bike. The youth threatened him with a knife causing the victim to let go of his bike. The suspects then fled the scene.

The victim was not injured in the incident.

The first suspect is described as black, around 5ft 9ins tall, of a large build and approximately 16 years old. He was wearing a black hooded top, black tracksuit bottoms and black trainers. His hood was up and he was wearing a black face covering and carried a black rucksack.

The second suspect is described by the victim as also around 16, mixed race, about 5ft 7ins and skinny. He was wearing a black tracksuit and black trainers and a blue and white bandana over his shoulder. He had a short afro with shaven sides and was riding a grey/blue bicycle.

Detective Constable Kristina Hailstone is the investigating officer. She said: "A young boy was threatened and had his bike stolen in broad daylight and in an area where there would have been a lot of passing traffic.

"We would like to hear from anyone who was in the vicinity at around this time and recalls seeing two youths matching these descriptions or the incident itself.

"Equally, if you have a dashcam and captured what happened please get in touch."

Anyone with information can call 101 quoting crime reference 20*446534.
