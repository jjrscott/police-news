A cyclist who died following a collision with a van in Desford has been named.

The collision happened on Wednesday 3 February on the High Street and involved a cyclist and a grey Peugeot Boxer van.

Detective Constable Kasie Carter, from force's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "This collision happened close to High Street's junction with Main Street which is the major route through the village.

"I would like to continue to appeal to anyone who was in the area on Wednesday morning and saw what happened - or anyone who was travelling in the area and has a dashcam installed in their vehicle - to get in touch.

"Our efforts to establish the circumstances of what happened are very much continuing so if you have any information, no matter how insignificant you think it may be, please contact us as it could help our investigation."
