Police are investigating a series of attempted break-ins at businesses in Market Harborough earlier this week.

The crimes are reported to have happened between 8pm on Monday (24 June) and 9am yesterday Tuesday (25 June) at businesses in High Street, Manor Walk and Church Square.

Entry was gained at a premises in Church Square where a quantity of cash was stolen. In the other offences, attempts were made to break in but no entry was gained.

Officers believe due to the close proximity and times of the offences they are linked and are appealing for information.

Sgt Gurpreet Mulley from Harborough neighbourhood team, said: "Officers have been providing extra patrols in the area and would like to reassure those business owners affected that these reports are being actively investigated.

"I would like to ask anyone who may have been in the area and may have witnessed anything related to these offences to get in touch. Did you see anyone in the area acting suspiciously? Did you notice something which may be connected to these offences? If so, please call us.

"I would also like to ask businesses in the local area to review their CCTV to see if they have captured anything related to these reports or ultimately may have been targeted themselves and haven't as yet reported it to police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact PC 4234 Ian Kilpatrick on 101.
