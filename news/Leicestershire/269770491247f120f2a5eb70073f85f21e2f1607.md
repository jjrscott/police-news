A motorbike which has been in the family for 50 years has been stolen during a burglary in Croft at the weekend.

A house in Huncote Road was broken into sometime between 10.40am and 11am on Saturday (11 May).

A red 50cc CZ100 1964 Honda Monkey bike and a blue Mini Cooper 'D' London 2012 edition car was stolen during the incident.

The victim purchased the bike for his son 50 years ago and it was being restored. The Mini has a 2012 London emblem on the roof and other limited edition London 2012 related livery on it. It had a personalised registration plate of 'S7ONE'.

A jewellery box with various different pieces of jewellery was also stolen during the incident.

DC Paul Hicks is investigating the burglary, he said: "The victims have been left devastated by the theft of their family heirloom. Both vehicles are distinctive and we would urge anyone who has been approached by someone trying to sell them to contact us. Also if you know someone who has acquired similar vehicles since Saturday to get in touch."

Anyone with any information is asked to contact DC 763 Hicks on 101, quoting crime number 19*239933.
