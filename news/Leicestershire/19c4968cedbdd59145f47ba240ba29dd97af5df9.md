A grieving family have been left distressed after burglars stole jewellery from their loved one's home while she was in hospital.

A house in Albert Promenade in Loughborough was broken into sometime between Monday and Tuesday (19-20 October) and a number of items of jewellery were stolen.

The elderly victim was in hospital at the time after taking ill and unfortunately passed away.

Her family have been left deeply distressed by what has happened and in addition to their grief they discovered her home had been burgled and items of great sentimental value stolen.

Officers would like to reunite the family with the jewellery and are urging anyone who recognises these items to get in touch.

Amongst the items stolen was a gold link bracelet with heart fob as part of the lock, a silver bracelet of square panels with Egyptian symbols and portraits on them, a gold engagement ring with three small diamonds on it, a small gold ring with one small diamond on it, a gold ring, a gold and amethyst oval brooch and a R.A.F. insignia brooch.

Anyone who has any information about the incident or the stolen items is asked to contact DC 1019 Clive Ellis on 101, quoting crime number 20*552917.
