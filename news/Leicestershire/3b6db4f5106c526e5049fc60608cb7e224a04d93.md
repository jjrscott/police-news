A 36-year-old woman has pleaded guilty to supplying cocaine and heroin.

Malgorzata Radawiec, of no fixed address, appeared at Leicester Crown Court yesterday (Monday 20 May) and admitted to seven drug offences.

All seven counts relate to the supply of class A on four separate occasions, between June and October 2018.

She was arrested last month as part of Operation Lionheart, following months of police work to gather evidence and information on those suspected of selling and distributing drugs in Leicester and Leicestershire.

Radawiec is due to be sentenced on Friday 31 May.
