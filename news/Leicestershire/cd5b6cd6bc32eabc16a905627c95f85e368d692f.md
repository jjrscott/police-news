Officers were called at 8.52pm on Thursday evening (11 February) to an address in Kingston Avenue following a report a man had sustained a stab wound injury.

Colleagues from East Midlands Ambulance Service attended the scene and Dharmendra Unadkat, 35, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

A post mortem examination concluded Dharmendra died as a result of a stab wound.

A woman, in her 40s, who was arrested at the scene on suspicion of murder has been released on bail pending further enquiries.

Enquiries into the circumstances surrounding the death are continuing and officers have been in the area of the incident carrying out house-to-house enquiries and collecting CCTV as they piece together the moments leading up to Dharmendra's death.

Detective Inspector Jenni Heggs from East Midlands Special Operations Unit (EMSOU) said: "Dharmendra's family are understandably devastated by his death and we are determined to find out exactly what happened.

"His family have asked to be left alone at this difficult time."
