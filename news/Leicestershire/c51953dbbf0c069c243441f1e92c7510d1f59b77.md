Officers are investigating after a man was assaulted in a Leicester street on Monday afternoon (25 January).

The 40-year-old victim was in his vehicle just off Beech Street around 3.20pm when someone drove at his car.

Damage was caused to the vehicle. The victim tried to get away and drove on to Beech Street but due to the icy conditions he wasn't able to drive away, where the suspect continued to damage the victim's car.

When the victim tried to make off on foot he was assaulted. He sustained a puncture wound to his back. The ambulance service attended the incident but he didn't receive hospital treatment.

The suspect drove off from the area but was arrested nearby. The 25-year-old Leicester man was arrested on suspicion of Grievous Bodily Harm with intent, possession of a bladed article and possession of a Class B drug. He has since been released on police bail pending further enquiries.

From enquiries conducted so far it's believed this was an isolated incident.

The incident took place in broad daylight and may have been witnessed by people either walking or driving by. Anyone who witnessed the incident is asked to contact officers.

Also, if anyone has video recording equipment installed in their vehicles they are asked to check the footage and get in touch if they have captured the incident or the events leading up to it.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact PC 4265 Vanessa Thomas on 101, quoting crime number 21*53931.
