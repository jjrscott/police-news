A 27-year-old man has pleaded guilty after a woman died following a collision in Woodgate, Leicester.

Edgar Grisulis, of no fixed address appeared yesterday (Monday 9 December) at Leicester Crown Court where he admitted one count of causing death by dangerous driving.

He will be sentenced on 19 December at the same court.

On 29 September at around 11pm, Grisulis was involved in a minor collision with a Nissan GT-R in Woodgate.

He failed to stop at the scene and instead reversed his Mercedes, at speed, along the road and collided with a woman standing at a bus stop with her husband.

Grisulis accelerated in an attempt to leave the area.

The driver of the Nissan alerted nearby officers to the incident and the Mercedes was pursued to All Saints Road where Grisulis abandoned his car and fled on foot.

He was detained by officers shortly afterwards and arrested.

The victim, 57-year-old Annette Booth from Leicester, was taken to the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham where she died as a result of her injuries.

DC Ali Briance, from the force's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "The events of that night were tragic and they could have easily been avoided had Grisulis not driven in the manner he chose to.

"Because of his actions a family has been devastated by grief and continue to try to come to terms with the loss of their loved one.

"I can only hope that with Grisulis admitting his culpability it will go some way to helping the family to move forward."
