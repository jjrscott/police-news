Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a robbery at a post office in Leicester.

At around 3.10pm yesterday (Monday 12 October) three men (pictured) entered the premises in Barkby Road and threatened members of staff with a knife.

The staff handed over thousands of pounds of cash and the men - who had their faces covered - left the post office. It is not known whether they got into a vehicle.

No members of staff were injured during the incident.

Detective Sergeant Scott Cairns, from the force's Complex Investigation Team is leading the investigation. He said: "We know that the men arrived from the area of Oliver Road. However, after taking the cash it isn't known whether they made off on foot or in a vehicle.

"I would like to speak to anyone who was in Barkby Road, Oliver Road or the surrounding area yesterday afternoon.

"Did you see a group of men dressed in black acting in a manner that seemed unusual or suspicious? Did you see them either go into or leave the premises?

"I would also like to speak to any motorists with dashcams installed in their vehicles who were travelling along Barkby Road or the surrounding streets just before or after this incident occurred.

"Any information you have could help our investigation."

Call 101, quoting reference 20*537753.
