Officers investigating a report of indecent exposure in a Leicester park have released an image of a man who may have information to help with their enquiries.

The incident took place at around 1pm on Saturday 13 March in Spinney Hill Park in East Leicester.

PC Adam Ahmed is the investigating officer. He said: "This was an unpleasant incident which left a woman - who had been exercising in the park - upset by what had happened.

"We are releasing an image of a man who we believe may have information about the incident.

"If you recognise yourself from this image, think you know who this man may be or saw what happened we would like to hear from you."

Anyone with information can call 101 quoting crime reference 21*142371.
