It was reported that around 6.30pm on Thursday 18 February a man entered a property in Johnscliffe Close via a bathroom skylight, stole a safe containing a number of items and drove away in a black hatchback, turning right towards Main Street.

The items stolen include:

 * Atlantic Star war medal
 * 1939-45 War Medal
 * Defence Medal
 * Polish war medal - cross of valour with two bars
 * Polish Air Force medal
 * A gold Tag Heuer watch
 * A Tag Heuer bi-metal series 6000 bracelet watch

Detective Constable Julia Newton said: "We would like to speak to anyone who may have seen a black hatchback in the area or anyone who may have seen these items for sale.

"We would also urge anyone with dash cam footage that may have captured the vehicle to please get in touch."

Anyone with information should contact 101 quoting reference 21*98222.
