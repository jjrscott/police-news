A burglar who stole two cars from the driveway of a house in Glenfield has been jailed.

Brett Smith, 30, was sentenced to 16 months imprisonment when he appeared at Leicester Crown Court on Friday (3 July).

He committed his crimes in Leicester Road in the early hours of 22 May this year. He was jailed after pleading guilty to one count of burglary dwelling and one count of theft of a motor vehicle.

The theft of the vehicles was reported to police when the owner of the cars - a Skoda Octavia and a Seat Ibiza - woke to find they had been taken. CCTV cameras at the address showed Smith going into the property and returning with the keys. One car was driven away by Smith and the other by another man who had accompanied him.

Neither vehicle has been recovered. However Smith, of HMP Leicester, was subsequently identified as a result of enquiries carried out, arrested and charged.

Another man, aged 32, was arrested but released with no further action.

PC Dan Nutbrown, the investigating officer, said: "Smith was captured on CCTV and as a result of our enquiries, we were able to identify and arrest him.

"He is an opportunist criminal and was taking the cars for financial gain. We take reports of burglary seriously and will always look to bring those responsible to justice.

"I hope the public can take some reassurance from the fact he is now serving a custodial sentence."
