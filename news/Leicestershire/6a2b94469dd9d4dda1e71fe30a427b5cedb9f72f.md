We have now been in lockdown for nine weeks as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak. For some people, this means they have been in the same household as their abuser with very little opportunity to get away from them.

Juniper Lodge, a Sexual Assault Referral Centre (SARC) remains open with some slight changes to the service to keep you and the team safe at this time. They offer non-judgemental advice and services to anyone who is the victim of sexual abuse or rape.

Millie Gant, SARC Manager said: "The office hours are now 8am until 8pm Monday to Saturday. Outside of these times, please call and leave a message and we will contact you as soon as we can. We work on-call to provide 24/7 support and access to specialist services.

"We want you to know you are not to blame no matter what the circumstances.

"Contact us via 0116 273 3330 or complete the online form on our website to discuss your options, arrange support following a sexual assault, which may include access to a forensic medical examination if necessary."
