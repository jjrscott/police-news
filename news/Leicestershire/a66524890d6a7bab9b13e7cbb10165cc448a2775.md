Three people who were arrested on Friday (3 May) after more than 100 cannabis plants were found at a property in Leicester have been released under investigation.

Police executed a warrant at a property in Ruby Street following information passed on from members of the community.

A 48-year-old man and a 44-year-old woman, both from Stoney Stanton, were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the production of cannabis. A 42-year-old man from Countesthorpe was also arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the production of cannabis.

All three have since been released under investigation.

Inspector Rob Randell, NPA Commander for West Leicester, said: "While our investigations are continuing, I would like to remind members of the public that we will always listen to and engage with local communities about any concerns they have and will look to execute warrants where possible."
