A Leicestershire man has been jailed for burglary offences which he carried out within his local community.

Luke Whiteman, of Bramley Close, Melton Mowbray, appeared at Leicester Crown Court on Tuesday (22 September) where he pleaded guilty to one count of burglary and a further charge of attempted burglary.

He was sentenced to 30 months imprisonment.

At around 11.40pm on Wednesday 29 July Whiteman gained entry via a first floor window to a premises in King Street, Melton Mowbray. Once inside the building he smashed a lock to one of the rooms and stole a quantity of makeup.

On the 1 August he was caught on CCTV attempting to gain access to an address in Palmerston Road, Melton Mowbray. An occupant of the property, disturbed by their dog barking, checked their CCTV and spotted Whiteman on the footage.

Following enquiries carried out into both reports officers arrested Whiteman on Friday 7 August.

Detective Constable Amanda Paddock was the investigating officer. She said: "The outcome of this case should serve as a warning to anyone intent on committing similar offences that we take all reports of burglary seriously, we will investigate thoroughly and bring those responsible to justice."
