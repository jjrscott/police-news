Leicestershire Police has launched a survey asking members of the public to provide feedback on the policing response to Covid-19.

During the coronavirus pandemic, the force is supporting the national effort - asking everybody to stay home, protect the NHS and save lives.

As part of the police's duty to protect, officers have consistently followed an approach to engage, explain and encourage members of the public in situations where they may not be complying with the current legislation or following social distancing rules.

In situations where encouragement does not succeed, officers have been enforcing the legislation and issuing fixed penalty notices.

The survey can be accessed via Neighbourhood Link - the community messaging system for Leicester, Leicestershire & Rutland.

The force is urging all residents to **complete the survey** and provide feedback on how well the policing approach so far has been received across the communities.

Anyone wanting to keep up-to-date with policing matters in their area, crime prevention advice or news and appeals can do so by **signing up to Neighbourhood Link**.
