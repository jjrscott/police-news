A Kibworth woman who committed fraud while being employed at a medical centre in her home town has pleaded guilty at court.

At her first appearance at Leicester Magistrates' Court yesterday (Monday 1 March) Kirsty Whawell pleaded guilty to fraud by false representation and six counts of fraud by abuse of position.

Whawell, 40, of Kimberley Street, will be sentenced at Leicester Crown Court on Monday 22 March.

The court heard that the fraud offences to the value of more than Â£184,000 were committed between 2013 and 2019 at a medical practice in Kibworth.

Detective Constable Neil Edwards from the force's economic crime unit, said: "This was a lengthy and complex investigation which first came to our attention in 2019.

"Whawell abused her position of trust in the medical centre for her own financial gain, believing that her crimes will never be uncovered.

"The evidence against her was overwhelming so she had no choice but to plead guilty to the offences."

Thank you to everyone who are following the COVID rules as it means that we can focus on dealing with criminals like this.
