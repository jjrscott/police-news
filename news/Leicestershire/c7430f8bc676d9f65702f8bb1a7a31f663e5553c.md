Detectives investigating after residents were evacuated from a building in Melton Road are appealing for witnesses.

Police were called at around 6pm yesterday (Thursday) by a resident reporting a man attempting to gain access to one of the flats inside the address.

Officers attended the scene alongside colleagues from Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service.

It was suspected that during the incident damage had been caused to a residential gas meter and as a precaution residents were evacuated from their properties while emergency services dealt with the incident.

Residents were allowed back into their address later in the evening.

A man, 31, was arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage with intent to endanger life - he has since been released on bail.

Detective Constable Mike Sime is investigating. He said: "We are appealing for anyone who was in the area and saw anything suspicious to come forward.

"If you know what happened and have not yet spoken to officers please get in touch."

Anyone with information can call 101 quoting crime reference number 20*475069.
