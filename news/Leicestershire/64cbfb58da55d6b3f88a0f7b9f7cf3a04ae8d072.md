Officers are appealing for witnesses following a collision at the junction of Wanlip Road and Melton Road in Syston.

It happened at around 9.50pm yesterday (Saturday) and involved two vehicles, a white Seat and a red Citroen.

Both vehicles were travelling in the direction of Thurmaston when the incident took place.

Two women were taken to Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre for treatment. A third woman was taken to the Leicester Royal Infirmary - their injuries have been described as non-life-threating or life-changing.

One of the drivers left the scene before emergency services arrived at the location.

Roads in the immediate vicinity were closed while emergency services dealt with the incident - they have since been reopened.

PC Liam Street is the investigating officer. He said: "We would like to hear from anyone who was in the area and saw either of the vehicles being driven beforehand or the collision itself.

"Equally if you have a dashcam installed in your vehicle and captured what happened please get in touch."

Anyone with information, who has not yet spoken to officers, can call 101 quoting incident 796 of 31 October.
