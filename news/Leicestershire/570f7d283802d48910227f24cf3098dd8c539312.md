Officers from the Serious Collision Investigation Unit are appealing for witnesses following a serious collision on the A47 at Tixover.

The collision happened at around 5.45pm on Wednesday 28 October and involved one vehicle, a silver Vauxhall Corsa.

The driver remains in hospital in a critical but stable condition.

The road was closed while emergency services responded at the scene and has since been reopened.

Detective Constable 763 Paul Hicks is appealing for anyone who witnessed the collision to get in touch.

He said: "We know that the vehicle was travelling west and had passed the village of Duddington just before the collision.

"I would like to appeal to anyone who may have seen the vehicle beforehand or the collision itself to get in touch. Similarly anyone with dash cam footage which captured anything relating to this collision, we would also be keen to speak to.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101 quoting incident 515 of 28 October.
