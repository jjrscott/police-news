Leicestershire Police has appointed Julia Debenham as its new Assistant Chief Constable in charge of crime and operations.

Julia, currently a Chief Superintendent with the Force, was appointed yesterday (Tuesday 23 April) following a nationally-advertised selection process.

Speaking after her appointment, she said: "I am really honoured and excited to have been appointed into this role in a force that I joined 26 years ago.

"I feel immensely proud to be part of such a great team serving our wonderful and diverse communities. I am very much looking forward to continuing in my new role in the years to comeâ€¦ "

Chief Constable Simon Cole said: "Julia is well-known to the Force and partners as she has served in Leicestershire and across the East Midlands for the whole of her career in policing.

"She brings relevant experience, excellent knowledge of local communities and a real commitment to the Force."

Julia joined the Force in 1993 and during her service has held a variety of different roles throughout the ranks in both uniform and non-uniformed roles. Most recently she was a Temporary ACC for both Leicestershire and Northamptonshire Police with responsibility for the collaborative criminal justice service as well as the East Midlands Specialist Operations Service. Last year she played a key role supporting the investigation into the Hinckley Road explosion which killed five people.

Julia is married with two young children.
