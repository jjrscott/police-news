Two people have been charged after officers executed a drugs warrant in Leicester on Friday (3 May).

A Misuse of Drugs Act warrant was executed at the property in Paton Street and seven men were arrested during the operation.

Sebastian Bienias, 30, of Paton Street, Leicester, was charged with possession with intent to supply class A and B drugs. Daniel Perzanowski, 29, of no fixed address, was charged with possession of class B drugs and possession of a bladed article. They appeared at Leicester Magistrates' Court yesterday (Tuesday 7 May).

Four other men, aged, 23, 24, 31 and 35, and a woman, 21, who were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of class A drugs, have since been released pending further enquiries.

Anyone with information about drugs activity in their community is asked to contact police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
