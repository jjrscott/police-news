Detectives investigating the stabbing of a 10-year-old boy in Belper Street have arrested a 32-year-old man.

The man, from Leicester, is currently in police custody after being arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.

The incident happened at 5.20pm on Saturday (18 January) when the boy was approached by a man who stabbed him before running off from the scene. The boy was treated in hospital and has now been discharged.

As part of enquiries, officers investigating the attack have also linked it to two other incidents in the area during the past week.

One is reported to have taken place at around 7.15pm on Tuesday 14 January, in Doncaster Road, Leicester, when a woman in her 30s suffered a cut to the back of head.

Two days later, on Thursday 16 January, a man in his 70s was found with wounds to his head and hands in Dean Street, Leicester.

Both victims were taken to hospital and have since been discharged.

Detective Inspector Tim Lindley said: "Following a public appeal issued this evening to trace a man captured on CCTV, a 32-year-old man has been arrested.

"While I would like to thank everyone who has shared our appeal and has already made contact with police, I am still appealing to anyone with any information to come forward.

"If you witnessed any of the incidents or have CCTV or dashcam footage from the area you could have vital information to assist us with our continued enquiries. Please speak to police if you can help."

Anyone with information can contact 101, quoting incident 145 of 19 January.
