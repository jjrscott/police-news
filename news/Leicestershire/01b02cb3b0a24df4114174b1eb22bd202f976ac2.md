Officers are appealing for information in relation to a report of an attempted robbery at a Co-Op store in Leicester.

Police were called to the incident at the store in Rowlatts Hill Road just after 10.15am yesterday (Thursday).

"We would particularly like to speak to members of the public who were in the store at the time. You are not in any trouble but we understand you may have information which could help us with our enquiries.
