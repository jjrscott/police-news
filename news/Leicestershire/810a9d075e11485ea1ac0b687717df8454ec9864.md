During this current lockdown police have stepped up enforcement activity across Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland.

As a result since 1 January to 2 February, a total of 889 fixed penalty notices have been issued to people who are breaching the Covid rules.

This total amount is more than the amount of tickets issued for the whole of last year's pandemic totalling 850.

Police have also released an online video where an officer states his health worker wife has been crying for two weeks as she 'honestly cannot watch people die anymore' as he hands out tickets to Covid rule breakers.

The officer, who was on a routine patrol, is seen to approach a vehicle near to East Midlands Airport where he finds two people who have driven from West Bridgford, nearly 13 miles away. The couple claim to be 'just watching planes.' He issues two fixed penalty notices and asks them to 'please pay attention to the guidelines; people are dying.'

Assistant Chief Constable Kerry Smith said: "We continue to say thank you to all of the public who are complying with the rules and understand why they are in place. This is allowing us to continue to do other work tackling crime and getting some really good results. The bottom line is that we have had to step up our enforcement as the message was not getting through to the small minority who are continuing to ignore the rules.

"We also have to thank the public for helping us by reporting Covid breaches to us. In the last month we received 2,480 calls relating to the pandemic. This is double the amount of calls we were receiving before this current lockdown. We need the public's information to guide us and we have been clear as to what the consequences are.

"We are continuing to engage with the public but we are being more proactive in giving out the tickets where possible.

"We continue to share the public's frustration that the small minority are still taking terrible risks."

Since 1 January 2021, officers have issued a total of 889 Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs) to the approximate value of Â£170,000.

Since 23 March 2020 to 2 February 2021, Leicestershire Police have given out a total of 1,739 FPNs and have received a total of 21,508 reports of Covid incidents.

17 licensed premises were visited during this period.
