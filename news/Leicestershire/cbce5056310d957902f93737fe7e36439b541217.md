Officers are appealing for information to help identify a man after an attempted theft was reported in Ashby-de-la-Zouch.

It was reported that around 3.25pm on Friday 12 February, a man approached a 13-year-old boy outside a supermarket on Derby Road and attempted to steal his pushbike.

The boy and three friends were then reportedly chased by a man towards the old Royal Hotel on Station Road.

The man was described as mid 20s, around 5'7 with tanned skin and a muscly build. He wore a shiny black puffer jacket with black joggers and a face mask. He was carrying a white paper carrier bag and spoke with a deep voice and local accent.

PC Rachael Walker said: "This incident and happened in the middle of the afternoon when many people are likely to have been out and about.

"We would like to hear from anyone who may have seen the man or anyone who has dash cam footage in the area at the time of the incident."

Anyone with information should contact 101 quoting reference 21*87647.
