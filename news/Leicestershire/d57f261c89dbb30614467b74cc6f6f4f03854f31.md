Officers investigating an incident where a man was assaulted are appealing for anyone with footage of the incident to come forward.

At around 8pm on Saturday 17 October, a 19-year-old man was punched to the back of the head. When he fell to the ground, he was then kicked.

He was taken to hospital for treatment but has since been discharged.

Four men - two aged 23 and two aged 22 - were arrested in connection with the incident and have since been released on bail.

Officers investigating the incident believe it may have been filmed by people in the area.

PC Neil Rawlings, the investigating officer, said: "From enquiries carried out to date, I know there were other people in Granby Street at the time and it has been suggested some of those people may have recorded what happened on their mobile phones.

"Please cast your mind back. Were you there? Did you see what happened? Were you one of those people who recorded the incident?

"Any footage - or information you have - no matter how insignificant you think it may be, could help my investigation."
