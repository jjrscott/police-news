A man who arranged for a woman to travel from China and train as a masseuse in the sex industry has been jailed.

Wenxin Wu, 35, appeared at Leicester Crown Court on Monday (23 November) where he admitted one count of controlling prostitution for gain.

He was charged under the Modern Slavery Act and sentenced to 20 months imprisonment.

He is also subject an indefinite sexual harm prevention order (SHPO).

On 16 September 2019, officers carrying out enquiries in Leicester city centre attended Mr Wu's address in Burgess Street

Inside the property was a 47-year-old woman who disclosed she was being exploited.

Officers arrested Wu at the property and an investigation into the allegations commenced.

From enquiries carried out it was discovered that the victim had been enticed to come to the UK with the promise of employment in a garment factory.

In November 2018, arrangements were made for a woman to accompany her as she flew to Heathrow.

At the airport they were met by a man who took them to a flat in London where the victim remained for several days.

The job in a garment factory was not forthcoming and instead she was offered an opportunity to train as a masseuse. She was told that payment for this, along with a percentage of her airfare, could be paid back out of her earnings.

The victim was moved to a different location where she was forced to stay inside for up to seven days a week performing massages and sexual services to clients brought to the address by a 'nanny'.

The nanny would receive payment from the clients and occasionally give the victim a percentage of what was taken.

Officers were told the victim's captors would show her screen shots on a mobile phone showing payments allegedly made to her family in China.

She was refused a key to the address and was afraid to leave through fear of violence.

On 16 September last year, the nanny told her she was going to work in Leicester and gave the victim money to travel to the city and take a taxi to Burgess Street.

She was met at the address by Wu and shown to a bedroom where she was expected to perform sexual acts with two men.

When officers arrived at the flat later that day they found the victim frightened and confused.

Following her admission she was taken to a place of safety and offered support by specialist officers.

Detective Constable Xanthe Fisher was the investigating officer. She said: "The victim in this case was enticed to leave China and travel thousands of miles believing there was a genuine offer of employment waiting for her.

"When she arrived the reality couldn't have been more different.

"She was made to stay indoors for days on end, having sex with men and given little or no money.

"Her vulnerability was exploited from the get-go and nobody should be treated this way.

"I hope the result sends a positive message to others who may be in a similar situation, encouraging them to report what is happening to them in the knowledge their accounts will be taken seriously and investigated thoroughly."
