Detectives investigating a burglary are appealing for motorists with dashcam footage - or any other witnesses - to come forward.

It happened between 2.45pm and 3.30pm on Friday (9 October) in Evington Valley Road.

The suspect or suspects managed to get into the property through a rear patio door and stole Asian jewellery, including gold rings, bracelets, bangles and necklaces before leaving the address.

Detective Constable Charlotte Rodgers, the investigating officer, said: "This incident happened at an address which is very close to a school at a time when parents may have been collecting their children.

"It is also close to a busy junction, therefore I am particularly keen to speak to anyone with a dashcam in their vehicle who was in the area at the time.

"I would like to speak to anyone who saw or noticed either an individual or a group of people acting in an unusual or suspicious manner in Evington Valley Road.

"Likewise, I would like to speak to anyone who has seen or been offered Asian jewellery for sale. Any information you have could help my investigation."

Please call 101, quoting reference 20*532807.
