Inspector Mark Botte has taken over command of the Charnwood Neighbourhood Policing Area.

He took up his new role at the beginning of this month having previously been a Priority and Resource Inspector and replaces Inspector Dwight Barker who has moved to the Local Policing Directorate in a support role.

Mark joined the force 21 years ago and has worked in uniformed roles across Leicestershire Police including the old Welford Road station, along with Mansfield House and Spinney Hill stations.

He said: "It's a real privilege to become Charnwood's new NPA Commander. As I have previously lived in the area myself, it's a role I have aspired to have since the start of my policing career and for that reason I feel an extra sense of responsibility to the Charnwood community.

"We have strong links with our partnership organisations and I aim to ensure this continues so that we can tackle any issues jointly.

"I know we have a committed team of officers who are working hard to make sure our community is a safe and pleasant place to live."

Inspector Dwight Barker added: "It's been a pleasure to serve the people of Charnwood. I've really enjoyed working with the community to solve as many of the key problems as possible. It has been one of my favourite roles that I've been lucky enough to experience within my police career and I will take away a number of fond memories. However, I know I leave the NPA in very capable hands. Inspector Botte has a wealth of experience and is passionate about neighbourhood policing."
