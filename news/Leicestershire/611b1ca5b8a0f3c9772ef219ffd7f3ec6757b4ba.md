A 20-year-old man from New Parks, who was found in possession of more than 100 'wraps' of cocaine and heroin, has been sentenced after pleading guilty to 15 drug offences.

Andrew Manjengwa, of Samson Road, Leicester, admitted the crimes at a hearing at Leicester Crown Court yesterday (20 May) and was sentenced to serve two years, eight months in prison.

He was detained last month as part of Operation Lionheart and charged with 13 counts of supplying class A and two counts of possession with intent to supply class A.

During a four-month period, between October 2018 and January 2019, Manjengwa admitted to supplying drugs on eight separate occasions.

He admitted being in possession of 133 'wraps' of cocaine and heroin when he was arrested by police in Loughborough on 30 October 2018. He was charged with all of the offences following his arrest in April.

Chief Superintendent Adam Streets, Head of Local Policing, said: "Being is possession of, and supplying, class A drugs is a serious offence and one where the consequences wreck lives.

"More than 100 'wraps' of drugs is a significant amount, and Operation Lionheart is working to take drugs off the streets, protect the vulnerable and bring offenders to justice."
