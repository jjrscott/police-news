Detectives investigating two robberies in the Beaumont Leys area of Leicester are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

They both happened on Sunday evening (4 October) - and police are linking them together.

At around 6.30pm, a 14-year-old boy was approached by a group of around 10 youths at a play park in Glovers Walk. They pushed him off his bike and one of the group took the bike - a black Carrera Vengence - and rode off towards Strasbourg Drive. The victim was not injured during the incident. The group are believed to be 16 to 17 years old.

At around 8pm, a 26-year-old man was cycling along Strasbourg Drive when a group of eight to 10 teenagers surrounded him and assaulted him. His bike - a black and white Cannondale mountain bike - was taken.

The man suffered minor injuries as a result of the assault.

Officers from the West Leicester Neighbourhood Policing Area (NPA) are carrying out extra patrols in the area and anyone with information is urged to contact police.

Detective Constable Kristina Hailstone, the investigating officer, said: "I would like to speak to anyone who saw a group of teenagers in Beaumont Leys - particularly Strasbourg Drive and the surrounding area - on Sunday evening.

"Did you notice anything unusual or suspicious in the way they were behaving? Did you see either of these incidents occur?

"I'm particularly appealing to dog walkers and anyone with a dashcam installed in their vehicle. Any information you have, no matter how insignificant you think it is, could help my investigation."

Call 101, quoting incident 20*522285 (first incident) or 20*522319 (second incident).
