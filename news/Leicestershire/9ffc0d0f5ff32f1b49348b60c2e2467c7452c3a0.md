Detectives investigating a fire at an address in Ashby are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

It happened at an address in Ridgway Road at around 1.30pm on Thursday 5 November.

Following a report of a fire, officers attended with colleagues from Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service and it was established the fire had been caused by an illegal electrical installation. Evidence relating to the cultivation of cannabis was found inside.

The fire spread to a neighbouring property, causing significant damage.

Detective Constable Natasha Perkins, from Coalville CID, is the investigating officer. She said: "From enquiries carried out to date, I have established that three men were seen going into the property a short time before the fire broke out.

"I would like to speak to anyone who lives in Ridgway Road or the surrounding incident. Any information you are able to provide, no matter how insignificant you think it may be, could help my investigation.

"I am keen to speak to anyone in the area either with CCTV installed at their address or who was driving in the area of Ridgway Road and has a dashcam installed in their vehicle."
