Two teenagers have been appeared at Leicester Youth Court and pleaded guilty to drugs offences.

The youths, who can't be named for legal reasons, appeared at court yesterday (Monday 20 May).

A 15-year-old boy admitted with being concerned in the supply of class A drugs on 21 February and was given a 12 month referral order.

A 17-year-old youth pleaded guilty to supplying a class A drug on 21 February. He was also given a 12 month referral order.

The order means they will be engaging with the Youth Offending Team over the 12 month period.

The two were arrested last month as part of the forces' enforcement activity for Operation Lionheart and were involved in the handing over of drugs in exchange for cash. The 17-year-old was the one to hand over the drugs, with the 15-year-old being there at the time of the exchange.
