"We would like to speak to anyone who may have seen a man matching the description or anyone who may have dash cam footage from the area at the time of the incident.

"We would also urge all dog owners to be vigilant to cold-calls and ensure their property is secured."

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting reference 21*97936.
