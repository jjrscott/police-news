Two Loughborough drug dealers have been sentenced as part of the force's crackdown on the sale and distribution of cocaine and heroin.

As part of Operation Lionheart, 44-year-old David Harker and 42-year-old Jason Barefoot appeared at Leicester Crown Court yesterday (30 July) to be sentenced - after pleading guilty to a total of seven drug offences.

Harker, of Pevensey Road, Loughborough, admitted to six counts of supplying class A drugs in the town, on five different occasions, between 28 November and 12 December 2018.

He was given a 14 month sentence, suspended for two years and ordered to attend drug rehabilitation for six months.

Barefoot, of Victoria Street, Loughborough, was sentenced for one count of supplying a class A drug after admitting selling cocaine in a Loughborough alleyway, between Ashby Road and Regent Street, on 19 July 2018.

He was given a 12 month sentence, suspended for two years.
