A further four people have been charged after a regional operation aimed at cracking down on the supply of controlled drugs.

Enrico Dieso, 50, of Carnoustie Road, Leicester, has been charged with conspiracy to supply class B drugs.

Louis Rowe, 31, and Lucy Rowe, 30, both of Skippers Close, Blaby, and Sukhpal Dhariwal, 33, of Barkbythorpe Road, Leicester, have been charged with conspiracy to supply class A drugs.

They are all due to appear before Leicester Magistrates Court' on Wednesday 28 August.

Last month the force took part in a regional enforcement operation which saw 40 people being arrested for drugs offences. These charges brings the total number of those charged to 24. The remaining suspects have been released pending further enquiries.
