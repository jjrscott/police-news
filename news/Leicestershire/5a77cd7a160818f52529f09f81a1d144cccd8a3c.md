Officers are appealing to speak to the men pictured following a report of a suspected theft in Melton Road, Leicester.

A woman, in her 50s, was in Melton Road, at around 12pm on 16 January, when she reported being surrounded by a number of men in the area. The men then left.

When the woman went to pay for some items at a shop, she discovered cash and a bank card which were in her pocket had gone.

The woman was not injured in the incident.

She had withdrawn the cash in Melton Road shortly before the reported incident. It is believed the woman was being distracted while the items were stolen from her pocket.

Police have been carrying out enquiries including checking CCTV and would like to speak to the four men pictured as part of their investigation.

If you are one of the men pictured, or you recognise the men, contact 101 quoting 20*29659.
