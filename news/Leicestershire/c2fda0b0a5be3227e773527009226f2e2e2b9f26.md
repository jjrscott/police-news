Rural security will be the focus of a special event hosted by the Safer North West Partnership on Thursday 9 May.

The partnership, which brings together a number of agencies including Leicestershire Police and North West Leicestershire District Council (NWLDC), aims to protect residents, businesses and visitors from crime.

Next month's event at Whatton House, Hathern, will see speakers from the police drone team and force wildlife officers, as well as NWLDC community safety team attend. Doors open at 6pm with presentations beginning at 6.30pm.

The evening will also see a number of presentations throughout the evening from crime prevention companies.

There will be a special talk on Land Rover Defenders, with a focus on how to secure your vehicle using particular products and a demonstration of how to mark them correctly for security purposes. Opportunities to purchase the equipment will be available.

There will also be a raffle and the chance to win Land Rover Defender security equipment.

Police Community Support Officer, Tony Gallagher, said: "This is a brilliant opportunity for members of our rural community to ask questions and gather crime prevention advice. The evening is open for all to attend, it would be fantastic to see lots of people on the evening."

Online booking for the evening is now open, sign up today.
