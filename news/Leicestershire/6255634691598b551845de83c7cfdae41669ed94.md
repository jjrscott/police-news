Officers are appealing for witnesses after a bike was stolen from a man in a Leicester park.

It happened at around 4.30pm on Monday (14 September) in Western Park on Hinckley Road.

The victim, 19, was sitting with friends near the bandstand when they were approached by the suspect. He asked the group for a cigarette before grabbing the victim's bike, threatening them and cycling out of the park and along Glenfield Road.

The suspect has been described as white, 5ft 9ins tall, of skinny but muscular build with dark brown shaven hair and scruffy looking facial stubble. He was wearing a pale blue t-shirt and grey shorts.

The stolen bicycle is a dark grey Carrera mountain bike with the brand written along the frame and an unclipped front brake.

The incident is being investigated by Detective Constable Liam Chapman. He said: "This bike was stolen in broad daylight on a sunny afternoon when there will have been people in the park or walking nearby.

"I would like to hear from anyone who was in the area and saw a man matching this description.

"Did you see what happened? Did you see a man cycling along Glenfield Road on a bike like this? Were you approached by this man in Western Park? Have you been offered this bike for sale?"

Anyone with information can call 101 quoting crime reference number 20*482831.
