A teenager has been charged after an incident in Kibworth at the weekend.

The 15-year-old, who can't be named for legal reasons, has been charged with attempted robbery, possession of a knife in a public place and two counts of assault by beating.

He is due to appear before Leicester Youth Court at Leicester Magistrates' Court today (Tuesday 9 February).

The charges relate to an incident at the park in Longbreach Road, known locally as 'Tin Bridge' on Saturday (6 February).
