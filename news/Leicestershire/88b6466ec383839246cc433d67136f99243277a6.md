Police are investigating three fires which are believed to have been started deliberately in the Coalville area overnight.

The fires, which happened between 11.45pm yesterday (18 May) and 12.30am today, involved a car, a trailer and a pile of rubbish being set alight.

No injuries have been reported and investigations into the three incidents are ongoing.

Police are keeping an open mind as to whether the three incidents could be linked.

Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service contacted Leicestershire Police at 11.45pm yesterday reporting a car fire in Stamford Drive. The car involved was a Vauxhall Zafira.

At 12.30am today, the fire service then contacted police reporting the other two fires - one involved a trailer on fire outside a property in Bradgate Drive, the other involved a pile of rubbish on fire outside a property in Garendon Road.

Each of the fires was extinguished and following initial enquiries, all are believed to have been started deliberately.

Sergeant Ryan Ludlam said: "Our enquiries are continuing to establish the full circumstances of these incidents and whether they are linked.

"We are appealing to anyone in the areas who has any information to make contact with us. We appreciate the incident happened late at night but please think back to if you saw or heard anything which may help our enquiries. If you have any CCTV we also urge you to check on this to see if you have any information which could help us."

Anyone with any information is asked to contact 101 quoting incident 20*251813.
