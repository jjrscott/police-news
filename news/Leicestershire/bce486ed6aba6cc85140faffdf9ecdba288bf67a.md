Officers are appealing for witnesses to the attempted break-in at a shop in Tournament Road, Glenfield.

Police are appealing for witnesses after an attempted break-in at a shop in Glenfield.

Officers were called at around 1.15am today (Wednesday 24 April) by a member of the public reporting seeing a silver 4x4 being driven into the front of the premises in Tournament Road.

A dark coloured Mercedes saloon was also reported as being at the scene and it is believed a number of suspects wearing dark clothing were involved.

Although significant damage was made to the brickwork and a roller shutter, it is not believed that access was gained to the shop.

Both vehicles were seen to leave the area shortly afterwards heading in the direction of Tatlow Road.

PC Beth Warner, the investigating officer, said: "We would like to speak to anyone who was in the area around the time of the incident and saw either of the two vehicles or the incident itself.

"If anyone was driving nearby and has a dash cam in their vehicle that captured events, we'd like to hear from you.

"Any information you have could help us with our enquiries."

Anyone with information is asked to call 101, quoting crime reference 19*206450.
