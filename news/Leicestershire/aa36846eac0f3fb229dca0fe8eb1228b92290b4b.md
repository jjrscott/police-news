A burglar who admitted carrying out a number of offences in Leicestershire has been jailed.

Raymond Abbott-Moore, 32, appeared at Leicester Crown Court yesterday (Thursday 15 October) where he was sentenced to four years and six months imprisonment after pleading guilty to four charges of burglary and one count of handling stolen goods at an earlier hearing.

Abbott-Moore, of no fixed address, carried out the offences between 10 and 22 August at addresses in Western Boulevard, Leicester, Ferndale Road in Thurmaston and Scotland Road in Harborough.

The remaining burglary charge relates to an incident in Station Road, Glenfield on 7 September.

Items taken from the premises included laptops, a quantity of cash, watches and sunglasses.

Abbott-Moore was arrested on 7 September after members of the public spotted him in Station Road. Officers called to the scene found him hiding in bushes nearby. He had with him items taken from a burglary at an address in Town Green Street, Rothley, earlier in the day.

Detective Sergeant Fraser Macintosh was the investigating officer. He said: "Abbott-Moore is a prolific burglar who showed no consideration for his victims.

"The act of burglary is an invasion of privacy and leaves victims feeling vulnerable in the place they should feel safest. It can take some victims a long time to get over a burglary.

"I hope that today's outcome will be of comfort to those affected by his crimes and help them move forward from their ordeal."
