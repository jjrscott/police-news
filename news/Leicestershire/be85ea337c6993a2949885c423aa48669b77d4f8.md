Officers are appealing for witnesses after a burglary at a Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service building in Leicester.

The incident was reported to have taken place around 11.40pm yesterday (Tuesday 30 April) in Lancaster Road.

A door was forced open at the central fire station and Lukas battery operated hydraulic cutting equipment was stolen.

The suspect was disturbed and made off in a car which was waiting nearby and being driven by another person.

Officers would like to speak to anyone who may have been either walking or driving in the Lancaster Road area last night. Did you witness someone acting suspiciously or did you see the suspect running towards a waiting car?

If anyone has come across the equipment or knows someone who has recently acquired similar items they are asked to get in touch.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact PC 1908 Navekar on 101, quoting crime number 19*220178.
