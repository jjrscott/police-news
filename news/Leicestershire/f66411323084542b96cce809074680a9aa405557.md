A second webchat is taking place next week to provide advice and support to people affected by domestic abuse.

Taking place between 9am and 11.30am on Tuesday 1 September, the webchat is being co-ordinated alongside the charity UAVA (United Against Violence and Abuse).

Detective Sergeant Sarah Widdowson, from the force's Domestic Abuse Investigation Unit (DAIU) will be taking part.

A previous webchat was held in July.

Members of the public can access the service by visiting the UAVA website - www.uava.org.uk - where they can ask questions and find out more about the help and support offered by both the charity and the force.

DS Widdowson said: "We're here for you - we can provide support and advice.

"The webchat has been set up as a safe place for people affected by domestic abuse to talk about the issue. Judgement will never be passed and by joining up with UAVA, we hope to help by showing what support is available.

"We have trained officers who will be able to help while carrying out any investigation."

The service is already ran by UAVA from Monday to Friday between 9am and 11.30am.

All information provided during the webchat is kept private and confidential and your details will never be shared without your consent. Your safety will always be put first.
