Leicestershire Police is extremely sad to announce the sudden death of one of its most senior detectives.

Detective Chief Inspector Rob Widdowson died during the afternoon of Monday 3 June near Syston. The circumstances surrounding his death are being investigated by the British Transport Police.

Earlier in the day, he had been interviewed by officers in connection with a fraud allegation that had been made against him by a member of the public. The investigation into that allegation was being led by the Force's Professional Standards Department. As a result of his death, we have referred ourselves to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.

The tragic news of DCI Widdowson's death was announced to his colleagues yesterday.

His family have asked that their need for privacy at this terrible time is respected.
