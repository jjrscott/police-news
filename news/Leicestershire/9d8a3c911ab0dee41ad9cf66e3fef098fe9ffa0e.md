A Melton man has been sentenced to three years in prison after admitting a number of drug possession offences.

Syed Hasnobee, 36, of Sherrard Street, Melton was jailed for a total of three years at Leicester Crown Court yesterday (25 June) after pleading guilty at an earlier hearing in April to the following offences:

 * Two counts of possession of class A drugs namely heroin and crack cocaine on 15 January
 * One count of possession of a bladed article in a public place on 15 January
 * One count of possession of an offensive weapon on 15 January
 * One count of possession with intent to supply class A drugs namely heroin on 22 March
 * One count of possession with intent to supply class A drugs namely crack cocaine on 8 April
 * One count of possession with intent to supply class A drugs namely MDMA on 8 April
 * One count of possession with intent to supply a class C prescription drug on 8 April

The charges relate to Hasnobee being stopped by officers on three occasions between January and April where he was found in possession of drugs some for personal use and some with the intent to deal and on occasion, a knuckle duster and a pocket knife.

PC Davey Rawlings from the Melton neighbourhood team, said: "Despite being stopped by officers a number of times in possession in drugs, Hasnobee continued to flout the law and carried on with the intention to deal.

"Drug dealing has a significant negative impact on our communities and I hope this conviction sends the message to the public that we will act upon our suspicions around drug dealing and those who commit such offences that we will put them before the courts to be held accountable for the crimes they commit."
