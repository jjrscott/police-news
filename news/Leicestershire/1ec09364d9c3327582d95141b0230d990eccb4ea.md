A man arrested after a two-year-old girl was seriously injured in a collision in Earl Shilton has been released under investigation.

Police were called at 3.28pm yesterday (Tuesday) to a car park in Oaks Way following a report of a collision involving the girl, who was a pedestrian, and a grey Mercedes C-class car.

East Midlands Ambulance Service were also in attendance and the girl was taken to the Queens Medical Centre in Nottingham. She currently remains in hospital with serious injuries.

A woman, in her 20s, was also injured in the incident and taken to the same hospital. Her injuries are not believed to be serious.

A 34-year-old man, of Leicester, was arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and failing a roadside drugs test.

He has since been released under investigation and enquiries are ongoing.

Detectives continue to appeal to anyone with any information in relation to the incident to make contact.

Detective Constable Kasie Carter said: "A young girl remains in hospital with serious injuries. We continue to appeal to anyone who was in the area yesterday afternoon and who witnessed the incident, or anyone who saw the vehicle, to make contact with us.

"If you were in the area of the car park, or Oaks Way or Station Road, please check any CCTV or dashcam footage which you may have which could assist our investigation.

"If you have any information at all, no matter how insignificant it may seem, you should get in touch."

Anyone with any information should contact 101 quoting incident 355 of 28 July.
