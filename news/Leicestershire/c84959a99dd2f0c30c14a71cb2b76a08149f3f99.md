Human bones found at a site in Melton Mowbray have been found to date back to the 7th century.

Police were called to a site off Scalford Road at around 3.30pm on Thursday 17 October last year following a report that human remains had been found in the ground following work ongoing at the site to demolish some buildings.

Enquiries were carried out at the location in addition to specialist forensic examination to determine the length of time the bones had been in the ground.

Carbon dating has now dated the bones to 635-685AD.

The bones are now being passed onto Cotswold Archaeology Ltd for further research to be carried out into the finding.

Detective Inspector Tim Lindley said: "During the past couple of months, we have been carrying out enquiries with contractors at the site as well as with a team of archaeologists.

"This has been a lengthy process to establish the facts but carbon dating has now dated the bones to the period between 635-680AD. Cotswold Archaeology Ltd will now carry out their own research into the history of this finding."

A scene preservation at the site had previously been removed.
