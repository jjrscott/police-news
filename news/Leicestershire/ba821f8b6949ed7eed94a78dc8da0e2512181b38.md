An appeal is being made for public help to find four puppies which were taken from a farm in Gilmorton.

The Jack Russell puppies - three boys and a girl - are 10 weeks old and were taken sometime between 5pm and 8pm on Wednesday 11 November.

The puppies were being kept in a crate inside the property and it is believed that a person or people entered through the kitchen window and took them.

Their mother and one other puppy were left behind. Those taken had not yet been microchipped or had their injections.

Officers investigating the theft are asking anyone who has seen the puppies in person - or seen or been offered them for sale - to get in touch.

PC Julie Toone, the investigating officer, said: "I would like to speak to anyone who has information regarding this burglary.

"Please look closely at the photograph provided. Do you recognise them? Have you seen them listed for sale - or have you been offered the opportunity to buy one?

"Any information you have, no matter how insignificant you think it may be, could help my investigation."

You can pass on information online by visiting https://www.leics.police.uk/ro/report/ocr/af/how-to-report-a-crime/ and quoting reference 20*598386.
