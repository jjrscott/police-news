A Leicestershire Police property officer has been sentenced today (Friday 21 June) after pleading guilty to two counts of theft.

Martin Bryan, 62, of Leicestershire, appeared at Leicester Crown Court last month and admitted taking a bottle of whiskey and a games console from the force property store.

Today (Friday 21 June), at the same court, the staff member was sentenced to 11 months, suspended for two years. He was also ordered to complete 250 hours unpaid community work and pay Â£1,800 court costs.

Concerns were raised around Bryan's behaviour after he was seen unnecessarily re-arranging bottles of alcohol in the Keyham Lane police station property store.

An investigation was launched, Bryan was arrested and subsequently suspended from his role. A search of his house found the items that had been taken from the property store.

Detective Inspector Julian Lester, from the force's Professional Standards Department, said: "Theft from the force is completely unacceptable and any such allegations will be thoroughly investigated.

"Bryan was opportunist in his approach, taking items from the property store which were later found in his home address.

"This individual was someone who was trusted with found property and responsible for attempting to get it back to their rightful owners. This behaviour is unacceptable, could compromise the trust and confidence the public have in police and won't be tolerated by the force."
