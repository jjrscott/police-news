A man who sold cocaine and heroin during a large-scale policing operation has been jailed for more than two years.

Lee Clayton, of no fixed address, appeared at Leicester Crown Court on Friday (20 September) and was sentenced to 27 months for two offences.

At an earlier court hearing, the 40-year-old pleaded guilty to two counts of supplying class A drugs after admitting he sold cocaine and heroin.

On two dates in November 2018 he supplied the drugs at two locations in Loughborough.

He was arrested in April as part of Operation Lionheart - a crackdown on the sale and distribution of drugs on the streets of Leicestershire.

The enforcement phase of the operation followed months of police work gathering information and intelligence on those believed to be involved in drug supply and associated criminality.
