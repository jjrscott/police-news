Nominations sought for Heroes of Leicestershire Awards

Do you know someone in the emergency services who have gone above and beyond in their call of duty?

The force is once again honoured to be part of the LeicestershireLive 'Heroes of Leicestershire Awards' for another year and is looking for nominations for the Emergency Services category, which it is sponsoring.

Chief Constable Simon Cole said: "These prestigious awards provide the perfect opportunity for us as an emergency service organisation to highlight the work of those who show dedication and commitment to their roles and go above and beyond to save lives and ensure the public's safety, whether that's as a colleague of Leicestershire Police, NHS, fire or ambulance service.

"The men and women behind emergency services such as these are our unsung heroes and we welcome the chance these awards provide to hear about their many tales of heroism so that we can show them just how vital their work is and thank nominees personally for all that they do."

The closing date for nominations is Friday 14 June.

A shortlist of nominees will be invited to attend a special awards ceremony at Leicester City Football Club's King Power Stadium on Wednesday 10 July when the winners will be announced.

There are nine categories and an overall winner will be chosen from these for the "Hero of Leicestershire Award," sponsored by Police and Crime Commissioner Lord Willy Bach.

Lord Willy Bach added: "All too often, acts of courage and selflessness go unnoticed or are simply taken for granted. The people involved receive little or no recognition and often remain unsung heroes. Individuals can, and do make a real difference. That's why I too would encourage colleagues to nominate the real heroes among us."

Other categories are: Armed Services; Bravery & Courage; Community Action; Community Building; Good Neighbour; Volunteer of the Year; Young Heroes; Lifetime Achievement.
