Detectives investigating a robbery in Birstall are appealing for public help to find who was responsible.

At around 5pm yesterday (Wednesday 30 September) a man and a woman were approached outside an address in Loughborough Road by two men wearing masks.

The men pushed the couple to the ground before snatching a black bag from one of the victims and running off towards nearby Johnson Road.

A number of keys were inside the stolen bag.

The suspects have been described as white and around 6ft tall. One of the men was of heavy build wearing a grey hooded tracksuit top, a hat and a grey face covering. The other man was slim and wearing dark blue clothing, a facemask and white trainers. Both men were wearing gloves.

Investigating officer, Detective Constable Jim Chaplin, said: "This robbery took place in daylight and at a time when there would have been people out and about in vehicles or on foot.

"The victims, although not injured, were left understandably shaken and upset by their ordeal and I am determined to find who was responsible.

"If you were in the area of Loughborough Road or Johnson Road and saw anything suspicious we would like to hear from you.

"A black Hyundai i20 was seen in Johnson Road and enquiries are being carried out to determine if the vehicle was involved in the incident - do you remember seeing this vehicle?

"Also, if you have any CCTV or a dashcam installed in your vehicle that has captured the incident itself or two men matching these descriptions please get in touch."

Anyone with information can contact 101 quoting incident 418 of 30 September.
