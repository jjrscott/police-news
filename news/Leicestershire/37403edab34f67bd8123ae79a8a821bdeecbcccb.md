Three further people arrested this week after a violent disorder in Braunstone Town last month have been released on police bail.

Reports were received around 11.55pm on Friday 23 October that a number of people were in possession of weapons in the street in Radford Drive.

Officers attended the location and enquiries carried out at the scene found a property has had its windows smashed and three cars have sustained damage during the incident. No one reported being injured.

Three men, aged 18, 19, 70, were arrested yesterday (Tuesday 17 November) on suspicion of violent disorder after officers executed warrants at a number of addresses in the New Parks area of Leicester. They have all been released on police bail pending further enquiries.

Previously, three people, a man aged 19 and two women aged 21 and 44, were arrested on suspicion of violent disorder. They have since been released on police bail pending further enquiries.

Detective Sergeant Fraser Macintosh from Hinckley and Blaby CID said: "Despite the arrests our enquiries into this incident are very much ongoing. We are treating this as an isolated incident and continue to investigate the circumstances around it and the people involved.

"Over the last few weeks officers have been carrying out house to house enquiries speaking to local residents, however we would still be keen to speak to anyone who hasn't as yet spoken to us who may have information around what happened and what they saw or heard.

"We would also like to speak to anyone who may have in the area or driving by at the time. Do you have video recording equipment installed in your vehicle? If so, can you check the footage and contact us if you captured any part of the incident?"

"If you know something and are reluctant to contact the police directly you can pass on any information via the force website www.leics.police.uk or to Crimestoppers, on 0800 555 111. We know it's not always easy to come forward with information but please be reassured that any information you provide will be treated in the strictest confidence."
