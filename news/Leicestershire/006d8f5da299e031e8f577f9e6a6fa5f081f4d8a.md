A man who threatened a shop worker before stealing cash and a lottery ticket has been jailed.

Michael Charlton was sentenced to eight years imprisonment when he appeared at Leicester Crown Court today (Friday 18 September).

At a previous hearing, he pleaded guilty to one count of robbery and one count of possession of an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.

The charges related to an incident at a shop in Wigston's Welford Road on 1 March last year.

Forty-two-year-old Charlton went into the shop with his face covered and carrying an item in a bag, which a member of staff believed was a firearm. He demanded money from her and took more than Â£170 from the till, as well as a lottery ticket.

He then made off in a black Kia Sportage. The following day, the Kia was stopped by police in Scarborough and was found to have been stolen in Dorset in February 2019. Charlton, of Avon Road, Bournemouth, was subsequently arrested.

He was transported to Leicestershire where he was interviewed in connection with the robbery.

Detective Constable Charlotte Mee was the investigating officer. She said: "Charlton drove to Leicestershire and went into the shop clearly in need of cash - and prepared to get it in any way he could.

"He threatened a member of staff, taking whatever he could get his hands on and drove off out of the county. Thankfully the following day he was arrested, which meant he could be brought back and questioned.

"I hope the local community can take some reassurance from the fact Charlton is now in prison, where he will have time to reflect on the consequences of his actions."
