In a tribute released today, her mother said:

"During the early hours of Wednesday 24 March, I was visited by two female police officers who informed me that my daughter had been found dead at her home. The shock I felt will remain with me for the rest of my life. Smita was only 32 years old.

"Smita was a much loved daughter to me.

"I would like to thank Leicestershire Police from the bottom of my heart for their efforts during this investigation and for their support, helping me with sympathy and kindness.

"I would also like to thank Azara from Aylestone Taxis and his staff for their ongoing support to me.

"I now ask for our family to be allowed to grieve in the privacy of our homes. May Smita rest in peace."

*Frank Farrell, 36, of St Peter's Road, Leicester, has been charged with the murder of 32-year-old Smita Mistry. He has been remanded into custody.
