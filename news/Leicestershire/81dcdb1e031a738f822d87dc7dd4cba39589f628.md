Officers are appealing for witnesses after a number of vehicles were found alight in a compound in Loughborough last night (Tuesday 15 October).

Ten vehicles parked in the compound of Sandicliffe Ford in Derby Road were damaged during the incident between 12.09am and 12.19am.

Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service attended the fire and have since carried out their enquiries at the scene this morning which determined the fire was started deliberately.

From initial enquiries it's believed two people were seen acting suspiciously in the area.

Officers would like to speak to anyone who may have been walking or driving in the area and witnessed anything that may help with the investigation.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact DC 2964 Steve Henderson on 101, quoting crime number 19*550448.
