Officers are appealing for witnesses after jewellery was stolen following a break-in at a shop in Market Harborough.

The incident happened shortly before 1.30am yesterday (Tuesday 1 September) at a premises in High Street.

It was reported that three suspects arrived at the scene on two motorbikes and used implements, including an axe, to gain entry to the shop.

Once inside they grabbed items from several display cabinets before leaving the scene on the motorbikes.

Officers attended the scene and with the assistance of colleagues from Northamptonshire Police one of the bikes was spotted and stopped by officers in Northamptonshire heading towards Corby.

A 44-year-old man from Northamptonshire was arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary, dangerous driving, failing to stop for police and driving under the influence of drugs. He has since been released on bail.

Despite an extensive search for the second motorbike it has not yet been located.

Detective Constable Robin Bonnell is the investigating officer. He said: "Although we do not yet have a comprehensive list of what was taken it is believed that a number of watches and necklaces were stolen.

"Our enquiries into what happened and who was responsible are continuing and we would like to appeal for anyone who was in the area and saw or heard anything suspicious to get in touch. We would especially like to appeal for any dashcam footage and believe there was a car that stopped as the suspects left the scene. The occupants of this vehicle may have vital information to assist with the investigation.

"If anyone has any information and has not yet spoken to officers please get in touch."
