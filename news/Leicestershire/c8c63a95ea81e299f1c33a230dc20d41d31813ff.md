A man who was found to be in possession of nearly 20 wraps of cocaine has been jailed.

Gentjan Bashkurti, 28 was sentenced to three years imprisonment at Leicester Crown Court yesterday (Monday 8 June).

On 8 May, two special constables stopped a car being driven by Bashkurti in Ashby Road, Hinckley after it triggered the automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) system.

A search of the vehicle uncovered 19 wraps of white powder and nearly Â£800 cash, as well as two mobile phones. Bashkurti, of no fixed address, was subsequently arrested.

The white powder was found to be cocaine and at Leicester Magistrates' Court on 11 May, he pleaded guilty to one count of possession of cocaine with intent to supply. He also admitted one count of acquiring/using/possessing criminal property, which related to the cash found in the car.

Detective Constable Kiran Tailor, from Hinckley and Blaby CID, was the investigating officer. He said: "We have a zero-tolerance approach to drugs and will always seek to bring those responsible to justice.

"Bashkurti has admitted that it was his intention to supply the drugs found in his car - and the fact two mobile phones were also found was a clear indication he was involved in dealing.

"We would encourage anyone who has concerns or information regarding the production or supply of drugs across Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland to contact us."
