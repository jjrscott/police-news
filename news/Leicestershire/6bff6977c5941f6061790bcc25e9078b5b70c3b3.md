A 33-year-old man has been charged following a collision on the A6 in Oadby, Leicester.

Dharminder Sangha, of Spencer Street, Oadby, has been charged with two counts of criminal damage, one count of dangerous driving and two counts of making threats to kill.

These charges relate to an incident on Saturday (4 May), near to the Racecourse roundabout, when a car driving along the A6 was hit by another vehicle which then collided with a lamppost.

Following enquiries carried out after the collision, Sangha has also been charged with one count of neglect.

He appeared at Leicester Magistrates' Court today (Monday 6 May) and has been remanded in custody until his next court appearance.
