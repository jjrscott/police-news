Detectives are investigating after a man and woman were assaulted during a robbery in Gorse Hill, Leicester, yesterday evening (Wednesday).

The man and woman, who are both in their 20s, were walking in the street near Leicester Road just after 6.30pm when they were confronted by three men and ordered to hand over items they were carrying.
