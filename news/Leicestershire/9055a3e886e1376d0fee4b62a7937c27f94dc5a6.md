Leicestershire Police will be offering advice and support to people affected by domestic abuse through three webchats this month.

Police officers will be providing the service alongside charity UAVA (United Against Violence and Abuse) on Wednesday 4 November, Wednesday 11 November and Wednesday 25 November. All the webchats will take place between 9am and 11.30am.

Members of the public will be able to access the service through the UAVA website at www.uava.org.uk where they will be able to ask questions and be informed about the help and support available from both the charity as well as the police.

UAVA does already run the service through their website from Monday to Friday between 9am and 11.30am. Leicestershire Police was involved in one of the webchats for the first time back in July. Following this, three further webchats involving the force have now been arranged for this month.

Detective Sergeant Sarah Widdowson will be providing support and advice during the webchat on 4 November, while Detective Sergeant Luke Wilsher will join in the webchat on 11 November and Detective Sergeant Ady Davies will be part of the webchat on 25 November.

All information provided on the webchat is kept private and confidential. Your details will never be shared without your consent and your safety will always be put first. Fully trained support workers will be on the webchat to support you and provide advice. Judgement will never be passed.

DS Sarah Widdowson said: "The webchat is a safe place for people affected by domestic abuse to talk and be provided with support and advice. By joining up with UAVA in this way, we hope to assist by showing what help is available from Leicestershire Police and the ways in which we can support you while carrying out any investigation. After being part of the webchat in July, we wanted to continue offering our help and support in this way.

"If you are affected by domestic abuse, please use this web chat service and talk to us. We can help you."
