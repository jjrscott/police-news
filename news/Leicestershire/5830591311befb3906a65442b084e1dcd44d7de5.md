A property officer who pleaded guilty to 25 theft offences from force property stores has been sentenced.

Julie Treen, 54, of Leicestershire, has been given a two year prison sentence suspended for two years today (Friday 20 September) at Leicester Crown Court.

Treen was also given a £10,000 fine, ordered to pay £3,500 court costs, pay Leicestershire Police £9,360.80 in compensation and pay a £100 victim surcharge.

The incidents were discovered in 2015 following errors being found on the police systems, showing that property had been destroyed too soon after being handed in to the force.

It was found that Treen was manipulating the police systems to show that quantities of cash had been collected, either by the owner or the finder, when in fact, she had taken it.

Detective Inspector Julian Lester, from the force's Professional Standards Department, said: "Julie entered a guilty plea and has today been sentenced for the significant number of thefts from the force.

"She used her extensive knowledge of the force systems to circumnavigate the checks, manipulating them for her own gain. She told the system the cash had been claimed, while keeping it for herself.

"While the sentence isn't to serve time in prison, I hope Treen reflects on the nature of her actions.

"Treen has been suspended from duty throughout the investigation, and disciplinary action will now be taken following the conclusion of the case."
