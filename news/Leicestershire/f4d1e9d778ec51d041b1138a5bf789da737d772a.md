More than 100 cannabis plants have been recovered - and three people have been arrested - after officers executed a warrant in Ruby Street, Leicester.

Information was passed to police from members of the community that there may be a cannabis grow inside disused commercial premises and today (Friday 3 May) officers carried out a search of the building.

A 48-year-old man and a 44-year-old woman, both from Stoney Stanton, were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the production of cannabis. A 42-year-old man from Countesthorpe was also arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the production of cannabis.

All three remain in custody and enquiries are ongoing.

Sergeant Spencer Dyer, from the West Leicester neighbourhood policing team, said: "Cannabis is a class B drug and is illegal - we take reports of it being grown seriously.

"We will always listen to and engage with local communities about any concerns they have and will look to execute warrants where possible.

"If you have any concerns, then please contact us."
