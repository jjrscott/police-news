Updated News Post

Two men have been arrested following an assault in Braunstone on Sunday (Sunday 6 December) - and detectives are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

At around 7pm, a man in his 20s was found by police in Gallards Hill having suffered a head injury. He was subsequently taken to hospital for treatment, where he remains in a critical but stable condition.

As part of subsequent enquiries, yesterday morning (Monday), two men from Leicester aged 36 and 28 were arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. They have since been released on bail.

Detective Sergeant Jo Elliott, from the force's Complex Investigation Team (CIT) said: "This incident happened in a residential area. Our investigation to establish exactly what happened is ongoing. However I little doubt there will have been people who witnessed events.

"I would like to speak to anyone who was in the area of Cantrell Road or Gallards Hill between 6.30pm and 7.30pm on Sunday.

"Did you see anyone acting in a manner that seemed unusual or suspicious? Any information you can provide - including CCTV or dashcam footage - could help us."
