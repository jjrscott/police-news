Following the sentencing of Ishaq Hassanjee this afternoon, Hassan Jama's family have released this statement:

"Hassan was both a son and a kind, loving brother who always looked out for both his siblings and other people.

"He always put others before himself and those who knew him will remember him as a kind-hearted soul. He was always happy and appreciated everything life had to offer. His future was bright. He was studying accounting and finance at university and wanted to make something of himself.

"Hassan's death has had a huge impact on all of us, particularly as he was taken away at such a young age. He was a huge part of our family and was especially close to his twin brother. They were best friends and always looked out for one another.

"We will never fully come to terms with our loss and Hassan's death will have a lifelong impact on all of us. He died close to where he lived and we still find it difficult to walk down the street where we live.

"But Hassan will always be in our hearts and is - and will always be - missed dearly. We'll be sure to carry his name and legacy on forever."
