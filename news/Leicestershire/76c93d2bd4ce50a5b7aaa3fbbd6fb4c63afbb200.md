A man injured in a road traffic collision on the M1 last week has died.

Police were called to a stretch of the motorway between junction 21, for Lutterworth, and junction 20 for Leicester shortly before 6.30pm on Wednesday 10 March.

A number of vehicles - including a BMW 1 Series, 3 Series, Skoda Octavia, Ford Mondeo and a Renault lorry - were involved.

A man in his 30s was taken to the University Hospital of Coventry and Warwickshire with life-threatening injuries and he sadly passed away on Friday 19 March.

A 24-year-old man arrested on suspicion of failing to stop was later released under investigation.

Detectives are continuing their investigation and are still keen to speak to the drivers or occupants of a number of cars which were known to have in the vicinity at the time.

From enquiries carried out so far, it's believed a dark-coloured Vauxhall Astra (2005 to 2011 model) and a silver Ford Focus (2012 onwards model) will have had to move from the outside lane to avoid colliding with the vehicles involved.

Drivers of the following vehicles who were travelling northbound between junction 20, for Lutterworth, and junction 21 for Leicester shortly before 6.30pm are also asked to contact police:

 * A red Fiat Panda
 * A white Volkswagen SUV (most likely a T-Roc)
 * A black Ford Transit van
 * A dark-coloured, possibly grey, Vauxhall Corsa (2015 model)
 * A silver Renault Master van or Vauxhall Vivaro, which was travelling behind a Skoda Octavia
 * A white Mitsubishi L200

Detective Sergeant Paul Hawkins, from the Serious Collision Investigation Unit (SCIU) said: "We are still keen to speak to the drivers and any occupants of these vehicles as we believe that they may have information that can assist our ongoing investigation.

"I would therefore ask that these people contact us as soon as they're able to. I am particularly interested to speak to any drivers who have dashcams installed in their vehicles."
