Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was injured in a collision on Narborough Road in Leicester.

It happened at around 7.30pm yesterday (Tuesday 15 December) near the junction with Upperton Road and involved a car and a pedestrian.

Colleagues from the East Midlands Ambulance Service attended the scene and a woman in her 40s was taken to Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre for treatment. Her injuries are no longer deemed life-threatening or life-changing.

The car, believed to be a light coloured BMW - possibly a 1 series - had been travelling county bound along Narborough Road.

After the collision the driver fled turning left onto Upperton Road and away from the area.

Officers continue to appeal for anyone with information around the people or vehicle involved.

Anyone with information, including those with a dash cam which captured what happened, can call 101 quoting incident 519 of 15 December.
