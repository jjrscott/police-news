A teenager who threatened a man with a gun, during a Saturday night out in Market Harborough, has been jailed.

In the early hours of 16 March a fight had broken out, between a group of people, outside a pub in the town centre.

A topless man had been seen hitting another man, knocking him to the ground, before proceeding to kick him several times as he lay motionless on the floor.

A man and a woman, who witnessed the assault, intervened and were both punched in the face by the topless man.

A fourth man, Matteo Heathcote, approached one of the victims showing him the handle of a gun tucked into his waistband. He then pulled the gun out and threatened the victim with violence before leaving the scene, running off towards the pub car park.

Heathcote, of Cromwell Crescent in Market Harborough, was arrested, a short while after the incident, in nearby Welland Park Road by officers who had been called to a report of disorder in the town.

Today, (6 August), the 18-year-old appeared at Leicester Crown Court where he admitted possession of an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.

He was sentenced to six months imprisonment.

Detective Constable Steph Burnham was the investigating officer, she said: "Heathcote went out on a busy Saturday night, into the centre of Market Harborough, knowingly carrying an imitation firearm.

"He threatened his victim with violence which would have been a very frightening experience.

"Leicestershire Police takes all firearms offences extremely seriously and will work tirelessly to investigate, gather evidence and put offences before the courts."
