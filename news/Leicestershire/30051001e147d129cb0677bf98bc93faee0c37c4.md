Officers are appealing for information after an elderly woman had her purse stolen during a burglary at her Leicestershire home.

It happened at 3pm on Friday 23 October at an address in Stroma Way, Countesthorpe.

The victim, 86, was inside the property when two men entered and stole her purse before running out of the house.

The suspects have been described as white men wearing black clothing with hoods or hats and black face coverings.

The woman, although understandably shaken by her ordeal, was not injured in the incident.

The stolen purse is described as black and contained a quantity of cash, a bank card and store cards.

PC Julie Watkins is investigating. She said: "This burglary took place in broad daylight at a time when the village would have been busy.

"I would like to speak to anyone who remembers seeing anything suspicious around this time in the areas of Stroma Way, Orchard Lane, Scotland Way or Main Street.

"Did you see two men dressed all in black and running in these areas? Do you know who was responsible?

"If you have any information about what happened I would like to hear from you."

Anyone with information can call 101 quoting crime reference 20*560163.
