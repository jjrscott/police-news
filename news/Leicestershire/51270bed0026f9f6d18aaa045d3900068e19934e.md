Detectives are appealing for public help after a 22-year-old man sustained a serious injury during an incident in the city centre.

The victim was inside a takeaway in Belvoir Street around 11.50pm on Sunday (31 January), when he left the premises with another man.

While they were talking in the street the man attacked the victim with a machete and slashed his back.

The suspect, a man in his 20s, wearing dark clothing, ran off from the scene along Belvoir Street towards Welford Road.

The victim was taken to the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham and discharged after treatment.

From enquiries conducted so far it's believed there were a number of people inside the takeaway at the time.

Officers would like to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident or captured any footage of the incident or the events leading up to it.

Anyone with any information about the person responsible or the incident is asked to contact PC 4146 Robert Gist on 101, quoting crime number 21* 65331.
