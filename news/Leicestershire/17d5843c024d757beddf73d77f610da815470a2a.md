A 36-year-old woman who pleaded guilty to drugs offences has been sentenced to two years in prison.

Malgorzata Radawiec appeared at Leicester Crown Court today (Friday 31 May).

She was ordered to serve a two-year sentence after pleading guilty to seven counts of supplying class A drugs on four separate occasions between June and October 2018.

On the four occasions, Radawiec supplied nine 'wraps' of drugs in exchange for money.

Radawiec was arrested last month as part of Operation Lionheart. The enforcement activity followed months of police work to gather evidence and information about those suspected of selling and distributing drugs across the city and county.
