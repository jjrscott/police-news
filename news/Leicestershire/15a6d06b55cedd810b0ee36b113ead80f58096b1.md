Officers have arrested three people in connection with catalytic converter thefts in the region.

Just after 10pm on Thursday 25 February officers received a report from a member of the public of a suspected theft in progress on Highfields Road, Hinckley.

Having been disturbed, the suspects drove away from the area and officers began a search to locate the vehicle.

Teams including the Roads Policing Unit, Special Operations, National Police Air Service and Dogs Unit were involved.

A forced stop of a car was executed near Barlestone and the suspects left the area on foot.

Following a search, a 31-year-old man from Loughborough, a 16-year-old boy from Loughborough and a 39-year-old man from Leicester were all arrested on suspicion of theft.

The car was recovered, no injuries were reported and enquires are ongoing.

Inspector Jamie Osborne said: "Dealing with catalytic convertor thefts has been a priority area for Leicestershire Police.

"We are extremely grateful to members of the public for coming forward immediately.

"It is vitally important that any information is reported to us as quickly as possible.

"This was a perfect example of what we can achieve when everyone works closely together."
