Detectives investigating a fatal collision on the A606 in Tinwell are appealing for witnesses and dashcam footage.

It happened shortly before 10.50pm on Saturday (17 August), between the junctions of Water Lane and Steadfold Lane, and involved a pedestrian and a blue Jaguar XF.

The pedestrian, a man in his 20s, had exited a parked vehicle just before the collision occurred. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

The driver of the Jaguar suffered minor injuries and was treated at the scene.

Detective Constable Pete Davies, from the force's serious collision investigation unit, said: "We are looking to trace anyone who may have seen the Jaguar or the pedestrian before the collision or witnessed the incident itself. This includes any dashcam footage from vehicles travelling along the A606 around the time of the incident.

"We know the Jaguar was travelling eastbound along the road before the collision occurred and the pedestrian was walking along the road after getting out of a parked car.

"If you have any information that can help with our investigation, please make contact."

The road, between the two junctions, was closed while officers carried out enquiries at the scene. It has since been reopened.

Anyone with footage or information is asked to call 101, quoting incident 700 of 17 August 2019.
