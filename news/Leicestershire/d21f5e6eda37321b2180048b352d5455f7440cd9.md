Officers are appealing for witnesses after a bike was stolen from a man on a busy Leicester road.

It happened at around 6.30pm on Sunday (1 November) on Abbey Lane, near to the junction with Beaumont Leys Lane.

The 33-year-old victim was making his way across Abbey Lane from the direction of Beaumont Leys Lane when he was approached by three men, who assaulted him before stealing his bike.

The suspects made off onto Corporation Street and then onto Beaumanor Road.

Two of the suspects have been described as being of dual heritage appearance, 20-25 years-old, about 5ft 5ins tall and of medium build. One was wearing a dark tracksuit with the hood up, gloves and dark Nike trainers and the other wore a dark tracksuit and gloves.

The third suspect has been described as being black, 20-25 years-old, about 5ft 5ins tall and of medium build. He was also wearing gloves.

The stolen bicycle is a Carrera Titan full suspension mountain bike (18" frame). The bike is dark grey with orange detailing on it. Including additional aftermarket orange spoke protectors on both wheels.

DC Liam Chapman is investigating the incident, he said: "This bike was stolen during the early evening on a busy road where a number of people were either walking or driving by at the time.

"I would like to hear from anyone who was in the area and saw the three people matching the descriptions of the suspects.

"Did you see what happened? Did you see a man cycling along Abbey Lane on a bike like this? Do you have dash cam footage that may have captured this incident? Did you stop to assist the victim? Were you approached by similar described suspects near Abbey Lane? Have you been offered this bike for sale? If you can help in any way we would like to speak to you."

Anyone with information is asked to contact DC Chapman on 101 quoting crime reference number 20*577323. You can also report crime online by visiting https://www.leics.police.uk/ro/report/ocr/af/how-to-report-a-crime/
