A man who burgled an East Leicester mosque has been jailed - just 36 hours later.

Officers on routine patrol in the Humberstone Road area of Leicester during the early hours of Sunday morning (5 May) heard a security alarm going off at the Faiz-E-Raza Mosque.

They approached the building and found a door insecure and after a search of the property Kieran Smith was found hiding in one of the rooms.

A window and door in the mosque were damaged and a large cash box normally kept in the prayer hall was found in another room.

Smith, 39, of no fixed address, was charged with burglary and appeared at Leicester Magistrates' Court on Monday (6 May) where he pleaded guilty to burglary and was jailed for three months.

He also pleaded guilty to driving whilst disqualified and no insurance for an unrelated offence in January this year. He was jailed for another three months and disqualified from driving for three years.

Inspector Paul Allen is the commander for East Leicester Neighbourhood Policing Area (NPA). He said: "This result is a great example of police work. A prolific offender with a history of committing burglaries was arrested, charged, appeared in court and jailed within 36 hours of the incident.

"These types of offences leave a massive impact on the local community. The mosque is a listed building and the cost of repairing the damage will be significant for them.

"We will continue to work closely with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and courts to ensure offenders are dealt with swiftly and face the consequences of their actions."
