Officers were called by Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service at around 8.40pm last night (23 October) to assist with road closures following a fire in Loughborough.

The fire, at a derelict building in Fennel Street, was extinguished by the fire service having caused significant damage.

Following a subsequent search of the building, the body of a man was found inside.

A scene preservation remains in place while a joint investigation with Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service into the cause of the fire remains ongoing.

Our enquiries are at an early stage to establish the circumstances surrounding the man's death which is currently being treated as unexplained.

We would like to appeal to anyone who may have been in the area at the time or saw anyone around the building or entering it to please get in touch by calling police on 101 quoting incident 554 of 23 October.
