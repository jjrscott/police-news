Officers investigating a robbery in Leicester have released an image of three people they want to speak to in connection with the incident.

It happened shortly after 10pm on Friday 20 November.

The victim, a 19-year-old woman, was walking along London Road when she was followed and attacked by a woman at the pedestrian crossing close to the junction of Shirley Road.

The victim was forced to the floor and her purse and mobile phone were taken. A number of passing cars stopped to help her. The woman, along with two other people, walked off towards the city centre.

PC Glenn Spencer, the investigating officer, said: "The woman was with two other people.

"I'd like to speak to the three people pictured as I believe they have information regarding this incident. Do you recognise them? Do you know who they are - or are you one of those people?

"Any details you can provide, no matter how insignificant you think they are, could help my investigation."
