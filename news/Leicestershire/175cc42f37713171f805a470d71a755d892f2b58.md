Two people have been arrested after a man was assaulted in a Hinckley street on Sunday evening.

A 32-year-old man of Hinckley and a 27-year-old man, of Stoney Stanton, have both been arrested on suspicion of assault in connection with the incident which happened in Butt Lane.

They have since been released on police bail while enquiries continue.

The victim of the incident, who is in his 30s, had been cycling along Butt Lane, near the junction with Woodland Road, between 7.30pm and 8pm when he reported that a small, white car had pulled up behind him. A number of men were reported to have got out of the car and began punching and kicking the victim before getting back into the car which then left the area.

The victim suffered a number of injuries from the attack and was taken to hospital for treatment. His injuries are not believed to be life-threatening.

From initial enquiries, it is believed the suspects are known to the victim.

Officers are continuing to appeal to anyone with any information in relation to the incident to make contact.

Detective Inspector Emma Matts said: "This is a nasty assault which has been carried out on a man who was cycling through the area.
