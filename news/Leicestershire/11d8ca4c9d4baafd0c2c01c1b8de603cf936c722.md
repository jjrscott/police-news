A man has been sentenced after admitting affray following an incident in Enderby last month.

Owen Maughan appeared at Leicester Crown Court where he also pleaded guilty to possession of an offensive weapon, namely a baseball bat.

The 34-year-old, of Blaby Road, Enderby, was sentenced to 13 months imprisonment suspended for 24 months.

The incident happened in the area of Mill Lane at around 3.30pm on Monday 10 February when Maughan was reported to be acting in a threatening manner while in possession of the baseball bat.

Due to the nature of the reports and in the interest of public and officer safety, armed officers were deployed to the scene.

A man was reported to have been injured in the incident. He declined medical attention at the time of police attending the incident. His injuries were not deemed to be life-threatening or life-changing.

Damage was also caused to a car window.

Following the incident, officers carried out a full investigation speaking with witnesses, analysing footage which had been recorded at the scene and making public appeals for information.

Officers also remained in the area offering reassurance and support to people affected by what they had seen.

The investigation led to the arrest of Maughan later that week on Sunday 16 February and he was later charged in connection with the incident.
