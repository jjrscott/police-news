Officers investigating an incident of indecent exposure in Hinckley are appealing to a teenager, who may have information to assist with their enquiries, to make contact.

Between 8-8.30pm on Thursday 30 July a man indecently exposed himself to a woman walking her dog near to the junction of West Close and East Close in Burbage.

It is believed that a girl, in her late teens, with long blonde hair and wearing what has been described as a leopard print dress was walking close by when the incident took place.

Officers would like to speak to the teenager as she may have information to help the investigation.

PC Mark Read is investigating. He said: "The victim was left shocked by the incident and we want to find who was responsible.

"We would really like to trace a teenage girl seen in the area - she may, without realising, have information to assist with our enquiries."

If you recognise yourself from this description or think you can help please call 101 quoting crime reference 20*393137.
