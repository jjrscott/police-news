A Leicestershire man has been found guilty of abusing a young girl more than 20 years ago.

David Neale carried out his abuse in the county between 1994 and 2000 - when his victim was just a child. Now an adult, she reported the abuse to police in January 2017.

Today (Friday 10 May) at Leicester Crown Court, 63-year-old Neale was convicted of seven counts of indecent assault on a girl under the age of 14 and two counts of indecency with a child.

He was found not guilty of one further count of indecent assault.

Neale, of Overpark Avenue, Braunstone, began targeting his young victim when he knew they would be alone together. She grew up thinking his behaviour was normal, only to realise when she reached her early teens that it was not.

Detective Constable Anna Blockley, from Leicestershire Police's Child Abuse Investigation Unit (CAIU), said: "When the victim in this case came forward, she described a catalogue of abuse over a prolonged period, which began when she was just a child.

"She thought the behaviour of Neale was normal and didn't realise that Neale was committing a serious crime until she was 12 or 13.

"I hope she can take some comfort from the fact that Neale has today been brought to justice and convicted of his crimes."

Neale will be sentenced at Leicester Crown Court on 1 July.
