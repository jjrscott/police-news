A man who distracted the occupants of a house allowing others to enter and threaten the victims has been jailed after pleading guilty.

Jason Mumford, also known as Marley-Owen, 22, of no fixed address, appeared at Leicester Crown Court yesterday (Monday 8 April) and pleaded guilty to aggravated burglary.

He was sentenced to six years in prison.

The conviction relates to an incident in March 2018 when the occupants of a house in Archery Close, Countesthorpe, Leicestershire, answered the door to Mumford.

Mumford followed the occupant into the house and within a few seconds a group of up to six people also entered the property and threatened the victims with knives and axes.

The group were wearing face coverings and assaulted the three occupants of the house before stealing items.

Detective Constable Gemma Dempsey was the investigating officer. She said: “The victims weren’t seriously injured during the incident but were left very distressed by what had happened in their own home.

“Incidents of this nature leave a lasting effect on the victims and in this case all the occupants were teenagers. I hope the guilty plea and significant sentence reassures the victims, and the local community.

“Despite extensive enquiries in relation to the remaining suspects we were not able to identify them. However, if anyone has any information about who they may be we encourage you to come forward and contact 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
