Officers are appealing for information to identify a group of boys reportedly involved in threatening a woman in Braunstone Park.

Around 3.45pm on Thursday 28 January it was reported that a boy riding a red moped drove dangerously close to a woman several times, sprayed her with mud and used racially-aggravated language towards her.

This caused the woman to fall over, crack her phone and lose her ear pods.

The boy was described as riding a red moped and wearing dark tracksuit bottoms, black trainers and a dark hooded coat.

A group of boys reportedly stood nearby watching the incident.

PSCO Julie Wycherley said: "This was a very distressing incident for the victim who is now worried about going out alone again.

"The incident happened in the middle of the afternoon in a public park where other people are likely to have been out and about.

"We would like to speak to anyone who may have seen the boy on the moped or anyone in this group."

Anyone with information should call 101 quoting reference 21*60260.
