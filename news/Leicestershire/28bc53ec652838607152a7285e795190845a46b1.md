A man arrested on suspicion of murder after a woman was found dead at an address in Leicestershire has been bailed.

The body of Elaine Geoghegan, 70, was found in her back garden in Market Harborough, on Monday 12 August 2019.

Police were called to the scene in Shelland Close at 12.17pm by the ambulance service following a report of a woman found face down in a pond.

Elaine was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

A post mortem concluded the cause of her death was unexplained.

From enquiries carried out since Elaine's death it has been deemed appropriate to launch a murder investigation.

Yesterday (Thursday 19 November) a man, 71, from Market Harborough was arrested on suspicion of murder - he has since been bailed.

Officers continue to carry out enquiries in the area of Shelland Close today as the investigation into the circumstances surrounding Elaine's death continue. Officers are also speaking to local residents about what they might have seen or heard around the time of Elaine's death and specialist officers are supporting Elaine's family.

Detective Inspector Nicole Main from the East Midlands Special Operations Unit Major Crime Team is the senior investigating officer. She said: "Our investigation remains ongoing. At this stage we are not looking for anyone else in connection with the death but encourage anyone with information about what happened that day in August last year to come forward.

"I know 15 months is a long time and it is hard to remember what you might have been doing that day but, for the sake of Elaine's devastated family, I am asking you to cast your mind back. Did you see or hear anything unusual that day? Did you see Elaine that morning?

"Any information, no matter how insignificant you think it may be could prove vital to our investigation.

If you have any information that you believe could assist the investigation please call 101 quoting Operation Kilter.
