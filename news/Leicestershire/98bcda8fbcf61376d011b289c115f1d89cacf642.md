Following enquiries carried out in connection with the assault, officers attended an address in Ottawa Road a short time after to discover a flat fire.

Inside the flat was a man who was rescued from the property by officers and he is uninjured. The fire has since been extinguished by Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service having caused substantial damage.

As a result of their assistance, three officers are being treated at hospital as a precaution for smoke inhalation.

The injured man remains in hospital where he is currently in a stable condition.

A 40-year-old Leicester man has been arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm with intent and a 26-year-old Leicester man has been arersted on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger fire. They both remain in police custody.

A number of flats in the same block have been evacuated while emergency services respond to the incident and Ottawa Road remains closed at this time.
