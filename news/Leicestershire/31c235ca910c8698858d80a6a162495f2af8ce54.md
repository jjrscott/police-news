A 20th person has been charged after a regional operation aimed at cracking down on the supply of controlled drugs.

Pardeep Dehal, 30, of Haywood Close, Leicester, has been charged with conspiracy to supply cocaine and cannabis. He appeared at Leicester Magistrates' Court on Friday (19 July) and was bailed to appear before Leicester Crown Court on Monday 5 August.

Earlier this month the force took part in a regional enforcement operation which saw 40 people being arrested for drugs offences. These charges brings the total number of those charged to 20. The remaining suspects are either on bail or have been released pending further enquiries.
