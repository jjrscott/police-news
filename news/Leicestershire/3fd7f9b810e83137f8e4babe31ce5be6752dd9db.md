Officers are appealing to speak to the man pictured following a report of a man being spat at and verbally abused.

Police received a report of an incident in Melton Road, Thurmaston, which happened at around 11am on Wednesday 2 September alleging that a van had swerved in front of a car while driving along the road.

When the vehicles arrived at the traffic lights, the car driver reported that he had asked the van driver what he was doing which he reported led to the driver of the white Ford transit van getting out of his vehicle, going up to the car driver and spitting at him through the open window. The van driver was also reported to have used offensive language and kicked the side of the car causing damage to the driver's side door.

The van driver then made his way back to his vehicle and drove off.

No-one was injured in the incident.

Police have been carrying out enquiries and have now released this image of the man who it is believed can help with enquiries.

If you are the man pictured, or you recognise him, you should contact police. Anyone with any information in relation to the incident should also get in touch.
