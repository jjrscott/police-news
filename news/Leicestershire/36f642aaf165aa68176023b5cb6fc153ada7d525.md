A man who repeatedly raped two women when they were just children has been jailed for 23 years.

Preston Paris was sentenced at Leicester Crown Court this afternoon (Friday 16 October) after being convicted of a raft of serious sexual offences on Monday.

He is also subject to a Sexual Harm Prevention Order (SHPO) and has been placed on the sex offenders register for life.

Paris must also serve a further year on licence.

The 50-year-old of Tarragon Road, Leicester, committed the offences between 2001 and 2016. He began sexually abusing one victim when she was eight years old - and the other when she was 12.

Following a trial, he was found guilty of five counts of rape, four counts of sexual intercourse with a girl under 13 years of age, three counts of sexual activity with a child, two counts of raping a girl under 13 years of age and one count of indecent assault.

Detective Constable Anna Blockley, the officer in the case, is part of the force's Child Abuse Investigation Unit (CAIU) non-recent team.

She said: "Paris began abusing the first victim nearly 20 years ago - but today is finally facing the consequences of his abhorrent and unspeakable crimes.

"I am pleased that he has been brought to justice and is going to serve a significant custodial sentence.

"While no time in prison will erase the victims' memories of the abuse and suffering they had to endure, I hope they can take some relief from the fact he is no longer living as a free man."
