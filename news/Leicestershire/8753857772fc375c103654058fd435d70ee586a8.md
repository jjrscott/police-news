A former Leicestershire Police special constable who was sentenced at Leicester Crown Court in February has had his sentence increased.

The original sentence handed to Shabib Asan - a 12 month suspended sentence - was appealed.

And today (Tuesday 16 April) he was handed a four year, nine month sentence at the London Court of Appeal.

Asan, 23, of Birstall, sent threatening and abusive texts to his victim between 15 and 16 August 2018.

He was also sentenced for criminal damage, two counts of intent to pervert the course of justice and harassment with threats of violence.
