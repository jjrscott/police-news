Updated News Post

Police are continuing their enquiries after a woman was found with serious injuries in Leicester.

Officers were called to the scene in Duke Street at around 12.35pm yesterday (Wednesday 10 February) by a member of the public reporting a woman lying injured on the ground outside a car park.

Colleagues from the East Midlands Ambulance Service attended and a woman in her 20s was taken to Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre - she remains in hospital where her condition is described as life-threatening.

The car park, Duke Street and an area of Regent Road was closed off while officers carried out an investigation of the scene - the car park and roads have since reopened.

Officers would like to thank the public for their patience while emergency services were at the scene.
