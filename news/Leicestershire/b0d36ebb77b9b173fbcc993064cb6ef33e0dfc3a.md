A Thurmaston man has been jailed after he pleaded guilty to committing sexual offences against a teenage girl.

Paul Stephen Phillips, 44, of Old Hall Close, pleaded guilty to three counts of sexual activity with a child and one count sexual touching at Leicester Crown Court today (15 April).

He was given a two-year prison sentence and placed on the sex offenders register for life.

The charges relate to information police received last month that it was suspected Phillips was having a sexual relationship with the teenage victim. Officers immediately began an investigation and following enquiries carried out, Phillips was arrested.

He was subsequently charged with four offences.

Detective Constable Liz Ayres, who was the investigating officer, said: "Despite fully admitting to knowing the victim's age, Phillips still took advantage of this young girl for his own sexual gratification.

"Thanks to this person reporting their concerns to police, we have been able to safeguard her against any further offending from Phillips. Specialist officers continue to work closely with our colleagues in social care to offer the right support to her and her family."
