Three teenage boys have appeared at Leicester Youth Court today (3 June) as part of the police's large-scale operation to tackle drugs on the streets.

A 16-year-old boy, who can't be named for legal reasons, was given a 12 month referral order after pleading guilty at an earlier hearing to one count of supplying class A drugs.

The order means the boy will be engaging with the Youth Offending Team during the next 12 months.

Two 17-year-olds also pleaded guilty to seven drug offences in total and will be sentenced at a later day.

One of the boys admitted to two counts of supplying class A drugs and one count of possession with intent to supply class A drugs.

The other youth pleaded guilty to two counts of supplying class A drugs, one count of possession with intent to supply class A drugs and one count of possession with intent to supply a class B drug.

Following months of police work to gather information on those believed to be involved, the youths were arrested and charged with the offences in April.
