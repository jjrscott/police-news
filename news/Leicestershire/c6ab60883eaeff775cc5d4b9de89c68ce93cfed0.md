The quick thinking actions of a taxi driver stopped two girls from potentially being sexually exploited after he called his concerns into police.

A taxi driver picked up two girls, who he believed to be around 15 or 16 years old, from an address in Leicester on Sunday evening (2 June).

During the journey, he became concerned around the content of the girls' conversation which included references to alcohol, sex and drugs.

The driver dropped off the girls at the agreed address where they were met by a man who walked them inside.

Fearing that the girls were being sexually exploited, the driver called police.

Officers attended the flat and forced entry after entry was refused.

Four men were arrested on suspicion of arranging or facilitating a commission of a child sex act and have been released under investigation.

The girls were found at the address and have been spoken to by officers.

Detective Inspector Jenni Heggs, from the force's Multi Agency CSE team, said: "Last year as part of our ongoing work to raise awareness of child sexual exploitation (CSE), materials were distributed among taxi drivers, hoteliers and licensed premises across Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland to help their staff recognise the signs of child sexual exploitation.

"People who work in these industries are in a unique position to spot the signs of CSE whether it's a taxi driver who notices all may not be right with passengers in their vehicle, hotel reception staff looking out for unusual bookings or bar staff being alert to a number of indicators and raising the alarm if necessary.

"Reports such as this help us build the bigger picture around CSE and I would like to praise the driver for contacting police. He noticed something which didn't seem right with him and he made the right decision by reporting his concerns.

"This latest report shows that our message is being listened to and people are helping the police and other agencies in the fight against eradicating CSE but this something that we must all continue to work together on. I would encourage everyone to know the risks around CSE, spot the signs and speak out to help us safeguard victims and bring their abusers to justice."
