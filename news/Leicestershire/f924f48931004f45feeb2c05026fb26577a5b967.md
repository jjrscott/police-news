A Tottenham man supplying class A drugs on the streets of Loughborough has been jailed for four years.

John Nwagobo, of Seven Sisters Road, was identified as being involved in the sale of distribution of cocaine and heroin during a large-scale response to tackle the issue - known as Operation Lionheart.

He played a significant role in a county line operating in the town in 2018.

During a two month period, between 26 October and 23 December 2018, he directly sold drugs to plain clothes officers and was involved on ten occasion for runners making deals after orders were placed through a dedicated phone number.

The 24-year-old was arrested for his part during the force's enforcement stage for the operation in April 2019.

He was due to stand trial for the offences this week but pleaded guilty to two counts of being concerned in the supply of class A drugs on Tuesday (21 January).

At Leicester Crown Court yesterday (23 January) he was sentenced to four year in prison.
