Officers are appealing for witnesses in relation to an assault which took place on Monday 1 March on the junction 22 slip road of the M1 southbound.

At around 5.30pm two vehicles were stopped at the red lights on the slip road when an altercation took place between the occupants each one - a silver panel van and an articulated lorry.

The lorry driver was assaulted by the two occupants of the van and suffered multiple injuries as a result.

Following subsequent enquiries, two men aged 34 and 25 were arrested on suspicion of causing racially-aggravated actual bodily harm. They have since been released under investigation.

Officers are keen to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time and witnessed anything in relation to this incident, or who have any footage which may help with the investigation.

PC Eimear O'Donnell, the investigating officer, said: "This incident took place at a time when there would have been a lot of traffic on the road. I would like to speak to anyone who may have information or any motorists with dashcam installed in their vehicles."
