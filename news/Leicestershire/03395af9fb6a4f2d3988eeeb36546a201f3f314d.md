The force's latest recruits took their oath to be sworn into Leicestershire Police last night.

A cohort of 24 officers was sworn in at Police Headquarters by a magistrate having already undergone several weeks of training as part of the Initial Police Learning and Development Programme (IPLDP).

Proud friends and family were there to watch the special ceremony and there were many beaming faces all round.

Among them was Debbie Weidacher, 57, who said age was "no barrier" and that she had fulfilled a "life-long dream of joining the police force.

She added: "Leicestershire has such a diverse community, as has the Leicestershire force. I just see it as being a reflection of the communities I'll be serving. I'm absolutely thrilled to be here. I feel very privileged and proud."

Fellow student officer, Christian Francis-Wint was equally as proud.

The 40-year-old former health and social care manager sees his new role as being another way of helping others.

He said he hoped he "brought a lot of life experience to the job."

Mrs Jane Morton Humphries, Deputy Chair of the Leicestershire and Rutland Bench who oversaw the attestation, wished them "every success in a difficult but immensely rewarding career."

Deputy Chief Constable Rob Nixon, warmly congratulated each and every student officer and added that it was "a job like no other," regaling them with stories past and present.

Lord Willy Bach, Police and Crime Commissioner for Leicestershire said they had decided to place themselves on the side of everything that was "good and right."

Sergeant Catherine Brighouse, regional team leader for core training, said: "It's always a delight to see new officers coming through. They have a very bright future ahead of them."
