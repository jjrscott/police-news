Officers are appealing for witnesses after a man was bitten by a dog in Leicester's Bede Park.

The incident happened between 1pm and 1.10pm on Sunday 15 November.

The victim, a man in his 20s, was walking through the park close to Tarragon Close when he was approached by a black dog which bit him on the leg.

The victim told police the dog then ran off, as did its owner - a man wearing dark clothing.

The victim went to the Leicester Royal Infirmary to be treated for a minor injury.

This incident happened in a public place at around 1pm on a Sunday afternoon, close to a children's play area.

There will have been other people in the park and we would like to speak to anyone who saw what happened. Please cast your mind back. Can you remember seeing a black dog?
