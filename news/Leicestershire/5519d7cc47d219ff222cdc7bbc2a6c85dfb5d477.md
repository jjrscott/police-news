A man who punched a woman in her own flat - resulting in her losing an eye - has today been jailed.

James Squires was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years when he appeared at Leicester Crown Court today (Monday 29 April).

Squires, 39, of Avon Street, pleaded guilty to one count of causing grievous bodily harm at the same court on 1 April.

On the evening of 21 February this year, Squires accepted an invite from his victim to go to her flat where he could have something to eat and a hot drink. The victim believed that Squires was homeless and was acting in good faith by offering him food and some shelter.

But, after they spent time having a drink and chatting, he lashed out when asked to leave, causing her to lose consciousness.

Detective Constable Sarah Jones, the investigating officer, said: "This was a horrific attack which has had a major impact on the victim's life. As a result of the vicious assault carried out by Squires, she has lost one eye and also suffered a broken jaw.

"Squires was invited into her home in an act of generosity - she had offered him food and a drink. But, in fact, he had no regard for her whatsoever. She had only asked him to leave as she wanted to go to bed, which for whatever reason, he took exception to.

"I hope that she can take some comfort from the fact that Squires has now been jailed."
