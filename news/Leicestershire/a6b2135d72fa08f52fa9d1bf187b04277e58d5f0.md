Detectives investigating a stabbing in West Street, Leicester, have made a fifth arrest.

At around 11.40pm on Wednesday (12 August) police were called to an address in West Street following a report that a man inside the property had been injured.

A 37-year-old man was taken to hospital for treatment and has since been discharged.

Officers subsequently found a second man, 56, in a car park at the rear of the address. He had suffered stab wounds and was also taken to hospital, where he remains in a critical but stable condition.

A 46-year-old man, a 41-year-old woman and a 37-year-old man were all arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. They have since been released on police bail pending further enquiries.

A fourth person, a 49-year-old woman, who was also arrested on suspicion of attempted murder has since been released with no further action.

Earlier today (Thursday 3 September) a 35-year-old man from Leicester was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. He has been released on bail.

Detective Sergeant Kevin Hames, from the force's Complex crime team, said: "Although we have made another arrest our investigation to determine the exact circumstances surrounding this incident is very much ongoing and we continue to appeal to anyone with information about what happened to get in touch.
