Officers are appealing for information after three men suffered stab wound injuries following an incident in Gwendolen Road, Leicester, yesterday afternoon (Tuesday).

Police received a call at 4.15pm reporting two men, both in their 20s, had been sitting in a car in a car park in Gwendolen Road near the junction with Evington Valley Road when a brick was thrown at the car window. The men were then assaulted by a group of other men with both victims suffering stab wound injuries.

One of the victims was taken to hospital. He has since been discharged. The other victim suffered what were believed to be minor injuries and left the scene.

At 4.42pm, police then received a call reporting a third man, also in his 20s, who was in Darley Street, Leicester, had suffered from stab wound injuries. From initial enquiries, it is believed he sustained his injuries in Gwendolen Street at the same time as the previous incident mentioned.

The man has been taken to hospital where he currently remains. His condition is described as serious but stable.

Following the incident in Gwendolen Road, four male suspects are believed to have left the scene on foot, making their way to Drinkstone Road and then St Saviours Road.

Enquiries are ongoing and officers remain in the area gathering information, carrying out house-to-house enquiries, checking CCTV footage and offering reassurance.
