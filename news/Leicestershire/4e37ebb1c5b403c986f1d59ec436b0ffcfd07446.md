Joshua's sister, Lucy Taylor, released the following statement on behalf of the family after the 17-year-old defendant was sentenced for manslaughter.

"October 7th last year is a day I will never forget, the day my whole life changed forever. The day my beautiful brother was so selfishly taken away from us.

"A son, grandson, nephew, cousin and best friend taken in such a senseless act. Every morning I wake up and think twice, was this just a sick joke? But then I see the heartache and pain in my family's faces and instantly have that ball of sickness and anger in my stomach.

"Josh (pictured) was my only sibling, there was just 13 months between us. There's not one day in my life I haven't seen him and now he has been ripped away from us all.

"I'm never going to see him get older or have children. I will never be an auntie. How can I come to terms with that?

"Our lives have changed forever, family and friends are heartbroken and devastated, and the impact on our local community has been immense.

"Josh was a bright, smart and kind boy with so much potential, a whole life ahead. He didn't deserve to die in this way. No parent should ever have to bury their child."
