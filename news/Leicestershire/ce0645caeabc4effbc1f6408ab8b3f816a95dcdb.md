A new inspector, who will be in charge of the East Leicester Neighbourhood Policing Area, has taken up his post.

Inspector Kamlesh (Kam) Mistry started in his new role today (Monday 3 February), replacing Paul Allen who has been promoted to the rank of Chief Inspector.

Born and raised in Leicestershire and having worked in policing for more than 27 years, Kam is a very experienced officer who knows the force area well.

At his current rank he has worked in both frontline and detective roles - including being a previous commander for the Rutland area, overseeing the force's control room that deals with our emergency and non-emergency calls, coordinating officers responding to live incidents and working as a detective inspector in the police's dedicated rape investigation unit.

Prior to taking up his new post he was working in the force's recently-created Serious Harm Reduction Unit and was also the Strategic Partnership Manager for Leicestershire.

He said: "I am really pleased to be the new commander for East Leicester, a really diverse and vibrant community area with lots of activity. I am particularly looking forward to working with the community and partners and building on the excellent work already established by Inspector Paul Allen."

Paul added: "I've thoroughly enjoyed my time as the NPA Commander for East Leicester, an area I grew up in and have a very strong connection with.

"I'm pleased that during my time here, through working with communities we've been able to strengthen the ties between the police and the public and begin some genuinely exciting partnerships for the future."
