Officers would like to remind residents in Leicester to take appropriate action to secure their property.

Opportunistic burglaries have recently been attempted at properties in the New Parks and Braunstone areas and officers are asking residents to be vigilant.

Detective Sergeant Dan Cumpsty said: "We have had several reports recently of people trying door handles to see if properties have been left unsecured.

"We urge all residents to ensure their properties are locked and to take extra care when leaving their homes unoccupied for unforeseen reasons."
