A second man has been arrested following a stabbing in Braunstone Frith last month.

The man, aged 19, was arrested at an address in Leicester yesterday morning (Tuesday 8 December) on suspicion of attempted murder.

He has since been released on bail and an investigation by the force's Complex Investigation Team (CIT) is continuing.

The arrest relates to an incident at the junction of Elsworthy Walk and Cuffling Drive shortly before 6.30pm on Wednesday 25 November, where police were called following a report a man had been stabbed.

 * Last week 19-year-old Callum Beane, of Kelbrook Close, Leicester was charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent in connection with the incident.
