Officers are appealing for information following a report of an aggravated burglary in Braunstone on Monday 21 December.

At around 11.45pm, four men were reported to have forced entry into a property in Heawood Way by smashing a rear French door window.

A man inside the property was reported to have been punched and threatened with a knife. He and a woman were then held against their will upstairs in the property.

A gold chain necklace and two watches were stolen: a Rolex Datejust Wimbledon 41mm bi-metal and a Rolex Submariner 40mm bi-metal.

An Audio RS7 car was also stolen. The suspects were reported to have driven away in the stolen car just before midnight.

No injuries were reported in the incident. The vehicle has since been recovered.

The suspects are described as white, aged between 23 and 26, all wearing dark-coloured Nike-branded tracksuits with hoods up, hats and gloves.

One of the men is described as around 5'10 and wearing a black-coloured face covering and black shoes.

Another is described as around 6'2 with a stocky build, wearing a black-coloured mask and black shoes.

PC Ian Mundy would like to speak to anyone who may have seen the men in the area.

He said: "We appreciate this incident will cause some concern and we are carrying out full enquiries to establish the full circumstances of the incident, how the men arrived at the property and where they drove to in the stolen car.

"We would urge anyone who may have seen these men or who may have CCTV or dashcam footage that captured the stolen car to please get in touch.

"Please think back to if you were in the area late on that Monday evening and anything you may have seen or heard which may assist our enquiries."

Anyone with information should contact 101 quoting reference 20*674149.
