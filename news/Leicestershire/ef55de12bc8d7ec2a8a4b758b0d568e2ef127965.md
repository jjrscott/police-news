A man is due to appear at magistrates' court today following a Loughborough stabbing last month.

John Donald, 37, of Pevensey Road, Loughborough is due to appear at Leicester Magistrates' Court today (Friday 5 July) charged with Section 18 wounding with intent and possession of a bladed article/sharp pointed article in a public place.

The charges relate to a report police received at around 12.20am on 19 June after a man in his thirties was assaulted at an address in Pevensey Road.

The man received treatment for a stab wound and has since discharged from hospital.

A 21-year-old woman arrested in connection with the incident remains on police bail pending further enquiries.
