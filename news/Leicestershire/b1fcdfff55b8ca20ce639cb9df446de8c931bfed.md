PC Nathan Jones has been selected to represent the England Police Rugby Union (EPRUFC) side for the forthcoming season 2020/21.

He has also been selected to attend a two-day training camp at the Cheltenham Tigers Rugby Club next month too for player selection for the up and coming season.

Nathan was first scouted to play for England Police rugby during his time as a special constable in West Yorkshire while studying at Leeds University back in 2015.

He spent a successful first season with them and was then selected to play their first ever game against Australia.

First and foremost was his career as a police officer and this was recognised and thoroughly supported by the EPRUFC.

Nathan took a few seasons off from the team while waiting to join as a full time officer - which he successfully did with Leicestershire in March 2020.

After starting his new career, last October he was selected to go to Hong Kong on tour with the team to play against Australia and New Zealand Police.

Speaking with great pride, Nathan said: "Policing had always been a strong passion of mine and I am grateful for the opportunity. I am proud to represent Leicestershire Police; not only as a PC, but as a representing player for England Police rugby.

"I am very excited for the season ahead and I believe this is a great opportunity to inspire more officers to get involved in police rugby. It is such a brilliant sport.

"This is a great opportunity that that I am proud to be part of. It will definitely highlight the beginning of a very happy and successful career with hopefully many more seasons to come."

The EPRUFC was formed in 2015 with five extremely successful seasons now behind them. The ethos of the club remains inclusive - encouraging rugby players from across all our police organisations to aspire to represent their country at the highest level.
