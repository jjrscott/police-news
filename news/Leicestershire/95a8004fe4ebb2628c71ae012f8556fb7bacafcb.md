A 20-year-old man from Shepshed has been sentenced after he admitted selling cocaine.

Ryan McGeechan, of Brook Street, Shepshed, pleaded guilty at a Leicester Magistrates' Court hearing last month to one count of supplying the class A drug.

At Leicester Crown Court today (21 June) he was given an 18 month sentence, suspended for two years.

He admitted to selling the drugs during a deal in Loughborough on 4 October 2018.

McGeechan was detained as part of Operation Lionheart - the force's response to crack-down on those selling and distributing drugs in Leicestershire.

This week, two other defendants being dealt with as part of the operation have also pleaded guilty to offences.

Following a hearing at Leicester Magistrates' Court on Wednesday (19 June), Brian Kelsey pleaded guilty to two counts of supplying class A drugs on 29 August 2018.

The 26-year-old of Waterside Close, Loughborough, is due to be sentenced on 10 July.

Richard Clarbour, 36, appeared at Leicester Magistrates' Court yesterday (20 June) and admitted to one count of supplying class A drugs on 26 November 2018.

He will be sentenced for the offence on 17 July.
