Police officers, staff, volunteers and members of the public who have gone above and beyond the call of duty, will be honoured for their achievements and acts of bravery at the Chief Constable's Commendation Awards tonight (Thursday 3 October).

A total of 29 awards will be presented to those winners, in the company of their family, friends and colleagues from the force who nominated them.

The families of officers who lost their lives on duty will be part of the audience. They will see the winners of the trophies named after their loved ones, handed out. This year will also see three new awards for lifetime achievement and innovation, as well as recognition awards for police staff in areas across the force.

Chief Constable Simon Cole will be hosting the ceremony, joined by the Deputy Chief Constable Rob Nixon and Police and Crime Commissioner Lord Willy Bach.

Mr Cole said: "Every day officers, staff and volunteers go above and beyond the call of duty - risking their own lives to save others, investigating the most challenging crimes and dedicating their own time to helping other people. Therefore, it's important to congratulate and show recognition to these people for the work they do.

"I feel privileged to have the opportunity to present members of the force, volunteers and members of the public with their trophies and certificates, as well as hearing the stories behind each award.

"Our force has no shortage of committed and talented officers and staff who are passionate about their job and keeping our community safe, and for that I am tremendously proud of.

"We have a brand new award category for 2019 which is for Innovation. It recognises creativity within the force and our ongoing commitment to be forward thinking."

Some of the awards that will be presented on the night are:

 * Bravery award
 * Outstanding Work award
 * Service Excellence award
 * Crown Court Commendations
 * Coroner's Commendation
 * Best Operational Police Dog
 * Best Dog Handling
 * Police Community Support Officer of the year
 * Student Officer of the year
 * Volunteer of the year
 * Special Officer of the year
 * Sports Person of the year
 * Beat Bobby of the Year (sponsored by the Leicester Mercury)
 * Patrol and Resolution Team of the year

Lord Willy Bach, Leicestershire Police and Crime Commissioner, said: "These awards recognise the lengths that people go to in the line of duty, committed to Leicestershire Police and keeping our communities safe.

"Award ceremonies rightly celebrate the actions of those receiving an award, but there are a lot of unsung heroes out there and I would like to thank them too."

Other special guests due to attend the event include Leicestershire's Deputy Lord Lieutenant Murray Colville, Leicestershire County Council's Chairman Pam Posnett, High Sheriff of Rutland Margaret Miles and HMIC Zoe Billingham to name a few.
