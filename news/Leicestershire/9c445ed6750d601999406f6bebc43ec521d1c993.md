A 33-year-old man is due to appear at Leicester Magistrates' Court today (Wednesday 23 December) charged with modern slavery offences.

Janos Sztoska, of Westover Road, Leicester, has been charged with conspiracy to commit offences under sections 1 and 2 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015.

Warrants were executed under section 8 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) at a number of addresses in Leicester and Narborough yesterday.

Two men aged 40 and 51 and four women aged 27, 30, 32 and 40, arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit section 1 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 have since been bailed.
