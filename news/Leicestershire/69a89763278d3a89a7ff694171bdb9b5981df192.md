Officers investigating the theft of an off-road motorbike in Sewstern are appealing for anyone who may have seen it to come forward.

It happened overnight between Tuesday 24 and Wednesday 25 November.

The bike was stored in a shed, the padlock of which was cut to gain access.

The bike, which has had its clutch and brake levers modified, has red 'AGV' levers. The rear mudguard has also been damaged and repaired, with the plastic welded back into place and metal brackets fitted.

PC Melissa Stapleton, the investigating officer, said: "I would like to speak to anyone who has seen a bike matching this description in the local area, or who has been offered one for sale.

"Any information you have could help my investigation."
