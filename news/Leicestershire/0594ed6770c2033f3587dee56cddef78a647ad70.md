The awards recognise the commitment and dedication shown by special constables, police support volunteers, volunteer police cadets and volunteers within offices of Police and Crime Commissioners.

There are individual and team awards across 10 categories. Last year, more than 700 nominations were submitted and 53 outstanding candidates were shortlisted.

Assistant Chief Constable Julia Debenham said: "In the last year 800 people volunteered more than 101,000 hours to supporting policing in Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland, which is an incredible achievement.

"The Lord Ferrers Awards provide a brilliant opportunity to thank people who have made a real difference to your community or you personally. Please help us to celebrate the outstanding achievements of our remarkable volunteers by nominating them for an award."

Anyone can nominate a special constable, police support volunteer or volunteer police cadet for an individual or team award, and nominations are open until midnight on Monday 15 July.

Nominations can be submitted via this online form: https://www.homeofficesurveys.homeoffice.gov.uk/s/lordferrersawards2019

An awards ceremony for winners will take place in October 2019. Awards have previously been presented by Home Office Ministers, Chief Constables and other senior policing figures.

Last year's winners included:

 * The Unmanned Aerial Support Group in Wiltshire Police - the only drone team in the UK run completely by volunteers. They use drones to support searches for missing people, air crashes and crowd disorder
 * Tameside Special Constables in Greater Manchester Police who successfully tackled cases involving the sexual exploitation of children
 * Sally Mack, a police support volunteer in Norfolk who has been reaching out to witnesses of fatal road collisions, providing specialised and ongoing support

Minister for Policing and the Fire Service Nick Hurd said: "The Lord Ferrers Awards are an opportunity to recognise the contribution policing volunteers make to keep our country safe.

"They all make a real difference, strengthening the links between the police and their communities, and bringing skills and experience from outside policing.

"For the police officers and staff who have worked with volunteers, and for the members of the public who have been supported by police volunteers - now is your chance to nominate those who deserve to be recognised for the important work they do."

The awards were previously known as the Special Constable and Police Support Volunteer Awards. They were created in 1993 by former Home Office minister Lord Ferrers and were renamed in his memory in 2013.
