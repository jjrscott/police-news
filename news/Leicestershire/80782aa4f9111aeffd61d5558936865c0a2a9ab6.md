A man who died in a single-car collision near Whitwick on Wednesday 23 December has been named as 24-year-old Aaron Fairbrother from Whitwick.

The collision happened in Leicester Road shortly before 1.30am when a black Nissan Note that was travelling from Whitwick towards the Leicester Road/Abbey Road/Warrens Hill Road area left the carriageway.

Mr Fairbrother was a passenger in the car and was pronounced dead at the scene.

Another man, aged 22, was taken to Queen's Medical Centre and treated for non-life threatening injuries.

He was arrested on suspicion of driving while under the influence of drugs and has since been released under investigation.

Detective Sergeant Ed Des-Chanelle, from the Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "Our enquiries are ongoing and I would like to speak to anyone who saw the Nissan Note in the area of Whitwick prior to the collision.

"We have spoken to some people who stopped at the scene, but I would also ask anyone who saw what happened - or who has a dashcam installed in their vehicle and thinks they can help - to come forward.

"Any information you have could help our investigation."
