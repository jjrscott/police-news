Officers are appealing for information after a police car was damaged in Ibstock between 3pm and 3.30pm on Thursday 28 January.

A large dent and muddy footprints were discovered on the bonnet of the car and it is thought the damage was caused by someone jumping on it.

It is believed the damage happened in the car park of Ibstock Leisure Complex.

Sergeant Nick Leeland said: "This appears to be mindless vandalism that has taken a police car off the road, reducing our ability to help people in the community.

"We would like to speak to anyone who was in the area of Ibstock Leisure Complex around the time of the incident."

Anyone with information should contact 101 quoting incident number 21*59884.
