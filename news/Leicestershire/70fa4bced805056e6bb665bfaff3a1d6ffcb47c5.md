Detectives investigating a robbery in the St Matthews area of Leicester are urging anyone who witnessed the incident to get in touch.

A 30-year-old man was approached by two men as he left the post office on Malabar Road, he was stabbed in the leg before a quantity of cash was stolen from him.

The incident took place around 9.25am on Friday 18 September. The victim was taken to hospital and discharged after treatment. The suspects made off on foot.

Detectives have carried out a number of enquiries in the area and trawled through CCTV, from those enquiries it's believed the incident may have been witnessed by the occupants of two cars which were parked at the location or had just arrived in the area.

We would like to speak to those people as they may be able to assist with our investigation. Specifically the driver of a red Nissan Qashqai and the driver and passenger in a silver or grey Toyota Uber taxi.

If this was you or you saw two men acting suspiciously in the area that morning we would like to speak to you.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact DC 572 Martin Sneath on 101, quoting crime number 20*490591.
