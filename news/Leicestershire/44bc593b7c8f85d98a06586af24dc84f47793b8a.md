Two brothers have today (Monday 29 April) been jailed for a total of 30 years for a string of non-recent sexual abuse.

Peter Mackenzie, 57, was sentenced to 16 years at Leicester Crown Court while his brother, 60-year-old John Mackenzie, was given a 14-year sentence.

Both men had been found guilty of numerous sexual offences, including rape, indecent assault and indecency with a child on 21 March following a trial.

Peter Mackenzie, of Borve, Isle of Lewis, was found guilty of six counts of indecent assault, six counts of indecency with a child, five counts of rape and one count of causing actual bodily harm.

John Mackenzie, of Pondthorpe, Coventry, was found guilty of five counts of indecency with a child, three counts of rape and two counts of indecent assault.

They began abusing their young victim in the 1970s when she was a child, continuing until she was around 14 years old.

Detective Constable Anna Blockley, from Leicestershire Police's Child Abuse Investigation Unit (CAIU) was the investigating officer. She said: "This abuse happened more than 40 years ago and I believe that both Peter and John Mackenzie thought that their victim would never speak about what happened.

"But, she found the courage to speak to police and speak in great detail about what the brothers did to her.

"I hope that, all these years later, she can still take some comfort from the fact that they have finally been jailed for their crimes."

 * There are a number of different agencies who are able to offer independent help and support to victims of sexual offences in Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland.
