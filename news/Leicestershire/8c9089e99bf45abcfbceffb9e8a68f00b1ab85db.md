Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a report of a firearm being discharged in Westleigh Road yesterday evening (Sunday 14 February).

Shortly after 8.15pm, a report was received from a member of the public stating they had seen a man chasing another man - and that a firearm had been discharged.

The person making the report then said he then saw the two men again in Narborough Road a short time later.

This morning (Monday) casings - which are believed to be from blank rounds - were found in a car park in Narborough Road and in Westleigh Road. Scene preservations are in place at both locations.

No injuries have been reported and nobody has come forward identifying themselves as a victim of crime.

However, as part of ongoing enquiries, officers would like to speak to anyone who was in the area and saw what happened.

Detective Sergeant David Speight, from the Central Leicester CID, said: "I would like to speak to anyone who was in Westleigh Road - particularly close to its junction with Narborough Road - shortly after 8pm yesterday.

"Did you see what happened? Did you see anyone acting in a manner that seemed unusual or suspicious?

"This incident happened in a main route in and out of the city, where there are number of businesses. I'd therefore ask anyone with CCTV footage - or motorists with dashcams in their vehicles - to come forward.

"Any information you have could help with our investigation."
