Officers are appealing for information after a woman was reportedly assaulted in Leicester on Saturday 6 February.

It was reported that around 1.30am a woman got into a white Audi on Hazel Street and was assaulted by a man.

The car was reportedly then driven near to a gym on Walnut Street where the attack continued and then to Brazil Street where a further assault took place before the woman got out of the car and the car was driven away.

The woman suffered non-life changing head injuries.

PC Chris Roberts said: "The incident happened when few other cars would have been on the road and the colour of the car would be distinctive at night.

"We are extremely keen to speak to anyone who may have seen this car around the time of the incident.

"We would also like to speak to anyone who may have been around the Walnut Street-Hazel Street-Brazil Street areas at the time."

Anyone with information should call 101 quoting incident 46 of 6 February.
