Police are appealing for witnesses and dash cam footage following a fatal road traffic collision in Toll Bar, Little Casterton.

Officers were called to the incident involving a black Skoda Kodiaq car and a silver Kawasaki motorbike just after 10am this morning (2 June).

The Skoda was travelling towards Old Great North Road, and the Kawasaki in the opposite direction, when the collision occurred.

The rider of the motorbike, a 47-year-old man, was pronounced dead at the scene. The driver of the car was not injured in the collision.

DC Louise McMahon from the force's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "Anyone who was in the area at the time of the collision and saw either vehicle prior to the incident or the incident itself and has not yet spoken to police, please make contact.

"Similarly if you have any dash cam footage that might help with our investigation please come forward."

The road is currently closed from the Toll Bar junction to Little Casterton while officers carry out enquires at the scene.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101, quoting incident 249 of 2 June.
