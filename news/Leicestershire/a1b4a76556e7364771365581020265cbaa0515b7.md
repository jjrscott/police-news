Detectives are appealing for public help after an incident of damage and a fire in the early hours of this morning (Thursday 30 May) in Leicester.

Police were called to Rowsley Street at 12.35am this morning by Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service after a report of a fire at a business premises.

The fire is being treated as suspicious and enquiries are continuing into the incident and the circumstances leading up to it.

Shortly before the fire the force received a report of damage at a property in Wavertree Drive, around 12.30am. A window and car at the property were smashed. It's believed both incidents may be linked.

Detective Sergeant Fraser MacIntosh from the Neighbourhood Investigation Unit (NIU), said: "We are in the early stages of our enquiries but at this stage it's believed both incidents were targeted and isolated. We are sure there are people out there who will know the circumstances surrounding the incident and we need to speak to them.

"We are also keen to speak to anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity around either location or has any information which could help move the investigation on. Anyone who has information and doesn't wish to speak to the police can contact Crimestoppers, on 0800 555 111."

Anyone with any information is asked to contact DS 397 MacIntosh on 101, quoting crime number 19*275930.
