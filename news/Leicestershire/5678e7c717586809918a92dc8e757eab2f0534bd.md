Officers can now confirm that a body found in Markfield is that of a missing Leicestershire woman, Jane Reeder.

Police were called at 10.25am yesterday (Wednesday 23 December) by a member of the public to Billa Barra Lane and a report of a body found in the area.

The body has since been formally identified as 55-year-old Jane Reeder who was reported missing from her home in Narborough the day before.

Her death is not being treated as suspicious and a file is being prepared for HM Coroner.

Officers would like to thank everyone who shared our appeal to help find Mrs Reeder and assisted with enquiries.
