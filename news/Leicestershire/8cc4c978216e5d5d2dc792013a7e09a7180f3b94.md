Officers investigating the theft of a trailer from Castle Donington have released images of a man they would like to speak to in connection with the incident.

The trailer, which contained car tyres of different makes and sizes, was stolen from business premises off Station Road in the early hours of 13 May.

The trailer was recovered on the A57 in Nottinghamshire on 23 May and was found to be empty.

Detective Constable Rhys Warner, the investigating officer, said: "I would like to speak to the man pictured as part of my enquiries.

"Do you recognise him or know who he is? Is that person you? If so, then I would like to speak to you.

"Likewise, I would like to speak to anyone who was in the area of Station Road in the early hours of 13 May and who has not yet contacted police. Did you notice anyone acting in a suspicious manner or anything untoward?"

Anyone with information is asked to call 101, quoting crime reference 19*243369.
