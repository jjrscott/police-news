Officers were authorised to use stop and search powers within a number of areas of East Leicester last night.

The Section 60 authorisation followed a stabbing in Saltersford Road, Leicester, earlier in the evening and reports of a fight in Fernie Road and Halstead Street.

The 19-year-old victim of the stabbing sustained injures to his back, which are not believed to be life threatening. Enquiries are continuing into the incidents.

The authorisation was in place between 11.44pm yesterday (Sunday 12 May) and 7am today (Monday 13 May) for Humberstone Road, Broad Avenue, Wakerley Road, Stoughton Drive, A6 London Road up to the railway station, A594, St Matthews, Melton Road and Dysart Way.

The powers allow officers to search for offensive weapons or dangerous instruments to prevent incidents of serious violence.

Following the authorisation, no searches were carried out and no arrests were made in relation to it.

Leicestershire Police has signed up to the Government's Best Use of Stop and Search Scheme, a voluntary scheme which aims to achieve greater transparency and community involvement in the use of stop and search powers. The scheme also encourages forces to tell people when there is a Section 60 authorisation.
