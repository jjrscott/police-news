Detectives have charged four more people in a regional crackdown on the supply of controlled substances.

Jacob Chetwynd, 27, of Main Street, Bushby and Kassim Sarang, 27, of Waldron Drive, Oadby, were both charged with two counts of conspiracy to supply class A drugs.

Sailesh Kumar, 35, of Starling Close, Coventry and Kevin Thompson, 42, of Ambergate, Birstall, have been charged with conspiracy to supply class A drugs.

Chetwynd and Kumar are due to appear at Leicester Magistrates' Court today (Wednesday 11 September) and Sarang and Thompson are due to appear before Leicester Magistrates' Court on Thursday 17 October.

The charges follows a regional enforcement operation in July which saw 40 people being arrested and now brings the total number of people charged to 27. The remaining suspects are either on bail or have been released pending further enquiries.
