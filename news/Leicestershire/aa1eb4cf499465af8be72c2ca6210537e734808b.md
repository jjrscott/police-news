Two men who admitted their involvement in county lines drug dealing have been sentenced to serve time in prison.

They both appeared at Leicester Crown Court.

Richard Grant, 36, of no fixed address was sentenced to two years and three months in prison. He admitted four counts of supplying class A drugs and two counts of possession with intent to supply class A drugs.

Grant was used as a drug runner for one of the county lines operating in Loughborough. On two dates in November 2018 he sold cocaine and heroin in the area after deals were arranged through a dedicated phone number.

While selling the drugs he was also seen in supply of a further 10 wraps of class A drugs.

Adrian Foster, 47, also admitted his involvement in county lines drug dealing.

Foster, of Griggs Road, Loughborough, was sentenced on Tuesday 10 September to serve three years and four months in prison.

He admitted two counts of supplying class A drugs during a drug deal at an address in Rockingham Road, Loughborough on 27 September 2018.
