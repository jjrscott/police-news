Detectives are investigating two reports of robbery in Melton last night (Wednesday 14 October) - and are keen to identify a small red Peugeot which may have been involved in both.

The first incident happened at around 10pm outside a pub in Welby Lane. The victim, an 18-year-old man, was sitting on a wall when a small red Peugeot hatchback pulled into the pub car park.

Two people got out and approached him. One of them asked the victim for something - he could not make out what was said - and then punched him in the face.

The second incident happened in Thorpe Road at around 10.25pm. The victim, a woman in her 30s, was walking to a supermarket staff car park when she was approached by two people who tried to snatch her handbag. However they were unsuccessful in their attempt and ran to a small red Peugeot hatchback and drove off. The victim was not injured during the incident.

Detective Constable Samantha Bates, the investigating officer, said: "The first incident happened outside a pub at 10pm and the second a short time later.

"I am particularly keen to speak to anyone who was in either area at the time and saw a small red hatchback. Were you making your way home from an evening out?

"I'm also keen to speak to anyone who saw two people wearing face masks, one of who was wearing a distinctive jacket with orange stripes on the sleeves. Were they acting in a manner that either seemed unusual or suspicious? Did you see anything last night that caught your attention?

"Any information you have could help my investigation."
