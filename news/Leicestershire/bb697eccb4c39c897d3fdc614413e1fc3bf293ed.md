Two Loughborough men, who appeared at court this week following their arrest as part of Operation Lionheart, have admitted supplying class A drugs.

Jason Barefoot, 42, of Victoria Street, Loughborough, appeared at Leicester Magistrates' Court today (28 June) and pleaded guilty to one count of supplying class A drugs.

He is due to be sentenced for the offence on 26 July.

Craig Vernal, also of Victoria Street, Loughborough, admitted to one count of supplying class A drugs at his appearance at Leicester Magistrates' Court on Tuesday (25 June). The 39-year-old will now be sentenced for the offence on 16 July.

A 17-year-old boy, who previously admitted to two counts of supplying class A drugs, one count of possession with intent to supply a class A drug and one count of possession with intent to supply a class B drug, was sentenced this week.

The teenager, who can't be named for legal reasons, appeared at Leicester Youth Court, on Monday (24 June) and was given a 12 month referral order.

Also this week, another suspect arrested as part of the force's crackdown on the sale and distribution of drugs, was charged.

Brooklyn Smith, 19, of no fixed address, has been charged with nine counts of supplying class A drugs. He is due to appear at Leicester Magistrates' Court on 24 July.

This takes the total number of people charged under Operation Lionheart to 97.
