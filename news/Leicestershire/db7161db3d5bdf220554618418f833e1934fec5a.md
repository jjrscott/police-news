Police are appealing for witnesses following a collision involving a motorised scooter.

While on duty, an officer came across the incident in Parker Drive, Leicester, at around 6.00pm on Friday (1 May).

It involved a man in his 50s riding an electric scooter on the pavement.

Paramedics from East Midlands Ambulance Service were already in attendance and the man was taken to the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham with possible life threatening injuries.

He remains there in a critical condition.

No one else is believed to be involved in the collision.

Detective Constable Charlotte Wright from the force's Serious Collison Investigation Unit, said: "If any motorist or pedestrians remember seeing a man riding an electric scooter in Parker Drive or a nearby road around 6pm on Friday - please make contact with police.

"We are keen to hear from anyone who has not yet spoken to us or who has any dash cam footage that could assist with our enquiries."

Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101, quoting incident 473 of 1 May.
