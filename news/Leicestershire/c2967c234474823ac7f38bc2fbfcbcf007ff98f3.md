A 20-year-old man involved in the supply of drugs has been handed a prison sentence - in the latest Op Lionheart court appearance.

Owen Beasley, of no fixed address, appeared at Leicester Crown Court today (29 May) and was sentenced to serve two years in prison.

He pleaded guilty to two counts of supplying class A drugs and one count of being concerned in the supply of class A drugs at a previous court appearance.

The court heard how the defendant supplied 'wraps' of class A drugs - both heroin and cocaine - on two occasions between September and November 2018.

Chief Superintendent Adam Streets, Head of Local Policing, said: "Drugs on the streets of Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland cause harm.

"Operation Lionheart has targeted those who have brought drugs into our communities or exploited the vulnerable and I hope that this sentence will be a deterrent to others."
