Officers are appealing for witnesses after two boys had their bikes stolen in a Leicester park.

It happened at around 6pm on Saturday (22 August) in Beaumont Park, Beaumont Way.

A 12-year-old boy and his friend, 11, were riding their bikes - identical black Carrera Hellcat mountain bikes - through the park as they cycled home.

They were approached by two older youths who threatened the boys before stealing their bikes and riding out of the park.

The boys - who were not injured in the incident- were able to provide officers with a description of the suspects.

The first youth is described as white, around 15-17-years-old, slim build and 5ft 4ins to 5ft 6ins tall. He was wearing a navy blue hooded top with the hood up and navy blue or black tracksuit bottoms.

The second youth is described as black and of a similar age. He is slim to medium build and around 5ft 6ins to 5ft 8ins tall. He was wearing a light grey hooded tracksuit jacket and bottoms. He may have had an orange hooded top with him.

Detective Constable Mona Saad is the investigating officer. She said: "Two boys were robbed of their bicycles as they rode through a park during daylight hours.

"We would like to hear from anyone who was in or around the area of Beaumont Park and saw anyone matching these descriptions or the incident itself."

Anyone with information can call 101 quoting crime reference number 20*437993.
