A group of 17 Turkish ambassadors have today (10 July) visited Leicestershire Police force headquarters.

The representatives, who are future Turkish district governors, were visiting through their partnership work with the University of Leicester.

The visit was a part of their development programme and took a closer look at democratic accountability and how other jurisdictions, such as Leicestershire Police work alongside partners.

The delegates enjoyed a talk, followed by a question and answer session with Chief Constable, Simon Cole and a representative from the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner (OPCC).

They were then given a tour of the site where they were introduced to the force's call management department.

Mr Cole, said: "It was a great pleasure to be able to welcome officials, who will one day be responsible for the implementation of legislation, constitutional and government within their individual provinces, to force headquarters today.

"There was some excellent discussion throughout and we were able to share our experiences of democratic accountability and how it works within our parameters.

"It was also really useful for the OPCC to describe the role of the Police and Crime Commissioner and the wider partnership work that they do."
