Three men have been jailed after a cannabis grow was found in Leicester by officers executing a warrant.

Emirjan Qehaja, 28, Bexhet Tafhasi, 22, and Filiz Muja, 31, had all tried to flee the scene on foot during the early hours of Thursday 4 June last year after officers had executed a warrant under the Misuse of Drugs Act at a premises in Southgates.

But officers assisting the operation detained the men in the city centre a short while later.

A search of the premises was carried out and recovered a cannabis grow of around 600 plants.

Qehaja, of Luther Street, Leicester, Tafhasi, of Millerstain Walk, Leicester and Muja, of Washington Street, Northampton, were arrested and charged, later all pleading guilty to conspiracy to produce class B drugs at Leicester Crown Court.

Today at the same court, all three were each sentenced to 20 months imprisonment.

Detective Constable Kam Kalia was the investigating officer. He said: "This was a substantial cannabis farm set up in the city. Drugs are a danger to society and cause untold harm in our communities.

"Leicestershire Police is committed to tackling drug misuse and will continue to investigate and bring to justice anyone who is involved in drugs offences."

"Anyone who has any information about drugs in their community should report it to police.

"You can report online at www.leics.police.uk or call 101. Always call 999 in an emergency."
