A Melton man has been sentenced after possessing indecent images of a young girl he met online.

Daniel McGrady pleaded guilty last month to one charge of making an indecent photograph/pseudo-photograph of a child.

The 35-year-old, of Wilton Place, Melton Mowbray, was sentenced yesterday (Monday 9 December) at Leicester Crown Court to a 15 month community order and is required to attend a rehabilitation programme for 20 hours.

He was also required to sign on the Sex Offenders Register for five years.

The conviction relates to a report police received in March last year relating to concerns from a relative that the victim, a teenage girl, was in contact with McGrady.

Officers began an investigation and on speaking to the victim, she explained she had become in contact with McGrady after he contacted her via a social media site.

She later disclosed that following conversations between the two online, they met up on several occasions and she sent him various indecent images via social media.

McGrady was later arrested and the indecent images were found on one of his phones after it was seized by police.

The charge relates to eight images of a category C which McGrady possessed between October 2017 and March 2018.

Detective Constable Jemma Harrison was the investigating officer.

She said: "McGrady exploited this young girl at an often vulnerable and impressionable age to pose indecently for him for his own sexual gratification.

"McGrady's admission of guilt only shows the overwhelming evidence against him and this case certainly highlights the concern that children are at risk of being exploited through the use of social media.

"At least half of all CSE happens online and there are a number of websites that offer useful advice and help about the dangers of engaging with those on social media you don't know and how you can help children stay safe online.

"If you have concerns regarding a child being exploited, please contact police. We have a number of specialist officers who work closely with our colleagues in social care to offer the right support and help victims and their families through that process."
