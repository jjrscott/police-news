Leicestershire Police will be part of a webchat tomorrow (Tuesday) offering advice and support to people affected by domestic abuse.

Detective Sergeant Sarah Widdowson will be helping provide the service alongside charity UAVA (United Against Violence and Abuse) between 9am and 11.30am.

Members of the public will be able to access the service through the UAVA website at www.uava.org.uk where they will be able to ask questions and be informed about the help and support available from both the charity as well as the police.

UAVA does already run the service through their website from Monday to Friday between 9am and 11.30am. Tomorrow will be the first time Leicestershire Police have been involved in the chat. If successful, further webchat sessions involving the force will be arranged.

All information provided on the webchats is kept private and confidential. Your details will never be shared without your consent and your safety will always be put first. Fully trained support workers will be on the webchat to support you and provide advice. Judgement will never be passed.

DS Widdowson said: "The webchat is a safe place for people affected by domestic abuse to talk and be provided with support and advice. By joining up with UAVA in this way, we hope to assist by showing what help is available from Leicestershire Police. We have trained officers who will provide support to you while carrying out any investigation.

"If you are affected by domestic abuse, please use this web chat service and talk to us. We can help you and we can provide support to you."
