A closure order has been granted for a flat in Market Harborough which has been linked to a number of reports of antisocial behaviour.

The order, for 32 Edwin Court, was granted yesterday (Thursday 10 September) following an application by officers the Harborough and Wigston Neighbourhood Policing Area (NPA).

It forbids anyone from entering the property for a period of three months. This includes the current occupants.

A copy of the closure order is displayed outside.

Inspector Siobhan Gorman, commander for the Harborough and Wigston NPA, said: "We've received a number of reports concerning antisocial behaviour at this address in recent months.

"By obtaining the order, we've been able to take necessary action to stop it from happening.

"I would like to thank the people living in our local community for the information that they have passed on to us, which has allowed this order to be granted. I hope they will now be able to live in peace without having to tolerate such unacceptable behaviour."
