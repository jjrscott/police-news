Detectives are investigating after a store in Coalville was targeted by burglars in the early hours.

Officers were called at around 1.20am this morning (18 March) following a report that the shutters of the store in Meadow Lane had been forced open.

A silver Mitsubishi 4x4 vehicle was used to drive into the front of the shop and it is believed an attempt was made to steal the ATM inside.

Detective Sergeant Andy Moore, from Coalville CID, said: "We don't believe that anything was stolen from the store but significant damage was caused to the front of the shop which is expensive to repair and inconvenient for the staff and its customers.

"What we have established so far is that the Mitsubishi was in company with a blue Ford Transit van and a dark coloured hatchback. The Mitsubishi and the van have since been recovered abandoned nearby.

"I would like to ask anyone who may have any information relating to this burglary to contact us.

"Any information, in particular about the vehicles involved or the people responsible, could be beneficial to our enquiries so please get in touch."

Anyone with information can contact police on 101 quoting 21*151244. You can also report online at www.leics.police.uk.
