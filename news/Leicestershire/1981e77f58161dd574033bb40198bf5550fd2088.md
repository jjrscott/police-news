Updated News Post

A man has been arrested following a burglary in Kibworth Beauchamp yesterday (Monday 14 December).

Shortly after 6pm, a report was received that a man had forced his way into a property in Church Road and threatened the two occupants with a knife.

The man ordered them to hand over personal items, before one of the occupants was eventually able to force him out of the front door and he ran off.

Officers attended and an investigation began. A 35-year-old man was subsequently arrested at an address in Leicester on suspicion of aggravated burglary. He has since been released on bail.

Detective Sergeant Tom Brenton, from the Complex Investigation Team, said: "One man was arrested and our investigation is continuing.

"I would ask anyone who was in Church Road or the surrounding area yesterday evening - and who has not yet come forward - to do so.

"Did you see anyone acting in an unusual or suspicious manner? Did you see someone running off?

"I would also like to speak to anyone with dashcam or CCTV footage. Any information you are able to provide could help us."
