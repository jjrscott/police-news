Officers will continue to be out and about this evening as the end of a difficult and challenging year approaches.

While New Year's Eve 2020 will be different for many when compared to previous years, Leicestershire Police has continued to plan for what is usually one of the force's busiest evenings.

Officers will continue to be providing a policing presence this evening, responding to incidents and working to keep communities safe and informed.

Members of the public are asked to ensure they are continuing to work with the force, looking after yourselves and your families and adhering to Government guidelines.

Superintendent Adam Slonecki said: "This year has certainly been a challenging year for many and as we come to the end of it, we would like to wish all of our communities a safe and enjoyable New Year's Eve and a Happy New Year.

"Leicestershire Police has been planning for tonight, as we do every year, and officers will be out and about working to keep you and your communities safe.

"Please continue to work together with us, making sure that you continue to adhere to the Government guidelines and are looking after yourself and your loved ones.

"Thank you to all our officers and staff for their continued hard work during a very unusual and challenging year and to all of those who are working this evening and into the early hours. I am extremely grateful and proud of the efforts that all our officers and staff have given in their service to our communities this year.

"I wish you all an enjoyable evening, a Happy New Year and best wishes for the year 2021."
