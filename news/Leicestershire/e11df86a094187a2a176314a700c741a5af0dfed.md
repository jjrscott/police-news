A woman has been found guilty at court after stabbing her partner in the neck in a New Year's Day argument.

Kimberley Constant, 32, of May Close, Braunstone was found guilty today (28 June) at a trial at Leicester Crown Court.

She had been charged with Section 18 grievous bodily harm wounding with intent but was found guilty of a lesser charge of Section 20 grievous bodily harm.

She was sentenced to three years in prison.

The court heard that the victim and Constant had been in a relationship which had been ended by the victim in November last year.

The couple briefed reconciled after Christmas and went out together to celebrate New Year's Eve.

They returned to Constant's home address in the early hours where an argument began and Constant stabbed the victim to the neck.

An ambulance was called and the victim was taken to hospital. She had sustained a wound to her neck which severed her artery and left her receiving life surgery.

Detective Constable Sarah Jones, the investigating officer, said: "The victim was extremely lucky not to have lost her life. She sustained a life threatening injury and later went on to have lifesaving surgery including receiving nine pints of blood in transfusion.

"There's no doubt that the quick thinking actions of the paramedics called to the address and hospital staff saved her life."
