A violent attack at the hands of his friend led to the death of a 50-year-old Stuart Morris and today (Tuesday 13 October) the defendant pleaded guilty to the offence.

Stuart had spent the day with 49-year-old Martin Green in Green's flat in Heathcott Road on Tuesday 14 April.

Shortly before 5.25pm that day police were called to the property where they discovered Stuart's body.

A post-mortem examination revealed Stuart had died as a result of multiple stab and blunt force injuries.

Green fabricated a story that he had been out to the shops and returned to find his friend dead.

CCTV evidence, witness statements and a forensic examination of the scene quickly revealed Green's web of lies and he was charged with murder.

Today Green of Heathcott Road appeared before Leicester Crown Court and pleaded guilty to the offence. He is due to be sentenced on Thursday (15 October).

Detective Inspector Kenny Henry from East Midlands Special Operations Unit Major Crime team was the senior investigating officer. He said: "Stuart suffered a horrific death at the hands of Green, a man who he thought was his friend. I have been a detective for many years and dealt with a number of serious cases where a degree of violence was used, however the sheer level of violence used in this crime was shocking.

"I am pleased Green has admitted to the murder and spared the family the traumatic experience of hearing the details of Stuart's last hours during the court proceedings.

"We take all forms of knife crime extremely seriously, whether it's committed in the home or in the street. The force's Lives not Knives campaign was launched in October 2016 and is still a priority.

"Officers and staff continue to educate and raise awareness of the consequences of carrying and using a knife. We work closely with the courts and criminal justice system to ensure those who choose to carry knives feel the full force of the law and are dealt with robustly."
