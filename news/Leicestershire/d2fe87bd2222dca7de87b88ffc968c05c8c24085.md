Two men have been sentenced at court after a cannabis factory with over 500 plants was found in Leicester earlier this year.

Artinist Cenaj, 22, and Jurgen Dervishi, 27, both of no fixed address, pleaded guilty at a previous hearing to the production of class B drugs namely cannabis.

They were each sentenced to 20 months in prison at Leicester Crown Court earlier this week.

On the morning of 27 January, officers executed a Misuse of Drugs Act warrant at a premises in Henley Road.

Once inside the premises, a disused office space, officers discovered in excess of 500 cannabis plants along with cannabis growing equipment.

Cenaj and Dervishi were both arrested at the scene and later charged. They were also charged with abstracting electricity, a charge which has since been discontinued at court.

PC Phil Longstaff, who was the investigating officer, said the factory was set up on a sophisticated level.

He said: "Once inside the premises we have found a well organised set up with a plants at different stages of growth to plants already harvested.

"In all, we recovered over 500 plants with a street value of almost Â£380,000.

"As part of the information we received and the investigation carried out by the local neighbourhood team, we were able remove a significant amount of drugs destined for our streets which is an excellent result for those communities most affected by drug use.

PC Longstaff added: "I would urge anyone who has information about drug use in their community to contact us. The more information we receive, the better placed we are at tackling that problem and carrying out action such as this."
