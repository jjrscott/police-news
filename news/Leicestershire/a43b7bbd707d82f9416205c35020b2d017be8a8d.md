Detectives from the force's Serious Collision Investigation Unit (SCIU) are appealing for witnesses to a fatal single-vehicle collision near Whitwick this morning (Wednesday 23 December).

It happened in Leicester Road shortly before 1.30am.

The car, a black Nissan Note, was travelling from Whitwick towards the Leicester Road/Abbey Road/Warrens Hill Road crossroads when it left the carriageway.

One man, aged 24, was pronounced dead at the scene.

Another man, aged 22, was taken to the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham to be treated for injuries that are not life-threatening.

A 22-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of driving while under the influence of drugs and has since been released under investigation.

Leicester Road remains closed at this time, but is expected to reopen later this morning.

Detective Sergeant Ed Des-Chanelle, from the SCIU, said: "Our enquiries are still in their early stages and I would like to speak to anyone who saw the Nissan Note in the area of Whitwick prior to the collision.

"We have spoken to some people who stopped at the scene, but I would also ask anyone who saw what happened - or who has a dashcam installed in their vehicle and thinks they can help - to come forward.

"Any information you have could help our investigation."

You can pass on information by visiting https://www.leics.police.uk/ro/report/rti/rti-b/report-a-road-traffic-incident/ and quoting incident 21 of 23 December.

Alternatively call 101.
