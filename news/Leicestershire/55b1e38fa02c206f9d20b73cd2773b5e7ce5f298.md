Officers in Market Harborough are investigating a robbery - and are appealing for anyone with dashcam, doorbell or CCTV footage to come forward.

At around 4.45pm yesterday (Monday 30 November) three teenagers - two boys and a girl - were sat on a bench in Sherrard Park when they were approached by two men.

The girl and one of the boys were asked to hand over any items they had by one of the men, who was reported to be holding a knife.

The boy handed over his wallet, before the men took a bag he was carrying and made off on foot. None of the group were injured during the incident.

Both men were white and wearing dark clothing with balaclavas. They spoke with local accents.

Sergeant Pete Jelbert, from Market Harborough police station, said: "We are particularly keen to speak to anyone who was in Sherrard Park, or saw two men leaving the area between 4.30pm and 5pm yesterday.

"Did you see anyone acting in a manner that seemed unusual or aroused suspicion?

"I would like to speak to anyone who has a doorbell camera or CCTV at their address. Likewise, I would also ask anyone with a dashcam in their vehicle to come forward.

"Any information or footage you have could help our investigation."
