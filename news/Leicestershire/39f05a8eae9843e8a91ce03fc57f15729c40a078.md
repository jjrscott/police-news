Detectives investigating the stabbing of a man in Armadale Drive, Leicester, have released descriptions of two men they are looking to trace in connection with the incident.

It happened at around 1pm on Monday (22 July).

Police would like to speak to anyone who noticed a white man in his mid to late 20s who spoke with a Polish or Romanian accent. He is of a medium build and has black hair which is shaved on the sides. He is clean shaven and has tattoos on his arms.

Another man - also white in his mid to late 20s - was at the scene. He is around 6ft tall and of a stocky build. He too has hair which is shaved on the sides.

Officers would also like to speak to anyone who noticed two dark-coloured cars being driven in an unusual manner - or who noticed the occupants acting suspiciously - in Scraptoft Lane between midday and 1pm.

The victim - a man in his 20s - was taken to the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham to be treated for injuries that were not life-threatening. He remains in hospital.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101, quoting 293 of 22 July.
