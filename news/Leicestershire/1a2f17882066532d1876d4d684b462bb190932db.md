A woman who was found dead at an address in Leicestershire has been named.

The body of Elaine Geoghegan, 70, was found in her back garden in Shelland Close, Market Harborough, on Monday 12 August 2019.

Her family have asked for their privacy to be respected at this difficult time.

Police were called to scene at 12.17pm by the ambulance service following a report of a woman found face down in a pond.

Despite efforts by Paramedics to revive her, Elaine was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

A post mortem concluded the cause of her death was unexplained.

From enquiries carried out since Elaine's death it has been deemed appropriate to launch a murder investigation.

Today (Thursday 19 November) a man, 71, from Market Harborough has been arrested on suspicion of murder. He remains in police custody.

A team of specialist officers are in the areas of Shelland Close, Ashley Way and The Furlongs today as searches are carried out as part of the investigation. Officers are also going door-to-door in the neighbourhood talking to residents about what they might have seen or heard around the time of Elaine's death.

Detective Inspector Nicole Main from the East Midlands Special Operations Unit Major Crime Team is the senior investigating officer. She said: "Elaine's body was found at a time of day when there would have been activity in the area with people going about their daily business. Dog walkers might have been out and about or families taking children out for the day during the summer holidays.

"I appreciate 15 months have passed and it will be hard to recall what you were doing that day, but something might have stuck in your mind.

"Were you in the area that day? Did you see or hear anything suspicious?

"I am asking for anyone with any information to get in touch. Any detail no matter how insignificant you think it may be could help with our investigation.

"Elaine's family have been left devastated by her death and we are determined to find out exactly what happened to her."

If you have any information that you believe could assist the investigation please call 101 quoting Operation Kilter.
