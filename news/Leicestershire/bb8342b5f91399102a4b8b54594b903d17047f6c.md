A burglar who distracted a vulnerable woman before stealing her mobile phone has been jailed after committing two offences within days of each other.

On Wednesday (5 June) Ross Simmons pleaded guilty at Leicester Crown Court to two counts of burglary.

He was sentenced to three years and six months in prison for each offence. One of the sentences is concurrent and will run alongside the other.

Simmons, 30, of Aston Firs, Hinckley, knocked on the door of a house in Barwell on 24 February and while the victim was distracted he stole her mobile phone.

Three days later, on 27 February, Simmons approached a man who was smoking a cigarette outside his home in Peggs Close and asked him for a cigarette. They both entered the property and while the victim was distracted he stole cash and a mobile phone.

Following Simmons arrest in March he was charged with the offences after both victims picked him out during an identification parade.

Detective Constable Shauna Ashton was the investigating officer, she said: "Simmons is a prolific offender in the local area and we are pleased he has pleaded guilty to the offences.

"Both victims are vulnerable due to disabilities and Simmons deliberately targeted them because of that. The victims showed immense bravery in coming forward and it was their evidence that secured this conviction.

"We hope this outcome gives Simmons a chance to reflect on his actions and mend his ways."
