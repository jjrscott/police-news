A man who stopped a police officer in the street and made comments implicating himself in an attack on his estranged partner has been convicted of her murder.

Bhavini Pravin was stabbed at her home address in Moores Road in Leicester.

Jigukumar Sorthi, 23, was found guilty today (Friday 11 September) at Leicester Crown Court following a trial lasting two weeks.

At around 12.30pm on 2 March Sorthi went to the address to speak to Miss Pravin. Once inside they talked for a few minutes before Sorthi stabbed the victim multiple times before leaving the property minutes later.

Police and the East Midlands Ambulance Service were called to the address where Miss Pravin, 21, was sadly pronounced deceased.

Less than two hours after the incident, Sorthi of East Park Road, approached an officer outside Spinney Hill Police Station and made admissions implicating himself in the stabbing of Miss Pravin.

A post-mortem examination was carried out and concluded Miss Pravin died as a result of multiple stab wounds.

Detective Inspector Kenny Henry from the East Midlands Special Operations Unit Major Crime team was the senior investigating officer. He said: "This was a vicious attack on a defenceless young woman.

"Bhavini Pravin was 21 years old with her whole life ahead of her, instead it has been cruelly taken away by an act so brutal it doesn't bear thinking about.

"Her family have said that a light has gone out in their lives and remain devastated by her death."

Sorthi will be sentenced on Wednesday 16 September.
