An accident and emergency doctor suffered facial injuries after he was assaulted in a park in Sileby.

The victim, who is 28, was playing basketball with a friend in Sileby Memorial Park, Seagrave Road, at around 6.20pm on Friday 7 August when he was approached by a group of around 10 youths.

It was reported that one of the youths asked to shoot some hoops with the ball, but when given the ball, he then left with it. The victim tried to get the ball back which led to the victim being racially abused and assaulted by three of the group.

The victim sustained cuts and bruises which required hospital treatment. He has since been discharged.
Following the incident the group dispersed and left the park.

An appeal was issued the day after the incident and enquiries have been ongoing. Officers are now making a re-appeal to anyone with any information to make contact.

Sergeant James Thomas said: "This was a random assault on a man who was out enjoying the hot weather and playing a game of basketball.

"It is believed that the youths, both boys and girls, were around 15 to 16-years old.

"There are likely to have been people in the area at the time and we are appealing to anyone who has any information to make contact. We would like to hear from anyone who was in the park and recalls seeing the group or the incident itself take place.

"If you have any CCTV or dashcam footage from around the area of the park at the time, please also check this to see if it holds any information which could help our investigation.

"Behaviour such as this is unacceptable. A man has been racially abused and assaulted and we are determined to find who was responsible."

Anyone with information about what happened can call 101 quoting crime reference 20*409347.
