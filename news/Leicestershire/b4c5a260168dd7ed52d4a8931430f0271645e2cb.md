Officers are appealing for information after a reported arson in Leicester on Saturday 6 March.

It was reported that around 5pm a caravan was set alight on Oswin Road.

No injuries were reported but all the contents of the caravan were destroyed.

Two men were reportedly seen running away from the fire, both around 18 years old.

One is described as mixed race with dreadlocks and wearing a shiny navy Adidas jacket with the hood up and dark blue bottoms.

The other is described as white with blonde hair and wearing a black Adidas puffer jacket with the hood up, black Adidas trainers and black Adidas tracksuit bottoms.

PC Sarah Lee said: "This incident happened when it was still light and traffic is likely to have been passing through the area.

"We would like to speak to anyone who may have seen these men or anyone with dash cam footage that might have captured them."

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting reference 21*129049.
