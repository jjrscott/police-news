A man arrested on suspicion of attempted murder following an incident in Coalville last month has been released on police bail.

The 18-year-old, of Leicester, was arrested yesterday afternoon (Friday) in connection with the incident which happened in Belvoir Road just before 1.45pm on Monday 13 April.

A 33-year-old man was found to have been assaulted in the area at the time of the incident. He was taken to hospital and has since been discharged.

The 18-year-old man was also arrested on suspicion of possession of a firearm in connection with an incident in Mallory Place, Leicester, which happened on Saturday 16 May.

He has since been released on conditional bail in relation to both offences.

Armed officers attended Mallory Place on 16 May following a report received that gun shots had been heard.

Enquiries remain ongoing into the incident to establish the full circumstances.

*Jed Palmer, 23, of Ross Walk, Leicester, and Dyrell Parker, 18, of Thurcaston Road, Leicester, have both previously been charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent in relation to a report of a non-stop collision in Belvoir Road, Coalville, on 13 April which involved the same victim as the incident in Belvoir Road mentioned above.
