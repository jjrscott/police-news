A closure order has been obtained for a property in Melton Mowbray following reports of anti-social behaviour, drug offences and breaches of Covid-19 legislation.

The order forbids anyone from entering the property at 65 Rutland Street for the next three months. This includes the current occupant.

The order, which is displayed outside the property was granted at Leicester Magistrates Court today (Friday) after being obtained by Police Constable Davey Rawlings from Melton and Rutland Neighbourhood Policing Area (NPA) working with Melton Borough Council.

The closure order came following concerns raised including reports of visitors to the property in breach of Covid-19 legislation. Two Fixed Penalty Notices have been issued to the occupant following breaches. The amount of these FPNs is dependent on a number of factors including when the fine is paid.

Officers have also attended reports of anti-social behaviour at the property including reports that the property was being used in relation to drug use and distribution.

Following the closure order being obtained, the council is working to house the occupant at a suitable location.

Police Constable Davey Rawlings said: "We were receiving a number of reports in relation to this property which were understandably causing high concern in the community.

"Working with Melton Borough Council, we therefore took action to obtain this closure order. We hope this provides some reassurance within the community and that it also shows the action we will take when concerns such as this are raised.

"Please continue to report any concerns you have to us regarding criminal activity and anti-social behaviour so that we can continue to work with you to keep our communities safe."
