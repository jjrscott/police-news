Detectives investigating a stabbing in Leicester's Bede Park are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

It happened at around 12.20am yesterday (Thursday 15 August). The victim - a man in his 20s - was walking through the park when he was approached by two men who asked him to hand over his phone.

When the victim refused, a struggle ensued in which he was stabbed in the shoulder and back.

He did not hand over his phone and the suspects left the scene. The victim was taken to the Leicester Royal Infirmary where he was treated for non-life-threatening injuries. He has since been discharged.

Detective Constable Eleanor Johnson, the investigating officer, said: "I'd like to speak to anyone who was in the area of Bede Park or Western Boulevard in the early hours of yesterday morning. Did you see anyone acting in an unusual manner or way that drew your attention?

"I'd also like to speak to any taxi drivers or motorists with dash cams installed in their vehicle and have footage recorded at the time. Any information you have could help my investigation."

Following the incident, officers from the West Leicester Neighbourhood Policing Area (NPA) are carrying out additional late-night patrols.

Sergeant Mark Brennan said: "I would like to reassure people in the area that we have additional patrols in place. We are also continuing to work with partner organisations to improve public safety, CCTV and lighting in Bede Park and the surrounding vicinity."

Call 101, quoting reference 19*431666.
