A woman remains in hospital three days after being robbed in Leicester earlier this week.

The 40-year-old victim was walking along Maidstone Road at around 9.50am on Monday (20 May) when she was approached from behind, pushed over and her phone and bag were taken.

The woman sustained a head injury during the incident and remains in hospital in a stable condition receiving ongoing treatment.

The suspect, described as in his late twenties to early thirties, was last seen running off through nearby Apollo Close.

Detective Sergeant Paul Franklin is urging for anyone who may have been witnessed the incident to get in touch.

He said: "This woman was subjected to a terrifying experience and sustained a significant head injury for which she remains in hospital receiving treatment for.

"I am particularly keen to speak to a motorcyclist who stopped at the scene and initially gave chase to the suspect, and also a taxi driver who stopped to assist. I would urge this people to contact me.

"Maidstone Road is a fairly busy road and I am hopeful that there is someone who may have seen this incident but hasn't as yet contacted police with what information they have.

"Maybe you didn't see the robbery but saw the suspect running from the scene? Or perhaps you saw someone in the area acting suspiciously who may be linked to this incident?

"Please call us if you have any information about this crime and help us with our enquiries to catch the person responsible."

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101 quoting 19*257411.
