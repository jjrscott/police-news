A man who was arrested for drug offences following the execution of a police warrant has been jailed for more than five years.

Reece Broad, 21, initially jumped out of a window to make his escape when police arrived at the property in Walpole Court, Leicester, during the afternoon of 4 November last year.

While Broad initially then ran off, officers remained at the scene and searched the property where a substantial amount of heroin and cocaine was found as well as scales, mobile phones and cash.

Broad, of no fixed address, was then identified by officers on CCTV and was arrested three days later.

Following investigation, the defendant's fingerprints were found on packaging of the drugs and a mobile phone was also linked to him. Broad was later charged in relation to the offence.

At court, he pleaded guilty to two counts of possession of a class A drug with intent to supply in relation to the offence committed in November last year.

He had also previously admitted to two counts of being concerned in the supply of class A drugs relating back to an offence in 2018.

On Monday (15 June) he was sentenced at Leicester Crown Court to a total of five years and eight months imprisonment.

Detective Constable Damian Young said: "Broad's arrest came following a planned warrant being executed at a property. We will act on information received in relation to drug offences and will bring those responsible for these offences to the courts.

"If you have any information in relation to drug offences being committed, you should report it to police. This can be done online at www.leics.police.uk or by calling 101. Always call 999 in an emergency."
