A 63-year-old man has been sentenced for two offences linked to a series of ATM attacks in 2017.

Derek Hall was charged with one count of converting criminal property and one count of concealing criminal property.

He pleaded guilty to the offences at a previous hearing at Leicester Crown Court, and was sentenced at the same court on Monday 16 September to two years and three months.

The 63-year-old, of Rosliston Road, Walton-on-Trent, Derbyshire, was charged following the discovery of more than £100,000 found in the toilet cistern in the bathroom of his home address. A further £10,000 was found hidden in the cooker hood at the property.

Derek Hall claimed the money was his life savings.

Derek's son, Heathan Hall, was sentenced to 11 years last month for his involvement in the ATM breaks between May and October 2017. Heathan involved Derek in the criminality from the ATM attacks, with thousands of pounds found in his father's property.

Some of the proceeds of the crime were also used to buy cars in cash - in an attempt, it seems, to get rid of some of the criminal money.
