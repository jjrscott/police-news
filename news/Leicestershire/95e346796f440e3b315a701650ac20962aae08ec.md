Look after yourselves, stay safe and know that we are here for you.

The festive season is a very different time for many this year but Leicestershire Police has continued to plan ahead as the force does every year. This is to ensure enough resources are in place throughout the coming days, that officers are providing a high policing presence across Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland and that plans are in place to respond to potential incidents while also keeping communities informed and reassured.

In return, communities are being asked to continue to ensure they are keeping themselves and others safe, adhering to the Government guidelines and celebrating safely.

Superintendent Adam Slonecki said: "This year has certainly been a challenging one and following the latest Government announcements, Christmas will be a very unusual time for many of us and not how many of us had planned.

"While circumstances are very different, Leicestershire Police has continued to plan for the Christmas period as we do every year. Our officers will continue to be out working hard to keep you and our communities safe and to help you enjoy this festive time as safely as you can.

"Please continue to work with us over these next few days. Please ensure you are adhering to the Government guidelines, looking after yourselves and your loved ones and celebrating in a safe way.

"Thank you to all our officers and staff who are working over the next few days giving up time with their own families to help keep Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland safe.

"Please continue to look after yourselves, please celebrate safely and have a happy, safe and enjoyable Christmas!"
