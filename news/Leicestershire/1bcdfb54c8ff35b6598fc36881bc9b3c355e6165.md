Officers are appealing for witnesses after money was stolen from the home of an elderly couple in Leicester on Wednesday 13 January.

Around 7.10pm a man knocked on the door of a property in Heyford Road and asked one of the occupants, a 78-year-old man, if they wanted to buy some meat.

While the occupant turned his head to talk to his wife, a man pushed the occupant aside and stole a container with a quantity of cash inside.

Two men then left the scene on push bikes in the direction of Avery Hill and Wilmore Crescent.

They are described as white and late 20s. One man was wearing a Russian-type hat, a light grey tracksuit with a rucksack on his back and trainers.

The other man was described as wearing a dark woollen hat, jeans, a Superdry coat and trainers.

DC Rachel Chapman would like to speak to anyone who might have CCTV or dashcam footage from the area that might have captured these men.

She said: "This incident happened during the early evening near to a local shop where there would have been quite a few people coming and going.

"I would like to hear from anyone who was in the area and saw men on bikes.

"We would also like to hear from anyone in the area who might also have been cold-called."

Anyone with any information should contact 101 quoting reference 21*33841.
