**Our duty to protect**

To all in Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland,

Today the police have been given new powers to help keep people safe.

As your Chief Constable I would like to make a pledge to you. In return, I ask for your support.

Every day and night my officers and staff go above and beyond to protect our communities.

Every officer at Leicestershire Police knows this as our duty - to protect the people and deal with those who cause harm. We do this by engaging with our communities, explaining and problem solving, and enforcing the law through action when we must.

In this force's 180 year history we have never faced a challenge like this.

I pledge that my officers will continue to exercise our duty, as we have always done. We will protect you. We will engage positively. We will explain. We will be there when you need help - and we will take action to protect you and others from harm.

I ask for your support in this. Help us to help you. Stay at home and together we will save lives.

**Simon Cole QPM**
