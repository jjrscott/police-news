A drug dealer from Beaumont Leys has been sent to prison for four years after pleading guilty to six offences.

Levi Kemp, of Marwood Road, Leicester, admitted being involved in a drug deal and directly supplying cocaine and heroin on four dates in January and February this year.

The 24-year-old supplied a total of nine 'wraps' of the drugs and was also responsible for setting up a deal in which two 'wraps' of cocaine were supplied. All of the offences took place in Loughborough.

Kemp was arrested by police last month as part of Operation Lionheart - the force's response to crack-down on those selling and distributing drugs in Leicestershire.

He appeared at Leicester Crown Court yesterday (3 June) and following his guilty plea was given a four-year custodial sentence.

Chief Superintendent Adam Streets, head of Local Policing, said: "Following months of police work Kemp was one the suspects identified for being involved in the sale of drugs on our streets.

"Selling cocaine and heroin is not only illegal but they ruin lives and cause devastation to communities. Many of those who are responsible for this activity are being dealt with as part of our ongoing operation to tackle the issue."
