An educational film created by Leicestershire Police to raise awareness of the grooming of boys online has won its third award - eight days after its last accolade.

Breck's Last Game tells the story of Breck Bedner, a 14-year-old gamer who was murdered in 2014 after being groomed online.

The hard-hitting film was produced to raise awareness of the dangers of talking to strangers online and being seduced by them, and was made as part of a collaboration between Leicestershire Police, Northamptonshire Police, Surrey Police and Essex Police.

The short film has been watched by millions across the country, and on Friday night (29 November) was awarded a Royal Television Society Midlands Award in the Best Promotional Content category.

This is the third award for the film - it picked up a silver award in the Film in a Digital Campaign category at the EVCOM (Event and Visual Communication Association) London Film Awards on 21 November and a silver award at the Cannes Corporate Media & TV Awards in September.

Deputy Chief Constable Rob Nixon said: "I am very pleased that Breck's last game has been given the recognition it has, and this third award cements the importance of the message that we need the film to convey.

"Anyone online can fall prey to a groomer - youngsters who spend a lot of time online and maybe speaking to people from all over the world, both boys and girls, may not be speaking to who they think they are.

"The film - rightly - raises the question: _do you really know your online friends?_ and aims to get people to think twice about who's on the other side of the screen, while opening up the conversation between parents and carers and children.

"Since it was launched, Breck's Last Game has been used as a valuable education resource in schools across Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland and even adopted by the Australian Federal Police."

Daynes lured Breck to his flat in Essex, under the premise that he would hand over control of a fictional computer business to the teenager.

The film was made by Affixxius Films, based in Loughborough and features Lorin LaFave, Breck's mother.
