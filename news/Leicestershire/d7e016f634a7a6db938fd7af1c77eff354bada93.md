A man who was stopped by police in a vehicle has been jailed after admitting possession of class A drugs with intent to supply.

Officers had stopped the silver Honda Civic car in Kingston Road, Leicester, on 27 January this year following concerns regarding the vehicle.

Daniel Stringer was found to be in the vehicle along with Kelly Snutch. Following initial enquiries, both were arrested.

Searches were carried out leading to Stringer being found to be in possession of more than £1400 of cash while Snutch was found to be in possession of a quantity of heroin.

The pair were charged and yesterday (2 March) at Leicester Crown Court, Stringer pleaded guilty to possession of class A drugs with intent to supply.

He also admitted driving while disqualified, driving without insurance and fraudulently using a vehicle registration. The Honda Civic car he was driving was found to displaying false plates.

Snutch pleaded guilty to possession of class A drugs.

Stringer, 32, of Coleman Road, Leicester, was sentenced to three years and six months imprisonment. He was also disqualified from driving for three months. Snutch, 32, of London Road, Leicester, was fined £1,000.

Detective Constable Damian Young said: "Officers acted on their concerns stopping the vehicle which led to the defendants being arrested.

"The supplying of drugs is a serious crime and will not be tolerated. We will take action against those found to be responsible and will work to bring these cases before the court."
