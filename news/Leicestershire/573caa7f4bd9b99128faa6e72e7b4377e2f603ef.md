Police are advising residents in parts of Rothley to stay indoors while they respond to an incident involving a gas substation.

Officers were called at around 6.30am this morning (1 January) to a report of a single vehicle collision in The Ridings.

The vehicle, a black Peugeot, collided with a gas substation.

The driver of the vehicle made off and enquiries are ongoing to locate them.

The Ridings is currently closed at its junctions with Westfield Lane and the Ridgeway and Swithland Lane is closed at its junctions with The Ridings, West Cross Lane and Carisbrooke Road.

A small number of residents in nearby properties have been evacuated as a precaution and we are advising anyone living locally to stay indoors with their windows closed.

All agencies involved are working as quickly as possible to resolve the situation and we would like to thank those affected for their patience and understanding while this necessary work is carried out.

Anyone with information about the incident can contact police on 101 quoting incident 226 of 1 January.
