Officers from the City Centre Neighbourhood Policing Area (NPA) have obtained a closure order for two properties in Leicester.

The order, which was granted at Leicester Magistrates' Court yesterday (7 October), relate to two properties in Newtown Street - flat numbers 4C and 4E.

The order was applied for by police following ongoing reports of anti-social behaviour and suspected drug activity at the addresses.

It forbids anyone, including the current occupants, from entering the properties for a period of three months and is displayed outside.

Inspector Adam Archer, who is the Commander for the NPA, said: "We know anti-social behaviour and drug use is concerning for residents who live in this community which is why we are taking these reports seriously and taking the relevant action.

"This is the second order we have successfully been granted for this particular area which confirms our ongoing commitment to tackling this issue.

"I am pleased that the order have been granted and I hope this gives some reassurance to those who live in the surrounding area as well as those who visit and work there."
