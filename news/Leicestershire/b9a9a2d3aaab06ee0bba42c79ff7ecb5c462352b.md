He was wearing a black hooded jacket, black trousers and a black face mask, he was carrying a black backpack and riding a silver BMX style bicycle.

DC Mona Saad is investigating the incident, she said: "This incident happened during the early evening on a busy residential street where a number of people were either walking or driving by at the time. The suspect also made his way onto the (A6) Abbey Lane again this is a busy road, where people would have been walking or driving by at the time."

"I would like to hear from anyone who was in the area and saw a man matching the description of the suspect."

Do you have dash cam footage that may have captured this incident or the suspect? Were you approached by similar described suspects near Tollemache Avenue, Sudeley Avenue or Abbey Lane? If you can help in any way we would like to speak to you."
