Officers are appealing for information after a report of an act of outraging public decency in Groby.

It was reported that around 3.30pm on Thursday 11 March a man was seen masturbating underneath his clothing near to Brookvale School on Ratby Road.

The man is described as white, aged between 60 and 70, around 5'2, with a slim build and grey medium-length hair. He was wearing a beige-coloured lightweight waterproof jacket and trousers of the same colour.

Inspector Jamie Osbourne said: "This is a concerning report but the man was only seen by one adult and we are carrying out investigations to identify him.

"We would like to speak to anyone else who may have seen a man matching this description in the area.

"The man was seen in the middle of the afternoon when many people are likely to have been out and about and we urge anyone who could help identify him to get in touch."

Anyone with information should call 101 quoting reference 21*138761.
