A man who stole a television and kettle from student accommodation has today (Monday 17 June) been jailed.

Tommy Briercliffe, 24, pleaded guilty to one count of burglary when he appeared at Leicester Magistrates' Court.

Briercliffe, of no fixed address, was arrested by police in Mountsorrel yesterday, having committed the crime at accommodation in Kingfisher Way, Loughborough, on Thursday (13 June).

A number of parcels that had been left for students were also taken from the property.

Briercliffe was sentenced to 18 weeks in prison for the burglary and was also sentenced to five weeks consecutively for one count of assault by beating relating to an offence on 8 May.

He was also sentenced to two weeks, consecutively, for failing to appear at court on 12 June. He will serve a total sentence of 25 weeks.

Detective Constable Steve Reed, the investigating officer, said: "Briercliffe was located in Mountsorrel yesterday morning. Thanks to help from both local and regional officers, as well as the National Police Air Service, he was arrested and remanded in custody.

"I hope the fact that he has been sentenced so soon after committing his latest crime will provide reassurance to people in and around Charnwood of the work the force is doing to tackle offenders."
