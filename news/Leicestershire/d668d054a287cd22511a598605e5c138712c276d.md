This afternoon (Tuesday), members of the Leicestershire Local Resilience Forum met.

Representatives from the force, local authorities, public health and the NHS declared a major incident in the response to the national health crisis we are facing with COVID-19.

All the public services will continue to work together to support the work being done to stop the spread of the virus.

Deputy Chief Constable Rob Nixon has taken over as the chair of the Strategic Coordinating Group. He said: "We are all one team working together across Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland.

"All the emergency services, the NHS and the local authorities need your help to stop the spread of the virus - stay at home, save lives, protect the NHS."
