Officers in Market Harborough have provided an update following a spate of damage to Christmas decorations, garden items and vehicles in the town earlier this month.

Thanks to information provided by the local community, a 20-year-old woman and 16-year-old boy were identified and visited by officers from the Harborough and Wigston Neighbourhood Policing Area (NPA).

Both admitted their actions and apologised for the damage caused.

They have been dealt with by way of community resolution and a letter of apology has been sent to all victims concerned and costs have been paid accordingly.

Sergeant Darren Richardson, deputy NPA commander, said: "I would like to thank everyone who came forward and provided us with information that has allowed the issue to be resolved.

"Both people we spoke to showed remorse for their actions and a decision was made to offer a community resolution. We have spoken to those whose possessions were damaged and they are satisfied with this outcome."
