Detectives are investigating the attempted theft of a cash machine from a shop in Coalville.

At around 2.45am today (Friday), police received a report that a vehicle had driven into the shutters of a shop in Cropston Drive.

A chain had been tied around a free-standing ATM inside the shop and an attempt was made by the vehicle to try and remove it.

However, the ATM was not taken and the vehicle - a Ford Ranger pickup - left the scene.

Enquiries into the incident are ongoing and no arrests have been made at this time.

Detective Constable James Collins, the investigating officer, said: "Although this happened in the early hours of the morning, I would like to speak to anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious in Cropston Drive.

"Likewise, if you saw a Ford Ranger pickup in the surrounding area at the time of this incident, please get in touch. Any information you have could help with my investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to call 101, quoting incident 36 of 10 April.
