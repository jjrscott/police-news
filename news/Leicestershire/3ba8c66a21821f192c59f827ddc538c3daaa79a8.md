A man is due in court charged with attempt murder and Section 18 grievous bodily harm following an assault in Leicester last year.

Mark McIntosh, 42, of no fixed address, has been remanded to appear at Leicester Magistrates' Court today (15 August).

The charges relate to an incident in January 2018 when two people, a 23-year-old man and an 18 year-old woman, were assaulted at an address in Leicester.
