Detectives investigating a fatal collision on the A447 near Stapleton are appealing for a motorcyclist who may have been in the area at the time to come forward.

Officers were called to the incident between Stapleton and Dobbies Woodlands Garden Centre at 1.23pm on Saturday (24 August).

The collision involved a blue Suzuki motorcycle and a grey Ford Ranger car. The car was travelling towards the garden centre and the Suzuki motorcycle was travelling in the opposite direction when they were involved in the collision.

The motorcyclist, a man in his 30s, died at the scene. No-one else was injured in the incident.

Detective Constable Louise McMahon said: "Following enquiries in the local area and after speaking to witnesses, it's believed there may have been a second motorcyclist who may have witnessed the collision. The rider was on a black KTM Super Duke R 2018 motorbike and was riding behind the Suzuki.

"We would urge the rider to get in touch as they may be able to help us with our enquiries.

"Also if you were in the area at the time and saw the collision, or either of the vehicles beforehand, and have not yet spoken to us, I urge you to make contact.

"Anyone who has any dashcam footage from the area at the time should also check this and get in touch if you believe you can help us."

Anyone with any information should contact 101 quoting incident 370 of 24 August.
