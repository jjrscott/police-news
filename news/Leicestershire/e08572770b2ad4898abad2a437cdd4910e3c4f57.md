Officers from the West Leicester CID are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a man was attacked in a city park yesterday afternoon (Thursday 18 February).

Between 3.30pm and 4.15pm, the victim - a man in his 20s - was walking in The Rally close to the BMX track when he was approached by three men. An argument then occurred, before the group attacked him, striking him with a bladed weapon.

The victim chased the suspects, who left the park at the Tudor Road entrance. He was taken to hospital to be treated for serious cuts to his hand and arm. His injuries are described as life-changing.

Two of the men were white, wearing black hooded tops. The third man was black and was riding a pushbike.

PC James Brennan, the investigating officer, said: "I would like to speak to anyone who was walking through The Rally yesterday afternoon and saw what happened.

"This happened at a time when people may have been making their way home from school or work or were out walking their dog. I believe there are people who witnessed this incident - or saw the group leave the park - but have not yet come forward.

"Any information you have, no matter how insignificant you think it may be, could help our investigation."
