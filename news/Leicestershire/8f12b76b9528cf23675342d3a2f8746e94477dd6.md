Officers have released images of jewellery they have recovered and wish to reunite with its owner.

Jewellery they believe to be stolen was recovered from the Bagworth area on Wednesday 9 December.

The items include a number of bracelets, rings, necklaces and brooches.

They were stored in a distinctive pillowcase.

A 20-year-old man from Coalville, a 19-year-old man from Cheshire and a 16-year-old boy from Leicester were arrested on suspicion of burglary and released on bail pending further enquires.

PC Lara Gerrard said: "We are continuing investigations to establish the full circumstances of this incident.

"We would like to speak to anyone who recognises this jewellery or the pillowcase."
