Updated News Post

A man who died in a collision in Leicester on Sunday 17 January has been named as 28-year-old Pavandeep Singh from Leicester.

The incident happened in Coleman Road, close to the junction with Avonside Drive, at around 11.30pm when a dark-coloured Seat Leon collided with a tree.

Mr Singh, who was known as Sunny, was a passenger in the car. He died at the scene of the collision.

Two other men were taken to the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham. A man in his 30s is being treated for life-threatening injuries, while a man in his 20s remains in a serious but stable condition.

Coleman Road was closed at its junctions with Broad Avenue and The Langfield, as well as at the junction with Avonside Drive, while officers carried out enquiries. The road was reopened around 8.35am on Monday 18 January.

Enquiries are continuing into the incident and detectives continue to appeal for information.

Detective Sergeant Paul Hawkins, from the Serious Collision Investigation Unit (SCIU), said: "Our enquiries are continuing to establish the full circumstances of the collision and I'd like to speak to anyone who saw a dark-coloured Seat Leon travelling around Evington late on Sunday night.

"I'd ask anyone who saw it prior to the collision - or who saw the collision occur - to come forward. I am also keen to speak to any motorists with a dashcam installed in their vehicle or, given it happened in a residential area, anyone with CCTV at their address.

"Any information, no matter how insignificant you think it is, could help our investigation."
