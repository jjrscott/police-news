Detectives are appealing for information following a fire at business premises in Leicester.

Officers were called to Great Central Street, off Vaughan Way, at around 11.30pm yesterday (Tuesday 29 December).

The fire had spread to neighbouring properties, causing some damage. However those living nearby were evacuated and no-one was injured.

This morning, enquiries are continuing in partnership with Leicestershire Fire and Rescue service to establish the cause of the fire. No arrests have been made.

Detective Inspector Mark Parish, from the force's Complex Investigation Team (CIT), said: "The location of the building where the fire occurred is very close to Vaughan Way - a main route through the city.

"I'd like to speak to anyone who was in Great Central Street or the surrounding area last night and who saw anyone acting in a manner that seemed unusual or suspicious. This includes anyone driving through the area with a dashcam in their vehicle.

"Any information you have could help us."
