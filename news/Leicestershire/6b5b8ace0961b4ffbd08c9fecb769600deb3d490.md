Detectives investigating a report of assault in Barrow upon Soar are appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident to come forward.

It happened in South Street at around 2.45pm on Thursday 21 January.

The victim, a man in his 50s, was riding a metal scooter on the pavement, when he was assaulted by a man who then used the scooter as a weapon. As a result, the victim suffered a broken arm during the incident.

An investigation began and earlier this month, a 42-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm with intent but later released under investigation.

Detective Constable Maggie Langton, from Charnwood CID, said: "I would like to speak to anyone who saw what happened that afternoon.

"The victim was going to collect a child from school and I believe there will have been other people in the area doing similar and who will have witnessed the incident. Please cast your mind back.

"I would also like to speak to anyone who may have captured the incident on a dashcam. Any information you can provide could help my investigation"
