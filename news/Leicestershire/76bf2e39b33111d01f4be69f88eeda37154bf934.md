A teenager who attacked a man in the street with a hammer and a machete has been jailed after pleading guilty.

Lewis Hackett, 19, of Thurlington Road, Leicester, appeared at Leicester Crown Court last month and admitted Section 18 wounding and two counts of a possession of an offensive weapon in a public place.

The conviction relates to an incident on Thursday 20 June in Herle Avenue, Leicester, when Hackett ran towards the 36-year-old victim and attacked him with a hammer and machete.

Yesterday (Monday 7 October) he was sentenced to three years and nine months for the incident on 20 June. He was also sentenced for two counts of threatening another with a bladed article or weapon - this was an unrelated incident on 2 January in Thurlington Road.

During the incident in Herle Avenue the victim sustained injuries to his head, bruising and cuts to his arms and hands when he tried to defend himself.

PC Hughes was the investigating officer, she said: "This wasn't a random attack on a stranger, Hackett came armed with weapons and intended to cause serious harm.

"Luckily the victim sustained relatively minor injuries during the attack, but he feared for his life and thought he was going to be killed.

"We are pleased Hackett has admitted to the offences and spared the victim the ordeal of giving evidence in court.

"We hope this plea reassures the victim and the wider local community that the defendant has been dealt with and will now face a term in prison."
