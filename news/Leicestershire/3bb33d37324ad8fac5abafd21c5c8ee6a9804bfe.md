Updated News Post

The family of the 10-year-old boy who was attacked in Belper Street, Leicester, by Carlos Racitalal have released the following statement:

"Seeing our young child being attacked on that horrific day was like living a nightmare for us. It is something which no-one should ever have to go through.

"We have watched our boy suffering unimaginable pain and the events of that day still remain with us now and still scare us. We still have sleepless nights from it.

"Life will simply never be the same for us. We do not wish for anyone to ever go through what we have been through since that day.

"All of the attacks which were carried out by the defendant were terrible and horrific for all the victims involved and for their families.

"We just wish and pray that they had not happened to anyone and our prayers remain with all of those who have been affected.

"We would like to thank everyone who helped us on the day of the incident and during the investigation since including Leicestershire Police, East Midlands Ambulance Service and the Crown Prosecution Service."

The family of the man in his 70s who was attacked in Dean Road, Leicester, by Carlos Racitalal have released the following statement:

"We would like to say a big thank you to the prosecuting team and to everyone else involved in the case. We also thank the jury for reaching the right verdict.

"No sentence will ever be long enough for this calculating, evil man but at least our dad, and the rest of the families affected by these brutal attacks, now have some form of justice.

"Carlos Racitalal has shown no remorse at all for his vicious crimes and we are now safer knowing that this dangerous man is locked up."
