Updated News Post

A cyclist who was injured in a collision in Desford earlier this week has died in hospital.

Shortly after 9.50am on Wednesday 3 February, police were called to High Street following a report of a collision involving a cyclist and a grey Peugeot Boxer van.

The cyclist - a 69-year-old woman - was taken to hospital in Coventry where she passed away yesterday afternoon (4 February).

A 46-year-old man from Market Bosworth who was arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and driving while unfit through drugs has been released under investigation.

A stretch of High Street was closed to traffic while officers carried out further enquiries and has since been reopened.

Detective Constable Kasie Carter, from force's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "This collision happened close to High Street's junction with Main Street which is the major route through the village.

"I would like to continue to appeal to anyone who was in the area on Wednesday morning and saw what happened - or anyone who was travelling in the area and has a dashcam installed in their vehicle - to get in touch.

"Our efforts to establish the circumstances of what happened are very much continuing so if you have any information, no matter how insignificant you think it may be, please contact us as it could help our investigation."
