Police are appealing for witnesses to a collision in Humberstone Gate on Friday (3 May).

Officers were called to the scene at 5pm on Friday after the ambulance service reported their attendance at a collision involving a pedestrian and a bus.

They attended the incident, which happened between Yeoman Street and Vestry Street, and a woman in her 70s was taken to Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre for treatment. She remains in hospital where her condition is described as critical but stable.

No one else was injured in the incident.

One lane of Humberstone Gate was closed from Rutland Street to Charles Street to allow for a thorough investigation of the scene. The road reopened later that evening.

Detective Constable John Borlase, from the Serious Collision Investigation Unit, is the investigating officer, he said: "Enquiries are continuing into the exact circumstances surrounding this incident and I would like to appeal to anyone who was in the area and saw either the pedestrian or the collision itself.

"If you have not yet spoken to police I would urge you to get in touch."

If you have any information about the incident, call 101 and quote incident 431 of 3 May.
