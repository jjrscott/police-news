Officers investigating a report of assault in the early hours of Friday morning (13 November) are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

It happened in Glen Street, in the Belgrave area of Leicester, at around 1am.

The victim, a man in his 20s, told police he had been walking in the street when he was confronted by another man, who then struck him in the face with a blunt instrument.

The victim ran off towards Shaftesbury Avenue where he called to request an ambulance.

A 47-year-old man was arrested in connection with the incident and has since been released on bail.

PC Yas Sardoiwala, the investigating officer, said: "From enquiries carried out to date, I believe there were other people in the area at the time who may have seen what happened.

"I'm keen to speak to anyone who was either travelling on foot, or any motorists who were driving through a busy part of the city. I'd particularly like to speak to anyone with a dashcam installed in their vehicle.

"Any information you have could help my investigation."
