Police are appealing for witnesses to a road traffic collision in Loughborough involving a bus and a coach.

Officers were called just after 5.30pm yesterday (27 April) to a report of collision involving an Arriva double decker bus and a white single deck coach on the A512 Ashby Road.

The ambulance service were in attendance and the driver of the bus was taken to the Queens Medical Centre in Nottingham where he remains with serious injuries.

A passenger on the bus sustained minor injuries.

The coach driver was not injured and there were no passengers travelling on the coach.

At the time of the collision the bus was travelling along old Ashby Road onto the A512 while the coach was travelling on the A512 towards Loughborough.

The road was closed while emergency services responded at the scene and has since been reopened.

Detective Constable Alison Briance, the investigating officer, is appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the collision and hasn't as yet spoken to police or anyone who may have seen the vehicles prior to the collision to get in touch.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101 quoting incident 474 of 27 April.
