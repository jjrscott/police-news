Incident number: 392 of 20 April

Witnesses to a serious collision in which a motorcyclist was injured are being asked to contact police.

It happened in Wakerley Road, Evington, at the junction with Ethel Road, at around 3.50pm yesterday (Saturday 20 April).

A solver Honda CBR 600F motorcycle was in collision with a dark blue Mercedes C220d. The motorcycle was travelling from the direction of the General Hospital and the car was travelling in the opposite direction.

The motorcyclist, a man in his 30s, was taken to the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham. His condition is critical but stable.

Detective Constable Seamus Burns, from Leicestershire Police's Serious Collision Investigation Unit (SCIU), said: "I would like to speak to anyone who witnessed the collision and has not yet contacted police.

"It was a clear afternoon and it's likely there will have been a lot of cars on the road. Did you see the collision take place, or did you see either of these vehicles prior to it occurring?

"If you have a dashcam fitted, please check for any footage that may have been recorded. Any information you have could help with my investigation."

Call 101, quoting incident 392 of 20 April.
