A 40-year-old man has today (Wednesday 21 October) been found guilty of raping a teenage girl in Leicester.

Deano Churchill-Richards committed the offence at his flat in Wreford Crescent on the night of Monday 20 April this year.

Having met the victim - aged just 13 - at a park, he gave her alcohol and provided her with a canister containing a psychoactive substance. After a while, Churchill-Richards called for a taxi and together they went back to his flat where they continued drinking before he carried out his attack.

When the victim tried to leave the flat, he tried to stop her but she was able to make good her escape.

The victim was approached in the street by a member of the public who contacted police and Churchill-Richards was arrested at his home address.

Following trial at Leicester Crown Court, he was convicted of:

 * Two counts of rape - both relating to one victim
 * Two counts of supplying a psychoactive substance - relating to the victim and another girl

Detective Constable Chris Perry, from Leicestershire Police's Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) team, was the officer in the case. He said: "Churchill-Richards has committed a horrific crime in which he took advantage of a young girl for his own sexual gratification.

"He knew what he was doing - he provided her with drink and drugs in order to ensure that he was able to carry out such a wicked act.

"It's difficult to put into words just how serious these offences are and the impact it has had - and will continue to have - on his victim.

"I hope she can take some relief from the fact he has been brought to justice and is now facing a custodial sentence."

Churchill-Richards will be sentenced at Leicester Crown Court on Monday 9 November.

 * Churchill-Richards was found not guilty of two counts of rape relating to a second girl, two counts of false imprisonment and one count of threatening to destroy or damage property
 * Leicestershire Police works closely with partner organisations to raise awareness of and tackle incidents of Child Sexual Abuse
