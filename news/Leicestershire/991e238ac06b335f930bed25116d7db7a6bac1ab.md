Officers investigating an attempted robbery in Loughborough yesterday (Tuesday 11 June) are urging anyone who witnessed the incident to come forward.

The 30-year-old victim was driving home in his white Ford Fiesta Zetec when another vehicle overtook him and then turned around blocking his way.

Two people got into the victim's vehicle and threatened him with a knife before slashing him on the back of the head.

The suspects got out of the vehicle and the victim then tried to drive off but in doing so his vehicle overturned on Benscliffe Drive.

The victim managed to get out of his vehicle and run off. The suspects chased him briefly and hit the victim on the back of the head with an object. They then made off in a grey or dark Vauxhall Astra.

Nothing was stolen during the incident and the victim was treated in hospital for injuries to his head. He has since been discharged.

Detective Constable Alex Paterson is investigating the incident, she said: "The incident took place around 12.45am, the noise of the collision and subsequently the assault shortly afterwards resulted in a number of local residents being woken up.

"We are in the process of speaking to potential witnesses and trawling through CCTV from the local area.

"If you witnessed any part of the incident and not yet spoken to the police or have any information about the circumstances leading up to it we would encourage you to come forward."

Anyone with any information is asked to contact DC 7 Paterson on 101, quoting crime number 19*299314.
