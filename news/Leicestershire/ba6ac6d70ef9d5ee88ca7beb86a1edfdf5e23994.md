Incident number: 139 of 31 March

A motorcyclist who died following a collision on Melton Road, Lowesby, has been named by police.

John Thorogood was taken to hospital following the collision on the B6047 at 9.43am on Sunday 31 March which involved a black BMW R9 motorcycle and a white VW Transporter campervan. He died later the same day.

Today, Mr Thorogood's family paid tribute to him.

They said: "You will be sorely missed. Nature is full of patterns which repeat through scales - from the very big to the very small, from atoms, through planets, up to galaxies and beyond we see the largest influence in the centre, holding the structure together. Families are no different. You held us all together, despite all and everything our tempestuous natures threw your way - throughout all the wind, rain and sunshine you remained a solid and steadfast rock of sensibility and integrity.

"Things will never be the same without you, for so many people, as your personality and warmth spread to all those around you - professionally and personally - the echoes of your character and actions will ring out for years to come in the hearts and minds of all those you touched throughout your time here. The full scope of your unexpected, untimely and frankly unbelievable departure will take a long time to set in, as the feeling you'll be home soon persists for everyone here. You will remain forever in our hearts."

Enquiries are continuing into the incident and officers are continuing to appeal for witnesses to the collision.

The motorcycle was travelling towards Twyford and the campervan was travelling in the opposite direction at the time of the incident.

Detective Constable Seamus Burns said: "We are continuing to appeal to speak to anyone who has any information in relation to the incident. Did you witness the collision? Did you see either of the vehicles prior to the collision?

"If you have any dashcam footage from the area at the time, we also urge you to check this and make contact as you could help with the investigation."

Anyone with any information is asked to contact DC 1504 Seamus Burns on 101, quoting incident 139 of 31 March.
