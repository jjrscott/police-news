The family of a man who died after being stabbed in Braunstone Gate have paid tribute to "a loving son and brother".

Abubakar Abbas, 22, was stabbed in the early hours of Sunday (23 August). He was taken to hospital in Coventry, but died as a result of his injuries on Tuesday.

Mr Abbas's family have said he was a loving son and brother who will be sorely missed by everyone who knew him.

_**Abubakar Abbas**_

His brother said: "Abubakar was a kind-hearted person, who always wanted the best for people. I really hope that this incident serves as a reminder to those who carry weapons and take innocent lives that this is how much pain it causes families - a pain that words cannot describe.

"This is clearly a big lesson that to death, age is nothing but a number and could come to us at any moment.

"Ask yourselves, what good deeds have you left behind?"

They have asked that their privacy is respected at this time.
