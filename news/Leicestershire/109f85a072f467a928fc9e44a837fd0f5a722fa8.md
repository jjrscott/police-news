A 25-year-old man has been charged with a number of drugs offences following his arrest last week as part of Operation Hatch.

Zayd Bobat, of Abbey Lane, Leicester, was arrested on Thursday 7 May following the execution of a warrant.

Bobat was charged with two counts of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply and two counts of conspiracy to supply class A drugs.

He has been released on police bail, pending his first court appearance at Leicester Magistrates' Court on a date yet to be set.
