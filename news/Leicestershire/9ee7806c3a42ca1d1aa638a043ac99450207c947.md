Police are re-appealing for witnesses and dash cam footage following a fatal road collision in Toll Bar, Little Casterton.

Officers were called to a collision involving a black Skoda Kodiaq car and a silver Kawasaki motorbike just after 10am on Sunday 2 June.

"If there is anyone was in the area at the time of the collision and saw either vehicle prior to the incident or the incident itself and has not yet spoken to police, please make contact.

"Similarly if you have any dash cam footage that might help with our investigation please come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to call 101, quoting incident 249 of 2 June.
