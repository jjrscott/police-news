A 48-year-old man who sexually assaulted a girl when she was just 15 has today (Friday 23 October) been jailed for his crimes.

Following a trial at Leicester Crown Court a jury convicted Wayne Haywood - of Lime Avenue in Groby - with three counts of sexual assault on a female and two counts of assaulting a female over 13 by penetration.

He was sentenced to eight years imprisonment and placed on the sex offenders register for life. He is also subject to a Sexual Harm Prevention Order (SHPO).

The victim, who is now an adult, reported the abuse in June 2018, informing officers that it had started around a year earlier.

She told detectives that Haywood had repeatedly touched her inappropriately at an address in Coalville and also kissed her on a number of occasions. She also said that the abuse had happened when they were both alone and that Haywood had ignored her pleas to stop.

Detective Constable Sandra Kelly, from the force's Child Abuse Investigation Unit (CAIU) was the investigating officer. She said: "Haywood denied committing the offences for which he's now been convicted and jailed.

"The fact he could not admit what he had done - meaning the victim had to give evidence to a jury - shows he has little or no remorse for the harm he has caused.

"I am pleased he's been convicted of his crimes and hope the young victim in this case can take some relief from the fact he's finally been brought to justice and is now serving a significant custodial sentence."
