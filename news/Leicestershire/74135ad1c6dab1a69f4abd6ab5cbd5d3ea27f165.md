Detectives investigating a report of burglary in Langham in which an air rifle was stolen are appealing for public help.

It happened at an address in Cold Overton Road between 2.15pm and 4.30pm on Friday 11 September.

During the incident photographic equipment - including a camera bag containing two Canon lenses and silver and black Sony Dictaphone - were taken.

A number of necklaces, earrings and rings were also stolen, along with the BSA Airsporter .22 air rifle.

Detective Constable Sam Bates, from Melton CID, said: "Were you in Cold Overton Road on Friday afternoon? Did you see anyone acting in an unusual manner or a way that aroused suspicion?

"From enquiries carried out to date, I believe both a grey Mercedes Sprinter van and silver Volvo could have been in the area - and these vehicles are of interest.

"Did you see either of those or hear or see anything that caught your attention?

"Likewise, have you seen or been offered items such as those taken for sale? Any information you have could help my investigation."

Call 101, quoting reference 20*477473.
