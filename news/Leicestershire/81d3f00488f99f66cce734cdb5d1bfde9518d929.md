A 19-year-old man has been charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent and possession of an offensive weapon following a stabbing in Braunstone Frith on Wednesday 25 November.

The charge relates to an incident at the junction of Elsworthy Walk and Cuffling Drive.

Keagan Costello, of Compass Road, Leicester, is due to appear at Leicester Magistrates' Court today (Tuesday 15 December).

A second man, Callum Beane, 19, of Kelbrook Close, Leicester, was charged earlier this month with causing grievous bodily harm and appeared at the same court on Friday 4 December.
