Updated News Post

Police are continuing to appeal for information following a serious stabbing in Loughborough.

Officers were called at around 4.45pm yesterday (1 January) to a report of a stabbing outside a flat in Cordell Road.

The injured man remains in hospital in a stable condition.

A cordon currently remains in place at the scene while further enquiries are carried out.

We are continuing to appeal for anyone who may have information about what happened to contact police.

We are treated this as an isolated incident and it's important we build a complete picture of the events leading up to this man being injured and establish exactly what happened.

We would therefore urge anyone who has any information about this assault to get in touch. Maybe you saw someone or a group of people leave the flat in a hurry and can provide a description of them or the direction they went? Or perhaps you suspect who may be responsible?

Any information you have could assist our investigation, especially at this early stage, so please don't hesitate to get in touch.

Anyone with information can contact on police on 101 or by visiting https://www.leics.police.uk/ro/report/ocr/af/how-to-report-a-crime/ and quoting incident 532 of 1 January. Alternatively you can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
