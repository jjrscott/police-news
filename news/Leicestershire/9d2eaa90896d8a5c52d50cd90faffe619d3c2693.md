Leicestershire Police is continuing to appeal for people to surrender illegal firearms as the national campaign enters its second week.

During the first week, there has been 210 rounds of ammunition, 15 guns of various forms including Air Rifles, Air Pistols and Shotguns, a CS Spray and an imitation gun.

The surrender (Saturday 20 July - Sunday 4 August 2019) gives members of the public the opportunity to safely dispose of unwanted firearms and ammunition, as well as stun guns, Tasers and CS spray at a safe location where it is then taken for disposal.

The campaign is being co-ordinated by the National Ballistics Intelligence Service (NABIS) with many other forces across the UK taking part.

Detective Inspector Helena Bhakta said: "Handing in guns, ammunition, CS spray & Tasers will make the streets of Leicestershire a safer place. I urge people to take this opportunity to safely surrender these items to the police.

"This will prevent these items falling into the wrong hands. Ask yourself how you would feel if a weapon that you possessed was used to injure or kill another.

"Communities should be reassured that we will continue to vigorously investigate offences linked to any firearm they receive to combat gun crime."

Firearms can be surrendered at the following designated police stations and local offices across Leicestershire:

Mansfield House Police Station, Leicester

Keyham Lane Police Station, Leicester

Market Harborough Police Station, Market Harborough

Melton Mowbray Police Station, Melton Mowbray

Braunstone Police Station, Leicester

Hinckley Police Station, Leicester

Wigston Police Station, Leicester

Beaumont Leys Police Station, Leicester

Illegal possession of a firearm can mean five years behind bars and if you are found guilty of possession with intent to supply that can lead to a life sentence.

If you know of anyone involved with illegal firearms call police on 101 or Crimestoppers (anonymously) on 0800 555 111. If you are a licensed firearm holder who wants advice please contact Leicestershire Police on 101.
