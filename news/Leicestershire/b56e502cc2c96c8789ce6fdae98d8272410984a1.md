Officers are appealing for witnesses after two people were reported to have used language deemed to be racially-aggravated at a store in Aberdale Road, Leicester.

Officers were called to the store at 6pm on Sunday 6 December after a man and a woman had reported that they had tried to enter the store and had challenged a man who they said was blocking the entrance.

It was reported that the man in the doorway then used racially aggravated language towards the man before getting into the passenger seat of a car that was driven away.

The man and woman then entered the store and reported that another man in the store began discussing the incident and then allegedly also used racially-aggravated language towards the woman.

Police Constable Adam King of Leicestershire Police is keen to speak to anyone who may have witnessed the incident or seen any of the people involved.

He said: "We are investigating this incident to establish the full circumstances and are appealing to anyone who was in the area at this time, and who has any information, to make contact."

Anyone with any information should contact PC King at Euston Street Police Station or by calling 101 and quoting incident 20*644826.
