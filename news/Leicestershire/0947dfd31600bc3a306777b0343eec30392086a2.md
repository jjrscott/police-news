Leicestershire Police is encouraging residents to celebrate VE Day this Friday - from the safety of your own homes and gardens.

Friday marks the 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day and officers and staff across force will be joining in with residents across Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland to remember and reflect.

This will include a special video released on our social media channels on Thursday followed by a number of videos posted on Friday including the flag being raised at force headquarters and a two-minute silence being held at 11am. This will all be done while following current Government guidelines.

Residents are invited to join in with these events through our social media channels as part of your own celebrations.

Superintendent Adam Slonecki said: "It is extremely important that we mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day together. It is a time for us to reflect and to remember the sacrifices which men and women made for us and to protect us.

"Unfortunately, at this time, we cannot celebrate in ways which we may have originally planned. While we still want you to celebrate this Friday and to remember and reflect, we also want to make sure that you are keeping yourselves and your families safe too. In light of the current Government guidelines, it is extremely important that you therefore celebrate in your own homes and gardens.

"We ourselves, at force, will be marking the anniversary in a number of ways this week, and you are invited to join us in this through our social media channels. Details of these channels can be found at the end of this release.

"Once again we thank you for continuing to work with us during this time. Please know we continue to be here to help you, to keep you safe and to take action when it is required.

"We hope you all enjoy your celebrations this bank holiday weekend while, of course, in the safety of your own homes and gardens."
