Updated News Post

Detectives are appealing for information following a robbery at a premises in Saffron Lane on Thursday (1 August).

A man was reported to have entered the shop, which is near to the junction of Shakespeare Street, at around 12.40pm where he demanded money. He was in possession of what is believed to be a firearm at the time.

The man, who is described as black and was wearing dark clothing with his face covered, ran out of the shop empty-handed when the smoke cloaking device was activated.

No-one was injured in the incident and nothing was stolen.

Enquiries into the circumstances surrounding the incident are in the early stages and officers are appealing to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time and who may have any information to make contact.

This includes a taxi driver who stopped to speak to the shopkeeper at the premises around the time of the incident.

Detective Inspector Tim Lindley said: "Please think back to if you were in the area at the time. Did you see the incident or the man described? Did you speak to anyone in the area at this time?

"I am particularly keen to speak to the taxi driver mentioned as I believe he can help our enquiries.

"Anyone with any CCTV or dashcam footage from the area is also urged to check this and make contact with us."

A 68-year-old man arrested in connection with the incident today (Friday) has since been released from custody with no further action.

If you have any information, call 101 quoting incident 258 of 1 August.
