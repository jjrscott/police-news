Three men and one woman have been sentenced for a total of 12 drug offences.

As part of Operation Lionheart, the four defendants all appeared at Leicester Crown Court this week for their part in the sale and distribution of class A drugs in Loughborough.

Dean Laing, 42, of Trackside Close, Loughborough, appeared on Monday (2 September) and was given a 16 month prison sentence, suspended for two years. He was also given a three month curfew between the hours of 8pm and 6am.

Laing had previously pleaded guilty to two offences - one count of supplying class A drugs and one count of being concerned in the supply of class A drugs. Both offences occurred in May 2018.

Victoria Martin, 40, of Braddon Road, Loughborough, appeared on Tuesday (3 September) for four counts of supplying class A drugs on 15 and 17 October 2018.

She was sentenced to a 12 month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to complete a nine month drug rehabilitation programme.

Jordan Raybone, of Victoria Street, Loughborough, appeared on Thursday (5 September) and was given a two year prison sentence, suspended for two years, after admitting to selling cocaine and heroin on 13 and 15 August 2018.

The 22-year-old also pleaded guilty to one count of possession with intent to supply a class B drug which he was found with on 17 April 2019 - the day he was arrested.

John Moon, 48, of Pinfold Gate, Loughborough appeared today (6 September) and was given a 12 month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, for one count of supplying a class A drug.

The count relates to the sale of heroin in Loughborough on 26 October which he had pleaded to at a previous court appearance.
