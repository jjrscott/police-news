A man who abused a young girl between 1994 and 2000 has today (Monday) been jailed.

David Neale, 63, was sentenced to eight years and six months at Leicester Crown Court.

On 10 May, following a trial at the same court, Neale, of Overpark Avenue, Braunstone, was convicted of seven counts of indecent assault on a girl under the age of 14 and two counts of indecency with a child.

He was found not guilty of one further count of indecent assault.

Detective Constable Anna Blockley, from Leicestershire Police's Child Abuse Investigation Unit (CAIU), was the investigating officer.

She said: "I hope that the victim in this case can take some comfort from the fact that Neale has today been sentenced for his crimes.

"He is now serving a significant custodial sentence where I hope he can take some time to consider the impact his horrific crimes have had on her."
