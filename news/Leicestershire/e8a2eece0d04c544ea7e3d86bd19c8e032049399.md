Officers investigating an incident whereby a shop worker was tripped up have released an image of a man they would like to speak to.

It happened at a shop in Granby Street, in Leicester city centre, on Saturday 8 August.

The member of staff, a woman, fell and suffered a dislocated elbow as a result. The incident is being treated as an assault.

The victim had to stay off work for a number of weeks as a result of the injury she suffered.

We would like to speak to the man pictured as we believe he has information that could help with my investigation.

Is that person you? Do you recognise him or know who he is? If so, then please get in touch.

Call 101, quoting reference 20*410952.
