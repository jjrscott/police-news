Mohammed Jibreel's family have today paid the following tribute to him following two men being convicted of his murder:

"Mohammed was just 21-years-old when his life and his whole future was taken away from him and from us.

_**Mohammed Jibreel**_

"He was a person who was loved by everyone and who endeavoured to do well in everything. He was an energetic person who loved his family. He always understood his younger brothers and what they needed and would always be there to help them.

"He also enjoyed his studies and loved his football.

"Our lives will never be the same again since that fateful day when we learnt we had lost our beloved Mohammed because of the brutal and selfish actions of others. He will be missed so much by all of his family.

_**Mohammed "loved his football"**_

"We would like to thank everyone who has supported us as a family during this difficult, heartbreaking and horrendous time and to all those who have helped to bring the people responsible for his death to justice.

"Mohammed brought so much joy to us during his short life and we will always remember the happier times with him. We will never forget him.

"We all pray for almighty God Allah to bless his soul, forgive him, grant him a place in paradise."
