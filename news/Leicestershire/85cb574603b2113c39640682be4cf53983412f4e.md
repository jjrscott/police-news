Leicestershire Police and the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner are hosting events for local charities to help them from becoming victims of cyber-crime and fraud.

The one day events are being run twice and are free of charge to attend, they are taking place on Tuesday 28 January and Thursday 6 February and will be held at Force Headquarters.

The focus of the events is to provide information on preventing cyber criminals from accessing systems and potentially disrupting organisations.

Areas that will be covered include:

 * Current risks faced by charities in a digital environment
 * How cyber criminals operate
 * How to be cyber aware
 * Ways to protect yourself and your workplace from potential cyber attacks
 * The importance of incident management

Samantha Hancock, the force's Cyber Protect Officer, said: "We're running these events with a specific focus on charities as a way to thank them for all of the hard work they do within our communities.

"It's easy to assume that charities won't get hit or that they're 'too nice' to be targeted by cyber criminals, but not many of us know just how easy it is for a fraudulent email with an attached invoice to get through the system, how important it is to be truly data secure, and how damaging it is to find your email system or website unexpectedly offline.

"We hope that as many charities as possible will be able to join us which is why we're running the event twice. If you have any queries please do not hesitate to contact me on _samantha.hancock@leicestershire.pnn.police.uk_."
