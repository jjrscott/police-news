Officers investigating a racist incident at the King Power Stadium in October last year have released an image of a man they wish to identify and trace.

Racist comments were made towards home fans at the Leicester City v West Ham United match during the evening of Saturday 27 October, 2018.

Extensive enquiries have been carried out to identify the man in the image and officers are now asking the public for their assistance.

Anyone who recognises the man in the image or has any suspicions about who he may be is asked to contact DC 1149 Jack Thomas on 101, quoting crime number 18*520698.
