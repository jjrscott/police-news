A city man who sexually abused a teenage girl has been jailed.

Robert Moseley was sentenced to two-and-a-half years when he appeared at Leicester Crown Court on Friday (17 May).

He is also subject to a 10-year sexual harm prevention order.

Moseley, 55, of Bowhill Grove, began abusing his victim when she was 13 years old, carrying on until she was 16. On 10 May he was found guilty of two counts of sexual assault following a trial at the same court.

The offences occurred between 2009 and 2013.

Moseley's victim contacted police in April 2017 and in interview told officers that in addition to being sexually abused, Moseley was both aggressive and controlling in his behaviour.

Detective Constable Tom Haines, the investigating officer, said: "This abuse had a profound impact on Moseley's victim. Despite trying to put it behind her, it became too much and she contacted police.

"Moseley committed his horrific abuse when both he and his victim were alone. He was challenged about it before it was reported to police but denied that anything had happened."

"But because of the bravery of the victim in this case - providing police with a very detailed account - he has been brought to justice."

Moseley was found not guilty of two counts of indecent assault.

No verdict was reached on five counts of sexual assault and these indictments will lie on file. No verdict was reached on two counts of indecent assault.
