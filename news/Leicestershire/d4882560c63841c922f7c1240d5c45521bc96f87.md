A Nottingham man detained for selling drugs as part of a Loughborough county line has been jailed for more than two years.

Tarell Comrie-Patterson, pictured, admitted selling cocaine and heroin after deals were arranged through a dedicated phone line.

The 23-year-old dealt the class A drugs in Selbourne Street, Loughborough, on three occasions in November last year.

He pleaded guilty to four counts of supplying class A drugs and was given 27 months in prison at Leicester Crown Court on Friday (16 August).

Comrie-Patterson was one of the defendants identified following the force's large-scale operation to tackle the sale and distribution of drugs on the streets of Leicestershire - known as Operation Lionheart.

Also sentenced last week as part of the same operation:

 * Uwimana Rahmana, 20, currently of HMYOI Brinsford, Wolverhampton, has given a further six months in a youth offending institute after pleading guilty to one count of supplying class A drugs.

 * Alisdair Morton, 43, of Victoria Street, Loughborough, was given an 18 month prison sentence, suspended for 20 months, after previously pleading guilty to two counts of supplying class A drugs and two counts of being concerned in the supply of class A drugs.

They were both sentenced on Tuesday 13 August.
