A county lines mastermind operating from London was one of two men sentenced this week for facilitating the supply of cocaine and heroin in Loughborough.

Jordan Murray will serve a three year sentence for jointly running a class A supply in the town through two dedicated phone numbers - known as county lines.

The 23-year-old, of Flamborough Road, Ruislip, was running the line with defendant Devaughn Williams, who was jailed last month.

The pair were taking the orders and then using local dealers to supply the drugs.

On 16 separate occasions, between 12 September 2018 and 17 January 2019, at least 10 dealers supplied cocaine and heroin on the order of Murray and Williams on the streets of Loughborough.

Both defendants, detained as part of Operation Lionheart, were living in the Borough of Hillingdon at the time of the offences.

At Leicester Crown Court on Tuesday (27 August) Murray pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs and was jailed for three years.

Also sentenced on the same day - Grant Griffiths - jailed for two years and three months for three counts of supplying class A drugs.

On three dates in September and October 2018, the 24-year-old, of Bay Avenue, Wolverhampton, sold heroin and cocaine, in Loughborough.

He pleaded guilty to the offences at an earlier court appearance.
