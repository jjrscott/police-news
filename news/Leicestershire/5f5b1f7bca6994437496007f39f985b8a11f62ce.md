Detectives are appealing for information after a teenager was robbed near Anstey at the weekend.

The robbery is reported to have happened at around 8pm on Saturday (10 October) as the teenage boy was walking along the pathway that links Anstey Lane to Gorse Hill and he was approached by what he has described as three black men wearing balaclavas.

They asked him for his property and showed him they were carrying knives. He handed over his mobile phone and the men walked off along Gorse Hill towards Castle Hill Country Park.

The phone has since been recovered outside an address in Anstey.

Detective Constable Claire Francis is investigating the robbery and asking anyone for information to get in touch.

She said: "This boy was subjected to a frightening experience and clearly left shaken by what happened to him.

"It's important we find this people responsible and we have been carrying out a number of enquiries to do this.

"I am eager to speak to anyone who may have seen the suspects hanging around the area before the offence, saw them after the offence or has any information about who may have been involved."

Anyone with information is asked to contact DC Francis on 101 quoting 20*534887.
