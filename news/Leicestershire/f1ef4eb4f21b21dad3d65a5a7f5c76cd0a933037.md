A prolific offender has been sentenced to a total of four years in prison for a number of burglary and fraud offences committed earlier this year.

Jamie Dunckley, 31, of HMP Leicester, was found guilty on Wednesday (9 December) following a trial at Leicester Crown Court.

He was found guilty of the following offences:

 * Burglary of a property in Luther Street, Leicester on 27 January
 * Two counts of fraud by false representation on 27 January and one count of fraud of false representation on 28 January when he made purchases with a bank card stolen in the Luther Street burglary
 * Theft from motor vehicle in Dunster Street, Leicester on 30 January where a bank card was stolen
 * One count of fraud by false representation on 30 January when he made a purchase with the stolen bank card
 * Attempt burglary of a property in Glenfield Road, Leicester on 1 February
 * Burglary of a property in Ibbetson Avenue, Leicester on 10 March
 * Theft of motor vehicle on 10 March after he stole the car keys and car in the Ibbetson Avenue burglary
 * Burglary of a property in Gipsy Road, Leicester on 27 March
 * Theft of motor vehicle on 27 March after he stole the car keys and car in the Gipsy Road burglary
 * Driving while disqualified on 27 March for driving the stolen car
 * Four counts of fraud by false representation on 27 March after making purchases with the bank cards stolen in the Gipsy Road burglary

Detective Constable Andrew Ilnicki, who investigated one of the burglaries, said: "Dunkley is a prolific offender who thought nothing of burgling a number of homes and stealing bank cards to use fraudulently over a period of three months.

"Through our investigation, we managed to obtain CCTV footage of Dunkley linking him to many of these offences which helped us to trace his involvement and secure charges of all of the offences he was convicted for.

"I am pleased that the jury saw through Dunkley's denial and I hope that his time in prison serves as some justice to his victims and those people who are deeply affected by such crimes."
