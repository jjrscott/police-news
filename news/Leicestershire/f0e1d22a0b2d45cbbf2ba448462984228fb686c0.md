Seven people arrested after a fight in Leicester during the early hours of Tuesday 12 January have been issued with fixed penalty notices for breaching Covid regulations.

Police were called to the disturbance in Grace Road at 5.20am. A number of people, both men and women, fled the scene before officers arrived.

A knife was recovered from the scene and it's believed other weapons were also used. No-one has reported being injured.

Seven men, aged between 18 and 23, were subsequently arrested on suspicion of affray and have since been released pending further enquiries. The men were also issued with Â£200 fines for breaching the Covid regulations.

Enquiries into the incident and the circumstances leading up to it are continuing and if anyone has any information they are asked to contact officers. Also, if anyone has any footage of the incident on their home or vehicle video recording equipment they are asked to get in touch.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact either 101, quoting crime number 21*18789, Crimestoppers, on 0800 555 111 or report online at www.leics.police.uk
