Officers are trying to locate the owners of pocket watches and other jewellery which were found in a stolen vehicle.

On Monday 3 June officers arrested a man in connection with the theft of a vehicle. When the vehicle was searched by officers items were recovered, and officers believe them to have been stolen.

Among the items recovered from the car were a gold and silver wrist watch inside a distinctive box, a silver pocket watch with an engraving on the back and a gold ring with red and silver stone, in a distinctive box.

Officers then carried out a search at the suspect's address and more property which they believe to have been stolen was recovered.

This included a Sony laptop in silver, an Info Touch tablet in black, contained within a grey flip tablet case, an Archos 10 internet tablet, an Acer laptop in black and a silver and gold Rolex style wrist watch.

The arrested person, a 35-year-old Leicester man, has since been released pending further investigations.

Officers are keen to reunite the stolen goods with their rightful owners and urge anyone who recognises the items to contact them with some form of proof of ownership.

Contact PC 302 Danielle Preston on 101, quoting crime number 19*224541.
