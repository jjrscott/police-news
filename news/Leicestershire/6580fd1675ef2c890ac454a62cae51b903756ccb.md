Officers have named a passenger who died in a collision in Willoughby Waterleys earlier this month.

The collision was reported at 3.15pm on Sunday 20 December and involved one vehicle, a silver Ford Fiesta, which was travelling along Willoughby Road when it left the road and came to rest overturned in a ditch, close to the junction with Broughton Lane.

There were four men in the vehicle, three of which were taken to the Leicester Royal Infirmary with minor injuries.

The fourth man, Thomas Gamble, 18 of Broughton Astley, Leicestershire, was the front seat passenger and sustained serious injuries. He was taken to University Hospitals of Coventry and Warwickshire where he sadly passed away during the night.

Officers are continuing to appeal to anyone who may have witnessed the collision or saw the vehicle being driven beforehand and haven't as yet contacted police to get in touch.

Also if anyone has video recording equipment installed in their vehicles and were in the area yesterday afternoon we would ask that they check the footage and contact officers if they have anything recorded which will assist with the investigation.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact DC 4695 Louise McMahon on 101, quoting crime number 20*671630.
