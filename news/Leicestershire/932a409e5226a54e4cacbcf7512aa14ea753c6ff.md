A fourth person has been arrested on suspicion of handling stolen goods following five warrants being executed across Leicestershire this morning (26 February).

The warrants were carried out at properties in Greystone Avenue, Hackness Road and Cordery Road and at premises in Gwendolen Road and Belgrave Gate at around 7am today.

This was following information received regarding stolen vehicles and the selling of stolen vehicle parts.

Three men, aged 36, 37 and 42, all of Leicester, were arrested on suspicion of handling stolen goods this morning.

A fourth man, aged 29, of Leicester, has also since been arrested on suspicion of the same offence.

Detective Inspector Simon Preston said: "We have had a large number of officers carrying out these warrants this morning across Leicestershire and therefore a lot of police activity ongoing in the area.

"Thank you to residents in the areas for their patience and co-operation while this was ongoing.

"Four men currently remain in custody being questioned on suspicion of handling stolen goods and our enquiries and searches remain ongoing."
