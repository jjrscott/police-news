Officers are appealing for witnesses following a collision on the A6 in Birstall.

Police were called to a collision on the A6 Loughborough Road just off the Red Hill Circle roundabout at around 5.35pm on Monday 28 September.

It involved two vehicles, a silver Seat Ibiza and a blue Ford Kuga.

Both drivers were treated at hospital for minor injuries.

PC Andy Richardson, from the force's Road Policing Unit, is appealing for witnesses.

He said: "At the time of the collision, the silver Seat Ibiza was travelling county bound and the blue Ford Kuga was travelling city bound in the opposite direction.

"I would like to appeal for any witnesses or anyone with video equipment in their vehicles which recorded footage connected to this collision to come forward. I am also keen to speak to anyone who has saw either vehicle beforehand. We know that a number of witnesses stopped to help so you have any information which could assist us and haven't spoken to police as yet, please get in touch."

Anyone who witnessed the collision or has information which can assist the investigation is asked to contact PC 1942 Andy Richardson on 101 quoting 20*510604.
