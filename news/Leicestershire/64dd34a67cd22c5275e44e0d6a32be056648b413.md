A Dr who specialises in sexual health is applying her expertise by joining the force's CSE team.

Dr Kat Finney, who is also a Special constable, will be based in the team for one day a week and her role will include providing officer training, working with sexual health clinics and providing advice and support to CSE victims.

Detective Sergeant Jim Muzzell, who played a pivotal role in bringing Kat into the team, said: "Kat has already forged some strong links with the sexual health centres in Leicester and I am confident she is going to be a huge asset to the team.

Kat said: "I very much enjoy my time with the force as a Special and I have always thought about how I can use the skills I have in this particular area of work to help the police further.

She added: "I am very pleased to be part of the CSE team and hope to offer my specific expertise where I can and to continue to build on the excellent teamwork that already exists with the multi-agency team."
