The family of a man who was killed after being put into a headlock following an argument has described him as a "good and harmless" person who helped those who needed something.

Constantine Papathanasiou, 51, was assaulted at a property in St Peter's Road, Leicester, on 17 May this year by Ricky Simon, 53. Mr Papathanasiou died at the scene of the incident.

Today (20 December), following a five-week trial, Simon was found guilty of murder and perverting the course of justice. He has been sentenced to life imprisonment to serve a minimum of 18 years.

The family of Mr Papathanasiou today paid tribute to him. They said:

"The loss of our son Constantine in a violent and inhumane way has forever created a void in our lives that will never close until we die.

"When the horrendous news of Constantine's murder became known in our town of Edessa, Greece, everyone was shocked. His death was so unjust and sudden.

"All the citizens of our small town remember him with a smile on his face and for the kindness he showed to everyone. He was a good and harmless man who helped those who needed something.

"We, as a family, and the friends of Constantine thank everyone in the investigation team at Leicestershire Police for their hard work to find the person responsible for Constantine's death.

"Constantine now lives on in our hearts and in our memories."
