Updated News Post

A man remains in hospital in a stable condition after two people were injured in a non-stop road traffic collision in Humberstone Road, Leicester.

Officers were called at around 1am today (30 May) by East Midlands Ambulance Service to a report of a man in his forties and a teenage boy being struck by a vehicle close to the junction with Spinney Hill Road.

Both have been taken to hospital, the boy sustained a minor injury while the man is in a stable condition.

The vehicle failed to stop at the scene and enquiries are ongoing to locate it. Early enquiries led officers to believe that the vehicle did not deliberately drive at the pedestrians.

Humberstone Road was closed as its junction with Spinney Hill Road while officers remain at the scene. The road has since been reopened.

We are in the early stages of our investigation and enquiries are continuing into the exact circumstances surrounding the incident with an increased police presence in the area.

We can confirm we are not treating this is as terrorist related and we would ask that people do not speculate while the incident remains under investigation.

Officers would like to appeal to anyone who may witnessed the collision or have any information surrounding the incident to get in touch. Alternatively anyone who has any dashcam or CCTV footage of the incident is asked to contact police.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101 quoting incident 19 of 30 May.
