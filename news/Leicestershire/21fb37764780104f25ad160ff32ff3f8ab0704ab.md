A Leicester man who admitted illegally possessing four shotguns has been jailed.

James Tresoldi, was sentenced to five years in prison when he appeared at Leicester Crown Court today (Friday 15 March).

The 27-year-old pleaded guilty to five counts of possession of a shotgun when prohibited, one count of transfer of a firearm and one count of possession of cannabis with intent to supply during a previous hearing at the same court on 15 February.

His conviction was the result of an investigation undertaken by the East Midlands Special Operations Unit (EMSOU). A search of Tresoldi's home address in Ingold Avenue, Leicester, uncovered a 'dealer list' as well as scales and a small amount of cannabis.

The four shotguns, as well as a significant amount of cannabis, were also found concealed close to the property.

EMSOU investigator Hazel Score said: "As part of this investigation, we have managed to recover four shotguns which were being held illegally by Tresoldi for what we believe was financial gain.

"There was a real possibility that these guns could have been sold on to be used in criminal activity elsewhere - both in Leicestershire and further afield - quite possibly putting lives at risk.

"We will, of course, continue to investigate any reports of illegal firearm ownership to bring those responsible to justice.

"However the shotguns we recovered, along with a significant amount of cannabis, are no longer bound for the streets of Leicester and beyond and credit must go to officers and staff involved in this investigation."
