Officers are appealing for information after an elderly woman was targeted by a distraction burglar in Ravenstone.

Sometime between 4.30pm and 4.40pm on Saturday 28 May, a man approached a woman in her garden at her address in the Leicester Road area.

The man claimed to be a police officer and was there to check on the woman's home security. The woman went back into her house and the man left the garden.

The suspect is described as white, in his mid-fifties, between 5ft 2ins and 5ft 4ins tall and of a slim build. He had short grey hair and was wearing dark clothing.

DC James Turner, the investigating officer, said: "From enquiries carried out we don't believe this to be a genuine police officer and while thankfully he didn't gain access on this occasion but he did make reference to returning the property.

"The victim has been spoken to by officers around protecting herself from being a victim of a distraction burglary and I would like to remind people to be vigilant to unknown callers, ask for ID and don't let anyone into your home unless you have verified who they are."

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101 quoting 19*273454.
