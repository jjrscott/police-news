Officers investigating a collision involving a car and a pedestrian in Leicester are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

It happened in Bassett Street at around 10.30pm yesterday (Thursday 10 December). The car involved was a grey Toyota Yaris.

The pedestrian, a woman in her 20s, suffered a dislocated shoulder and facial injuries as a result.

Police attended and a 42-year-old man from Leicester was arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. He has since been released under investigation.

PC Ryan Berry, the investigating officer, said: "This happened in a residential area and, from enquiries carried out so far, I believe there will have been people who saw what happened.

"If you have any information, then I would like to speak to you. I would also like to speak to anyone who was driving through the area and has a dashcam installed in their vehicle.

"Likewise, anyone with CCTV installed at their address should also get in touch."
