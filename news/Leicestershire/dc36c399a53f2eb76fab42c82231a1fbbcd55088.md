Six people have been arrested after a man was shot in his car in Leicester in April.

Officers were called to Scraptoft Mews, off Scraptoft Lane, at around 4.45pm on Friday 3 April following a report that a man had been shot while sitting inside a car.

The man, in his 30s, was discharged from hospital after being treated for gunshot injuries.

Yesterday (Tuesday 16 June) four men, aged 19, 19, 20 and 22, were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.

They have all been released on bail.

A 37-year-old man and 36-year-old woman were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. They have been released with no further action.

Detective Inspector Mark Parish has been leading the investigation. He said: "Quite rightly this incident would be of concern to the local community and we'd like to reassure you that we continue to treat this as an isolated and pre-meditated crime.

"Our enquiries into the incident have been ongoing since April and our investigation resulted in these arrests.

"Despite the arrests we continue to appeal to anyone who hasn't yet come forward to get in touch. If you witnessed the incident or were driving in the area at the time we need to speak to you. Also if you have video recording equipment installed in your vehicle and may have captured any footage please contact us."

Anyone with any information is asked to contact 101, quoting crime number 20*176244.
