A scene preservation at a site off Scalford Road, Melton Mowbray, where a number of human bones were found last week has now been removed.

Police were called at around 3.30pm on Thursday (17 October) reporting that the human remains had been found in the ground following work ongoing at the site to demolish some buildings.

Officers attended the area and a scene preservation was put in place while enquiries were carried out at the location.

Detective Inspector Tim Lindley said: "While we have completed our enquiries at the scene, our investigation into determining the length of time the bones have been in the ground is very much ongoing.

"This continues to be a lengthy process which includes specialist forensic examination of what we have recovered and I would like to continue to reassure the public there continues to be nothing at this stage that links these findings to any other current ongoing investigation."
