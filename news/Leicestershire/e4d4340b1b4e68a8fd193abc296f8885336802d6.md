A woman has died following a collision in Humberstone Gate, Leicester.

Police were called to the scene at 5pm on Friday (3 May) by the East Midlands Ambulance Service.

The collision involved a bus and a woman in her 70s. She was taken to the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham for treatment but died yesterday.

No-one else was injured in the incident, which happened between Yeoman Street and Vestry Street. Detectives investigating the collision have today (Tuesday) issued a renewed appeal for information.

Detective Constable John Borlase, the investigating officer, said: "I would still like to speak to anyone who was in Leicester city centre on Friday evening.

"Were you out shopping or making your way home through the city? Did you see the collision occur or did you see either the pedestrian or the bus beforehand?

"Any information you have, no matter how insignificant you think it may be, could help my investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to call 101, quoting incident 431 of 3 May.
