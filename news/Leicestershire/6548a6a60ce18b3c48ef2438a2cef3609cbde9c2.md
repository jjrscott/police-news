Officers from the serious collision investigation unit are appealing for witnesses after a fatal collision on the A5 in Hinckley this morning (Tuesday 22 October).

The collision was reported at 8.25am and involved two vehicles, a white Ford Fiesta and a red Audi A5 cabriolet.

The driver of the Ford Fiesta sustained serious injuries and she was pronounced deceased at the scene. The driver of the Audi sustained minor injuries.

The Ford Fiesta was driving along High Cross Road and turned right on to the A5 where the collision occurred.

The southbound carriageway of the A5 was closed from High Cross Road up to junction 1 of the M69, but it has since been re-opened.

If anyone witnessed the collision and hasn't yet spoken to officers they are urged to come forward. If anyone has video recording equipment installed in their vehicles they are asked to get in touch if they captured the collision or the vehicles being driven beforehand.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact DC 1761 Pete Davies on 101, quoting incident 97 of 22 October.
