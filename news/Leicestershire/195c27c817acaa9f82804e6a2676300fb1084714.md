Updated News Post

A man has been charged with attempted murder following an incident in Gallowtree Gate, Leicester, last week.

Mohammed Osman, 20, of Hipwell Crescent, Leicester, is also charged with aggravated possession of a knife. The charge alleges he was in possession of a knife and that he unlawfully and intentionally threatened a person with the knife in such a way that there was an immediate risk of serious physical harm to the person.

The charges relate to the same victim following an incident in Gallowtree Gate on the afternoon of Tuesday 23 March where a man was found to have suffered stab wound injuries. He was airlifted to hospital with serious injuries but has since been discharged.

Osman has been remanded into custody to appear at Leicester Magistrates Court this morning (Thursday 1 April).

A 55-year-old man and a 60-year-old woman, both from Leicester, who were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender have been released under investigation.
