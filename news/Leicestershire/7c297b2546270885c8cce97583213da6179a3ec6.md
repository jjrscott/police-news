Officers are appealing for public help after the occupants of a car stopped to help a 14-year-old boy who was being robbed on the A563 in Leicester.

The teenager was cycling on Glenfrith Way (A563) area when he was approached by four youths who tried to steal his bike. They punched him in the face causing his nose to bleed and knocked him to the floor.

The incident took place sometime between 4.30pm and 6.20pm on Monday 14 December. The suspects have been described as being 16-17 years-old, two of them were white and two were black.

The occupants of a car stopped at the scene which resulted in the suspects running away empty handed.

Officers would like to identify and speak to the four Asian men who stopped and helped the victim as they may be able to assist with the investigation.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact DC 4710 Claire Francis on 101, quoting crime number 20*660280.
