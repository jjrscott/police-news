Officers are appealing for witnesses after a 27-year-old man sustained significant facial injuries during an assault in the city centre.

The victim was approached at the junction with Granby Street and Campbell Street, near the Premier Inn, around 6.30pm on Thursday 28 January.

He was struck in the face with an object and sustained cuts which required a number of stitches.

A 27-year-old man was subsequently arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm and released on bail pending further enquiries.

From enquiries conducted so far it's believed this was an isolated incident and that both parties were known to each other.

Anyone who witnessed the incident is asked to contact PC 4499 Neil Rawlings on 101, quoting crime number 21*60432.
