Detectives investigating a serious collision in St Matthews Way have released CCTV footage of a man they would like to speak to.

The collision happened near the junction with Wharf Street North shortly before 1.30pm on Monday 18 March.

A silver VW Golf GTi was in collision with a woman who was using the pedestrian crossing. The vehicle then made off from the scene.

The woman, who is in her 50s, was taken to the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham with serious injuries. She has since been discharged.

Detective Constable Seamus Burns, the investigating officer, said: "Today we are renewing our appeal for information and we are particularly keen to speak to the man seen on CCTV, as we believe he may have seen what happened.

"If that person is you - or you know who he is - then please get in touch as he could have information that could help our investigation.

"I would still like to speak to anyone else who witnessed the collision but has not yet spoken to police. Please cast your mind back. Were you driving along St Matthews Way on that Monday afternoon, or were you using the pedestrian crossing?

"If you have any information about this incident, no matter how insignificant you think it may be, we would still like to speak to you."

Call 101, quoting incident 275 of 18 March.
