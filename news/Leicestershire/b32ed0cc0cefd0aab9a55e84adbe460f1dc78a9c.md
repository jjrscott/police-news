Leicestershire Police has taken part in a tri-force operation with Northamptonshire Police and Warwickshire Police over the weekend (Friday 16 - Saturday 17 August) to disrupt and deter criminals targeting rural areas along the A5 corridor.

In a combined total of the three forces work, 268 vehicles were stopped, 18 farm visits were made and 1 suspicious incident attended. Leicestershire officers stopped 17 vehicles, carrying out PNC checks on each one and 3 breath tests were completed.

During the operation officers and staff from all forces worked together with neighbouring forces to target the activities of offenders attending fields populated with sheep in the rural areas, primarily along the A5 corridor, and either illegally butchering or stealing them.

Eastern Counties' Deputy Commander, Sgt Kevin Manship said: "Rural crime offences have a negative impact on the farming and rural community, which is why we hope this operation helps to reassurance our communities of the steps we are taking to tackle these offences.

"During the successful police activity, officers were able to engage with the public to discuss any concerns they may have and provide crime prevention advice."

Officers and staff also responded to reports of suspicious persons or vehicles, burglary and thefts in progress.

Officers who were double crewed also patrolled designated areas along the A5 and villages nearby and previously targeted locations to make intelligence led stops of any suspicious vehicles.
