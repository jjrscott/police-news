Updated News Post

Officers are appealing for witnesses after a fatal collision on the A47 in Leicestershire.

It happened at around 6.50am today (Thursday 28 January) close to Billesdon and involved two vehicles, a blue Mazda 3 and a white HGV.

The Mazda was travelling towards Peterborough and the lorry towards Leicester when the collision took place.

Officers attended the location with colleagues from the East Midlands Ambulance Service and Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service and a woman, in her 40s, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

No one else was injured in the collision.

The A47 was closed between the junctions of Coplow Lane and the B6047 Tilton Road to allow for an investigation of the scene - it has since reopened.

Detective Sergeant Paul Hawkins is from Leicestershire Police's Serious Collision Investigation Unit (SCIU). He said: "We would like to speak to anyone who has any information about what happened.

"If you were in the area and saw either of the vehicles beforehand or witnessed the collision please get in touch.

"If you have a dashcam installed in your vehicle and captured what happened we'd like to hear from you."

Anyone with any information who has not yet spoken to officers is asked to call 101 quoting incident 68 of 28 January.
