A 26-year-old man who twice ran over his former partner has today (Friday 15 January) been convicted of attempted murder.

On the morning of 3 December 2019, Zack Coleman knocked over his victim in Sturdee Road, Leicester, before turning his vehicle around and running over her again.

He then fled the scene in his Ford Kuga.

Police were called at 11.20am and officers were immediately deployed. On arrival, they were able to speak to the victim, who named Coleman as the person responsible.

This information led police to Coleman's address in Auburn Road, Blaby where - a short time later - he was located and arrested. The Ford Kuga, which had been damaged as a result of the collision, was parked outside.

During the investigation, officers found Coleman had sent malicious messages to the victim, in which he made direct reference to running over an unknown person.

In addition to the charge of attempted murder, Coleman also pleaded guilty to a charge of breaching a restraining order at an earlier court hearing.

Detective Constable Kerry Washington, from the force's Domestic Abuse Investigation Unit (DAIU), was the investigating officer. She said: "The officers who responded to this incident were able to speak to the victim, who immediately told us Coleman had run her over.

"It meant that they could focus their efforts on immediately trying to find and arrest him. That first call came in at 11.20am and he was arrested at 12.25pm.

"Coleman sent messages in which he threatened to run someone over. When he was arrested, he asked officer whether the victim was dead - he was fully aware of what he'd done. I'm in little doubt there had been an element of planning behind this horrific crime.

"I am pleased that despite denying the offence, he has been brought to justice."

Coleman will be sentenced at Leicester Crown Court on 8 March.
