Updated News Post

Detectives from the Serious Collision Investigation Unit (SCIU) are continuing to carry out further enquiries into a multiple-vehicle collision yesterday (Wednesday 10 March)

Police were called to a stretch of the motorway between junction 20, for Lutterworth, and junction 21 for Leicester shortly before 6.30pm

A number of vehicles - including a BMW 1 Series, 3 Series, Skoda Octavia, Ford Mondeo and a Renault lorry - were involved.

One man in his 30s was taken to the University Hospital of Coventry and Warwickshire to be treated for life-threatening injuries. He remains in hospital in a serious condition. A number of other people were also taken to hospital as a precaution.

Both sides of the motorway were closed to allow officers and other emergency services to attend the scene. They have since reopened.

After officers arrived, a 24-year-old man located near the motorway was arrested on suspicion of failing to stop. He has since been released under investigation.

Detective Sergeant Paul Hawkins, from the force's Serious Collision Investigation Unit (SCIU) said: "Our investigation into this incident has continued through the night and a number of enquiries are still ongoing.

"I would also ask that anyone travelling on the motorway around the time the collision occurred and who saw what happened, has a dashcam in their vehicle or saw any of the vehicles prior to the collision occurring to come forward if you have not already done so.

"Any information you have could assist our investigation."
