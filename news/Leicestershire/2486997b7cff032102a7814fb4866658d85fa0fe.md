Officers are warning people about the dangers of electric scooters after a young boy was left with significant injuries.

Jamie Smith was walking with his father in Elston Fields, Leicester, last August, when the rider of an electric scooter collided with him.

Six-year-old Jamie was treated at the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham, for a fracture to his skull, and multiple cuts and bruises.

The rider failed to stop at the scene and rode off. He was subsequently identified following an appeal by Jamie's family and friends.

The 17-year-old, who can't be named for legal reasons, was charged with causing a serious injury by dangerous driving, failing to stop after a road traffic collision, failing to report a road traffic collision, using a motor vehicle without insurance, using a motor vehicle without a MOT certificate and driving a vehicle otherwise in accordance with a licence.

Yesterday (Monday 22 March) at Leicester Youth Court the defendant pleaded guilty to the charges. He will be sentenced on Monday 12 April.

PC Kieran Dempsey from Leicestershire Roads Policing Unit was the investigating officer, he said: "As this case has demonstrated, electric scooters are dangerous vehicles in the wrong hands and are currently illegal to use both on the road and in public areas in Leicestershire"

"Jamie was left with significant injuries which were initially believed to be life threatening. Thankfully he has made a physical recovery but it was an extremely difficult time for him and his family.

"In Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland it is illegal to use an electric scooter on a public highway. The government is currently running trials of electric scooters (e-scooters), however this trial is not taking place in the Leicestershire force area.

"If you use an e-scooter illegally you could face a fine, get penalty points on your licence, and the e-scooter could be impounded. If your actions results in someone being injured, as in this case, you could face prosecution.

We would advise users to check the government guidelines for their use at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/powered-transporters/information-sheet-guidance-on-powered-transporters."
