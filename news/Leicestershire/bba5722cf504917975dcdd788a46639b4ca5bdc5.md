Officers are appealing for witnesses to a collision involving a pedestrian and a car at the end of last month.

An 87-year-old woman was hit by a car - a black Toyota Aygo - as she was crossing Ambassador Road in the Rowlatts Hill area of the city.

The incident happened on Tuesday 28 January just after 11am, at 11.07am.

The car remained at the scene and no one was arrested.

DS Paul Hawkins from the Serious Collision Investigation Unit is leading the investigation, and said: "The injuries the woman sustained in the incident have had a massive impact on her life.

"We want to piece together the events leading up to the collision, so if anyone remembers seeing an elderly woman in Ambassador Road and a black car immediately prior to the collision, we'd like to hear from you.

"I appreciate it's a number of weeks ago now, however a number of enquiries have been carried out in the background and we are now looking for public help.

"Any information you have, no matter how little you may think it is, might help our investigation."

Call 101, quoting incident number 204 of 28 January.
