Updated News Post

A man has been arrested and released on police bail following a road traffic collision in Rothley.

Officers were called at around 6.30am on Friday morning (1 January) to a report of a single vehicle collision in The Ridings.

The vehicle, a black Peugeot, collided with a gas substation while the driver of the vehicle made off from the scene.

A 33-year-old man was arrested earlier today (3 January) on suspicion of failing to stop at a road traffic collision and perverting the course of justice. He has since been released on police bail pending further enquiries.

Enquiries are ongoing into the collision.

The incident caused some disruption as officers assisted with road closures in the area and the evacuation of a small number of properties as a precaution. Those affected have since returned home and roads reopened.

Anyone with information about the incident can contact police on 101 quoting incident 226 of 1 January.
