Two men have today (Wednesday 22 May) pleaded guilty to being concerned in the production of cannabis.

Adi Uka, 29 and 20-year-old Ervin Thaci were arrested by police following the execution of a warrant at an address in Luther Street yesterday (Tuesday).

More than 150 cannabis plants were recovered from the property.

The pair, both of Luther Street, each admitted the offence when they appeared at Leicester Magistrates' Court.

They were remanded in custody and will be sentenced at Leicester Crown Court on 17 June.
