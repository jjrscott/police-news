Officers from the Central Leicester Neighbourhood Policing Area (NPA) have secured a closure order for a flat in West Street.

Today (Friday 21 August) a full closure order was granted at Leicester Magistrates' Court, meaning the occupants have been evicted. A copy of the closure order is displayed outside.

An application for an order to be granted was made by the NPA following a number of incidents at the address - 31a West Street - over recent months, including assaults and antisocial behaviour.

Inspector Adam Archer, commander for the Central Leicester NPA, said: "Our teams have been called to this address on a number of occasions in recent months. We have received reports of people being assaulted and other antisocial behaviour taking place."

"We have taken necessary action to bring the unacceptable behaviour to an end. We owe it to people living nearby to take steps which will allow them to live in safety and peace without having to tolerate this."
