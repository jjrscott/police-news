Updated News Post

Detectives from the force's Complex Investigation Team (CIT) are appealing for information following an incident in Saffron Lane on Sunday night (14 February).

Shortly after 10pm, a call was received stating a pedestrian - a man - had been hit by a vehicle close to the junction with Shakespeare Street. The car had then left the area.

Prior to the collision occurring, it was also reported that a number of people had been fighting in the street.

The victim, a man in his 30s, was taken to the University Hospital in Coventry to be treated for injuries that could potentially be life-changing.

As a result of enquiries in the surrounding area, a 33-year-old man was also arrested on suspicion of affray at an address in Leicester. He has been released on bail.

Three other men were arrested in Leicester, also on suspicion of affray.

Two men - aged 33 and 32 - have been released with no further action and a 31-year-old man has been released under investigation.

Detective Sergeant Jenny Tattersall said: "Our investigation into this incident is very much continuing.

"The car that left the scene but we believe there were other people involved who have not yet been identified and who left the scene in other vehicles.

"I would ask anyone with information - no matter how insignificant you think it is - to come forward. I would like to speak to anyone who saw what happened or who has dashcam or CCTV footage of a fight taking place or vehicles leaving the area where this incident occurred."

 * A 32-year-old man from Leicester, who was arrested by police in Saffron Lane, has since been charged with possessing a knife blade/sharp-pointed article in a public place and is due to appear at Leicester Magistrates' Court today (Thursday 18 February).
