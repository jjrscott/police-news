The quick actions of officers led to a rapist being arrested an hour after he had fled the scene of his "harrowing and appalling" crime.

Virgil Arhip, 28, had broken into a property in the South Leicester area during the early hours of 19 July before raping a woman who was living in the property and leaving the scene.

The victim, who is in her 60s, immediately reported the incident to police, making a call to 999 at 1.54am.

Officers attended, providing support to the victim while carrying out initial enquiries including obtaining a detailed description of the suspect. The suspect was reported to also be wearing jeans belonging to the victim when he left the property.

Officers immediately carried out a search in the area, identifying a man matching the description - including the clothing - in an adjoining street.

The man was arrested at the scene. He denied the offence in interview but due to police evidence gathered, he was charged later that same day.

Yesterday (2 September), at Leicester Crown Court, Arhip, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to one count of rape and one count of burglary.

He has been remanded into custody and is due to be sentenced on 16 October.

Detective Inspector Gareth Goddard said: "This was a truly harrowing and appalling attack on a woman in her own home.

"Thanks to the extreme bravery of the victim and the swift actions and tenacious work of all officers involved - from those taking the initial emergency call and attending the scene to those who assisted in a thorough and dedicated investigation - Arhip has pleaded guilty to these horrendous crimes.

"Although this does not change what happened, I hope it is of some support to the victim that the defendant has accepted responsibility in court.

"It is thanks to the victim's courage to immediately report this crime and bravely co-operate with us that we were able to act on this in the way which we did. We encourage victims of any sexual offence to report it to us. Your report will be investigated and full support will be provided to you throughout.

"You can report an incident by calling 101 or you can report online at https://www.leics.police.uk/ro/report/ocr/af/how-to-report-a-crime/. Always call 999 in an emergency."
