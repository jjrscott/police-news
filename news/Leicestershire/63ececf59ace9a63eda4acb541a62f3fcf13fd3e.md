Leicestershire Police is supporting a national surrender, led by the Home Office, which will see members of the public financially compensated for handing in offensive weapons and firearms.

Starting today (10 December) and running until 9 March, the surrender scheme has been launched following the introduction of the Offensive Weapons Act - banning possession of specific offensive weapons and firearms in households.

All 43 police forces across the country are taking part in the scheme, which asks for 22 types of offensive weapons, rapid firing rifles and ammunition, to be surrendered to police.

The offensive weapons include flick knives, zombie knives, batons, knuckledusters and belt buckle knife. For a full list and description visit the guidance on the Government website.

Lawful owners will then be able to claim compensation for the items in most cases.

In order to claim compensation, owners of any items on the offensive weapons list must ensure the item is safely wrapped and boxed before bringing to a police station with a completed compensation form. The form can also be found on the Government website.

The list of stations and opening times for dropping off weapons in Leicester and Leicestershire is below:

Claim for compensation must be made at the same time as surrendering the weapon. These will be passed on by forces for process by the Home Office.

Compensation will not be given for any weapons not included in the surrender.

Leicestershire Police has already made contact with legal owners of the firearms listed to arrange for a surrender of the item. Anyone who has not been contacted should call 101 to arrange for the item to be collected from an address. These should not be bought into stations.

For more information on the surrender scheme visit the guidance on the Government website.
