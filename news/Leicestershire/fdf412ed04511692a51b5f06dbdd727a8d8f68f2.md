An online safety campaign to teach young people about the safe and positive use of technology launches today.

As today (Tuesday 9 February) is Safer Internet Day - a national campaign to help create a better internet - a cause Leicestershire Police is always pleased to support.

The campaign theme for 2021 is _'_ _An internet we trust: exploring reliability in the online world '_ and wants to reach as many young people along with their parents, carers, teachers and social workers as possible.

The forces Cyber Protect Officer, Samantha Hancock, will host two webinars about staying safe online, using technology responsibly, respectfully, critically and creatively.

The 90 minute sessions will cover a large number of topics which include password guidance and account security, using social media safely, keeping young people safe online and how to shop / bank online safely.

Samantha said: "Our use of the internet has increased even more so since home schooling has become common practice during the last year. More young people are spending increasing amounts of time on on-line platforms and therefore its imperative we take staying safe online seriously.

"There are a number of really useful resources available online for parents and carers to engage with children about online safety. Here is a great example: https://www.thinkuknow.co.uk/parents/Support-tools/home-activity-worksheets/

"We fully support the Safer Internet Day campaign, and as a force we have signed up as official Safer Internet Day supporters acknowledging our role in ensuring the safety of young people while online."

To keep up to date with online safety, fraud and scams you can follow the Leicestershire Police Cyber Aware Facebook page.

Leicestershire Police have made two films about the dangers that exist online when people hide behind technology and use it to pretend to be somebody they're not.

The films feature grooming, coercive control and violence and would be rated as a 15 if shown in a cinema.

The films have been designed to make young people think about who they interact with online and if their online friends are really who they say they are.

Make online safety an ongoing conversation with young people. Talk regularly about how they use technology, and find out what their digital life is like, including what their favourite sites and services are and also how being online makes them feel.
