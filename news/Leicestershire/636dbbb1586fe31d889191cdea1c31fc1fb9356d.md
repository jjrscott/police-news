A man who was last month convicted of raping a teenage girl has been jailed for eleven years.

Forty-year-old Deano Churchill-Richards appeared for sentencing at Leicester Crown Court today (Monday 9 November), having been convicted of two counts of rape - both relating to the same victim - on 21 October.

He was also placed on the sex offenders register indefinitely and is subject to an indefinite sexual harm prevention order (SHPO).

Following a trial Churchill-Richards, of Wreford Crescent, Leicester, was also convicted of two counts of supplying a psychoactive substance - to the victim and another girl.

All offences occurred on 20 April this year.

The officer in the case was Detective Constable Chris Perry, from the force's Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) team.

He said: "No sentence is going to erase the victim's memory of the crimes Churchill-Richards committed that night.

"However, as I said when he was convicted, both she and another girl were able to provide us with information that has meant he is now serving a significant time in prison."
