Officers from the South Leicester Neighbourhood Policing Area (NPA) are appealing for public help following several reports of cars being damaged.

All incidents - in which it was reported windows had been smashed - happened last night (Thursday 26 November). It is believed that the same person or people are responsible.

An appeal is being made for anyone with CCTV or dashcam footage to come forward. The reports received so far are:

 * The windows of a Vauxhall Mokka and Volkswagen Golf being smashed in Knighton Church Road between 5pm and 6.35pm
 * The window of a Vauxhall Cavalier being smashed in Pendlebury Drive at around 8pm
 * The window of a Toyota Avensis being smashed in Kingsmead Close at around 8.05pm
 * The windows of a Peugeot 208 and Mercedes A180 being smashed in Asquith Boulevard between 6pm and 9pm

It is not believed anything was taken from the vehicles.

Sergeant Jack Jackson, from the South Leicester NPA, said: "We believe that there are other cars in these areas that may have been damaged.

"Officers are currently collating the reports and I would ask anyone with information - especially any CCTV or dashcam footage - to come forward.

"Were you walking or driving in any of these areas yesterday evening? Did you see anyone acting in a manner that seemed unusual, suspicious or untoward? Any details you're able to provide could help our investigation."
