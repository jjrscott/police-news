Updated News Post

A passenger has died following a collision on the M1 last weekend.

The collision occurred just before 11.20pm on Saturday 26 September at junction 23 of the M1 northbound and involved two vehicles, a black Range Rover and a black Audi RS4.

A rear seat passenger in the Range Rover sustained serious injuries and was taken to hospital. She sadly passed away yesterday (1 October).

Two other people in the Range Rover - the driver and front seat passenger - were also injured and were treated in hospital.

The driver of the Audi wasn't injured.

A 37-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of drink driving and driving offences, has since been released pending further enquiries.

Anyone who witnessed the collision or saw either vehicle being driven beforehand is asked to contact the police.

Also, if anyone has video recording equipment installed in their vehicles we ask that they check their footage and contact us if they captured any part of the incident.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact 101, quoting incident 743 of 26 September.
