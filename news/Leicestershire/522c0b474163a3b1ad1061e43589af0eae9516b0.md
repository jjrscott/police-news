Officers are appealing for information following a fire at a Leicester property which is believed to have been caused by a firework.

Police were called at 8.13pm yesterday (5 November) by a member of the public reporting the fire at a property in Chesterton Walk.

Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service were also in attendance and the fire was put out.

No-one was in the property at the time and no injuries have been reported.

The fire is being treated as deliberate and an investigation is ongoing to establish the full circumstances of the incident.

Detective Sergeant Dan Cumpsty said: "It is extremely fortunate that no-one was seriously injured in this incident and extremely fortunate that witnesses reported this as soon as they did averting any danger it may have caused to others.

"An investigation is ongoing to establish the full circumstances but from initial investigations, it is believed the fire was started by a firework.

"Anyone who was in the area yesterday evening is asked to think back to anything you saw or heard which could help us in our investigation.

"If you have any CCTV or dashcam footage from the area, we also urge you to get in contact."

Anyone with any information should contact 101 quoting incident 601 of 5 November.
