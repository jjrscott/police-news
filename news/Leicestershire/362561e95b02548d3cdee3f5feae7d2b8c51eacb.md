Officers are appealing for public help after thousands of pounds worth of tools were stolen from a vehicle in Leicester.

A Landrover Discovery was broken into in St Oswalds Road sometime between 5.50pm and 6.10pm on Thursday 17 September and a number of tools used to carry out ground work were stolen.

Officers have released images of some of the tools in the hope someone may recognise them and help reunite them with the owner.

If you have any information about the incident or the stolen items contact PC 449 Paul Wallis on 101, quoting crime number 20*489515.
