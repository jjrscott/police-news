Officers are investigating a robbery whereby a van was stolen while a driver was delivering a parcel.

It happened in Boundary Road, off Aylestone Road, at around 2.30pm yesterday (Thursday 28 January).

The driver, a man, attempted to hold on to the vehicle as it was driven off and was dragged along in the process.

He was taken to hospital to be treated for injuries that are not life-threatening or life-changing.

The van - a red Vauxhall Vivaro with the registration SW07 SPZ - was taken by a man and has not yet been located.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has seen the van is asked to come forward.

PC Kate Butler, from South Leicester CID, said: "This happened during the day in a residential area. I believe there are people who will have seen what happened.

"I would like to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident or saw the van being driven away from Boundary Road towards Swanscombe Road.

"I'm also keen to speak to any motorists with a dashcam installed in their vehicle or anyone with CCTV installed at their property.

"Any information you have could help our investigation.

"I would also ask all delivery drivers to remain vigilant. Do not leave your keys in the ignition if you are visiting an address and are leaving the vehicle unattended.

"I'd also ask any other motorists to adopt the same approach, particularly at this time of year when you may be defrosting your vehicle."
