Detectives are appealing for information after a man was stabbed in a Leicester street last night.

Police were called at around 7.20pm yesterday evening (17 March) to a report of a man found stabbed in the street close to the junction with Paget Road and Tudor Road in Leicester.

The victim, a man in his twenties, has been taken to hospital where he remains in a critical but stable condition.

A scene preservation was put in place and the road was closed while enquiries were carried out at the location. These have since been lifted.

Officers are continuing their enquiries today which will include the review of the CCTV in the area.

Detective Sergeant Scott Cairns, from force's Complex Investigation team said: "This man has sustained a significant injury and remains in hospital in a critical but stable condition.

"From our enquiries so far, we believe that the victim was involved in an altercation with a group of other men close to the nearby Rally Park shortly before he was stabbed.

"While we have already spoken to a number of people in the area, it's extremely important that anyone who may have witnessed something connected to this incident and hasn't spoken to our officers, gets in touch with us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101 quoting 21*151058. You can also report online at www.leics.police.uk.
