Officers would like to speak to this man following a burglary in Ashby in which a debit card taken was used to withdraw money.

Police received a report that a man had approached a property in the area of North Street on the afternoon of Sunday 3 March claiming to be selling cleaning products.

The victim, who is in her 60s, handed her card to the man who said he would need to take it outside to his van to take a small payment. No product was given to the victim.

The victim noticed later on in the day that hundreds of pounds had been taken from her bank account.

The man returned to the property the next day (4 March) with another man and asked for the victim's card. The victim refused to hand the card over during this visit and the men left.

Enquiries are continuing.

Detective Constable James Turner said: "An investigation is ongoing and we believe the man pictured can help us. If this is you, or you recognise him, I urge you to get in touch.

"Similarly anyone who has any information in relation to the incident should also get in touch."

Anyone with any information should contact 101 quoting incident 19000112482.

*Always be cautious when answering to a cold caller. Always check for ID and only allow someone into you home if you are absolutely certain they are genuine. Never hand your bank card or large amounts of cash over. If the caller refuses to leave, you should contact police on 101 or 999 in an emergency.
