Updated News Post

Officers are appealing for witnesses after a fatal collision involving two lorries on the M1 southbound.

It happened at around 7pm yesterday (Friday 11 December) close to junction 21a at Leicester Forest East.

Officers attended the location with colleagues from the East Midlands Ambulance Service and a man, 52, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

No one else was injured in the collision.

The Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service were also called to the incident.

The M1 was closed southbound at junction 22 to allow for an investigation of the scene - it has since been reopened. The A46 was closed temporarily at the Groby junction.

Detective Constable John Borlase is from Leicestershire Police's Serious Collision Investigation Unit (SCIU). He said: "We would like to speak to anyone who has any information about what happened.

"If you were in the area and saw either of the vehicles beforehand or witnessed the collision please get in touch.

"If you have a dashcam installed in your vehicle and captured what happened we'd like to hear from you.

"We would like to thank the public caught up in the closure of the M1 for their patience and understanding as we carried out our investigation and looked to reopen the road. In incidents such as this we do our utmost to keep disruption to a minimal but due to the severity of this incident the road remained closed overnight."

Anyone with any information who has not yet spoken to officers is asked to call 101 quoting incident 534 of 11 December.
