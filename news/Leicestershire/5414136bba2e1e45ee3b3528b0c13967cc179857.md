Officers are appealing for information after a robbery was reported in Leicester on Thursday 12 February.

It was reported that around 7.45pm a man approached a car parked at the end of Slater Steet, opened the door and threatened two occupants with a knife.

The man stole mobile phones before leaving on foot towards the Leisure Centre.

He is described as white, around 5'9, of average build and wearing a balaclava.

Detective Constable Matthew Harrison said: "This incident happened during the early evening in an industrial area close to main roads into the City Centre, where there would have been people coming and going.

"I would like to hear from anyone who was in the area and saw anything suspicious, particularly anyone who saw a man matching the description.

"Many cars were in the area and we would urge anyone with a dash cam to check their footage to see if this man may have been captured."

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting 21*85912.
