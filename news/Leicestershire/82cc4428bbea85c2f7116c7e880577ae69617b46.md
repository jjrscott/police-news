Detectives are continuing their investigation into the circumstances surrounding a fire at a derelict building in Loughborough.

Officers were called by Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service at around 8.40pm on Friday evening (23 October) to assist with road closures in the Fennel Street area.

The fire was extinguished by the fire service having caused significant damage.

Following a subsequent search of the building, the body of a man was found inside. A post-mortem examination has been carried out and the death is being treated as unexplained.

The deceased has been formally identified and officers are supporting his family through the investigation.

The area was cordoned off over the weekend. Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service has concluded its investigation at the scene and the cordon has since been lifted.

Detective Inspector Mark Parish from the force's serious crime team said: "Our enquiries to establish the circumstances surrounding the man's death are ongoing.

"We know there were people in the area at the time and we would like to speak to anyone who hasn't yet spoken with officers to get in touch.

"Also if you were driving in the area and have video recording equipment installed in your vehicle we would ask that you check the footage from Friday evening and contact us if you captured anything which may assist."

Anyone with any information is asked to contact 101 quoting incident 554 of 23 October or online via www.leics.police.uk
