Police officers and staff continue to provide 24/7 service to the public throughout the Christmas and New Year period.

However, this year is totally different to any others due to the Covid Pandemic. Leicester and Leicestershire remain in Tier 3 and only on Christmas day were households allowed to join up.

The majority of people adhered to the guidelines with a very small minority being issued with a fixed penalty notice for breaching the guidelines.

As a result between Christmas Eve and Boxing Day police issued six fines to the total value of Â£1,200. The fines were issued as a result of vehicle checks.

In addition police also received 95 reports of Covid breaches by the public.

Assistant Chief Constable Kerry Smith said: "Many officers and staff have given up their Christmas Day celebrations to work these holidays in order to keep people safe. This year has been unique in every way due to the pandemic and the restrictions placed on our communities.

We continue to police throughout, dealing with day to day crime as well as policing the pandemic.

A small number of people chose to ignore the rules and have had a Christmas present from us of a fine. My officers were away from their families on Christmas Day, providing a service throughout the day and night despite the risks.

We continue to work with our partners, and the public to keep everyone safe throughout the Christmas and New Year Period."
