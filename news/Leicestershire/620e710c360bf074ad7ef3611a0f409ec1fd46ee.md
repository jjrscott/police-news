Officers are appealing for information after a reported assault in Leicester on Friday 1 January.

Around 3.30am three men were reported to have been assaulted by two men in the front garden of a property near the junction of Marwood Road and Wheatley Road.

One of the men suffered a broken jaw and damage to his teeth.

The men who carried out the assault reportedly left the scene on foot in the direction of Wheatley Road.

Both men are described as mixed race and in their late 20s.

One is described as 5'6 and dressed in a dark tracksuit.

The other is described as 6' with a chunky build and black hair that was shaved very closely on the sides and longer on top. He was wearing a yellow or silver sporty jacket.

Officers would also like to speak to a female, also mixed race and around 5'5\. She was wearing pink and white pyjamas.

Trainee Detective Lauren Speight from CID at Beaumont Leys Police Station said: "Our enquiries are continuing to establish the full circumstances.

"This happened in the early hours and caused a loud disturbance within the street.

"I believe there are witnesses out there who have seen this and may be able to help identify who is responsible.

"We are urging anyone with information to make contact with the police."
