Officers investigating a hate crime during which Hare Krishna worshippers were verbally abused and spat at are appealing for anyone with footage to come forward.

It happened close to the clock tower in Leicester city centre between 4.50pm and 5.05pm on Wednesday 9 December. Books used by the worshippers were also damaged and a container containing change was kicked.

Following enquiries carried out to date, it is believed some people in the area may have filmed the incident on their mobile phones.

A 30-year-old woman from Leicester was later arrested on suspicion of common assault, religiously aggravated public order and criminal damage.

She was subsequently released on bail.

PC Luke Eden-Walker, the investigating officer, said: "This incident happened in the middle of the city centre when an evening where people will have been out shopping or perhaps making their way home from work.

"I would, therefore, like to speak to anyone witnessed it. From my enquiries so far, I believe some people may have filmed the incident on their mobile phones.

"If you were one of those people, then please get in touch. Any information or footage you can provide could help my investigation."
