Items used as weapons - including blades and cricket stumps - were seized by officers during a proactive operation to tackle robberies and violent crime across the East Leicester Neighbourhood Policing Area (NPA).

Running over two-week period, Operation Vocal also resulted in drugs and vehicles linked to crime being recovered.

In addition to this, more than 20 people believed to be involved in organised crime were visited, along with their family members.

Officers engaged with those people and provided support and advice as well as signposting them to other agencies for further help.

The patrols involved both uniformed officers and plain-clothed detectives.

In total:

• 21 people were stopped and searched in areas and at relevant times when robberies have been known to take place
• Eight people were found to be in possession of drugs and six people in possession of weapons - all of which were seized
• 11 people were arrested for a range of offences - including assault, possession of offensive weapons and possession of drugs
• More than 20 vehicles were stopped - three of which were seized after it was found no insurance was in place, one of which was found to be stolen
• Items including a police stab vest, blades, cricket stumps and other adapted weapons were also seized

Detective Sergeant Des Hearnshaw, from East Leicester CID, oversaw the operation.

He said: "This proactive operation was in response to a number of incidents that have happened across the NPA in recent months."

"As a result of our work, a number of people were stopped, weapons and drugs have been taken off our streets. I hope this can provide some reassurance to our communities."

"However, our officers were also proactive in engaging with people believed to be involved in crime."

"This approach allows us to take positive steps in identifying those at risk and provide help and support, as well as referring them to other organisations that can assist in turning them away from such a lifestyle."

"In addition, we will continue to listen to any concerns and take appropriate action."
