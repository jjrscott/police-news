Incident number: 19*183660

Detectives investigating the theft of bicycles are urging anyone who has seen or been offered one for sale to come forward.

The bikes, which belong to British Cycling, were stolen from an outbuilding at New College in Glenfield Road, Leicester overnight between 10 and 11 April.

Seven bikes were discarded nearby. It is believed the incident happened between 6pm and 8am.

The bikes were due to be used by students and four classes had to be cancelled as a result of them being stolen. They are:

 * Six Hoy disc brake bikes
 * Six Pinnacle MTB small bikes
 * Three Pinnacle MTB medium bikes - and one of which was still boxed
 * Two Hoy 24-inch V-brake bikes
 * Two Hoy Meadow Hills CX 24-inch bikes
 * Two Pinnacle CX bikes
 * One Pinnacle CX women's bike
 * One Mini Rocker BMX
 * One Voodoo BMX

Four Hoy 24-inch V-brake bikes and one Pinnacle CX bike were recovered nearby.

Detective Constable Gina Baxter, the investigating officer, said: "If you recognise any of the bikes pictured, have seen or been offered them for sale or have seen one being used, then please get in touch. Many of the bikes are quite distinctive in their appearance.

"The fact they have been taken has had a significant impact on the college, who have had to cancel classes as a result.

"If you have any information that could help my investigation, no matter how insignificant you think it may be, then please contact me."

Call 101, quoting crime number 19*183660.
