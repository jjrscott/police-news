Officers are appealing for witnesses after the occupants of two vehicles were involved in an altercation in Leicester.

The incident took place in Aylestone Road, near to the junction with Wigston Lane, around 11.40am on Thursday 12 November.

It's believed the driver of a van approached a Nissan Micra which was in front of his vehicle and made gestures towards the driver suggesting he was going to punch her.

No one was injured during the incident but the victim was left very distressed by the incident.

The incident took place in broad daylight in a busy road and there were a number of people in the area at the time.

Enquiries so far suggest that the incident may have been recorded by a passer-by on their mobile phone, officers would like to speak to that person as they may be able to assist with their enquiries.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact PC 1026 Azmil Shaffi on 101, quoting crime number 20*599228.
