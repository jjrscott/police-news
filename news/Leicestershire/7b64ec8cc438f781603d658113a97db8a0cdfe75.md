The 'What Matters to You' Roadshow with Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner Kirk Master and Deputy Chief Constable Rob Nixon will be in Highcross Shopping Centre, Leicester later this week (Fri 10 May) to hear first-hand what local people have to say about policing.

The event will take place between 11am and 1pm and the pair will be joined by members of the local policing team.

These events are designed to give members of public the opportunity to meet both the Deputy PCC and the Deputy Chief Constable and talk to them about policing in the area. They will be invited to share their experiences with those setting policing priorities and give their views on crime and public safety.

Public feedback is vital to both the PCC and senior officers as they seek to meet the policing needs and expectations of different communities. The feedback they receive helps to influence where resources are allocated.

Kirk Master said: "These events are always well-attended and provide a great opportunity for a real two-way conversation about policing, community safety and any concerns that people may have. We all learn something.

"We will be around throughout the afternoon to chat to people and talk about local concerns. We really do want to hear what matters to people and what they feel we can do to help. If you are in the area please, pay us a visit!"
