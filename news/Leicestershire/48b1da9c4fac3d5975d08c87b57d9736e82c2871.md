A 29-year-old man has been charged with the murder of Suvekshya Burathoki.

Hafiz Sharifi, of no fixed address, was arrested at an address in Coventry yesterday (Thursday 10 October).

He has been remanded in custody and will appear at Leicester Magistrates' Court tomorrow (Saturday).

On Tuesday (8 October), police were called to an address in Bartholomew Street, Leicester, following a report that a woman was seriously injured. Suvekshya, known as Fatima, was found inside the property. She was pronounced dead at the scene.

Two others - a 30-year-old man and a 33-year-old woman - were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender and have been released under investigation.
