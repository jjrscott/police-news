A woman was left injured when she was assaulted by a man in Aylestone Meadows, Leicestershire.

Officers are appealing for witnesses to the incident which happened at around 4pm on Friday 31 May. This includes a cyclist who it is believed was near the area at the time.

The victim had gone into the Meadows by the Aylestone Road entrance. She had passed the car park on her right and walked down a path to her left. She was sat on a bench in this area when she was approached by a man who assaulted her.

It is understood another man was pushing his bicycle in the area at the time and it is believed this may have led to the suspect then leaving the scene.

The woman suffered injuries in the incident including scratches to her arms.

Nothing was stolen. It is not known if any kind of weapon was used.

Enquiries remain ongoing into the incident and officers are appealing for any further information.

Police Constable Nathan Birkin said: "We are particularly keen to speak to the cyclist who was in the area as he could have information to help us in our enquiries.

"We would also ask anyone else who was in the area on Friday afternoon to think back to if they saw or heard anything which caused them concern.

"If you have any information at all which you think could help, then please get in touch."
