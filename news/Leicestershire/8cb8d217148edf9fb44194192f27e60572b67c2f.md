PC Julie Watkins, the investigating officer, said: "The children were not physically harmed but left understandably shaken by the incident.

"We have spoken to the children involved and would be keen to speak to this man to establish the full circumstances around what happened and the events leading up to it so I would urge him to get in touch.

"Alternatively, I would like to speak to anyone who may have seen what happened or who knows this man. Anyone with information is urged to get in touch with us."
