A 25-year-old man who was travelling from the West Midlands to sell class A drugs in Leicestershire has been jailed for three years.

Nathan Williams, from Earlsdon Avenue North, Coventry, sold heroin and cocaine on the streets of Loughborough to plain clothes officers in October 2018.

Across a 10-day period, Williams supplied drugs seven times on three different dates.

Between the 15 October and 14 December last year, he also sent eight text messages to the officers marketing the sale of his gear.

As part of Operation Lionheart - the force's response to tackling the sale and distribution of class A drugs, Williams was charged with 15 drugs offences - seven counts of supplying class A drugs and eight counts of offering to supply class A drugs.

At Leicester Crown Court on Friday (29 November) he was sentenced to three year in prison after pleading guilty to all of the offences at a previously hearing.
