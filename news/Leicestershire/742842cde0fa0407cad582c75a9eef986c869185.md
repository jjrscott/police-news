Officers from the force's Economic Crime Unit have arrested two people in Leicester as part of an investigation into an alleged 'safe account scam'.

Searches were carried out at three properties in the Spinney Hills, Glen Parva and Thorpe Astley areas on Thursday 10 December.

A 27-year-old man from Leicester and a 39-year-old woman from Leicester were arrested on suspicion of fraud. Both were released under investigation.

A second woman, 32 years old, was voluntarily interviewed.

Enquiries are ongoing.

A 'safe account scam' is where a suspect allegedly contacts a victim pretending to be from the victim's bank and urges them to move their money because their account is not safe.

The victim is persuaded into transferring their money into an account controlled by the suspect.

Anyone who believes they are a victim of a similar scam is urged to contact police on 101.
