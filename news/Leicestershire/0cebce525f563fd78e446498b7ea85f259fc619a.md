Officers have released photographs of five dogs who have been stolen from kennels on Walcote Road, South Kilworth and are appealing for information to help find them.

Between 5pm on Wednesday 17 February and 7.30am on Thursday 18 February entry was gained to the property via a hedgerow and two male and three female Basset Hounds were stolen.

All the dogs - Landlord, Bashful, Lattice, Drama and Banish - were microchipped.

Sergeant Paul Archer said: "This is another upsetting incident for the owners of these dogs and we are carrying out investigations to try and find them.

"We would urge anyone who has seen the dogs or has any information that could help us find them to get in touch.

"We would also ask all dog owners - and particularly those operating kennels - to ensure their property is secure.

"Anyone with any information is asked to call 101 quoting reference 21*97226.
