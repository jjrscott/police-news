We are aware of the announcement made today that the inquiry into how institutions responded to allegations of child sexual abuse relating to the late Leicester MP Lord Janner of Braunstone QC will now be held partly in closed session.

A hearing examining how Leicestershire Police, and other institutions, responded to allegations that Lord Janner sexually abused children is due to be held on 12 October.

At a preliminary hearing last month, lawyers for the Inquiry explained that, for legal reasons, the full hearing could not go ahead in the form that had been originally planned.

Today the chair of the Panel has announced that the hearings will be held partly in closed session.

The Chief Constable of Leicestershire Police, Simon Cole QPM, said he respected the decision reached by the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse which had been made in "difficult and unenviable" circumstances.

He said: "We have consistently supported the need for a full and thorough examination of how all public bodies responded to the allegations made against Lord Janner."

He added: "We will continue to assist the inquiry in its work, will have regard to any recommendations which the Panel may make, and will continue to investigate allegations of child sexual abuse with determination, professionalism and sensitivity."
