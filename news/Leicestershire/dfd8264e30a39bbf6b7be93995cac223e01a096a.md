A man from Birmingham, who was selling drugs on the streets of Loughborough, has been jailed for more than four years.

Between 26 May and 6 July 2018, Nathaniel Samuels, currently of HMP Nottingham, sent numerous text messages to a plain clothes officer working as part of Operation Lionheart - marketing the supply of class A drugs.

On four occasions between these dates, the 28-year-old sold cocaine and heroin to the officer, in the Queen's Park area of the town.

During three of the deals he was seen in possession of multiple wraps of drugs - up to 30 on one occasion - he also intended to sell.

At Leicester Crown Court on Tuesday (24 September) Samuels was jailed for four years and eight months after pleading guilty at an earlier hearing to 23 offences - 14 counts of offering to supply class A drugs, six counts of supplying class A drugs and three counts of possession with intent to supply class A drugs.

He was given a prison sentence for supplying the drugs but the other 17 offences were taken into account by the judge when determining the length of time Samuels will serve.

At the time the offences occurred, Samuels was living in Birmingham but was selling and distributing cocaine and heroin in the Loughborough area.

When he was arrested for offences in April of this year as part of Operation Lionheart, the defendant was already in jail for unrelated drug offences.

This latest 56 month sentence will run consecutively to the one he is already serving.
