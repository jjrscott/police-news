Officers from the Hinckley and Blaby Neighbourhood Policing Area (NPA) are appealing for public help following a spate of criminal damage in Earl Shilton.

This morning (Thursday 18 February), a number vehicles parked in Doctors Fields had their windows damaged. It is not known who is responsible, but it is believed the damage was caused by the same person or people.

Among the vehicles damaged were a Volkswagen Caddy van, a Mercedes Sprinter van, a Vauxhall Astra, a Vauxhall Corsa, a Honda Civic, a Mazda 2 Capella and a Renault Megane.

PC Rachael Hughes, the investigating officer, said: "I believe the vehicles were damaged between 4.30am and 5am and would like to speak to anyone who saw what happened. Did you hear anyone or any noises outside that drew your attention?

"I am particularly keen to speak to anyone who has a video doorbell or CCTV installed at their property, as footage may have been captured.

"Any information you're able to provide could help my investigation."
