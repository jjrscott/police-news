Melvin Shephard's widow, Margaret Shephard, has released the following statement since the sentencing of Matthew Allen.

"Mel was a loving husband, the life and soul of the party and a man who adored his family.

"He is sadly missed by so many people who all have their own tale to tell.

"He was a popular man who would do anything for anyone. He loved all sport, was an avid Leicester City fan and a passionate golfer. He enjoyed socialising but equally loved spending time at home with his family. He was a prankster who took great delight in playing tricks on friends and family and is deeply missed by us all.

"He loved visiting garden centres to look for fish he could add to the pond which he'd finished shortly before his death.

"He was looking forward to a taking a cruise to Gran Canaria - a surprise for me that he booked a week before he passed away.

"It is very hard knowing Mel will never walk through the door again.

"Matthew Allen has a lot to answer for. He has robbed me of my partner of 28 years and his sisters of a beloved brother.

"Since Mel's untimely death he has shown no remorse for what he did and for two years we've had to try to come to terms with our loss.

"He refused to admit his culpability until two weeks before going to court when he changed his plea to guilty - therefore receiving a lesser sentence.

"His actions have left myself and the family feeling we are serving a life sentence. We've not been able to try to move on with our lives.

"Mel was killed on the road where he lived and it is a constant reminder to me every time I look out of the window.

"Nothing can take away the intense feeling of loss since his death. Mel was my soulmate.

"He will always be deeply missed by everyone who knew him."

Valerie Onions has released the following tribute to her brother, Melvin Shephard.

"My brother, Mel, was a popular, hardworking man with a huge sense of humour.

"He was generous to a fault, kind, loyal and had the biggest heart.

"He loved to socialise and play golf. He loved his home, his garden and spending time with his wife, Margaret, and his family.

"Mel liked to travel - taking many trips to visit family in Malta. In May 2018 we went - as a family - to a wedding in Greece. We had so much fun and made many happy memories. I hadn't holidayed with my brother since we were children - I never imagined it would have been Mel's last.

"He had retired from working nights and was looking forward to having time on his hands to enjoy doing what he loved most in life.

"My brother was killed as he walked home after spending a night out with friends. He was seconds from his front door.

"Two years have passed since that fateful day and I can't stop wondering if things might have been different if Matthew Allen had stopped and called for help. My brother might still have been here today.

"We have been left heartbroken since we lost Mel and unable to grieve with the court case hanging over our heads.

"He will remain always in our hearts and minds and never be forgotten."
