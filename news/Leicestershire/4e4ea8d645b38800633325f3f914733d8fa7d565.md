Detectives are teaming up with neighbourhood officers to carry out a proactive operation across the next month aimed at tackling violent crime and providing immediate support to victims.

The operation, which starts today (Monday), will see a detective deployed to support a neighbourhood officer on an evening shift during attendance at reports of robberies and incidents involving knife crime or other violent crime.

The operation will be carried out across the force area focussing on places where levels of violent crime is a concern and will see a different detective and neighbourhood officer teaming up each evening.

By working together in this way at the scene of incidents and providing additional investigative support, it is hoped that opportunities during the early stages of investigation at incidents can be maximised. This includes providing additional support to secure victim engagement, capture evidence and establish early identification of offenders.

A similar operation carried out at the end of last year saw more than 20 arrests made during six weeks of activity (https://www.leics.police.uk/news/leicestershire/news/2020/november/more-than-20-arrests-during-operation-to-tackle-violent-crime/?fbclid=IwAR2cHqRAJtv25HTY6375GXQXxpyY2zqRVRMwptKRrFBg34-5ZNwTt8wX68w)

Detective Inspector Mark Parish said: "Our neighbourhood officers already do outstanding work at the scenes of incidents of violent crime supporting victims, finding offenders and securing evidence; all while working to ensure members of the community are kept safe.

"By teaming up in this way and providing additional investigative support at the scene from our detectives, it is hoped we can help to continue to develop on this outstanding work by providing further resource to assist with capturing evidence at the early stages, finding offenders and, most importantly, ensuring full safeguarding is immediately in place for victims and that they feel supported and reassured to assist us in the investigation.

"We continue to work and develop new ways to effectively tackle violent crime and to keep our communities safe. Please continue to work with us by making contact with us if you have any information in relation to an incident of violent crime or regarding any concerns you have."
