Officers are appealing for witnesses after a man tried to rob two people in the Abbey Meadows area of Leicester.

The incident took place sometime between 9.30pm and 10pm on Saturday (6 February). Two men, aged 28 and 32, were walking along the path which runs behind the Space Centre and the River Soar when they were approached by a man on a bike.

He threatened them with a knife and demanded their mobile telephones. Both victims managed to get away. Nothing was stolen and one victim sustained a minor injury to his hand during the incident.

The suspect has been described as being white, about 5ft 8ins tall and of medium build. He was wearing dark clothing, black face mask and black cap. He was riding a black mountain bike.

Officers would like to speak to anyone who may have witnessed the incident or been approached in a similar way. It's believed the area the incident took place in is used regularly by dog walkers and joggers.

Anyone who can assist with the investigation is asked to contact PC 4463 Janine Tunnicliffe on 101, quoting crime number 21*79703 or report online via www.leics.police.uk
