A 30-year-old man has been charged with six offences following a break-in and collision in Evington.

Ashish Devshi, of Green Lane Road, Leicester, has been charged with causing serious injury by dangerous driving, driving while disqualified, driving with no insurance, failing to stop for police, attempted burglary and aggravated vehicle taking.

It follows a report of a burglary in progress at a premises in Coleman Road at around 8.15am on Sunday 18 August.

Officers arrived and the suspect left the scene in a vehicle which was then in collision with a cyclist in Smith Dorrien Road. He remains critical but stable in hospital.

As police were responding to an incident prior to the collision, a mandatory referral has been made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).

Devshi will be appearing at Leicester Magistrates' Court today (20 August).
