Police have donated 11 mountains bikes to a Scout facility near Ashby after thieves broke-in to their storage unit.

Willesley Scout Campsite is used by Scout groups across the city and counties as a place for children aged 10 to 14 to take part in a range of outdoor activities.

Earlier this month a number of bikes were stolen from a storage container in the area, leaving young people without access to some of the vital equipment used on the site.

To ensure groups did not miss out, the local police team arranged for 11 bikes seized from criminals but not claimed back by owners to be donated by the force.

Inspector Rich Jackson, Commander for the North West Leicestershire neighbourhood policing area, said: "It's important now more than ever that kids are able to enjoy outdoor space when there is an opportunity.

"When the bikes were stolen from the site the team wanted to do something to help while the theft of the property was being investigated.

"We are so pleased the force has been able to donate these bikes. Despite our best efforts the ones donated have never been reclaimed so it's great to see them going to good use."

PC Ady Coleman is a local officer but also the warden at Willesley Scout Campsite. He said: "These replacement bike will allow us to offer young people from Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland the chance to experience mountain biking as soon as the covid situation improves.

"We are very grateful for the help that Leicestershire Police has been able to offer us."
