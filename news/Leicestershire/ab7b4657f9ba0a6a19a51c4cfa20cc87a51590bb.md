A Leicester man who assaulted his ex-partner in Leicester city centre has been jailed.

Leroy James, 37, was sentenced to 33 months imprisonment at Leicester Crown Court today (Thursday 20 August).

He was also given a four-year restraining order, forbidding him from contacting his victim.

Yesterday (Wednesday) James, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty to one count of causing grievous bodily harm.

The incident happened at a flat in the city on 21 February this year. Police were called after a member of the public noticed the victim had significant facial injuries and was struggling to walk.

After speaking to officers, she confirmed she had been assaulted by James - who she was in a relationship with at the time - and he was promptly arrested.

Detective Constable Jack Chester, from the force's Domestic Abuse Investigation Unit (DAIU), was the investigating officer. He said: "The victim in this case originally said she'd been assaulted by a group of women. However, after realising that James could have killed her, she disclosed what had happened.

"I am pleased that James has admitted his crimes and as a result is now serving a custodial sentence, which means he cannot harm others who he has formed relationships with.

"I hope he takes time to reflect on the severity of his crimes."
