Detectives investigating a collision in Saffron Lane earlier this month have made two further arrests.

Yesterday (Tuesday 23 February) a 33-year-old man from Whetstone was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and has since been released on bail.

A 52-year-old man from Leicester was arrested on suspicion of violent disorder. He has been released under investigation.

Shortly before 10pm on Sunday 14 February, a call was received stating a pedestrian - a man - had been hit by a vehicle close to the junction with Shakespeare Street. The car had then left the area.

Prior to the collision occurring, it was also reported that a number of people had been fighting in the street.

Detective Sergeant Jenny Tattersall said: "Our investigation is ongoing and while we have made two further arrests, I would still ask anyone who has information but has not yet come forward to do so."

 * Following the incident, three men aged 33, 32 and 31 were arrested on suspicion of affray and later released pending further enquiries. A 32-year-old man from Leicester was later charged with possessing a knife blade/sharp-pointed article in a public place
