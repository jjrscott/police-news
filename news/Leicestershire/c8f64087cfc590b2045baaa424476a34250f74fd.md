The public are being warned to remain vigilant after an elderly man in Glenfield was the victim of a distraction burglary.

The incident took place in a property in the Branting Hill Avenue area between 7.15pm and 7.30pm yesterday (4 June) when a man wearing a high visibility jacket, knocked on the door of the house and claimed that someone was trying to break in at the back.

The victim, believing the man was a police officer, let the man in.

While inside a second man entered as the victim was distracted and a wallet containing a quantity of cash was stolen from the address.

A similar incident was reported when two men knocked on the door of an address around 7.40pm last night in Flaxfield Close, Groby.

The men, described as white, of stocky build, aged in their late twenties to early thirties and in dark clothing, claimed to be from the police and were chasing someone who was in the man's back garden.

The men didn't enter the address and are believed to have left the area in a red vehicle.

Were you visited in similar circumstances or did you see anyone matching the descriptions of the suspects in the Glenfield or Groby yesterday?

If you have any information then please contact 101, quoting crime number 19*287331.

We'd like to take this opportunity to remind people to never let any visitors into their homes if they are unsure of their identity and use a door chain when answering the door if they are unsure. A police officer will always carry valid ID and if you are in any doubt don't let them in and call police on 101 to verify their identity.
