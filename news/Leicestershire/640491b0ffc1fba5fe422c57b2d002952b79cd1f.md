Officers are reminding people that support remains in place for victims of domestic abuse - as well as for those who are using abusive behaviour and want to stop it.

Leicestershire Police has been working with partner agencies to continually raise awareness of domestic abuse and the support and help which is available to those who may be currently suffering at home - particularly during the recent lockdown period.

But the force is also reminding people who may be worried that they themselves are causing harm or fear to members of their family, that support is also accessible.

The Jenkins Centre, a Leicester City Council commissioned project delivered by the charity FreeVA (Free from Violence and Abuse) for UAVA (United Against Violence and Abuse), is an example of this support. Programmes are available to help people using abusive behaviour in their relationships to make changes.

The Respect helpline, a national support line, is another example. A person can speak to a friendly helpline advisor who will listen without judgement and give honest advice.

Detective Chief Inspector Lucy Batchelor, the force lead for domestic abuse said: "With lockdown restrictions remaining in place in some areas and easing in others, many people are still at home more than usual. It may be that domestic abuse was happening in the home before the lockdown started, or it may have developed during it. Either way, it is not acceptable.

"We have been sharing messages about the help and support which is available for victims of domestic abuse but we also want people to remember that there is also support for people who are concerned about their own behaviour and the harm or fear which they may be causing to their partner or a member of their family.

"There is no excuse for abuse and it is always the responsibility of the perpetrator to make it stop - but it may be that you know your behaviour is not acceptable and you do want to stop it but you need help to do this. Support is available to you to talk with you about what is happening, to help develop your coping skills and to change your behaviour.

"If you are using abusive behaviour, you need to take that step to change now. Think about the impact your behaviour is having on those that you love and accept that it is your responsibility to change your ways and access this professional help which is available to you."
