Officers are currently at the scene of a serious collision involving two lorries on the M1 southbound in Leicestershire.

Police were called to the scene close to junction 21a at Leicester Forest East at 7.04pm today (Friday 11 December).

Colleagues from the East Midlands Ambulance Service and Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service were also called to the incident.

The M1 has been closed southbound at junction 22 and will remain closed overnight. Motorists are advised to seek an alternative route.

The A46 which was closed at the Groby junction has since been reopened.
