The family of Bhavini Pravin have issued the following tribute to a "beautiful girl".

It reads:

As a family we could never have imagined that one day we would be issuing a tribute to Bhavini under such circumstances.

Our world has been ripped apart by her death and we can't believe she has gone.

A light has gone out in our lives.

Bhavini was a devoted daughter and sister, loved by all who knew her.

She was beautiful, kind and sweet. Our lives will never be the same without her.

All we can hope for is Bhavini to be at peace and for our request for privacy to be respected.
