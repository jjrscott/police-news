Two suspected thieves have been arrested after police tracked down a haul of stolen goods – that had been advertised for sale on social media.

It follows a report that intruders had targeted the Green Man pub in Newcastle city centre on the evening of December 6.

A haul of items were stolen during the break-in including alcohol, beer pumps, a beer keg, handheld radios and guitars.

But on Monday – more than two weeks after the burglary - a number of the items were spotted for sale on Facebook Marketplace.

Officers from Northumbria Police’s Operation Benelli team organised to purchase the goods and attended an address on Essex Close in Elswick.

There they found a haul of suspected stolen goods which were recovered, many belonging to the Green Man which will now be returned.

A 52-year-old man and 40-year-old woman who were at the address were arrested on suspicion of handling stolen goods.

Today (Wednesday) the officer who oversaw the investigation has warned thieves we will stop at no costs to safeguard communities.

Detective Inspector Ash Loader, of Northumbria Police, said: “This was a great job by our Operation Benelli team who organised to purchase these goods.

“They posed as buyers and were able to organise a pick-up but upon arrival at the address they revealed their true identities and placed the sellers under arrest.

“A full investigation to establish whether or not they are responsible for the burglary is ongoing but the victim is delighted their property will now be returned.

“This year has been a difficult time for our region’s businesses who have struggled to stay afloat during the Coronavirus pandemic.

“The last thing they need is to be targeted by thieves and we hope that these arrests reassure people we take burglaries and theft seriously.”

The two people arrested have since been released on bail pending further enquiries.

Anyone who has information they want to report to Northumbria Police can do so through the ‘Tell Us Something’ pages of their website.
