A major police operation was launched this morning following a series of smashes in North Tyneside

Drivers have been urged to take extra care on the roads after an icy blast caused a succession of crashes involving 17 vehicles.

Significant disruption was caused on the Coast Road in North Tyneside this morning after sub-zero temperatures overnight led to adverse conditions during rush-hour.

Emergency services were called to four separate incidents within a matter of hours on the eastbound and westbound carriageways between Middle Engine Lane and Billy Mill – with the road closed in both directions as a result.

In total, 17 cars were damaged as a result of collisions on that road alone – sparking a major police operation. Thankfully nobody was seriously injured.

With snow and sub-zero temperatures again expected this evening and into the weekend, police have reminded motorists to drive to the conditions and take extra caution when heading out on the regions’ roads.

Inspector Lynne Mckevitt, of Northumbria Police’s Motor Patrols Department, said: “It was a very challenging and busy morning for all involved following a number of crashes on the Coast Road.

“It is sheer luck that nobody was seriously injured, at a time when the NHS and blue-light services are already stretched.

“All 17 vehicles involved in the various incidents have now been recovered and the roads cleared. I would like to thank everyone for their patience and cooperation, as well as all emergency service personnel for their swift response.

“This is an important reminder that everyone must drive to the conditions. It is expected to be icy again this evening and over the weekend, so please take that into consideration, and think carefully about whether you need to get behind the wheel.

“Please leave yourself extra time to make your journey, drive at a safe speed and leave an increased distance between you and the vehicle in front.

“The safety of all road users is imperative, and in line with the current Government guidance, I would ask people to only travel if absolutely necessary.”
