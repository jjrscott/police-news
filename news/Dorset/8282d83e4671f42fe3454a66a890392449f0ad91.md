# Police warning following spate of thefts from motor vehicles in Weymouth and Portland

27 October 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating a spate of thefts from motor vehicles in Weymouth and Portland are reminding people not to leave valuables in their unattended vehicles.

Over the past week there have been 15 reports of thefts from motor vehicles in Weymouth alone, with three incidents reported to police in Oakbury Drive, Bowleaze Coveway and Wyke Oliver Road on Thursday 26 October 2017.

Detective Constable Nick Hodge, of Weymouth CID, said: "A large number of the thefts we are investigating are as a result of the occupants leaving items on display or leaving windows open and doors unlocked. Just by taking simple precautions, residents and visitors to the county could significantly reduce the chance of being a victim of opportunist theft from their vehicle.

"We regularly arrest and prosecute prolific offenders, however criminals continue to target vehicles across the county, whether at a beauty spot, a roadside or on a residential driveway.

"I would also appeal to anyone who has any information that could assist with our investigation into these thefts across the borough to please contact Dorset Police."

A convicted car thief from Dorset gave this advice to motorists on how to avoid being a victim of crime: "When I'm looking at a car, I'm looking at what kind of security it's got, I'm looking at whether it's going to be something quick and easy or if it's going to take a bit of time.

"Stickers, security signs, visible alarm systems, steering locks, gearstick or handbrake locks - those type of security measures tell me that this person has gone out of their way to secure their car. They are more forward-thinking so would be less likely to leave anything of value in their car - I would be less motivated to do it.

"If your car is clean, looks secure, looks empty, I'm probably just going to walk off and go to the next car. If I walk down the street and every car is like that, I'll then move to a different street, and then a different area."
