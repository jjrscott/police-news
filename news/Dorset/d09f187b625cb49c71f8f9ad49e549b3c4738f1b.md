# Update â€“ investigation into the death of Emiliano Sala

19 June 2019

* * *

Detectives investigating the death of professional footballer Emiliano Sala have confirmed that a man has been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter by an unlawful act.

Mr Sala's body was brought to Portland Port in Dorset on Thursday 7 February 2019 and detectives from Dorset Police have been carrying out enquiries into the circumstances of the death on behalf of HM Coroner.

Family liaison officers have continued to update the families of Mr Sala and David Ibbotson, the pilot of the plane that lost contact with Air Traffic Control north of Guernsey when flying from Nantes to Cardiff on Monday 21 January 2019.

Detective Inspector Simon Huxter, of Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT), said: "We have carried out a wide-ranging investigation into the circumstances of the death of Mr Sala and continue to work with partner agencies including the Civil Aviation Authority.

"As part of this investigation we have to consider whether there is any evidence of any suspected criminality and as a result of our enquiries we have today, Wednesday 19 June 2019, arrested a 64-year-old man from the North Yorkshire area on suspicion of manslaughter by an unlawful act. He is assisting with our enquiries and has been released from custody under investigation.

"This matter therefore is still subject to a live investigation and I would ask the media and members of the public to refrain from speculation, as this could cause additional distress to the families involved as well as potentially hinder the investigation.

"As is standard practice, we will not be releasing any further information as to the identity of the individual who has been arrested unless that person is charged to appear in court and again would discourage any speculation in relation to this."
