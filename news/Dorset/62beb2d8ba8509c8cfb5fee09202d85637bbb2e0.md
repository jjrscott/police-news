# Message to communities and visitors â€“ enjoy the warm weather safely

29 July 2020

* * *

Dorset Police is urging people to enjoy the warm weather expected in the coming days in a safe and responsible way as it steps up preparations to cope with the increased demand on its service.

The Force has already seen an increase in demand recently, with more than 3,000 incidents attended over the past two weeks - 20 per cent above average. This is anticipated to rise even further with the sunny weather forecast over the next few days and into the weekend.

Superintendent Richard Bell, the Force's silver commander for summer policing, said: "We have been working with partners throughout recent weeks to ensure we have a detailed plan in place to cope with the expected influx of visitors to our county during sunny spells this summer.

"We are all keen to welcome visitors to our area but we want to ensure people enjoy what Dorset has to offer in a safe, respectful and responsible manner that does not place an additional strain on all emergency services and public resources.

"We have been putting additional resources in place, including high visibility patrols at key hotspots, and this will continue throughout the summer.

"However, it may be that at times of peak demand we will have to prioritise the deployment of our officers and resources to those communities and locations which are most vulnerable, threatened or at risk of harm.

"Members of the public can help us to manage the level of demand by acting in a sensible manner and taking a moment to think before they call the police if it is not an emergency. Sadly we do get a number of nuisance or unnecessary calls into our control room and these can be a drain on our resources, particularly during busy periods.

"If you do have a matter that needs reporting and is not urgent, consider using the 'Do it Online' facility at www.dorset.police.uk or email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk.

"Clearly, if life is in danger or a crime is in progress, we would always urge people to call 999 immediately."
