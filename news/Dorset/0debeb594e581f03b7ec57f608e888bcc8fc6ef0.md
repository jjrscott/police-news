A man is due to appear in court in connection with a fatal road traffic collision near Dorchester.

At 2.42pm on Tuesday 31 July 2018 Dorset Police was called to a report of a collision involving a black Land Rover Discovery and a blue Aprilia motorcycle on Warmwell Road in Crossways.

The rider of the motorcycle, named by his family as 51-year-old Mark Coombs of Weymouth, sustained serious injuries and was taken to Southampton General Hospital where he sadly died.

The driver of the Land Rover, a man aged in his 40s, was uninjured.

Following an investigation by the traffic unit, a 40-year-old man from Coventry has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Monday 25 March 2019 for an offence of causing death by careless driving.
