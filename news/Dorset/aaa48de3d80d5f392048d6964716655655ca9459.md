# Death of man in Weymouth â€“ further update

17 September 2019

* * *

A 38-year-old man arrested in connection with the death of a man in Weymouth has been released from custody while enquiries continue.

Dorset Police was called at 10.17am on Saturday 7 September 2019 by the ambulance service following reports of the sudden death of a 75-year-old man at an address on The Esplanade in Weymouth.

The death was initially treated as unexplained and enquiries into the circumstances surrounding the death have been carried out by detectives from the Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT).

A post-mortem examination took place on the afternoon of Thursday 12 September 2019. Further neurology and toxicology tests have been requested before a cause of death can be given, but the pathologist stated that the victim suffered injuries that are believed to be consistent with an assault. Following the conclusion of the post-mortem examination and as a result of further extensive enquiries, detectives launched a murder investigation.

A 38-year old Weymouth man who was arrested on suspicion of murder has been released on police bail while enquiries continue.

A 28-year-old woman of no fixed abode, who was known to the victim and had been arrested on suspicion of murder, remains on bail. A 37-year-old Weymouth man, who was arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender, remains released under investigation.

Detective Chief Inspector Rich Dixey, of MCIT, said: "I am continuing to urge anyone who has any information that may be relevant to my investigation to please come forward.

"I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed or heard anything suspicious in the area of The Esplanade, to the rear of Alexandra Gardens, on the morning of Saturday 7 September 2019."
