# Dog bite incident in Wimborne â€“ witness appeal

22 March 2021

* * *

Officers investigating a dog bite incident in Wimborne are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward.

At around 12.15pm on Thursday 18 March 2021 the victim, a local man aged in his 70s, was walking along the river path next to the River Stour and opposite Canford School near to Brook Road.

He noticed a woman sat on a bench with an Alsatian or German Shepherd-type dog on a lead. The woman was on her phone and when she saw the victim she got up and walked to the other side of the bench.

It is reported that as the victim walked past the woman struggled to control the dog and it bit him on the bottom twice.

The victim turned around, but the dog was barking and bearing its teeth at him so he left the scene and did not take the owners details.

The owner is described as white, five feet 10 inches tall, of slim build and aged in her 30s. She had medium-length light brown hair and was wearing blue jeans.

The dog was mainly grey in colour, possibly with black colouring.

Police Constable Jennie Sykes-Martin, of Dorset Police, said: "I am appealing for the owner or anyone who recognises her or the dog described to please come forward and help me with my investigation so I can take an account and establish what happened."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210043305. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
