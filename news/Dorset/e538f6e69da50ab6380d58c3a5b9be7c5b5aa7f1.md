# Man released without charge after attempted street robbery in Weymouth

10 March 2017

* * *

A man has been released without charge after an attempted street robbery in Weymouth.

Officers were called to reports that sometime between 8.30pm and 9.30pm on Wednesday 11 January 2017 a man was riding his bicycle outside The Cutter pub in East Street when he was pulled off the bike by a group of men who verbally abused him.

The men demanded the victim's running shoes, coat and his bicycle before throwing empty cans of drink at him and then stamping on him.

The victim, a local man aged in his 40s, wrapped himself around his bike on the road to prevent it being taken. He suffered minor injuries in the incident. Nothing was stolen.

An 18-year-old man from Weymouth arrested on suspicion of two counts of assault has been released from police bail without charge.
