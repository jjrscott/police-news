# Dorset Police to receive an extra 50 officers in year one of Operation Uplift programme

09 October 2019

* * *

It has been announced that the recruitment target for Dorset Police is 50 new officers as part of year one in the 6,000 national Operation Uplift scheme. This figure will be in addition to the existing planned recruitment for officers that Dorset Police already had in place. On Tuesday 8 October 2019 the National Policing Board announced how year one of the Government's officer uplift programme would be allocated across all of the forces in England and Wales. The uplift numbers for both year two and year three of the scheme are yet to be confirmed. Chief Constable James Vaughan said: "This is a good start and it will bring a welcome relief to our stretched workforce. "These much needed extra officers are great news for the communities that we serve in Dorset. I would like to reassure them that the new officers will be carefully invested for maximum effect and we have already developed firm plans to recruit these officers. "The extra officers will assist the Force in moving from good to outstanding in the way we deliver services."
