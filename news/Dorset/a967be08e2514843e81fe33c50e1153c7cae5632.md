# Update â€“ witness appeal following alleged robbery in Poole

29 November 2017

* * *

A man has been arrested in connection with an alleged robbery in Poole.

It was reported that at around 9.50pm on Saturday 11 November 2017 a Poole man aged in his 20s picked up two men from outside Sainsbury's in Pitwines Close.

The men then reportedly forced him to pull over in a nearby layby on Newfoundland Drive, which backs on to Emerson Road. They allegedly threatened the victim and forced him out of the vehicle before driving off in it.

The car was found the following day in a residential car park in Perry Gardens in Poole.

A 28-year-old Poole man has been arrested on suspicion of robbery and has been released under investigation.

Detectives investigating the incident are still appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170176424. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
