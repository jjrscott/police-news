# Search for burglars who stole money from elderly residents in Christchurch

13 August 2019

* * *

Officers are calling on the public's help to find the people responsible for a burglary in Christchurch.

Sometime between 1pm and 3pm on Thursday 8 August 2019 a man knocked at the door of an address in Bronte Avenue off Fairmile Road and asked to read the boiler meter. The elderly occupants led him in through the house so he could access the meters in the garden. However, when they reached the kitchen the man turned on the tap and claimed to have found the meter under the sink, which they knew was incorrect.

The man remained in the address for around 10 minutes before he left via the front door.

A short time later the occupants noticed that a large quantity of cash had been stolen from the bedrooms.

Police Constable Louise Rowswell, of Christchurch police, said: "We believe this offence occurred while the occupants were distracted and someone else entered the property and stole the cash.

"This incident has caused both victims a great deal of upset and distress. We have carried out a number of house-to-house and CCTV enquiries in a bid to identify the offender or offenders but these have so far not been successful.

"I would urge anyone who was in the area at the relevant time and either saw or heard something suspicious or caught anything of relevance on dashcam to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190123720. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
