# Witness appeal following robbery in Bournemouth

05 December 2018

* * *

Officers investigating a robbery of a teenage boy in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 3.15pm on Monday 3 December 2018 the victim, a 15-year-old local boy, was cycling with a friend in Mallard Close and was intending to go down a path that leads to Strouden Avenue.

As they approached the entrance to the path, the victim saw two people, believed to be male teenagers, in black clothing with gloves and ski masks on. One was on a bicycle and the other was on foot.

As the victim attempted to cycle past, the offenders blocked his way and told him to get off his bike. The victim was then pushed off his bike, causing him to fall to the ground.

His friend tried to come to his aid but was pulled away and the offenders made off with his bike.

The bicycle, a grey Marin Hawk Hill 2019 model with oversized handle bars, is valued at around Â£1,350.

Police Constable Dave Wilcox, of Bournemouth police, said: "This must have been a very distressing incident for the victim and his friend and we are carrying out a detailed investigation to identify the offenders.

"I am appealing to anyone who witness any suspicious activity in the area around the time of this offence or who comes across a bicycle matching the description given to contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180194229. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
