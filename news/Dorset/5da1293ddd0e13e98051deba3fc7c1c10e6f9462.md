# Arrest made in connection with fatal collision in Dorchester

04 January 2018

* * *

Officers investigating a fatal collision in Dorchester have arrested a woman.

Police were called at 7.46pm on Wednesday 27 December 2017 to reports of a collision between a pedestrian and a car on The Grove. It is alleged the driver failed to stop at the scene.

The female pedestrian - 39-year-old Erika Prisacaru from Dorchester - was taken to Dorset County Hospital, but she sadly died from her injuries. She leaves behind her six-year-old son Andrei who is now being cared for by relatives. Erika's distraught family continues to be supported by specially-trained officers.

Yesterday, Wednesday 3 January 2018, officers issued CCTV images of a dark-coloured convertible Audi A3 they wished to trace as well as photos of Erika and her son.

A 47-year-old local woman has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving, failing to stop at the scene of a collision and perverting the course of justice and is assisting officers with enquiries.

Inspector Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "As part of ongoing enquiries, officers have arrested a woman in connection with this collision. A vehicle has also been seized.

"I am renewing my appeal to anyone who saw a dark-coloured Audi A3 in either The Grove or Brewery Square at the relevant times on Wednesday 27 December to please call Dorset Police.

"I would also ask for any motorists who were in these areas and have dash cam on board to please contact us."
