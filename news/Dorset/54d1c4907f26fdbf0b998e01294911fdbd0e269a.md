# Update â€“ man arrested in connection with reported robbery in Weymouth

15 January 2020

* * *

A man has been arrested in connection with a reported robbery at a pharmacy in Weymouth.

Dorset Police received a report at 10.15am on Tuesday 24 December 2019 that a man had entered Wessex Pharmacies Ltd in Avenue Road in possession of a kitchen knife and demanded fentanyl patches.

He is reported to have then entered a staff area and took two boxes of the patches before leaving the scene.

The patches are used as prescribed pain medication and contain a strong opioid drug. They can be extremely dangerous if used inappropriately without medical advice.

Following enquiries by detectives, a 42-year-old Weymouth man was arrested on suspicion of robbery. He has been released under investigation as enquiries continue.
