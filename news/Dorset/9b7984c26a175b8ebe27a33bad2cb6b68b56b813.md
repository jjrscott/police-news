# Arrests made in alleged stabbing in Bournemouth

17 December 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating an alleged stabbing in Bournemouth have arrested two teenage boys.

At approximately 8.30pm on Saturday 16 December 2017 a group of boys and girls, all aged 16, were sitting on a bench at the Pelhams Park area on Millhams Road. It was reported that the group was approached by two teenage boys on bicycles before one of them began shining a torch at a girl in the group, who asked him to stop. It is alleged that he then pulled a knife out of his pocket.

It was further reported that an altercation took place between one of the suspects and a boy from the group, who sustained serious injuries to his chest and face. He was taken to hospital to receive treatment.

This afternoon, Sunday 17 December 2017, a 13-year-old boy and a 14-year-old boy, both from Bournemouth, were arrested on suspicion of assault and are helping officers with their enquiries.
