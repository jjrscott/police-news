# Appeal following reported theft of post and parcels from delivery vans in Bournemouth

08 December 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following the reported theft of post and parcels from delivery vans in Bournemouth.

At 1.45pm on Thursday 26 November 2020 it is reported that two bags of mail were stolen from a Royal Mail van that was parked in Abbott Road. The mail was later found to have been set fire to and destroyed in Harewood Avenue.

The van driver was alerted to the incident by a male passer-by who reportedly witnessed the incident. He is described as black and was riding a bicycle. A woman also approached the van driver and said they witnessed the incident.

At around 7.55pm on Friday 27 November 2020 an unknown number of parcels were allegedly stolen from an Argos delivery panel van in Heaton Road.

It is further reported that at around 12.20pm on Saturday 28 November 2020 parcels were stolen from a DPD delivery van in Broadway Lane.

In each reported incident a white car was seen in the area.

A 15-year-old boy and two men aged 23 and 24 - all from Bournemouth - have been arrested on suspicion of theft and have been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Police Community Support Investigator Paul Bosley, of Dorset Police, said: "Our investigation into these incidents remains ongoing. I would urge anyone who witnessed any of the incidents and has yet to speak to officers to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly keen to speak to the man and woman who spoke to the victim to the Royal Mail van theft as I am aware they may have important information that could assist my investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200178367. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
