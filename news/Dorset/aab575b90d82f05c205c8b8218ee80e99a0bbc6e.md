* * *

The family of a woman who sadly died in a road traffic collision near Dorchester have named and paid tribute to her.

At around 6.25am on Monday 16 October 2017 a road traffic collision occurred on the A352 at Whitcombe.

The collision involved a red Honda Civic and a silver Peugeot 206.

The passenger of the Honda - 43-year-old Hannah Richardson from Stratton near Dorchester - was taken to Dorset County Hospital with life-threatening injuries. Sadly she died at hospital later that morning.

Her husband Stuart, aged 43 and who was driving the Honda, sustained serious injuries that are not thought to be life-threatening and was taken to Dorset County Hospital.

The driver of the Peugeot, a man from the Dorchester area, sustained chest, leg and arm injuries and was taken to Dorset County Hospital.

In a statement, the family of Hannah and Stuart said: "We have taken the brave decision to name Hannah, who sadly died as a result of her injuries despite the best efforts of medical staff at the scene and at Dorset County Hospital.

"Her husband Stuart sustained serious injuries and continues to receive treatment and recover at Dorset County Hospital.

"Hannah was a wonderful daughter, wife, sister and mother to a beautiful 11-year-old girl.

"We are understandably devastated at losing her and wish to thank everyone for all the support we have received. We wish to focus on supporting Stuart and their daughter and would request complete privacy at this difficult time."
