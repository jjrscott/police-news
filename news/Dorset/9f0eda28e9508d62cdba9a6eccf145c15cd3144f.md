Officers in Dorchester are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a burglary at a business in the town.

Sometime between 6.30pm on Tuesday 21 February and 7.30am today, Wednesday 22 February 2017, offenders gained access to Casterbridge Chiropractic Clinic in Icen Way via a window.

A safe containing a quantity of cash was stolen.

Deputy Neighbourhood Inspector Matt Chutter said: "An investigation is now underway to trace those responsible for this offence and I would urge anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious in Icen Way overnight to please contact Dorset Police.

"We are currently investigating a number of burglaries at businesses in Dorchester that have occurred this month which we believe are linked.

"Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team will be carrying out high-visibility patrols in the area over the coming days to reassure the community and are available should anyone wish to raise any concerns.

"I would urge any local businesses who would like information on how to best secure their premises to please make contact with local officers."
