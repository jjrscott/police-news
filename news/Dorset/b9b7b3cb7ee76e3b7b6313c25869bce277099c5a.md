# Update - appeal after reports of suspicious incident on bus in Bournemouth

14 September 2017

* * *

Officers investigating reports of a suspicious incident on a bus in Bournemouth have identified a man following a CCTV appeal.

At around 5.54pm on Monday 7 August 2017 a 13-year-old girl from Poole boarded the M2 bus at Bournemouth Square travelling toward Boscombe and sat on the back seat.

It is reported that a man boarded the bus at the same time and sat near to the girl before allegedly placing his hand onto her thigh for several seconds.

A 54-year-old man from Bournemouth has come forward and is voluntarily assisting officers with enquiries.
