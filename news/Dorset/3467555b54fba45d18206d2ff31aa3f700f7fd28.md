# Update - CCTV appeal following reported theft of pushchair from baby store in Poole

15 July 2019

* * *

A man has been interviewed by officers in relation to the alleged theft of a pushchair from a store in Poole.

It was reported that a man entered Mothercare on Poole Retail Park in Branksome at 3.14pm on Saturday 12 January 2019, browsed the pushchairs, selected one and then left without paying.

In February 2019 officers issued a CCTV appeal.

A 34-year-old man from Ferndown voluntarily attended a police station and has been interviewed by officers. He has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.
