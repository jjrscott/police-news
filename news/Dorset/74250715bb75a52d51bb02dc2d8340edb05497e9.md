A man has been charged in connection with warrants executed under the Misuse of Drugs Act in Bournemouth.

Officers executed warrants at two addresses off Jewell Road on Thursday 15 September 2016 following community intelligence about the alleged production and supply of cannabis.

A large quantity of cannabis plants and bags of cannabis were discovered and seized.

A 59-year-old man from Bournemouth has now been charged with being concerned in the production of a class B controlled drug.

He is due to appear before Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 24 March 2017.

A 27-year-old Bournemouth man who was arrested on suspicion of possessing cannabis with intent to supply and a 39-year-old Bournemouth woman who was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of a class B controlled drug have both been released without charge.
