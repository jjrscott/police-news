# Witness appeal following distraction burglary in Lyme Regis

21 March 2021

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a distraction burglary in Lyme Regis.

At around 3pm on Saturday 20 March 2021 the victim, a woman aged in her 70s, was in her garden when she noticed a black Audi car near to her home off Pound Street. As she returned to her kitchen the victim heard a tap on her front door. She answered the door and a man said his Jack Russell dog had squeezed through the fence and into the victim's garden.

The victim locked the front door and went to check her garden. She returned and noticed the man walking near to the house and told him that she could not find his dog. The man left in the Audi car.

A short time later the victim discovered that a vanity mirror and jewellery box had been stolen from her bedroom. Some items of jewellery were later found on the ground near a gate on her property.

The suspect is described as white, six feet tall, of slim build and aged in his 20s. He had an angular long, thin face and was clean shaven with short dark hair. He was wearing a bright blue tracksuit with white lines down the arms.

Detective Sergeant Matt Bradley, of Weymouth CID, said: "This suspect distracted his victim while he stole items of jewellery from her home and I would like to reassure the community that a full investigation is underway to identify him.

"I am appealing to the public to come forward if they noticed any usual activity in the area of Pound Street at the relevant time.

"I would ask anyone who saw a black Audi, or any motorists who were travelling in the area and may have captured a vehicle or man matching the details given on their dashcam, to please get in touch.

"It is believed that the suspect gained access to the address via an insecure back door and I would encourage residents to ensure all doors are locked when they leave their address, even if it is just for a moment."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210044583. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
