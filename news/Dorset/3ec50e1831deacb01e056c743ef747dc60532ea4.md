# Man due in court following fatal collision in Stalbridge

09 May 2017

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with a fatal collision in Stalbridge in which a motorcyclist died.

Officers were called at 3.22pm on Friday 7 October 2016 to reports of a collision between a Suzuki motorcycle and a tractor registered to a Stalbridge company on the A357.

The rider of the motorcycle, a 36-year-old Blandford man, sadly died at the scene from his injuries.

A 30-year-old man from Sturminster Newton has been issued with a postal requisition to appear before Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Monday 15 May 2017 for an offence of causing death by careless driving.
