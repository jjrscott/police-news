# Update â€“ man due in court in connection with reported public order incidents in Weymouth

27 December 2019

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with two reported public order incidents in Weymouth.

It was reported that a bus driver was verbally abused on two separate occasions by the same man.

The first incident was reported to have occurred at around 8.40am on Wednesday 6 November 2019 outside the law courts in Westwey Road and the second incident at the Dumbarton Road bus stop on Portland Road shortly before 11am on Saturday 9 November.

Following a CCTV appeal, a 24-year-old Portland man came forward and was interviewed by officers. He has now been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 8 January 2020 for two offences of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause fear of or provoke unlawful violence.
