Officers investigating a burglary where car keys were stolen and the subsequent theft of number plates in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Between 11pm on Saturday 20 February and 8.45am on Sunday 21 February 2021 a set of car keys were stolen from an address off Malborough Avenue. It is believed access was gained to the property via an insecure door.

A white Peugeot that was parked on the road nearby was stolen.

During the same night, it was reported that the front and back number plates were stolen from another white Peugeot that was parked on a road near to All Saints Church.

Police Constable Rory Swinden, of Weymouth police, said: "We are investigating these two incidents as linked and are carrying out a number of enquiries to identify who is responsible.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the vicinity of the two incidents during the relevant time and witnessed what happened to please get in touch.

"I would also ask residents to check their home CCTV systems for any footage that may assist my investigation."
