# Update â€“ men due in court in connection with reported road rage incident in Bournemouth

25 July 2019

* * *

Two men are due to appear in court in connection with a reported road rage incident in Bournemouth.

The incident began at around 1.30am on Thursday 21 February 2019 at the Somerford roundabout in Christchurch and involved a taxi driver who was allegedly followed by two people in an Audi TT.

It was reported that after the taxi had stopped at traffic lights in Exeter Road in Bournemouth, the occupants of the Audi got out and punched and kicked the driver's door of the taxi and smashed the windscreen.

Two men, aged 18 and 25 and both of Lymington in Hampshire, attended for voluntary police interviews and have now been issued with postal requisitions to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 26 July 2019 for offences of criminal damage and using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause fear of or provoke unlawful violence.

The 25-year-old man will also face an allegation of driving without due care and attention.
