# Update â€“ witness appeal following reported stabbing in Bournemouth

29 December 2017

* * *

Two people arrested in connection with a reported stabbing in Bournemouth have been released without charge.

At 6.37am on Wednesday 6 December 2017 officers were called to an address in Crabton Close Road.

A man was found with a stab wound to his shoulder and head injuries and was taken to hospital for treatment. A woman who was inside the address was uninjured. A second man who was also inside the address left the scene and officers issued an appeal to identify him. He came forward and voluntarily assisted officers with enquiries.

The injured man, aged 27 and from Christchurch, was arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary and a 30-year-old local woman was arrested on suspicion of wounding with intent. They have both now been released without charge.

Officers are not looking for anyone else in connection with this incident.
