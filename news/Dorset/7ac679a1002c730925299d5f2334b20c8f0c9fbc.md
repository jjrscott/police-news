# Update to investigation into rape near Christchurch

01 November 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating reports of a rape near Christchurch have issued an update.

The incident was reported to have occurred in a wooded area near to Hinton Admiral Train Station at around 4pm on Monday 14 August 2017.

The victim - a local woman aged in her 20s - reported that she was sexually assaulted by a man near to a makeshift shelter in the woods to the south of the train line off Station Road. It is understood that they were known to each other.

A 30-year-old man from the New Milton area was arrested on suspicion of rape and released under investigation. Following a detailed and thorough investigation a decision has now been made that no further police action will be taken. The woman has been updated.

Dorset Police remains committed to investigating all reports of sexual offences and encourages any victims to report matters so they can be investigated.
