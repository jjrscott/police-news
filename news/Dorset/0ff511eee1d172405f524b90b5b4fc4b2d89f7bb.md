# Witness appeal following distraction burglary in Ferndown

16 November 2016

* * *

Detectives are appealing for the public's help to find a man responsible for a distraction theft in Ferndown.

Sometime between 3pm and 4pm on Friday 11 November 2016 a man knocked on the back door of an address in Woodside Road claiming that he was working on a fence on an adjoining property and was having some difficulty.

The elderly victim initially spoke to the offender through the door while keeping her safety chain on.

However, she then invited the offender in for a cup of tea to discuss the problem. While the victim was making a drink, the offender suddenly announced that he had to leave and quickly disappeared.

Approximately an hour later the victim discovered her handbag, containing cash, bank cards and two sapphire and diamond rings, was missing.

The offender is described as white, aged in his 30s, approximately five feet seven inches tall and with short dark hair.

Detective Constable Sara Watts, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was a despicable crime on an elderly woman in her home.

"I would urge anyone who may have seen the described man in the area at the time or anyone with information about him to contact us.

"Victims of bogus callers or distraction burglaries are usually elderly and live by themselves and I'd urge everyone to help reduce the chance that the people you care about and your elderly neighbours are subject to this type of crime.

"Do not buy, sell or sign up to any work on the doorstep no matter how urgent they say the work is. If you are suspicious of the caller's intentions, tell them to go away and call a family member or neighbour and inform the police. If they won't leave, then call 999."

Members of the public should consider the following advice when answering the door:

LOCKED - Is the back door locked?
STOP - Am I expecting anyone?
CHAIN - Put the chain on BEFORE opening the door.
CHECK - Ask for the caller's identification. Shut the door leaving the caller on the doorstep and phone the number in the phone book NOT the one on the card they give you, as this could be an accomplice around the corner - especially if it is a mobile number. A genuine caller will be happy to wait while you do this.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55160170302. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
