# Witness appeal following fail-to-stop collision in Poole

24 April 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a fail-to-stop collision in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 11.40pm on Friday 17 April 2020 it was reported that a vehicle was involved in a collision with a motorhome that was parked on Haskells Road. Shortly afterward a dark-coloured pick-up truck was seen to drive away from the area in the direction of Cranbrook Road toward Cynthia Road.

The motorhome sustained significant damage in the incident.

Police Constable Clare Gillard, of Poole police, said: "It is likely that the other vehicle involved in the collision will have damage to its front end. I am keen to speak to the driver of this vehicle in order to establish the circumstances of the incident.

"I also am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or who may have information that could assist in my investigation to please get in touch.

"I would urge anyone who may have relevant dashcam footage to contact us and would also like to hear from anyone who is aware of a pick-up truck in the area that has sustained damage in unexplained circumstances recently."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200054967. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
