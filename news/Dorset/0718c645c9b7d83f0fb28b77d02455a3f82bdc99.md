Detectives have launched an investigation following the sudden death of a man in Bournemouth - with one man arrested.

At around 3.40am today, Friday 21 October 2016, officers were called by the ambulance service to reports that a man was in a critical condition at an address in Wootton Gardens. Sadly the man was pronounced dead at the scene a short time later.

The man has yet to be identified. The coroner has been notified.

An investigation is underway to establish the circumstances surrounding the man's death.
