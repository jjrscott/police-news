* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with an alleged aggravated burglary in Weymouth.

At 12.35am on Sunday 1 October 2017 Dorset Police received a report of a disturbance at a property in Pottery Lane.

It was reported that three men had entered the property and threatened a woman aged in her 30s with a knife before rummaging through drawers. The men left the property without taking anything and the victim did not sustain any serious injuries.

One of the men who entered the property is believed to be known to the woman.

A 27-year-old Weymouth man has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court today, Wednesday 21 March 2018, for an offence of assault.
