# Witness appeal following indecent exposure in Ferndown

25 June 2020

* * *

Officers investigating an indecent exposure incident in Ferndown are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 5.10pm on Tuesday 23 June 2020 a group of five teenage girls were walking along Dudsbury Road near to the junction with Ellesfield Drive when they noticed a car driving slowly alongside them. They looked inside and saw a male driver indecently exposing himself.

The driver did not speak to the girls and drove off shortly after they noticed him.

The man is described as white, aged in his 50s and of medium build with grey hair and a beard. He was wearing a purple or blue short-sleeved polo shirt.

The vehicle is described as a silver Ford with a child seat in the rear passenger side of the car.

Police Community Support Investigator Kate Hann, of Ferndown police, said: "This was understandably a distressing incident for the group of girls and a full investigation is underway to identify the man involved.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the relevant time and may have witnessed any suspicious activity to please get in touch.

"I would also urge residents to check their home CCTV systems and motorists who were travelling in the area to check their dashcam for any relevant footage."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200090242. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
