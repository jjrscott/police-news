# Witness appeal following burglary in Purbeck

22 July 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a burglary in Purbeck are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 3pm on Friday 19 July 2019 Dorset Police received a report that two men were seen by a passer-by to enter an address in Wareham Road in Lytchett Matravers by using a ladder to access a first floor window.

The men were seen to leave the premises shortly afterwards through the rear garden, making off in the direction of Eldons Drive.

Officers attended and carried out a search of the area but the men were not located. A black safe was found smashed at the rear of the premises.

The occupants returned home and confirmed the safe had been removed from the address and that there had been nothing inside it.

Police Constable Kevin Miller, of Purbeck police, said: "We are continuing to investigate this matter and I am keen to hear from any witnesses who have not already spoken to police.

"I would urge anyone who saw any suspicious activity in the area of Wareham Road around the time of the incident or who has any information that could assist our investigation to come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190111440. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
