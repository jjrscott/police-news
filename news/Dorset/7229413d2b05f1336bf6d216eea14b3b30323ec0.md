# Update â€“ witness appeal following fatal collision in Wareham

30 March 2018

* * *

A man arrested in connection with a fatal road traffic collision in Wareham has been released under investigation.

At 8.43am yesterday, Thursday 29 March 2018, Dorset Police was called to a report of a road traffic collision in North Street.

The collision involved a white Sainsbury's articulated lorry and a three-year-old boy, who was crossing the road with his family at the pedestrian crossing.

The boy sustained very serious injuries and was taken to Dorset County Hospital for treatment. Very tragically, he was pronounced dead a short time later. The coroner has been notified.

A 43-year-old man from Basingstoke was arrested on suspicion of driving offences and has been released under investigation as police enquiries continue.

Inspector Matt Butler, of the traffic unit, said: "The family are continuing to be supported by specially-trained officers and have requested privacy at this very traumatic time.

"We are continuing to investigate the circumstances of the collision and are still appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or saw the manner of driving of the lorry immediately before to please come forward.

"I am also keen to hear from any motorists who were travelling along North Street at the relevant time and have dashcam fitted in their vehicles."
