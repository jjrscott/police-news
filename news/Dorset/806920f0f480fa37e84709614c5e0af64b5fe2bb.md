# Appeal for witnesses after assault in Bournemouth

21 December 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses following an assault in Bournemouth.

The incident occurred at around 4am on Sunday 9 December 2018 on Old Christchurch Road at a taxi rank at the junction of Glen Fern Road.

The victim - a Bournemouth man aged in his 40s - was standing queuing for a taxi when he stepped forward to speak with the driver.

A man suddenly appeared behind him telling the victim it was his taxi and a verbal altercation occurred.

The victim was then punched from behind on the side of the head by a second man, causing him to fall to the ground.

He was then kicked on the ground by the men.

The victim managed to get up and run off toward the Lansdowne roundabout before making his way home.

The following day he discovered problems with his vision and pain to his eye socket. After visiting an eye specialist he was diagnosed with a damaged retina. It is unknown if or when his eyesight will fully restore.

The first offender is described as five feet five inches tall, aged in his late teens or early 20s, of slight build and had short black hair.

The second offender is described as six feet tall, of slim build and had short dark-coloured hair.

Detective Constable Ben Swain, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was a nasty assault, which has left the victim with a serious eye injury and I am appealing to anyone who saw what happened or who has any information that could assist with the investigation to please come forward.

"I believe that there may have been a group of women nearby at the time who may have witnessed the incident and I would ask that they contact Dorset Police.

"We have made CCTV enquiries and at this stage we have not been able to identify any footage that could assist in identifying the suspects, however I would request that taxi drivers or motorists who were in the area at the time review their dashcam footage and report anything relevant to us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180197449. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
