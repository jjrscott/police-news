# Witness appeal after offenders target cashpoint in Beaminster

18 August 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward after offenders targeted a cashpoint in Beaminster using a tractor.

At 4.09am today, Saturday 18 August 2018, Dorset Police received multiple reports that offenders were stealing a cashpoint from Fleet Street.

The offenders used a stolen green tractor to extract the cashpoint from the wall of the premises, which was previously an HSBC bank and is now Chris Chapman Bespoke Kitchens and Furniture. They were then seen to make off on foot. It is not yet known if any money was stolen.

The offenders then got into a dark-coloured Audi car and left the scene.

The tractor was left at the scene alongside a green Land Rover Defender, which had been stolen by the offenders from Whitcombe Road in Beaminster.

The offenders have caused significant structural damage to the property. One occupant who was in the flat above the shop escaped uninjured.

Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service attended to assess the damage. The road has been closed until a structural engineer can attend and advise on how to make the property safe.

Detective Sergeant Simon Austin, of Weymouth CID, said: "A full investigation is underway to identify the offenders involved in this incident.

"I would urge anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious in the early hours of this morning in Beaminster and has yet to speak to officers to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who saw a Audi or similar looking car being driven in or around the area this morning or one that may have been abandoned.

"The offenders have caused significant structural damage to the property and the road has been closed to ensure the safety of members of the public until it can be made safe. I would like to thank the community for their patience and understanding.

"Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team will be continuing their patrols of the area and can be approached with any concerns and issues."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 18:105. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
