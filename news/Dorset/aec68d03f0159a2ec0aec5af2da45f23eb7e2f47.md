Detectives investigating an alleged aggravated burglary in Gillingham are appealing for any witnesses to come forward.

At around 2.30pm on Tuesday 13 October 2020 it is reported that two men entered a commercial premises off Newbury armed with batons and demanded money from the occupant.

It is alleged that the occupant - a local man aged in his 50s - was assaulted and sustained serious injuries, which are not deemed to be life-threatening.

A 29-year-old man from Weymouth has been charged with aggravated burglary and wounding with intent and appeared at Poole Magistrates' Court on Saturday 17 October 2020. He is next due to appear at Bournemouth Crown Court on Friday 20 November 2020.

Detectives are keen to identify a second man who reportedly attended the address. He is described as white, of average build and wore dark, baggy clothing with the hood up and a face covering.

Detective Constable Kim Williams, of Weymouth CID, said: "I am appealing for anyone who witnessed the reported incident or saw anyone matching the description given to please contact Dorset Police urgently."
