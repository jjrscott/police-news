# Witness appeal after paint damage to property in Christchurch

21 September 2018

* * *

Officers investigating an incident of criminal damage in Christchurch are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

The victim discovered at 6.45am yesterday, Thursday 20 September 2018, that black paint had been deliberately slapped over the door, walls and window of her home on Stanpit. The damage is said to have occurred sometime between 10pm on Wednesday 19 September and when it was discovered.

It is believed a brush was used during the incident.

House-to-house and CCTV enquiries are underway in a bid to identify who was responsible.

Police Constable Peter Simpson, of Christchurch police, said: "This incident has caused the victim and her family a great deal of distress. A full investigation is underway to establish who was responsible for this mindless vandalism and I would ask anyone who was in the area between the relevant times and saw or heard anything suspicious to please contact Dorset Police."
