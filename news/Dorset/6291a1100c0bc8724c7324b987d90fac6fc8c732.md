Detectives have launched an investigation after a woman died at an address in Christchurch.

At around 10.12pm yesterday, Wednesday 23 November 2016, officers were called by the ambulance service to an address in Mude Gardens.

Sadly the body of a 60-year-old woman was discovered. Her family have been informed and the coroner notified.

Detective Inspector Wayne Seymour, of Bournemouth CID, said: "At this time we are treating the woman's death as suspicious.

"The address has been cordoned off while our enquiries continue."

A 66-year-old local man was arrested on suspicion of assisting a suicide and has been released on police bail pending further enquiries.
