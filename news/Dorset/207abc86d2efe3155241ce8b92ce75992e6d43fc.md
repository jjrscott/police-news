# Appeal for information following sexual assault in Poole

01 November 2018

* * *

Officers investigating a sexual assault on a woman in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The victim, a local woman aged in her 30s, was sitting on the green area off Dear Hay Lane by the Hunger Hill roundabout at around 12pm on Tuesday 23 October 2018 when she was approached by an unknown man, who sat next to her.

He appeared intoxicated and began kissing her without her consent and punched her on the arm.

The victim was able to get away from him and left the man sitting on the grass. The woman did not sustain any serious injuries.

The offender is described as white, around six feet tall, of slim build and aged in his late 60s or early 70s. He has blue eyes, short stubble and is missing a number of teeth. He was wearing a grey 'Nike' baseball cap, jeans and hiking boots.

Police Constable Phil Pearson, of Poole police, said: "This was understandably a very distressing incident for the victim and we are determined to identify the man responsible.

"We have been carrying out a number of enquiries and I am now appealing to the public for anyone with information about this incident, or who recognises the man from the description given, to contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180171565. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
