Officers investigating a fail-to-stop road traffic collision in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage to come forward.

"I appreciate the incident was some time ago but we have only recently been able to take a full account from the victim.

"We are continuing to make enquiries and I would urge anyone who witnessed this incident or may have captured it on dascham to please contact us."
