# Major incident exercise in Bournemouth

05 October 2016

* * *

Dorset Police will be conducting a multi-agency major incident exercise in Bournemouth and is reassuring the public not to be concerned.

The exercises will take place on two consecutive Thursdays - 6 and 13 October 2016 - between 8pm and midnight at the JP Morgan site in Bournemouth.

The exercise will be in partnership with JP Morgan and the fire and ambulances services.

Chief Inspector Tracey Baker, of Dorset Police, said: "We are carrying out this exercise to ensure that the emergency services are prepared in the unlikely event of a major incident.

"We would like to reassure the public that nobody should be alarmed by noises throughout the event as the simulation will involve pyrotechnics and gun fire. Any disruption will be kept to a minimum.

"Officers would like to thank members of the public in advance for their cooperation and understanding and the advice is not to enter the site as this may interfere with the exercise."
