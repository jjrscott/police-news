Officers are issuing an image of a watch that was recovered in Poole in a bid to locate its owner.

On Saturday 28 November 2020 officers were on patrol and carried out a search on a man on Ashley Road who was suspected to be in possession of drugs. No drugs were located. A Tag Heuer watch was seized.

Police Constable Christopher Lee, of Poole police, said: "I am really keen to hear from anyone who believes they have had a Tag Heuer watch stolen or go missing recently.

"If you suspect the watch is yours, please get in touch with the serial number and if it matches the one we have then we will be in touch."
