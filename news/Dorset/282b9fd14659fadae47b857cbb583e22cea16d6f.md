Officers investigating a fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

It is reported that, between 8pm on Saturday 25 January and 5am on Sunday 26 January 2020, a vehicle collided with a parked car on St Leonard's Road near to the Brunswick pub. It failed to stop at the scene of the collision.

The parked car was shunted onto the pavement in the incident and also sustained scratches to one side, a buckled wheel and a flat tyre.

It is believed the car responsible could be a black Audi.

Police Constable Justyna Nicholas, of Bournemouth police, said: "The vehicle involved has caused considerable damage to the parked car and is also likely to have sustained some damage itself.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have either witnessed the collision or caught it on dashcam or home CCTV to please contact us.

"I would also appeal directly to the driver involved in this incident to come forward."
