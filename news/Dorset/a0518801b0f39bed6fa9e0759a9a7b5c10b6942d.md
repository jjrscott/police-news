An investigation is underway after a woman sustained life-threatening injuries following a reported assault in Bournemouth.

Officers were called at 10.28pm yesterday, Tuesday 13 December 2016, by the ambulance service to reports of a seriously injured woman outside Charminster Supermarket in Charminster Road.

A local woman aged in her 20s was taken to hospital with serious head injuries. Her condition is described as life-threatening.

It is reported that the alleged assault took place at an address in nearby Shelborne Road and the injured woman made her way to the supermarket where calls were made to emergency services.
