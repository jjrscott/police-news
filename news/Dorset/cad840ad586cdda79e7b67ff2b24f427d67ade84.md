Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a woman sustained serious injuries in a collision near Blandford.

At 9.45am on Saturday 5 December 2020 a road traffic collision occurred on the A354 in Pimperne.

His passenger, a local woman aged in her 20s, sustained serious injuries and was flown by air ambulance to Southampton General Hospital. Her condition is described as serious, but stable.

The driver was arrested on suspicion of driving offences and has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Police Sergeant Lee Savage, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was travelling along the A354 either at the time or before the collision to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly keen to hear from any motorists who may have captured the Citroen car travelling before the incident on dashcam to please get in touch."
