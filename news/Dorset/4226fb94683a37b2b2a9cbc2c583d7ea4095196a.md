A man has been charged and has appeared in court in connection with a burglary in Boscombe.

An appeal was issued after Dorset Police received a report of a break-in at The Cherries Cafe on Curzon Road at 9.05pm on Thursday 15 November 2018. A till was reportedly stolen from the premises.

A 19-year-old Bournemouth man was arrested on suspicion of burglary and has been released under investigation.

A 21-year-old Bournemouth man was subsequently arrested and was charged with burglary. He appeared before Poole Magistrates' Court on Saturday 8 December 2018 and is next due to appear at Bournemouth Crown Court on Friday 4 January 2019. He has also been charged with three further commercial burglaries.
