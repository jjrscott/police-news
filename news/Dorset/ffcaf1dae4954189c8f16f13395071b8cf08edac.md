Detectives investigating a reported assault in Dorchester are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 4.10am on Wednesday 1 January 2020 an alleged altercation occurred involving two men and two women near to Hardy's pub on Trinity Street. Some of the people involved were wearing fancy dress costumes.

The victim - a local man aged in his 50s - was reportedly assaulted and sustained an injury to his arm. He was taken to hospital for treatment.

A cordon was put in place to allow officers to carry out their investigation.

Following enquiries, a 37-year-old woman and a 39-year-old man, both from Dorchester, have been arrested on suspicion of wounding with intent. They are currently assisting detectives with their enquiries.

Detective Sergeant Rhys Griffiths, of Weymouth CID, said: "A full investigation is underway and officers have been carrying out a number of enquiries, including checking CCTV in the area.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident and has not yet spoken to police to please get in touch.

"I would also like to hear from any motorists who were travelling along Trinity Street around the time of the incident and may have captured any relevant dashcam footage."
