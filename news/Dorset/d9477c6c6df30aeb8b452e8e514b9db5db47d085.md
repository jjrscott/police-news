# Witness appeal following fatal road traffic collision near Wimborne

28 September 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for any witnesses or motorists with relevant dashcam footage to come forward as they investigate a fatal road traffic collision near Wimborne.

Dorset Police received a report at 6.07pm on Saturday 28 September in relation to a single vehicle collision at Badbury Rings on the B3082 Blandford Road, at the junction with New Road. The vehicle involved was a white Mazda 2.

Emergency services attended and very sadly the driver of the Mazda, a woman aged in her 70s from Blandford, was pronounced dead at the scene. Her family has been informed and is being supported by specially-trained officers.

There was nobody else in the vehicle at the time of the collision.

Road closures were put in place to allow the emergency services to respond to the incident and for a detailed examination of the scene to be conducted.

Sergeant Fern Graham, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the family of the woman involved at this sad time.

"We are carrying out a full investigation to establish the exact circumstances of this collision and I would urge any witnesses to contact us. I would also like to hear from anyone who was travelling in the area at the time and may have relevant dashcam footage.

"Finally, I would like to thank members of the public for their patience and understanding during the road closures. We appreciate these might have caused some disruption but they were absolutely necessary to enable the emergency services to deal with the incident and to allow for an examination of the collision scene."
