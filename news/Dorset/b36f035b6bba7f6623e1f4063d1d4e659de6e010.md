# Witness appeal following burglary in Dorchester

27 January 2017

* * *

Police in Dorchester are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a burglary in the town.

Between 3pm and 7pm on Tuesday 24 January 2017 offenders gained access to the rear garden of a property in Queen's Avenue via an unlocked side gate.

Once in the garden they used an ornament to smash the glass of a patio door.

A quantity of jewellery, including gold rings, earrings, broaches, necklaces and costume items, were stolen.

Police Constable Jim Long, of Dorchester police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious in the area between the relevant times to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who has been offered any similar items of jewellery for sale in unusual circumstances.

"We would also like to remind residents to remain vigilant and to keep all side access doors and gates locked."
