# Public appeal following dog attack in Poole

24 June 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for any witnesses to come forward after a woman was bitten by a dog during an incident in Poole.

At 7am on Saturday 22 June 2019 the victim - a Chinese woman aged in her 60s - was walking her Jack Russell dog along Wimborne Road. As she approached the bus stop near to the Office Supplies warehouse at Fleetsbridge she encountered a woman with a small to medium-sized black or brown dog.

The dog bit the victim's dog, requiring the animal to have 11 staples to a wound on its back legs.

The dog then bit the victim several times on the top of her leg and jumped up and bit her nose. She went to hospital for treatment. The victim was wearing a pink tracksuit at the time of the incident, which was damaged.

Police Constable Phil Prentice, of Poole police, said: "The owner of the dog that attacked the woman is reported to have made no attempt to help and instead walked away. A passing cyclist came to the victim's aid and called for an ambulance.

"I am keen to trace the owner of the dog who was described as old, unkempt and was sitting on the bench opposite the Toby Carvery, surrounded by various shopping bags.

"I would ask anyone who knows who she is, caught the incident on dashcam or witnessed what happened to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190094382. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
