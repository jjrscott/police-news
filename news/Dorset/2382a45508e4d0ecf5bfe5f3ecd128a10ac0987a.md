# Appeal for information following assault in Weymouth

21 August 2020

* * *

Officers investigating an assault in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At 9.20pm on Thursday 20 August 2020 officers were called to reports of a large group of teenagers gathered in the area of Sandsfoot Castle off Old Castle Road.

Officers attended and were speaking to a man at the scene when someone came up behind and hit him over the head with a bottle, causing a cut to his head, before they made off from the scene. The victim was taken to hospital for treatment.

Following enquiries at the scene, a 17-year-old local boy was arrested on suspicion of a public order offence. Enquiries are ongoing to identify the person responsible for the assault.

Detective Constable Jo Blackmore, of Weymouth CID, said: "This was a nasty attack and we are carrying out a full investigation into this incident.

"I understand there were a number of people in the area at the time and I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the assault, or who has any information about who is responsible, to please contact us."

Local officers from the neighbourhood policing team will continue to carry out patrols in the area as part of their 100 Days of Summer campaign.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200125013. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
