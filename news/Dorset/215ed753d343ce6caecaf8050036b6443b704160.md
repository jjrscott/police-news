# Witness appeal following fatal collision in Bridport

14 November 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a fatal collision in Bridport.

At 11.15pm yesterday, Monday 13 November 2017, a two vehicle collision occurred on the A35 Sea Road South close to the Crown roundabout involving a silver Mercedes convertible and a black Mitsubishi L200 pick-up truck.

Sadly, the driver of the Mitsubishi, a 64-year-old man from Bridport, died at the scene. His family have been informed and the coroner notified.

One of the occupants of the Mercedes, a 35-year-old man from the Bridport area, suffered serious but not life-threatening injuries and was taken to Southampton General Hospital for treatment.

Two men aged 30 and 33 and a 27-year-old woman, all from Bridport, have been arrested in connection with the incident and are assisting officers with their enquiries.

The A35 Sea Road South remains closed while collision investigators examine the scene. It is expected to open later this morning to allow a full and thorough examination in the daylight.

Police Sergeant Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or the manner of driving of either vehicle immediately before the incident to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would also ask anybody who was in the area at the time to consider any dashcam or CCTV they may have which could assist us in our investigations."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at scit@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 13:412. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
