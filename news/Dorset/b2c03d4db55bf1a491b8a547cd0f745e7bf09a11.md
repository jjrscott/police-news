A teenager from London, who has now been confirmed as 16 years old and cannot be named for legal reasons, was charged with murder as well as attempted murder in relation to another man who was found with injuries to his neck and face on the evening of Tuesday 30 June 2020.

He appeared at Winchester Crown Court on Thursday 9 July 2020 for a preliminary hearing. He did not enter a plea and will next appear at the same court on Thursday 20 August 2020.
