# Update in relation to reported public order incident in Poole

08 April 2020

* * *

A man and a woman have come forward following an appeal in relation to a reported public order incident at a park in Poole.

The incident occurred at Baiter Park at around 6.50pm on Sunday 29 March and involved a woman who was running with her German Shepherd dog allegedly being verbally abused by a man who was with a woman and a white Shepherd-type dog.

Following an image appeal, a man and a woman have come forward and are assisting officers with their investigation.

We would like to thank everyone who shared our appeal.
