# Renewed appeal after multiple vehicle collisions in Poole

02 September 2016

* * *

Police are renewing their appeal for witnesses and anyone with information following multiple road traffic collisions reportedly involving the same vehicle in Poole - with one man being arrested.

Officers were called at around 8.40pm on Wednesday 31 August 2016 following an initial report that a black Chrysler 300c had collided with three parked cars in the car park to Alum Chine beach and that it had failed to stop at the scene.

It was then reported that the vehicle had collided with five other cars along Poole Road and then was in collision with two further vehicles near to the Civic Centre.

The vehicle continued into Poole town centre when it was seen by officers along West Quay Road and failed to stop when requested by them. Officers safely brought it to a controlled stop along Holes Bay Road, causing minor damage to the rear of one police car.

Two female drivers from Poole are believed to have suffered minor injuries during the series of collisions.

A 21-year-old man from Poole has been arrested on suspicion of a number of driving offences and aggravated vehicle taking and is currently on police bail until the middle of September 2016 pending further enquiries.

Police Constable Dave Cotterill, of Dorset Police's Traffic Unit, said: "I am appealling to anyone who witnessed the Chrysler driving through Poole to contact police.

"I am particularly interested in hearing from anyone who may have dash cam or mobile phone footage of the series of incidents.

"I would also ask anyone who believes their vehicle may have been damaged and has not yet been in contact with us to come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 31:427. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
