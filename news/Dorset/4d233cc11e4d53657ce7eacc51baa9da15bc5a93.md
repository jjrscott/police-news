# Development in investigation into the death of Louella Fletcher-Michie at Bestival

22 February 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating the death of a woman at Bestival have re-arrested a man.

Just before 1am on Monday 11 September 2017 officers at the event were alerted to reports of a concern for welfare of Louella Eve Fletcher-Michie, 25 and from London, who had attended the festival at Lulworth Castle.

Very sadly, following a search of the area her body was located in a wooded area on the edge of the festival site.

An initial post-mortem examination carried out shortly after her death showed no clear signs of an assault. Further examinations have been carried out, including toxicology tests.

A 28-year-old man from London, who was known to Louella, was previously arrested on suspicion of murder and released under investigation.

Senior Investigating Officer Neil Devoto, of Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team, said: "Detectives have today, Thursday 22 February 2018, re-arrested a man at an address in Enfield in London on suspicion of manslaughter and drug supply offences. He is currently assisting officers with their enquiries.

"Louella's family has been updated with this development."
