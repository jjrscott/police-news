# Dorset Police is recruiting for more officers

03 February 2017

* * *

As of Monday 6 February, Dorset Police will be launching recruitment for police constables. Recruitment will run until Monday 13 February 2017.

While final numbers will depend on Force demand, Dorset Police intends to recruit for approximately 80 new officers to join the Force from December 2017.

Dorset Police needs people from diverse backgrounds with different skills and experiences to help us deliver excellence in local policing across Dorset. We welcome and encourage applications from all groups from within our communities.

Chief Constable Debbie Simpson said: "As a police constable, you would carry out a huge variety of roles. We are looking for committed, positive and conscientious individuals who want to make a difference to local communities across Dorset.

"The job is extremely rewarding as well as challenging. Dorset encompasses a real mix of urban and rural locations, where police constables can apply the new skills they will learn to meet local policing needs.

"I would also ask people who may initially think this role is not for them to reconsider. We need people who think differently and who bring diversity to the service.

"I ask prospective applicants to read all the information provided in the police recruitment brochure online and to take note of eligibility criteria, before trying to contact the Force."

Dorset Police and Crime Commissioner, Martyn Underhill said: "This intake of police constables provides a fantastic opportunity for individuals looking to work closely with communities across Dorset to tackle crime and disorder at a local level.

"As well as enhancing policing resilience, this recruitment round enables Dorset Police to benefit from the diverse range of skills and experiences that new recruits can bring to the Force."

To be eligible to apply, you must be aged 18 years or over by 28 March 2017. The Dorset Police website contains all the necessary information for those interested in the post, including an outline of the application process.
