# Witness appeal following reported robbery in Bournemouth

04 November 2019

* * *

Detectives investigating a reported robbery in Bournemouth town centre are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The incident occurred at around 12.40am on Friday 1 November 2019 in Old Christchurch Road.

A man aged in his 40s was walking along Old Christchurch Road near to the Dalkieth Steps when he stopped to have a brief conversation with a homeless man, who had a Staffy-type dog.

As he carried on walking, a second man - who had spoken briefly with the man with the dog - allegedly ran up behind him and assaulted him. The victim was reportedly dragged back down Old Christchurch Road by this man to the area outside the front of the Dalkeith Arcade.

He was allegedly punched a number of times and when he tried to flee the man followed and punched him to the back of the head, causing him to fall to the ground. Whilst he was on the ground the alleged offender reportedly pinned him to the ground, went through his pockets and stole a mobile phone, e-cigarette and keys.

Two members of the public in Halloween fancy dress then intervened and the alleged offender made off in the direction of Horseshoe Common.

Following enquiries by detectives, a 25-year-old man of no fixed abode was arrested and subsequently charged with robbery. He appeared at Poole Magistrates’ Court on Monday 4 November 2019 and is next due to appear at Bournemouth Crown Court on Thursday 5 December 2019.

Detective Constable Steph Ashworth, of Bournemouth CID, said: “We are continuing to investigate this matter and I would appeal for any witnesses or anyone with information to contact us.

“I am particularly keen to speak to the two young men who reportedly intervened in the incident who were in Halloween fancy dress.”
