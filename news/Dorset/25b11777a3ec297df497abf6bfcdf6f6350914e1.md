# Witness appeal following aggravated burglary in Dorchester

21 November 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating an aggravated burglary in Dorchester are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

Shortly after 12am on Monday 20 November 2017 two men forced entry to a property in Cambridge Road.

Once they were inside the men assaulted the three occupants of the house - a man and two teenage children - with a weapon, believed to be a baseball bat.

It is not believed that anything was taken from the property.

The offenders both wore face coverings and dark clothing.

The three victims were all taken to hospital, where they received treatment to cuts.

Detective Constable Nick Gravenor, of Weymouth CID, said: "We are continuing to investigate this incident and have made a number of enquiries, including house to house enquiries in the local area.

"I would urge any witnesses or anyone with information that can assist our investigation to please contact us immediately.

"We are supporting the victims and have increased patrols in the area to offer reassurance to the local community. Our officers can be approached with any concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170180561. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
