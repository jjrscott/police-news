# Assault in Boscombe â€“ witness appeal

22 March 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating an assault on a man in Boscombe are appealing for the public's help to find the person responsible.

At around 7.25pm on Saturday 18 March 2017 an unknown man entered an address in Aylesbury Road and assaulted the occupant.

The victim - a man aged in his 40s - sustained a small cut to his thigh which is believed to have been caused by a small peeling knife. He was taken to hospital for treatment. His condition is not life-threatening. Nothing was stolen.

The offender is described as white, aged 35, five feet ten inches tall and of medium build. He had long stubble and was possibly wearing a grey hooded top, dark blue jeans and a pair of dirty Nike trainers.

Detective Constable Amy Burbidge, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This would appear to have been an unprovoked attack and I would urge anyone who saw a man acting suspiciously in the Aylesbury Road area to please contact Dorset Police.

"Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team have been carrying out high-visibility patrols in the area to offer reassurance to the community and address any direct concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170040039. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
