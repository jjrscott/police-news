Police are appealing for witnesses after a serious road traffic collision between a car and a 4-year-old boy in Weymouth.

The incident happened at around 11.20am today, Saturday 5 August 2017, near to the tennis courts along Radipole Park Drive.

A grey Volkswagen Golf - being driven by a 23-year-old local woman - was in collision with the boy.

As a result of the collision, the child sustained serious injuries and was flown by air ambulance to Bristol Children's Hospital, where his condition is not believed to be life-threatening.

Police Sergeant Craig Tatton, of the traffic unit, said: "Specially-trained officers from Dorset Police are supporting the boy's next of kin at this difficult time.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision to please contact me."
