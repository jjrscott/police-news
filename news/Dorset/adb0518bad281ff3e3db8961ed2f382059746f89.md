# Witness appeal following assaults in Weymouth

11 January 2019

* * *

Officers investigating assaults on three people in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At 3.44am on Tuesday 1 January 2019 Dorset Police was called to reports of a fight between two groups of people on Turton Street.

Officers attended and discovered that three local men aged in their 20s had sustained minor cuts to either their faces or hands.

No suspects were located and enquiries are underway to identify them, including CCTV. It is believed the suspects were part of a group who had attended the town in fancy dress for New Year's Eve.

One of the main suspects is described as white, approximately five feet six inches tall, aged in his early 20s and of stocky build. He had short dark hair and was wearing a fancy dress costume, which made him look like he was sitting on someone's shoulders, and a denim jacket.

The second man is described as white, aged in his early 20s, around five feet nine inches tall, and of slim build. He was wearing a Santa outfit and Santa hat but no beard.

They were with four other people - a man wearing an elf T-shirt, another man wearing a grey tweed jacket and a brown trilby hat, a third man who wore jeans, a light-coloured hooded top and beanie hat and a woman who was wearing a snowman fancy dress costume.

Police Constable Rory Swinden, of Weymouth police, said: "We are aware there were a number of people in Turton Street at the time of the incident and I would ask anyone who witnessed what happened and has not yet spoken to officers to please come forward.

"I believe members of this group had been at an event to see in the New Year and it is possible someone may know who they are from the description of the clothing they were wearing. I would urge anyone who knows who they are to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190000143. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
