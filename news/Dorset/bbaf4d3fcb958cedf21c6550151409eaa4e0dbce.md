# Update â€“ teenagers due in court in connection with reported violent disorder in Bournemouth

16 January 2020

* * *

Six teenagers are due to appear in court in connection with an incident of reported violent disorder in Bournemouth.

The incident occurred at around 12.45am on Saturday 15 June 2019 on Albert Road in the town centre. It was reported that a group of four men aged in their 20s who were visiting Bournemouth for the weekend were approached by a group of teenagers who followed them up Old Christchurch Road and attacked them.

The men fled to an address on Richmond Hill where they called the emergency services. One of victims sustained four suspected stab wounds to his leg and back and he was taken to hospital for treatment for injuries that were not believed to be life-changing or life-threatening.

A second man also sustained a suspected stab wound to his leg, which was not believed to be life-changing or life-threatening.

Six teenage boys were arrested in connection with the incident and, following enquiries by detectives from Bournemouth CID, have been issued with postal requisitions to appear at court.

A 16-year-old boy has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Youth Court on Tuesday 28 January 2020 for an offence of assault. The other five boys - two aged 14, two 15-year-olds and a 17-year-old, all from Bournemouth - have all been issued with postal requisitions to appear at the same court on the same date for an offence of violent disorder.
