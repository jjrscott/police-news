# Appeal after explosion at house in Poole

22 October 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following an explosion at a property in Poole.

Dorset Police was called at 1.47pm today, Monday 22 October 2018, to the address in Sterte Road. The explosion had caused the property to partially collapse.

Nearby residents were evacuated as a precaution and a cordon was put in place.

The cause of the explosion is being investigated. The gas board has isolated the gas supply in the property and the focus of the investigation is on gas cylinders within the property.

A 66-year-old Poole man was arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage with intent to endanger life and was taken to hospital. He remains in hospital in a serious condition.

A woman aged in her 60s was treated at the scene for minor injuries. It is not believed anyone else was inside the building.

Detective Inspector Jamie Halford, of Dorset Police, said: "This incident required a significant multi-agency response and I would like to thank all those involved.

"We are continuing to liaise with the fire service to establish the cause and have launched a detailed investigation into the incident.

"I am appealing for anyone with information that can assist our investigation to contact us.

"I would like to thank motorists and members of the public for their patience during the road closures, which have been necessary to allow the emergency services to deal with the incident and investigate the circumstances. I would also like thank those residents who were evacuated for their co-operation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 22:205. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
