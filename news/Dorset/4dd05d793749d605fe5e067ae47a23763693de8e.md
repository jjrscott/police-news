# Woman sentenced for dealing drugs in Bournemouth

02 March 2021

* * *

A woman has been sentenced after she was seen by officers dealing drugs in Bournemouth.

Suzanne Rachael Nias, 44 and of Wootton Gardens in Bournemouth, was sentenced at Bournemouth Crown Court on Friday 26 February 2021 after previously pleading guilty at the same court to possession of cocaine and heroin and supplying cocaine and heroin.

She was handed a 22-month prison sentence, suspended for two years. Nias was also given a two-year community order.

At around 11.05am on Thursday 11 July 2019 officers from the Bournemouth South Neighbourhood Policing Team (NPT) were on proactive patrols when they spotted a group of suspected drug users loitering in the Stafford Road area.

Nias was seen to approach the group and make an exchange with one of them.

Officers went over to the group and detained Nias. Following a search, she was found to be in possession of money and a phone. A package also dropped to the floor from her hand, which was believed to contain heroin and crack cocaine.

She was arrested in connection with the incident and a search of her home address was carried out. A handbag was found that contained a handwritten piece of paper with a phone number on it.

Police Constable Stuart Grant, of Bournemouth South NPT, said: "Dorset Police takes drug dealing and drug-related activity extremely seriously as we recognise the detrimental impact it can have on our communities.

"We are committed to working with our partners and the community to tackle drug misuse and dealing and I would urge anyone with information about suspected drug related activity to contact at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101."
