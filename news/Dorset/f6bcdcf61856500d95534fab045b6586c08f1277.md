# Witness appeal after attempted street robbery in Bournemouth

03 August 2017

* * *

Detectives in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses after an attempted street robbery.

The incident happened at around 7.25pm on Wednesday 2 August 2017.

The victim - a man aged in his 20s - was walking along Abedare Road, when he was approached by two men.

Both the men threatened the victim verbally, before they each produced a small knife. The victim ran off, but was pursued, and was again threatened along Broughton Avenue. The offenders then ran off after the victim was able to alert a witness to call the police. He was not physically injured in the incident and nothing was taken.

The first offender is described as a white man, aged in his mid-20s, around five feet ten inches tall and of slim build. He had dark brown facial hair and was wearing a bright blue jacket with the hood up, dark grey jogging bottoms and was carrying a navy blue Stanley knife. He also spoke with an English accent.

The second offender is also described as a white man, aged in his mid-20s, and of a similar height and build, with brown hair. He was clean shaven and was wearing a black coat with a fur-lined hood, grey jogging bottoms and was carrying a small knife.

Detective Constable Karen Penn, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the incident or anyone acting suspiciously in the area at the time to contact Dorset Police.

"I would particularly like to hear from anyone who saw a silver BMW five-door estate driving in the area at the time as we believe the offenders may have left the area in that vehicle.

"We have already made a number of house to house and CCTV enquiries and officers have stepped up patrols in the area to reassure the public."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170118782. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
