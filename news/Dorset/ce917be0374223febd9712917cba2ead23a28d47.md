* * *

Detectives in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses following an attempted street robbery in the town.

The incident happened at around 8.50pm on Tuesday 6 December 2016 while the victim was standing at a bus stop at Cemetery Junction.

It was reported that two men approached the 22-year-old victim from Bournemouth and one of the men grabbed the victim's mobile phone from his pocket.

The victim managed to get the phone back, but he was then assaulted by the two men.

He suffered minor injuries that did not require medical treatment.

The victim then ran off along Charminster Road.

The first offender is described as white, around five feet nine inches tall and of medium build. He had a brown moustache and beard and short hair. He was wearing a dark-coloured waist-length padded jacket that had a zip, which was open.

The second offender is described as white, around six feet tall, of slim build and aged in his early 20s. He was wearing a grey or black beanie hat and loose fitting jeans.

Detective Constable Mark Richardson, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or has any information that could assist with the investigation to come forward.

"I would also ask that anyone who saw two men matching the description acting suspiciously in the area at the time to please contact police."
