# Knife amnesty in Dorset: 18 - 21 September 2018

13 September 2018

* * *

**No good can come of carrying a knife, so bin it.**

This is the message from Dorset Police as it launches a knife amnesty in the county.

Between Tuesday 18 September and Friday 21 September 2018 members of the public can dispose of unwanted knives and bladed items at designated police stations without fear of prosecution.

Knives of any description can be disposed of including illegal “zombie” knives, swords, kitchen knives, illegal lock knives, unwanted collectibles, replicas and ceremonial items.

Dorset Police is supporting a national week of action instigated by the Home Office with the aims of combating and raising awareness of knife crime.

The following stations will have collection bins in which members of the public can deposit items anonymously: Blandford, Bournemouth, Poole and Weymouth.

Please check opening times and station addresses on the Dorset Police website: www.dorset.police.uk/contact-us/visit-us/

Superintendent Jared Parkin, Dorset Police knife crime lead, said: “In Dorset knife crime does not reach the levels that are reported in some major metropolitan areas of the country.

“However this week we are supporting the national knife amnesty as part of our ongoing local approach. Focusing on prevention is key, as any knife taken out of circulation and off the street helps to prevent injuries and deaths.”

“Carrying a knife or bladed article is not only illegal but incredibly dangerous.

“Dorset Police’s message is simple: No good can come of carrying a knife.”

As well as responding to reports of someone carrying a knife, police officers can proactively use their powers to search where information or intelligence indicates it is necessary.

Between January to July 2018, there were 237 crimes where a knife was used to commit an offence. Over 100 searches for knives have been carried out since the beginning of 2018, where a knife was found on 12 occasions, and a further 15 voluntary interviews for possession of a knife.

Dorset Police and Crime Commissioner Martyn Underhill said: "I fully support this initiative and would encourage anyone to take this opportunity to dispose of a knife safely and anonymously.

“Knife crime has a devastating effect on people’s lives and is causing concern for communities locally and nationally. We must take every opportunity to make people aware that carrying a knife can have extremely serious consequences and doing so poses a serious danger to themselves and to others.”

The maximum penalty for an adult carrying a knife is four years in prison and carries an unlimited fine, with a guaranteed prison sentence if you’re convicted of carrying a knife more than once.
