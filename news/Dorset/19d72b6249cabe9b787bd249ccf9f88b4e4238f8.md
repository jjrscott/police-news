# Appeal to find wanted man

08 March 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for the public's help to find a man who is wanted in connection with drug offences.

Michael Appleton, 26 and of Manchester, is wanted on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drug heroin in Weymouth on Thursday 4 February 2016.

Michael Appleton is described as white, five feet 11 inches tall and with brown hair. He is known to have connections in both Manchester and Dorset.

On Monday 6 March 2017 Paul Corrigan, previously of Liverpool but currently of no fixed abode, was jailed for five years at Bournemouth Crown Court having been found guilty of being concerned in the supply of Class A drug heroin.

The court heard that on Thursday 4 February 2016 Corrigan, 33, and another man were involved in the supply of 1,216mg of diamorphine to two women in the Melcombe Regis car park.

Subsequent enquiries led officers to Corrigan and he was arrested on Wednesday 14 September 2016 and charged two days later.

The second man has been identified as Michael Appleton and he is still wanted by officers.

Anyone with information as to the whereabouts of Michael Appleton should dial 999 immediately. Anyone else with other information should call 101 quoting occurrence number 55160047430 or Crimestoppers in confidence on 0800 555 111.
