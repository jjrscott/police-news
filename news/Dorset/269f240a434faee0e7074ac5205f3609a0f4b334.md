# Appeal for information following reported robbery in Weymouth

24 September 2019

* * *

Detectives investigating an alleged robbery in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 8.20pm on Sunday 22 September 2019 the victim, a man aged in his 20s from Weymouth, was leaving a property in Gordon Row in Chapelhay through a communal area when he noticed a number of people on the stairs behind him.

A man reportedly stopped him from leaving the property and demanded that the victim give him money. It was alleged that this man took his wallet and phone before a second man took the victim's watch from his wrist.

A third man was reportedly seen to be in possession of a knife and head-butted the victim to the left side of his face.

The victim was able to get out of the property. On leaving he saw a couple with a dog and asked them to call the police. He then saw another couple on the town bridge, who took him to a taxi office where the incident was reported to police.

The victim sustained a swollen lip and cut to his mouth and was treated by the ambulance service.

Following enquiries, a 40-year-old Weymouth man and a 37-year-old Portland man have been arrested on suspicion of robbery. A 39-year-old woman of no fixed abode and a 36-year-old Weymouth woman were also arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit robbery. All four have been released under investigation.

Detective Constable Charlie Soutine, of Weymouth CID, said: "We are continuing to investigate this incident and I am appealing to any witnesses or anyone with information to contact us.

"I am particularly keen to speak to the couple with the dog who were reportedly approached by the victim as he left the address in Gordon Row."
