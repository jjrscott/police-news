# Street robbery in Bournemouth - witness appeal

05 October 2016

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses after a man suffered a broken jaw following a street robbery in Bournemouth.

The incident happened at around 12.10am on Monday 3 October 2016 along Wimborne Road, close to the junction of Withermoor Road in Winton.

Three men approached the victim and demanded cash. One of the offenders then took the victim's phone before punching him twice in the face.

The three offenders then made off along Wycliffe Road.

The victim - a 23-year-old local man - was taken to hospital, where he required an operation on his injuries.

The first offender is described as white, around five feet ten inches tall, of medium build and was balding. He was also wearing a grey jacket.

The two other offenders were described as white and around six feet one inch tall.

Detective Constable Luke Davis, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was a cowardly attack that has left the victim very traumatised.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or saw three men matching the description acting suspiciously in the area at the time to contact me."
