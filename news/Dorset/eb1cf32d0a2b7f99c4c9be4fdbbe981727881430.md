# Image appeal following theft from vehicle near Hurn

17 November 2020

* * *

Officers investigating the theft of valuable rings from a vehicle near Hurn are issuing images of the stolen items as they appeal for anyone with information to come forward.

The victim had parked their vehicle, a black Kia Sportage, in a small gravel car park near to the Mildren Construction site on Matchams Lane when it was broken into between 11.30am and 11.45am on Monday 16 November 2020.

The passenger window was smashed and a handbag was stolen, which contained a purse. Inside the purse were three rings - a platinum gold engagement ring with a square diamond worth an estimated £4,400, a platinum gold eternity ring worth nearly £1,500 and a platinum gold wedding ring valued at more than £500.

Police Community Support Investigator Chis Wilson, of Dorset Police, said: "We are making enquiries into this theft and I would urge anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the Matchams Lane area around the relevant time, or may have captured anything on dashcam, to please contact us.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who comes across these items of jewellery matching those stolen being offered for sale in unusual circumstances locally or online.

"Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to remind members of the public not to leave valuable items unattended in their vehicles wherever possible."
