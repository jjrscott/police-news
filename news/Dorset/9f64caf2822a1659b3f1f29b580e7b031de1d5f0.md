# Witness appeal following hate crime incident in Beaminster

08 December 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following a hate crime incident in Beaminster.

At around 3.50pm on Wednesday 2 December 2020 the male victim was walking his dog along Hogshill Street when he saw a vehicle parked on the pavement, causing him to have to walk in the road to get around it.

The victim asked the driver of the vehicle to move it off the pavement. It is reported that the driver shouted racially aggravated abuse at the victim.

Police Constable Dan White, of Bridport police, said: "There is no place for hate crime in the community and I am carrying out an investigation to identify the man responsible.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the time and witnessed what happened to please get in touch.

"I would also ask residents or motorists to check their home CCTV systems or dashcams for any relevant footage to assist my enquiries."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200181408. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
