# Family tribute following fatal collision near Weymouth

09 April 2020

* * *

The family of a man who very sadly died in a collision near Weymouth has issued a tribute to their loved one.

Officers were called at 11.41am on Sunday 22 March 2020 to reports of a collision on the A354 Weymouth Relief Road involving a white Nissan Micra and a white Mercedes.

Sadly the driver of the Micra, named by his family as 54-year-old Billy Denton from Yateley in Hampshire, suffered very serious injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene. A woman, who was also travelling in the car, sustained serious injuries and was flown by air ambulance to Southampton General Hospital.

The family of Billy Denton has issued the following tribute: "As for our loss, we will treasure the great memories we all shared. He was one of a kind. We could call on him at any time and he always found a solution. He was such a joker and made us all laugh, and he taught us not to take life too seriously. He was a true naturalist, a resourceful, kind and thoughtful partner, dad, brother and adoring grandad to Samuel. His family meant the world to him - we never questioned if he loved or cared for us because he made it so obvious. Not a day will go by that we don't think of him and smile, we'll cherish his memory, he will live on in our hearts and minds. Always."

Sergeant Nikki Burt, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with Billy's family at this extremely difficult time and they are being supported by specially-trained officers.

"We are continuing our investigation to establish the full circumstance of the collision and I would urge anyone who witnessed the incident or has relevant dashcam footage and has not already spoken to police to please contact us."
