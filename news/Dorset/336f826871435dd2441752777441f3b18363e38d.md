Detectives are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following an alleged assault in Charminster near Dorchester.

Dorset Police was called at 9.07pm on Saturday 10 December 2016 to a report of an assault on a man outside The Three Compasses pub in The Square.

It is reported that the victim - a local man aged in his 20s - was hit over the head with an unknown glass object by another man.

He sustained lacerations to his face, which required treatment at hospital.

Detective Constable Siobhan Lovering, of Weymouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in The Square at the time of the incident and witnessed what happened to please contact Dorset Police."
