# Fail-to-stop collision in Ferndown â€“ witness appeal

08 October 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a fail-to-stop collision in Ferndown are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

At 5.34am on Monday 7 October 2019 Dorset Police received a report of an injured cyclist on the A31 between the Ameysford and Palmersford roundabouts.

The cyclist - aged in his 60s and from Wimborne - sustained a head injury and was taken to Poole Hospital. His condition is described as serious.

Police Constable Craig Jeffery, of the traffic unit, said: "Following enquiries we believe that the cyclist was involved in a collision and the driver failed to stop at the scene.

"We recovered a wing mirror from the scene. I am urging anyone who was travelling in the area at the time to check their vehicles as the driver may not have realised they were involved in a collision.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or may have relevant dashcam footage to assist my investigation to come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at scit@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 7:32. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
