# Witness appeal after assaults in Bournemouth

15 September 2016

* * *

Detectives in Bournemouth are appealing for the public's help after two women were assaulted in separate incidents in the Ensbury Park area of town.

The latest incident happened at around 10.30pm on Wednesday 14 September 2016.

The victim - a woman aged in her 20s - was running along a footpath in a wooded area at Slades Farm listening to music on her headphones when she was approached from behind by an unknown man and pushed to the ground.

The victim started to scream and the offender ran off in the opposite direction.

She did not see her attacker. This incident was reported to police at 3pm today, Thursday 15 September.

The earlier incident happened at around 7.07pm on Tuesday 13 September along Boundary Road.

The victim - a woman also aged in her 20s - was walking when she was approached by a man on a bicycle and pushed to the ground. The victim started to scream and at this point the man got back onto his bike and rode off in the direction of Redhill Park.

The offender in the second incident is described as white, approximately six feet tall, of slim build, aged in his 30s and scruffy looking.

He was wearing all red sports clothes with a hood that was pulled over his face. There were two yellow stripes down each sleeve of the top. The bicycle he was riding was yellow in colour.

Detective Inspector Kate Lill, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We are obviously deeply concerned about these two incidents, which has left both women understandably very shaken.

"I would like to reassure the community that we have specially-trained officers running each investigation and offering support to both women.

"At this stage we believe the same man could be responsible for both offences and I am asking for the public's help to find him.

"I would urge anyone who may have witnessed either incident or saw a man acting suspiciously in the area at the relevant time to contact me.

"Officers from the local Neighbourhood Policing Team have stepped up patrols in the area to offer reassurance to the public. We would remind members of the public to be vigilant and if you see a man matching the description given to please contact the police urgently."
