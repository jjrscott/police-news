# Witness appeal following series of thefts from vans in Sherborne

05 July 2018

* * *

Officers investigating a series of thefts from vans in Sherborne are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

A total of six vans were targeted on the night of Tuesday 26 June 2018 and police are warning vehicle owners to take appropriate security measures and not leave valuable items in them overnight.

Two vehicles were broken into in Lenthay Road, with vans also targeted in St Catherine's Way, Bristol Road, St Paul's Green and Simons Road.

In four of the incidents tools or gardening equipment were taken from the vans and in the other two cases entry was forced but nothing was stolen.

Police Sergeant Ged Want, of the Dorchester and Sherborne Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "We are reminding van owners to remove expensive items from the vehicles overnight and to consider supplementary security measures to deter thieves.

"This can include parking in a way that prevents easy access to rear or sliding doors, fitting tool security boxes to vans and fitting alarms or additional locks.

"With keyless vans owners can fit a steering lock and keep the key in a secure place."

Anyone with information about the van thefts is urged to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180104788. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
