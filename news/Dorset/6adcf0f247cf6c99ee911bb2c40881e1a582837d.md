# CCTV appeal following hate crime incident in Bournemouth

24 February 2021

* * *

Officers investigating an incident where a shop worker was racially abused in Bournemouth are issuing CCTV images of the suspect.

At around 7.45am on Thursday 21 January 2021 a woman entered the Co-op store in Madeira Road and made a coffee from the shop's coffee machine. The woman then went to leave without paying for the coffee and a member of staff challenged her.

She responded by shouting racial abuse at the man and threw the coffee over his uniform.

The man did not sustain any injuries.

Police Constable Ryan Greenwell, of Bournemouth police, said: "We take hate crime such as this extremely seriously. It was a very distressing incident for the victim and we are determined to do all we can to identify the woman responsible.

"We have obtained CCTV images of the suspect and I would urge anyone with information as to her identity to please come forward."
