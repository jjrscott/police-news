# Witness appeal following arson in Ashley Heath

23 March 2020

* * *

Officers investigating an arson incident at a country park in Ashley Heath are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 5.10pm on Thursday 19 March 2020 a group of three young people set fire to benches and play park equipment in Moors Valley Country Park and Forest.

The fires were quickly extinguished by staff members, but damage was caused to the items.

One of the group of young people is described as male and was wearing a yellow hooded top and glasses. A second male member of the group was described as having dark hair and was wearing black-coloured clothing.

Police Constable Steve Knight, of Ferndown police, said: "Thankfully, the fires were extinguished before they were able to take hold and cause a risk to life for anyone using the surrounding forest.

"I am appealing to anyone who saw any suspicious activity in the area at the relevant time to please get in touch.

"Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team have been carrying out increased patrols in the area, assisted by Dorset Council."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200042343. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
