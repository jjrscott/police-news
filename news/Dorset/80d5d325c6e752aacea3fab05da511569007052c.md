# Appeal after street robbery in Weymouth

13 December 2017

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses and information from the public after a man was robbed Weymouth.

At about 10.05pm on Monday 11 December 2017, the victim was followed by a group of men as he walked along King Street and into Ranelagh Road.

Two of the group knocked the victim through a door and into the hallway of a house and stole his bag containing cash.

The victim - a 50-year-old man from Weymouth - sustained bruising and cuts to the face and body.

CCTV and house to house enquiries are ongoing.

Detective Constable Gerald Marchant, of Weymouth CID, said: "This was an unprovoked attack that left the victim bleeding heavily from his nose.

"I would ask the public to cast their mind back to around 10pm on Monday 11 December and to contact me urgently if they recall any suspicious activity in the King Street or Ranelagh Road areas.

"I'd like to hear from anyone who witnessed this incident and, in particular, any witnesses who came to the aid of the victim."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170192244. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
