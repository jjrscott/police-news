Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a serious road traffic collision in Ferndown.

At approximately 10.40am today, Thursday 11 January 2018, a collision occurred involving a grey Volkswagen Golf and a cyclist on Ham Lane.

The cyclist, a 63-year-old man from Bournemouth, sustained a serious head injury and was taken to Poole Hospital for treatment. He is in a life-threatening condition.

The driver of the Volkswagen was uninjured.

Road closures were put in place between Stapehill Road and the roundabout at the junction with Ringwood Road.

Police Sergeant Phil Lee, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or the driving of either the car or the cyclist immediately prior to the incident to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would also like to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time and may have dashcam footage that would assist with my investigation.

"I wish to thank everyone for their patience while the road closures were in place, which are absolutely necessary to allow us to investigate this collision thoroughly."
