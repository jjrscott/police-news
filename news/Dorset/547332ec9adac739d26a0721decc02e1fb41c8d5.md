# Witness appeal following reported arsons at industrial estate in Weymouth

21 January 2017

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward after two reported arsons at an industrial estate in Weymouth.

Officers were called at 6.21am today, Saturday 21 January 2017, by Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service to reports of a fire at City Plumbing in Albany Road on the Granby Industrial Estate.

It is alleged the fire was started deliberately at the premises at around 6am.

Detectives are now investigating the incident and are linking it to a reported arson at Dorset Insulation which occurred overnight between Wednesday 18 January and Thursday 19 January 2017. Both businesses rent a section of the same industrial unit.

A 23-year-old man from Weymouth has been arrested on suspicion of arson and is currently assisting officers with enquiries.

No one was injured in either incident, although a substantial amount of damage has been caused to the business unit.

Detective Constable Ian Davies, of Weymouth CID, said: "We believe the two fires at this business premises are linked and I am appealing to anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious in the area at the relevant times to please contact Dorset Police."
