Detectives investigating a collision involving a car and a pedestrian in Poole have released a man under investigation.

The collision involving a silver Mercedes A-Class and a pedestrian occurred at around 12.30am on Friday 17 November 2017 on Lindsay Road, near the entrance to The Oasis. The Mercedes initially left the scene but returned around ten minutes later.

The pedestrian, a Poole man aged in his 30s, was taken to hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries.

It is believed the driver and the pedestrian were known to each other.

A 50-year-old local man was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Detective Sergeant Andy Haworth, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We are continuing to investigate this incident to try and establish exactly what happened.

"I would urge anyone who witnessed the collision or who has any further information that can assist our investigation to contact police immediately. I would also like to hear from anyone who might have CCTV or dashcam footage covering the area at the relevant time."
