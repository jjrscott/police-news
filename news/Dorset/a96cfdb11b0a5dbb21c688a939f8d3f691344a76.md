# Dorset Police lifts lid on Bournemouth policing in social media campaign

13 December 2017

* * *

As part of a safety campaign, the Force will be offering members of the public a unique insight into what policing on a Friday night in Bournemouth town centre involves.

Dorset Police is issuing advice around safety in the night-time economy, which forms part of the wider #ThisChristmas festive crime prevention campaign. This Friday evening from 6pm, members of the public will be able to follow the work of PC Anthony Berry and PC Adam Steeves via the hashtag #DPNightOut on Twitter (@DorsetPolice), Facebook (Dorset Police) and Instagram (Dorset_Police).

Superintendent Jared Parkin, Commander for Bournemouth police, said: “We are running this campaign to raise awareness of the importance of staying safe from harm while on a night out.

“We know that Christmas is a perfect time to go out celebrating with friends and family, and this social media event is a fantastic opportunity to share our work with the public and get their take on how Dorset Police is protecting them while they are out enjoying themselves this Christmas.

“The last thing we want to do is stop anyone having fun. We just want to encourage people to consider their personal safety before going on a night out and to make decisions during the night that do not put themselves or others in danger.

“Excessive drinking lowers your inhibitions and can result in you doing things you may later regret. It also affects your senses and can make you less aware of potential dangers. This can lead to people getting themselves into trouble with the law and makes them more likely to be a victim of crime. Please follow our advice and help Dorset Police keep our night time communities safe.”

Follow the hashtag #DPNightOut on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram this Friday from 6pm.
