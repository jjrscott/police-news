Detectives investigating the reported rape of a teenage girl in Dorchester have arrested a man.

Dorset Police received a report that at around 9.20pm on Thursday 5 December 2019 a 15-year-old girl was raped in a field at St Osmund's School in Barnes Way.

It was reported that the victim was walking along the field when she was approached by a man and forced onto the ground before being sexually assaulted.

An investigation into the incident was launched, led by detectives from the Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT).

Following extensive enquiries, a Dorchester man aged in his 30s has been arrested on suspicion of rape. He is assisting detectives with their investigation.

Detective Inspector Wayne Seymour, of MCIT, said: "We have kept the girl and her family updated throughout our investigation and they have been informed of this latest development. She continues to be supported by specially-trained officers.

"I appreciate this incident has caused concern for the local community and I would like to thank members of the public for their support and information they have provided during this ongoing investigation."
