# Appeal after alleged assault in Weymouth

26 January 2017

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses after an alleged assault in Weymouth - with two men being arrested.

The incident happened at around 11pm on Saturday 21 January 2017 in the Golden Lion pub on St Edmund Street.

It is alleged that the victim - a local man aged in his 60s - was pushed, causing him to fall to the ground.

The victim sustained a broken leg that required surgery.

A 33-year-old Portland man and a 34-year-old Weymouth man have been arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm without intent and are on police bail until early March 2017 pending further enquiries.

Detective Constable Sarah Desmond, of Weymouth CID, said: "I believe there were a number of people in the pub at the time of the incident and I would appeal for them to come forward.

"Anyone with information that could help with my investigation should contact police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170010640. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
