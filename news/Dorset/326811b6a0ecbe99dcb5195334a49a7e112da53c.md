# Witness appeal after man discovered seriously injured on Portland

12 February 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for the public’s help to establish how a man sustained serious injuries on Portland.

At 7.40pm on Friday 9 February 2018 Dorset Police was called by the ambulance service to reports that a local man aged in his 60s had been discovered seriously injured near to steps on Clovens Road close to the junction with Killicks Hill in Fortuneswell.

He remains in hospital receiving treatment to a serious head injury. His condition is not believed to be life-threatening.

Subsequent enquiries have established that the man left the Cove House Inn in Fortuneswell at around 7.20pm and began to walk home. His route took him south along the promenade that forms the sea wall toward Quiddles Café.

Detective Constable Declan Cummings, of Weymouth CID, said: “At this time we do not know how this man sustained his injuries and it could be that he received them as a result of an accident. However, I am keen to hear from anyone who was in the area of the promenade at the relevant time and may have seen the man or what happened to him. I would ask any witnesses or anyone with information to please contact Dorset Police.”

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk, or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180021452. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
