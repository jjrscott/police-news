# Update â€“ witness appeal following reported assault in Corfe Mullen

10 July 2018

* * *

A man has been arrested in connection with a reported assault at a pub in Corfe Mullen.

At around 9.30pm on Saturday 7 July 2018 officers were called to reports of a fight involving about 10 people at The Dorset Soldier in Wareham Road. Officers attended but the fight had dispersed and no offences were disclosed.

Approximately 30 minutes later it was reported that a man had knocked a 49-year-old man from Corfe Mullen unconscious in the pub car park before leaving the scene.

The alleged victim was taken to hospital for treatment to injuries to his head and neck.

A 26-year-old local man has been arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent and has been released under investigation.

Detectives investigating the incident are still appealing for any witnesses who have not already spoken to police to come forward.
