Detectives investigating a reported disturbance in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 8.15pm on Monday 22 February 2021 Dorset Police received a report of a disturbance involving a group of people in the vicinity of the Star off licence in Bournemouth Road.

Officers attended and two men were subsequently found with injuries in Ashley Road. One of the men was reportedly found in possession of a knife.

A 26-year-old Poole man was arrested on suspicion of affray and a 22-year-old Bournemouth man was arrested on suspicion of possessing an offensive weapon in a public place.

Both men were taken to hospital for treatment before being released and taken into police custody.

Following further enquiries, a 33-year-old Poole man was arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent and affray and a 41-year-old woman from Poole was arrested on suspicion of affray.

All four of those arrested are assisting detectives with their enquiries as their investigation continues.
