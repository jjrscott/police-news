# Appeal to locate owner of possible stolen cat

13 September 2017

* * *

Officers are hoping to trace the owner of a cat found in Poole that they believe may have been stolen.

At 9.15am on Monday 11 September 2017 Dorset Police received a report of anti-social behaviour relating to two men and two women in the area of the Serpentine Lane car park.

Officers attended and moved the group on. They were found to have with them a cat in a box, which one of the women claimed they had found abandoned.

Police took the cat, which does not have a microchip, to a local vets and it is currently being kept there. It is said to be a little underweight but otherwise healthy and officers are keen to trace the animal's owner.

Police Constable Vanessa Hall, of Poole police, said: "We believe this lovely, affectionate young cat may have been stolen and we are keen to locate the owner so it can return home.

"I am appealing for anyone with any information to contact us."
