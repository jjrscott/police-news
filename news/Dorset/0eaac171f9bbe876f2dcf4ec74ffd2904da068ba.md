A man arrested in connection with a reported assault on a woman in Weymouth will face no further police action.

At around 8.45am on Thursday 10 December 2020 Dorset Police was called to reports that a woman aged in her 20s had been assaulted on Dorchester Road.

It was alleged that a man had got out of a car, grabbed the woman and punched her to the stomach.

A 35-year-old local man was arrested on suspicion of assault and was released on police bail. He has now been released from bail without charge and will face no further police action.

Officers are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.
