# Witness appeal following burglary in Blandford

02 December 2016

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a burglary in Blandford.

Sometime between 1pm and 9pm on Thursday 1 December 2016 offenders gained access to a property in Damory Court Street.

A number of items of jewellery and six war medals belonging to the victim's father were stolen.

Police Constable Matt Weldon, of Blandford police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious in the area of Damory Court Street during the relevant time to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who has seen or been offered items of jewellery or war medals for sale in suspicious circumstances in the last 24 hours.

"Finally, I would like to remind residents to be vigilant, to ensure their properties are secure and report any suspicious activity to Dorset Police.

"The items stolen during this incident are of great personal significance to the victim who has, in effect, had her family history stolen from her. I would urge those responsible to do the right and moral thing and return these items."
