10 October 2018

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with a serious injury collision near Bridport.

At 8.23am on Sunday 17 December 2017 a three vehicle collision occurred on the A35 at Morecombelake involving a silver Citroen C3, a silver BMW 320 convertible and a silver Vauxhall Astra.

The occupants of the Citroen, a 77-year-old woman and an 81-year-old man from Bridport, were both taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries. They have since been discharged from hospital.

The driver of the BMW sustained minor injuries and the driver of the Vauxhall was uninjured.

A 28-year-old Weymouth man has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Friday 19 October 2018 for offences of driving a motor vehicle with the proportion of a specified controlled drug above the prescribed limit, two charges of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and driving without valid insurance.
