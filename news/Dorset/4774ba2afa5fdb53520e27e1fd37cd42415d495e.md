# Witness appeal after criminal damage caused to cars in Weymouth

25 February 2017

* * *

Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward after vandals caused damage to cars in Weymouth.

Sometime between 7.30pm on Friday 24 February and 8.30am today, Saturday 25 February 2017, a number of cars parked in Victoria Street and Grange Road in the town centre were targeted.

Residents woke up this morning to discover that 10 vehicles had sustained damaged wing mirrors or wiper blades, while a further 16 were tampered with. In these cases wing mirrors were moved or bent back but no permanent damage was caused.

Police Sergeant Mark Dent, of Weymouth police, said: "This mindless vandalism has caused a great deal of upset and inconvenience to residents and I would urge anyone who knows who was responsible to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would also ask anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious in the area between the relevant times to please come forward.

"Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team will be carrying out patrols in the area to offer reassurance to residents."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170028539. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
