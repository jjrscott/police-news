# Renewed appeal following reported theft of car from Gillingham

14 June 2019

* * *

Officers are renewing their appeal for witnesses after a car was reportedly stolen from a hotel car park in Gillingham.

It was alleged that sometime between 5pm on Wednesday 5 June and 6.20am on Thursday 6 June 2019 a grey Seat Leon with the registration YC64 SJY was stolen from the Red Lion pub car park on the High Street.

Yesterday, Thursday 13 June 2019, a 23-year-old man of no fixed abode was arrested in Priory Road in Bournemouth on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle and has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Inspector Simon Perry, of North Dorset police, said: "A set of keys for the Seat Leon have been recovered but the vehicle has not yet been located.

"We are continuing to carry out a number of enquiries in relation to this incident and I would appeal to anyone who knows the whereabouts of the vehicle to please contact Dorset Police.

"It is possible that the vehicle might be in the Priory Road area of Bournemouth so I would ask that anyone who sees a grey Seat Leon in suspicious circumstances to get in touch."
