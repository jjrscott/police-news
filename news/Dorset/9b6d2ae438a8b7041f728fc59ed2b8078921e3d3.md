# Witness appeal following sexual assault in Christchurch

10 March 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for any witnesses to come forward after a woman was sexually assaulted in Christchurch.

The incident occurred at around 1.45am today, Saturday 10 March 2018, as the victim walked along Stour Road. A man approached her, asked a number of questions and then sexually assaulted her over her clothing.

The victim - a local woman aged in her 30s - shouted at the offender, pushed and kicked him and he ran away. She then called the police.

Officers attended but no offender was located.

He is described as white, approximately 30 years old, five feet seven inches tall, of medium build, with brown hair in a short crew cut hairstyle and some facial hair. He spoke with an accent, described as possibly Polish or Romanian and wore dark clothing.

The victim is being supported by specially-trained officers.

Detective Constable Honor McAdam, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We are carrying out a number of enquiries in the Stour Road area, including house-to-house visits and CCTV searches.

"I would urge anyone who was in Stour Road at the relevant time and saw a man acting suspiciously to please contact Dorset Police.

"Enquiries are also underway to locate a male taxi driver who was dropping off a fare in Stour Road just before the incident. I would ask this witness to please come forward as I believe he may have important information that could assist my investigation.

"Finally, I would ask any motorists who were in the Barrack Road or Stour Road area at around 1.45am this morning and have dashcams fitted in their vehicles to please make contact."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180036293. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 55511 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
