Officers searching for a missing man in Purbeck are renewing their appeal for help from the public to find him - with an image of his last confirmed sighting being released.

Patrick Guinard, aged 66 and from Woking, was reported missing to Surrey Police having last been seen at his home address at around 9am on Wednesday 5 February 2020.

He was last seen wearing his cycling clothing, which was possibly pale blue and grey and black trousers, and travelled on his road bike.

Patrick is described as white, five feet five inches tall and of slim build with dark hair that is starting to grey and has a French accent.

Following enquiries, officers from Dorset Police located Patrick's bike in a public car park at Renscombe in Worth Matravers on Saturday 8 February 2020. His helmet, goggles and gloves were also found.

Further searches on the same day led to a bag belonging to Patrick being located on the beach at Ringstead Bay.

Chief Inspector Neil Wood, of Dorset Police, said: "During our extensive enquiries we have established that Patrick used the Sandbanks Ferry at around midday on Wednesday 5 February and this is the last confirmed sighting of him.

"We are continuing to search and make enquiries to try and locate Patrick and I would like to reiterate my appeal to anyone with information about his whereabouts, or who sees a man matching the description given, to please contact us immediately."

Anyone with information or knowledge as to Patrick's whereabouts is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200020288.
