Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a serious injury road traffic collision between a car and a schoolboy in Poole.

The incident happened at around 8.09am today, Wednesday 12 October 2016, in Sherborn Crescent in the Canford Heath area.

The seven-year-old boy was walking to school with his parents at the time of the collision. He has been taken to Poole Hospital with critical injuries. His parents are with him and are being supported by specially trained officers.
