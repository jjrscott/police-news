# Witness appeal following burglary in West Moors

29 November 2016

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following a burglary in West Moors.

Sometime between 7.30am on Thursday 24 November and 7.15pm on Friday 25 November 2016, offenders gained entry to a property on Station Road near to the junction with Moorside Road and Pinehurst Road.

A number of items were stolen including a large quantity of cash, high-value watches and a large safe.

Detective Constable Matt Cooke, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We believe that the offenders would have needed to use a vehicle to transport the large safe out of the property.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious in the Station Road area at the relevant time to contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who saw a large safe being carried in the area."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55160177321. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
