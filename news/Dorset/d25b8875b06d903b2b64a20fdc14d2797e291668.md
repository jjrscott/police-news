# Witness appeal following reported assault in Poole

24 February 2021

* * *

Officers investigating an alleged assault on a child in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

It was reported that at around 3.50pm on Monday 22 February 2021 a man was seen with an eight-year-old girl outside the Co-op store in Blandford Road, Hamworthy. The man allegedly assaulted the girl before they went into a nearby address.

Officers attended and located the man and the girl, who were known to each other. The girl did not sustain any serious injuries.

A 42-year-old local man has been arrested on suspicion of assault and he has been released on police bail while enquiries continue.

Detective Constable Laura McQueen, of Dorset Police's Child Abuse Investigation Team, said: "We are carrying out an investigation into this alleged assault and appropriate safeguarding measures have been put in place in relation to the girl involved.

"I would appeal to anyone who witnessed the incident or who may have been driving in the area and captured anything relevant on dashcam, to please contact us.

"I am particularly keen to speak to a woman who went to intervene in the incident outside the Co-op store in Blandford Road."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210030270.
