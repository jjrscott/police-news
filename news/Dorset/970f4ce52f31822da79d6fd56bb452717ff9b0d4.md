# Witness appeal following aggravated burglary in Ferndown

01 February 2021

* * *

Detectives investigating an aggravated burglary in Ferndown are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police received a report that at around 1.50am on Wednesday 27 January 2021 three men forced entry to an address in Wollaton Road.

Threats were made to the occupants and the men stole a number of items from the house as well as a black Range Rover Velar from outside, which was subsequently abandoned in the West Howe area of Bournemouth.

There were no reports of any injuries to the victims. No arrests have been made at this stage.

From enquiries, it is believed that this was a targeted attack and there is no information to suggest any threat to members of the wider public.

Detective Inspector Andrew Kennard, of Bournemouth CID, said: "Detectives have launched a full investigation into this matter.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or has any information to assist our enquiries to please get in contact."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210016587. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
