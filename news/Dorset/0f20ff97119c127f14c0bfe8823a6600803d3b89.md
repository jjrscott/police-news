Detectives investigating a stabbing in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The incident occurred at around 10.45pm yesterday, Friday 16 November 2018 on The Esplanade near to the King's Statue.

The victim, a man aged in his 30s, was involved in an altercation with a group of two men and a woman and sustained a stab wound to his back.

He was taken to hospital for treatment. The injury was not believed to be life-threatening and he has since been discharged from hospital.

Detective Sergeant Rhys Griffiths, of Weymouth CID, said: "I would like to reassure members of the public that we are carrying out a detailed investigation into this incident to identify those involved.

"I am appealing for anyone who may have witnessed an altercation in the area of the King's Statue around the relevant time to contact us.

"I am aware from our enquiries that there were several members of public on The Esplanade at the time of the offence who would have directly witnessed this incident involving the victim, who was wearing a distinctive red jacket. I am particularly keen to locate and speak with a female witness who was wearing a brown woollen jacket and was stood outside EDZ on The Esplanade and a man wearing a brown duffle coat waiting at the adjacent bus stop."
