# Appeal for information following assault in Bournemouth

29 December 2020

* * *

Officers investigating an assault on a woman in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 9.30am on Wednesday 16 December 2020 a woman aged in her 70s was walking along the promenade on Undercliff Drive toward Boscombe Pier when she noticed two male runners and a dog pass from behind.

It is reported that a short time later the two runners and their dog came toward the woman in the opposite direction near to the Manor Steps zig-zag area. The dog started jumping at the woman and she backed away.

The two male runners approached the victim and she said that the dog should have been on a lead. It is then reported that one of the men punched her in the face.

The victim sustained a number of lacerations to her eye socket and a black eye that did not require hospital treatment.

The two men are described as aged in their mid to late 20s, approximately six feet tall and of athletic build with short straight black hair. The first man was wearing black running bottoms and a black long sleeved top with white stripes on it. The second man was wearing all black clothing.

The dog is described as similar to a Pit bull terrier with a grey, short-haired, shiny coat and of medium size with short legs and a snub nose.

Police Constable Sara Johnson, of Dorset Police, said: "This incident left the victim extremely shaken up and I am doing all that I can to identify the two male runners.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident and has not yet spoken to police to please get in touch.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who may recognise the two men and their dog from the CCTV image or the descriptions given."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200188735. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
