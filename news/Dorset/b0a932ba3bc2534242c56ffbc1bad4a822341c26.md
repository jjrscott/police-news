Detectives have launched a murder investigation after a man died following an alleged assault in Bournemouth - with one man being arrested.

At 2.20am on Friday 19 June 2020 Dorset Police was called by the ambulance service to reports of a 46-year-old Bournemouth man having sustained stab wounds at an address in Eldon Place in the Westbourne area of the town.

He sadly died at the scene. His next of kin have been informed and the coroner has been notified.

A woman in her 40s and a teenage boy, both from Bournemouth, were taken to hospital with injuries, which are not believed to be life-threatening.

A 31-year-old man from Bournemouth has been arrested on suspicion of murder, but was taken to hospital as he had also sustained injuries, which are not life-threatening.

A full investigation is now underway.

Detective Inspector Andy Bell, of Dorset Police, said: "We are carrying out a thorough investigation to establish the full circumstances of what happened.

"I would like to hear from anyone who may have any information to assist my investigation."

A cordon has been put in place while crime scene investigators examine the scene.
