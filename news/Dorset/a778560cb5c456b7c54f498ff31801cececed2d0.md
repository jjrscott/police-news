# Witness appeal following fatal collision in Swanage

02 April 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following a fatal collision in Swanage.

At approximately 8.40am today, Monday 2 April 2018, a collision occurred between a beige Vauxhall Zafira and a pedestrian on the beachfront off Institute Road.

Very sadly, the pedestrian - a 70-year-old man from Swanage - was pronounced dead at the scene. His next of kin has been informed and is being treated by specially trained officers. The coroner has been notified.

The driver of the Zafira, a local woman aged in her 60s, sustained minor injuries and was taken to hospital as a precaution.

The road is closed to allow collision investigators to carry out a full and thorough examination of the scene.

Police Sergeant Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision, or has any dashcam footage that can assist my investigation, to please come forward.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who saw the manner of driving of the vehicle prior to the collision.

"Also, I would like to thank the public for their patience while the closure was in place to allow emergency services to deal with the collision."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at scit@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 2:73. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
