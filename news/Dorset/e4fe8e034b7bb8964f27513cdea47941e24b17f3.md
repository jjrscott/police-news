Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an alleged fail-stop collision in Weymouth.

At around 12.30pm on Monday 27 March 2017 it is reported a dark-coloured vehicle mounted the pavement in Abbotsbury Road and struck a pedestrian. It is alleged the driver failed to stop at the scene.

The pedestrian - a 23-year-old man from Dorchester - sustained minor injuries to his leg and was taken to the local minor injuries unit for treatment.

A 23-year-old man from Weymouth was arrested on suspicion of driving offences and has been released on police bail pending further enquiries until early May 2017.

Detective Constable Sean Garrett, of Weymouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the Abbotsbury Road area at the time and either saw the incident or the manner of driving of the car immediately prior to the collision to please contact Dorset Police. "
