Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a woman was assaulted in Bournemouth.

At around 7am on Friday 10 March 2017 a woman was walking her two dogs along Littlemoor Avenue at the junction of Maidment Close when she was approached from behind by an unknown man.

The offender placed his arms across the victim's chest and grabbed her clothing. He threatened her before running away from the scene.

The victim - a local woman aged in her 20s - was not physically injured.

The offender was described as wearing Nike AirMax trainers and spoke with a northern accent.

Detective Constable Jo Regan, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the area of Littlemoor Avenue or Maidment Close at the relevant time and either witnesses the incident or saw a man running away from the scene to please contact Dorset Police."
