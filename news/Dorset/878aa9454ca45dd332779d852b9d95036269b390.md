Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a serious collision near Bridport.

At 8.23am today, Sunday 17 December 2017, a three vehicle collision occurred on the A35 at Morcombelake involving a silver Citroen C3, a silver BMW 320 convertible and a silver Vauxhall Astra.

The driver of the Citroen, a 77-year-old woman from Bridport, sustained life-threatening injuries and was taken to Derriford hospital by air ambulance. Her passenger, an 81-year-old Bridport man, also sustained life-threatening injuries and was taken to Exeter hospital.

A 27-year-old man from Weymouth, who was the driver of the BMW, sustained minor injuries and was taken to Dorset County Hospital.

The driver of the Vauxhall, a man aged in his 60s and from Hampshire, was uninjured.

The road was closed to allow collision investigators to carry out a full and thorough examination of the scene.

Police Sergeant Fern Graham, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or the manner of driving of either of the three vehicles prior to the incident to please get in touch.

"I would ask that anybody who was in the area at the time to consider any dashcam footage they may have which could assist me in my investigation.

"Also, I would like to thank motorists for their patience while the road closure was in place to allow emergency services to deal with the collision."
