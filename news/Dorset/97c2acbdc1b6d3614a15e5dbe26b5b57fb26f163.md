# Witness appeal after assault in Bournemouth

27 April 2020

* * *

Officers investigating an assault that is believed to have caused a potentially life-threatening injury to a man in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

On Wednesday 26 February 2020 the victim - a 70-year-old man - drove into the car park of the Co-Op in Wimborne Road. He drove around a stationary pick-up truck as he thought they were waiting to park. As he passed, the driver of the truck got out and was verbally abusive. The victim also got out of his car, at which point the offender hit the victim in the face with his fist, causing him to fall and hit the back of his head on the ground.

The victim then drove home but did not report the assault to police at the time as he only initially suffered a headache and pain to his arm as a result of the incident.

On Friday 17 April 2020 the victim was admitted to hospital and underwent surgery for a bleed on the brain. His doctor described the injury as life-threatening and said that it would have been caused by a trauma to the head.

The victim's wife contacted Dorset Police on Monday 20 April 2020 to report the assault, which is believed to be the most likely cause of the victim's injury and subsequent surgery. The victim's surgery was successful and he is now home and recovering well.

The offender is described as around five feet eight inches tall, aged in his 20s to 30s and with ginger hair. He is described as wearing a vest and camouflage trousers and was driving a silver pick-up truck with a cover over the back.

Detective Constable Jordan Curtis, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am aware that this assault happened some time ago and we are continuing to make enquiries and assess CCTV footage.

"The unprovoked assault is believed to have led to a very serious medical incident for the victim and I would urge anyone who may have witnessed it to get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200055796. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
