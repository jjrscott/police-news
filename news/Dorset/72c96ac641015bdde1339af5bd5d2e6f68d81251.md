# Witness appeal following reported suspicious incident in Poole

05 August 2016

* * *

Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a suspicious incident in Poole Park.

Just after 3pm yesterday, Thursday 4 August 2016, Dorset Police received reports that a man was seen holding hands with a three-year-old girl in the park, close to the Ark. The man was not known to the child.

The child was not physically injured.

The man is described as aged in his 30s, with dark hair, of Asian descent and was wearing a green shirt. From reports he was possibly with another man and two women.

Deputy Neighbourhood Inspector Steve Houston, of Poole police, said: "I know there were a number of people in Poole Park and the Ark at the time of the incident. I would urge anyone who witnessed a suspicious incident and has yet to speak to officers to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would also appeal for the four people who were seen in the park at the relevant time to get in touch.

"Dorset Police takes reports such as this very seriously and a full investigation is underway to establish the facts of what occurred.

"Officers from the Neighbourhood Policing Team will be carrying out high-visibility patrols in the park today and this weekend to reassure the community."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 4:288. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
