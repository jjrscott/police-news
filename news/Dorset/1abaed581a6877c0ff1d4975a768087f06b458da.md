# Renewed appeal to locate wanted man from Bournemouth

08 January 2021

* * *

Officers are renewing their appeal for help from the public to locate a man wanted in connection with breaching the conditions of his licence.

Damien Stephen Cable, 35 and of Bournemouth, is wanted for prison recall after reportedly breaching the terms of his licence having been released on Monday 9 November 2020 after serving part of a two-and-a-half-year prison term for drug offences.

He is described as white, around five feet nine inches tall and of medium build with dark brown hair.

Inspector Greg Tansill, of Dorset Police, said: "Our efforts to locate Damien Cable are continuing and I would ask anyone who has seen a man matching the description given, or has information about his whereabouts, to please get in touch.

"We now believe that Damien Cable has returned to Bournemouth after previously travelling to Watford and is staying locally at various addresses.

"While we do not have any information to suggest Damien presents a risk to the public, anyone who sees him is urged not to approach him but instead dial 999 immediately."

If you see Damien Cable you should dial 999 immediately. Anyone with other information should call 101, quoting occurrence 55200176917 or Crimestoppers in confidence in 0800 555 111.
