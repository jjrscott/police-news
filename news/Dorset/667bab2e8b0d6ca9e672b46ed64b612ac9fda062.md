# Appeal for information following assault in Poole

25 November 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for anyone with information to come forward following a report of an assault in Poole.

Between 4.30pm and 4.40pm on Wednesday 11 November 2020 two teenage girls were walking their elderly Sharpei dog, which was on a lead, in Wallisdown Recreation Ground between Talbot Primary School and Wallisdown Road.

A black and white Cocker Spaniel came over to the Sharpei, which is nervous of other dogs and rested its weight on the Spaniel to control it.
The owner of the Spaniel began to shout abuse at the girls and kicked their dog, before punching one of the teenagers in the arm.

The woman is described as white, aged in her late 30s, approximately five feet five inches tall and of slim build with wavy blonde greying hair that went down to her collar. She was described as wearing a long green coat with a fluffy hood and black office-style shoes.

Police Constable Mal Dye, of Dorset Police, said: "This incident was very distressing for the two girls and I am keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed what happened.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who recognises the woman from the description given or may have any information to assist my enquiries.

"The owner of the Spaniel was accompanied by a woman with a Shih-Tzu dog and I am appealing directly to the two women to please get in contact so I can get your account."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200170320. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
