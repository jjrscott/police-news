The cyclist who died in a fatal collision in Bournemouth has been named by his family as Gordon Randall.

At around 3.45pm on Saturday 18 February 2017 it was reported that a collision occurred between a bicycle - being ridden by Mr Randall - and a white Mitsubishi L200 that was parked in the Cranmer Road car park in Winton.

Mr Randall - aged 79 - suffered a serious head injury and was taken to Southampton General Hospital by air ambulance. He sadly died from his injuries later that evening.

The family of Mr Randall have today, Wednesday 22 February 2017, issued the following statement: "We would like to thank everyone who came to Gordon's aid at the scene of the collision.

"We would request privacy at this extremely difficult time."
