A further 15 people have been charged with drink or drug driving offences as part of Dorset Police's summer drink and drug driving campaign.

They are due to appear at courts in Poole and Weymouth during July.

A total of 48 people have been charged as part of the campaign, which ran from Thursday 1 June 2017 to Friday 30 June 2017.

As with previous campaigns, anyone charged with a drink or drug driving-related offence during the campaign had their name and court appearance details released to the media.

The campaign also ran on social media using the hashtag #DontRiskIt.
