# Renewed appeal in relation to fatal road traffic collision in Weymouth

27 November 2020

* * *

Officers continuing to investigate a fatal road traffic collision in Weymouth are renewing their appeal for witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage to come forward.

Dorset Police was called at 9.41am on Monday 16 November 2020 to reports of a road traffic collision on Lynch Lane involving a pedestrian and a lorry.

The pedestrian sadly died at the scene.

At an inquest opened on Friday 27 November 2020, the victim was confirmed as 62-year-old Sarah Lewis from Weymouth. Her family is continuing to be supported by specially trained officers.

Sarah's family said they would like to thank the emergency services for their hard work in such difficult circumstances. They added that they would also like to express their deepest gratitude to those witnesses who risked their own safety to comfort Sarah until first responders arrived.

Police Constable Leanne Steedman, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts remain with the family and loved ones of Sarah Lewis at this difficult time.

"We are continuing to urge any witnesses to this collision, or anyone who was driving in the area and may have captured something relevant on dashcam, to please contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200172496.
