Police are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information following a street robbery in Poole.

The incident happened at around 1.30am on Saturday 29 October 2016 along Churchill Road.

The victim - a Bournemouth man aged in his 30s - was walking along the pavement pushing his bicycle when he was approached by two men and a woman.

One of the men punched the victim in the face causing him to fall to the ground. The other man then kicked him in the face.

The trio then made off with the victim's bike.

The bicycle is described as a black and grey GT Avalanche.

The victim was taken to Poole Hospital with a fractured cheek bone.

Detective Constable Amy Burbidge, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing for witnesses or anyone who has any information about what happened to come forward.

"I would also like to speak to anyone who has been offered a bike with a similar description for sale since the incident to contact police."
