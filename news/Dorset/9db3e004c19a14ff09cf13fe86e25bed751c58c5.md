Officers investigating the theft of an elderly man's bicycle in Bridport are pleased to say it has been reunited with its owner.

The bike, belonging to an 83-year-old local man, was left against railings in South Street near to Bridport Town Hall at 3pm on Wednesday 24 January 2018 but was not secured. The theft is believed to have occurred at 3.47pm.

It was located in the town following a public appeal.

Police Constable Brian Puttock, of Bridport police, said: "The victim and I are very grateful for the positive responses from the public in Bridport and assistance from businesses allowing me access to their CCTV systems.

"This allowed me to quickly locate the bicycle and reunite it with its delighted owner."

Following a CCTV appeal a 23-year-old woman from Bridport came forward and admitted to the theft. She received a caution.
