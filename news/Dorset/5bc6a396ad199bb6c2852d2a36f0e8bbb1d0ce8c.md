# Update - CCTV appeal following reported assault in Christchurch

09 October 2020

* * *

A man has come forward following a CCTV appeal in relation to a reported assault in Christchurch.

At around 4pm on Thursday 10 September 2020 the victim - a local man aged in his 40s - was in Nisa Local on Marlow Drive when a man got close to him. Due to the fact the man was not wearing a face covering, the victim asked if he could stay back.

It is reported that the man then got closer to victim and a verbal altercation occurred. As the victim left the shop, the man went out at the same time and allegedly spat in his face.

Following a CCTV appeal, a man aged in his 30s has come forward and is assisting officers with their enquiries. No arrests have been made.
