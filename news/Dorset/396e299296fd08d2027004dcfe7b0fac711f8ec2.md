# Witness appeal following fatal road traffic collision in North Dorset

19 June 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a fatal road traffic collision in North Dorset are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

At 6.45am on Friday 19 June 2020 Dorset Police received a report of a collision on the A354 at The Beeches near Sixpenny Handley. The collision involved a grey Toyota Yaris and a silver Mitsubishi pick-up.

Officers attended, along with the fire and ambulance services. Fire crews assisted with freeing the occupant of the Toyota, a woman aged in her 80s, from the vehicle and she was taken to Southampton General Hospital for treatment.

Very sadly, she subsequently died in hospital. Her family has been informed.

The driver of the Mitsubishi, a man aged in his 50s, suffered minor injuries.

Road closures were put in place to allow the emergency services to respond to the incident and for an investigation of the scene to take place.

Sergeant Sarah Jones, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are of course with the family of the woman involved at this difficult time. We will be carrying out a thorough investigation to establish the full circumstances of this collision.

"I would appeal to any witnesses who have not already spoken to us or anyone who may have captured the incident on dashcam to please contact us.

"Finally, I would like to thank members of the public for their patience and understanding while the road closures were in place."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 19:55. Alternatively, or alternatively to stay 100% anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
