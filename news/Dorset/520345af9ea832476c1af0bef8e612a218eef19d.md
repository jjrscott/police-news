# Theft and fraudulent card use in Bournemouth â€“ CCTV appeal

14 December 2020

* * *

Officers are issuing a CCTV image of a man they would like to speak to following the theft of a bag and subsequent fraudulent card use in Bournemouth.

At around 12.45pm on Tuesday 17 November 2020 a woman was putting her dog into her car that was parked on Boscombe Overcliff Drive when she was approached from behind by two men.

It is reported that the men grabbed her handbag from the passenger seat of the car and left the area. The bag contained keys, a phone and bank cards.

Her bank cards were subsequently used in a number of shops in the town between 1.09pm and 2.10pm that same day.

Police Community Support Investigator Chris Wilson, of Bournemouth police, said: "Following initial enquiries I have now obtained an image of a man I would like to speak to as part of my investigation.

"I am appealing to anyone who recognises him to please get in contact with Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200173242. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
