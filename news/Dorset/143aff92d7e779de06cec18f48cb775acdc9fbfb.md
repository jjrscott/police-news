Detectives are appealing for witnesses following a reported serious assault in Bournemouth.

Officers were called at 10.27pm on Monday 4 September 2017 to reports of an assault in an alleyway off Christchurch Road near to Corpus Christi Church in Bournemouth.

A woman - aged in her 20s - was found with serious head injuries and was taken to hospital for treatment.

It is believed that they were both known to each other.

An investigation into the incident is ongoing.

Detective Constable Chris Waters, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident, or who has any information that can assist with my investigation, to come forward."
