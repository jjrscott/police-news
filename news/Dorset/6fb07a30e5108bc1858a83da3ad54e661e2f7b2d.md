# Update - witness appeal following reported suspicious incidents in Bournemouth

29 June 2018

* * *

A man arrested in connection with reported suspicious incidents in Bournemouth has been released from under investigation.

At 4.59pm on Tuesday 6 March 2018 Dorset Police received information which reported possible voyeurism offences taking place in the public toilets in St Catherine's Road in the Southbourne area.

A 69-year-old man from Glastonbury was arrested on suspicion of voyeurism and released under investigation.

Following a thorough and detailed investigation into the reported incidents, detectives have now released the man from under investigation and no further police action will be taken.

The toilets will continue to be checked by council officers and as part of regular police officer patrols to ensure no offences are being committed.
