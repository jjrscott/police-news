# Rural crime targeted in cross border operation

21 June 2016

* * *

A cross border operation to tackle criminals targeting rural communities took place on Wednesday 15 June 2016.

Dorset Police led officers from Hampshire, Wiltshire and Dorset to detect and prevent those who use the road networks around the county borders to commit rural-related crimes.

Overt and covert patrols were undertaken in hotspot areas to target vehicles and people suspected to be involved in cross border crimes such as poaching, non-dwelling burglary and theft from motor vehicles in isolated areas.

The multi-force border operation provided an enhanced presence, which utilised specialist resources, including roads policing teams, Dorset Police's 'No Excuse' team, neighbourhood policing teams and road fuel testing units.

A total of 49 vehicles were stopped and six arrests were made for: drink driving, possession of illegal drugs, failing to stop at an accident and for an outstanding court warrant.

Three vehicles had illicit diesel fuel in their tanks, 12 fixed penalty notices were issued for a variety of road traffic related matters and six vehicles were seized by police. Intelligence was also gained as a result of the operation.

The collaborative approach in tackling acquisitive and rural crime forms part of Dorset Police's ongoing rural crime strategy. Each force works in partnership with their respective rural business communities to ensure a joined-up approach to combating rural crime.

Inspector Wayne Nock, of Dorset Police who led the operation, said: "These operations are a recognised tactic in the fight against rural crime. This is the seventh tri-force operation that we have participated in and it will be repeated at intervals throughout the year to deny cross border criminals the use of the roads.

"This joined up approach sends a strong message to those who choose to use the road networks to commit crime. Travelling across police force boundaries will not stop criminals from being dealt with positively and robustly."
