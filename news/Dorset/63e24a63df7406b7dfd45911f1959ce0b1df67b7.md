Detectives investigating an aggravated burglary in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

On Sunday 15 October 2017, between 11pm and midnight, an unknown man attended an address asking for a specific person in Talbot Road in the Winton area of town.

While inside the property, the offender assaulted a 19-year-old local man with a baseball bat before attempting to tie him up with cable ties. He stole a number of items from the property including a laptop, phone and watches.

The victim sustained a head injury which is not believed to be serious, but he was taken to hospital as a precaution.

The offender is described as white, aged in his late 20s with light-coloured short hair and facial stubble. He was wearing a green and white windbreaker jacket and carrying a small dark-coloured shoulder bag.

Officers attended and a search of the area was carried out but the offender was not located.

Detective Constable Garry Weston, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We have already made a number of enquiries and are continuing to investigate this incident and why this victim was targeted.

"I am appealing for any witnesses, or anyone who saw any suspicious activity in the area around the time of the burglary, to please contact police."
