# Witness appeal following criminal damage in Dorchester

28 December 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following criminal damage to a home in Dorchester.

The occupants of the property in Holloway Road were asleep at around 11.10pm on Wednesday 19 December 2018 when they heard the sound of smashing glass downstairs.

They went down and discovered their front lounge window had been smashed and a large rock was on the ground directly outside the window.

A witness described seeing three men in their mid to late teens in the street at the time, who were wearing black hooded tops and dark clothing. They were seen to run off down Holloway Road in the direction of High East Street.

Police Constable Simon Rogers, of Dorchester police, said: "As well as being distressing for the victims, the damage caused will cost a significant amount to repair and we are carrying out a number of enquiries to identify the offenders.

"I am appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident or who saw any suspicious activity in the area of Holloway Road around the time of the offence to contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180203446. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
