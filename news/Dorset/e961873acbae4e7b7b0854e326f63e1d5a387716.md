Officers in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following a report of indecent exposure at Lodmoor Nature Reserve.

The incident happened at around 5.45pm on Thursday 2 August 2018.

The victim - a woman aged in her 50s - was walking her dog through the nature reserve near to the footpath with Southdown Avenue. She walked past a man who called out to attract her attention. The man then indecently exposed himself to her.

Police Constable Toby Norman, of Weymouth police, said: "This was an incredibly distressing incident for the victim who has been left shaken by what occurred.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident, saw anyone acting suspiciously in the area at the time of the occurrence or knows a man matching the description provided to please contact Dorset Police.

"I wish to reassure the public that we are determined to identify the offender and local officers will continue to patrol the area and can be approached with any concerns."
