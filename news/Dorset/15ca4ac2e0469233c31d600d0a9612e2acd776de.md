# Detectives charge man following alleged robbery on two taxi drivers in Bournemouth

12 December 2018

* * *

A man has been charged in relation to two alleged robberies on taxi drivers in Bournemouth.

The first incident is alleged to have occurred just before 1am on Sunday 9 December 2018. It was reported that a taxi driver - a local man aged in his 40s - picked up a man in Meyrick Road and drove him to St Clement's Road near to the church. Upon arrival, it was alleged that he was threatened with a knife and was told to hand over money. The suspect reportedly made off with a quantity of cash. The taxi driver did not sustain any physical injuries.

The second incident is reported to have happened at around 3.30am the same day. It is alleged that a second taxi driver - a man aged in his 50s - was approached by two men on Southcote Road who asked him if he could take them to Southbourne.

The men then reportedly threatened the taxi driver at knifepoint and demanded he hand over money.

The taxi driver managed to escape the taxi and run off. He then reportedly saw one of the men get into the driver seat and drive off. A short time later the fire service was called to Aylesbury Road, where the taxi was located on fire and was extinguished. The taxi driver was not physically injured.

A 28-year-old man from Wimborne was charged with two counts of robbery, two counts of threatening a person with an offensive weapon in a public place and aggravated vehicle taking. He is due to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court today, Wednesday 12 December 2018.
