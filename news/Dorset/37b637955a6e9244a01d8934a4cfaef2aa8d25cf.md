Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a serious collision in Shaftesbury.

At 1.26pm today, Tuesday 12 December 2017, a two vehicle collision occurred on Salisbury Road near to the junction with Greenacre Way involving a black Hyundai i40 and a black Peugeot 307.

The driver of the Hyundai, a 64-year-old man from Singapore, sustained life-threatening injuries and his passenger, a 95-year-old man from Salisbury, sustained serious injuries. Both were taken to Southampton hospital for treatment by air ambulance.

A 68-year-old Shaftesbury woman, who was the driver of the Peugeot, sustained serious injuries and was taken to Salisbury hospital.

The road was closed to allow collision investigators to carry out a full and thorough examination of the scene.

Police Sergeant Mark Scammel, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or the manner of driving of either vehicle immediately before the incident to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would ask anybody who was in the area at the time to consider any dashcam or CCTV footage they may have which could assist us in our investigation."
