Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a car involved in a reported collision with a pedestrian in East Dorset failed to stop at the scene.

At 1.09am today, Sunday 19 August 2018, Dorset Police was called to reports that a woman had been hit by a car as she crossed Ringwood Road, St Leonards.

The injured woman - aged in her 30s and from Ringwood - sustained serious but not life-threatening injuries and was taken to Poole Hospital for treatment.

The car reported to have been involved in the collision was described as a dark-coloured Volkswagen Golf and failed to stop at the scene.

A VW Golf was discovered a short distance from the scene and has been seized. Enquiries are underway to locate the driver of the vehicle.

A 23-year-old man from Blandford was arrested in Hampshire on suspicion of assisting an offender and is helping officers with enquiries.

Police Sergeant Mark Scammell, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the Ringwood Road area at the time of the collision and either witnessed the incident or saw a VW Golf immediately prior or after the collision to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am also keen to hear from any motorists who were travelling in the area at the time and may have relevant dashcam."
