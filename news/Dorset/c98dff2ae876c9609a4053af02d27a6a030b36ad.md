# Patrols stepped up to tackle anti-social behaviour hotspots in West Dorset

16 July 2020

* * *

The neighbourhood inspector for West Dorset is asking parents 'do you know where your children are?' as patrols are stepped up to tackle anti-social behaviour hotspots.

Following a number of reports from residents in relation to anti-social behaviour in areas including Langmoor Gardens in Lyme Regis and Pageant Gardens in Sherborne, proactive patrols are being carried out and section 35 dispersal powers are being utilised.

These powers mean police can order people to leave the area if their presence is likely to contribute towards anti-social Behaviour and they are liable to be arrested if they return within a designated period.

Dorset Police is also working with local councils to ensure a detailed plan is in place to respond to these repeated reports of anti-social behaviour.

Inspector Darren Stanton said: "Much of the anti-social behaviour reported involves individuals, mainly but not always young people, getting together and listening to music. While this may seem harmless behaviour on the face of it, when the music is at a loud volume and being played into the early hours of the morning it can cause considerable distress to people living nearby.

"We have even had reports of people having to go and stay somewhere else just to get a good night's sleep and this is clearly unacceptable.

"We are asking people in these areas to think about their behaviour and be considerate of the impact it has on others.

"There are also the clear public health implications of people getting together in larger groups, the COVID-19 pandemic has not gone away and the Government guidance is clear in relation to large gatherings.

"As we enter the summer holidays and young people spend more time outdoors and away from home, we want parents to ensure they know where their children are and that they are acting in a safe and responsible manner."

Anyone with information about anti-social behaviour in their area is asked to report it to Dorset Police when it's happening at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101.
