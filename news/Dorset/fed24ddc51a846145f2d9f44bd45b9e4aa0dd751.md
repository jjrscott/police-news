A man arrested in connection with an incident where shots were reportedly fired in Weymouth has been released under investigation.

Dorset Police received a report at 5.53pm on Tuesday 22 May 2018 of shots being fired - possibly from an air weapon - in Marsh Road near to the Asda supermarket in Weymouth. There were also reports of a number of men seen running from the scene.
