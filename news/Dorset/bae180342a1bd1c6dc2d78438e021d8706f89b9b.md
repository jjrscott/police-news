# Witness appeal after suspicious fire in Weymouth

03 October 2018

* * *

Detectives have launched an investigation into a fire at a car garage in Weymouth and are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police was called at 5am on Sunday 30 September 2018 by the fire service reporting a large fire at the premises on Holly Road.

Residents in nearby properties were evacuated while the blaze was tackled and due to acetylene cylinders at the location. There were no reported injuries.

Detective Sergeant Tom Hall, of Weymouth CID, said: "Following a number of enquiries and in close consultation with Dorset and Wiltshire Fire Service, we are now treating this fire as a suspected arson.

"The fire caused immense disruption to many local residents and it is extremely fortunate that no one was injured. Credit must go to the local community who rallied round and ensured those evacuated had somewhere to stay while the incident was dealt with.

"I am appealing to anyone who has any information about the fire or witnessed anything suspicious in the early hours of Sunday morning to please contact Dorset Police or call Crimestoppers anonymously."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting 55180158308. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
