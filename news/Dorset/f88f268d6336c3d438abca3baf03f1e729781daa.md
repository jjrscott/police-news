# Family tribute following fatal collision on the A30 near Sherborne

19 March 2018

* * *

The family of a young woman who sadly died following a collision on the A30 near Sherborne is paying tribute to her.

Dorset Police was called at 7.54pm on Tuesday 6 March 2018 to reports of a road traffic collision on the dual carriageway section of the A30 Yeovil Road at Babylon Hill involving a blue Honda Civic.

The driver of the Honda - 23-year-old Francesca Lee from the Sherborne area - sustained very serious injuries and had to be cut free from her vehicle by firefighters. She very sadly died at the scene. No one else was injured.

Her family has issued the following tribute: "Devoted mummy to her beautiful baby 17-month-old Alfie, he was her whole world and he meant everything to her.

"Francesca was brought up in Upton Somerset, from the age of seven by grandparents after losing her mother. She was a happy bright child who loved school, she enjoyed living in the country and had a love of animals and nature. She attended Kingsmead School in Wiveliscombe and Richard Huish College in Taunton, before going to University of Portsmouth.

"Francesca was a kind and loving girl who always tried to do her best to put people at ease, she had the most amazing laugh, a wicked sense of humour and Christmas was always her favourite time of year. Her favourite colour was pink. She had an amazing singing voice and as a teenager sang with the East Devon Choral Society and could reduce you to tears when she sang, her grandparents will miss hearing her sing.

"She has touched so many people's hearts over the years, people who have watched her grow from a small child living with her grandparents to becoming the beautiful and mature young women she was. Francesca has a sister Hannah and a brother Adam, who along with her grandparents Elizabeth and Terry, are heartbroken and utterly devastated. She will be so sorely missed by her family, friends and the many people who have known and loved her."
