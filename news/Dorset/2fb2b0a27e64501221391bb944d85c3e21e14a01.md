* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an attempted robbery in Poole.

At 8.10pm on Tuesday 27 February 2018 a man aged in his 20s was cycling along the Dorset Way toward the roundabout at Tower Park.

As he cycled through the underpass that goes under the Dorset Way into Oakdale he was approached by a man and punched to the side of the face causing him to fall to the floor. The man attempted to steal the victim's mountain bike.

The offender was accompanied by two women and another man. He has been described as having an olive skin complexion and aged between 17 and 20 years old. He was wearing a grey tracksuit top with grey tracksuit bottoms and black and grey Nike Air Max 95 trainers. The two women have been described as wearing white Parka-style coats.

Detective Constable Garry Weston, of Bournemouth CID, said: "During the altercation the victim and offender went on to the main carriageway of the Dorset Way.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident, or may have dashcam footage of the incident from the Wessex Way that could assist my investigation, to please get in touch.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who recognises the offender from the description given."
