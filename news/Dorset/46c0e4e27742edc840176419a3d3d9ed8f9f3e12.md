# Witness appeal following attempted robbery in Dorchester

31 October 2016

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an attempted robbery in Dorchester.

Sometime between 4.30pm and 4.50pm on Saturday 29 October 2016, a 17-year-old girl was walking in an alleyway between Cromwell Road and Alfred Road when she was approached from behind by an unknown man.

The offender attempted to grab the bum bag which the victim was wearing around her waist. The victim lost her balance and the man stood on her ankle forcing her to fall to the ground. The offender made a second attempt to grab the bag.

It is believed a passing member of the public may have disturbed the offender and he ran away from the scene. Nothing was stolen.

The victim, from Weymouth, sustained an injury to her ankle but did not require medical treatment.

The offender is described as white, aged in his 50s and with grey hair. He was wearing a hat and a long coat.

Detective Constable Sean Garrett, of Weymouth CID, said: "We believe that the offender was disturbed by a passing member of the public and I would appeal to that person to please come forward and help me with this investigation.

"I would also like to hear from anyone else who saw or heard anything suspicious in the area at the relevant time."
