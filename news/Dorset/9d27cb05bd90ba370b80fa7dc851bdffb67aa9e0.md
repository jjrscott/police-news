# Public appeal and warning following further burglary at vet practice in Weymouth

08 August 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for the public's help after dangerous drugs were stolen from a vet practice in Weymouth - almost three weeks after an identical break-in.

At 2.24am today, Thursday 8 August 2019, Dorset Police was called to reports of a suspicious man in the garden of an address in Dorchester Road.

Officers attended and discovered that access had been gained to Moorcroft Veterinary Practice.

A cabinet that securely housed the practice's dangerous drugs was forced open and a quantity of ketamine was stolen. Cash was also taken from the till.

An identical offence occurred at the practice on the morning of Friday 19 July 2019. On that occasion the entire contents of the dangerous drugs cabinet was stolen, including ketamine and euthanasia drugs.

Police Constable Tom Arnold, of Weymouth police, said: "A full investigation is underway to establish who is responsible for both this latest break-in and the previous offence. I would urge anyone who was in the Dorchester Road area in the early hours of this morning and witnessed anything suspicious to please contact Dorset Police.

"The drugs stolen are only normally administered under clinical supervision and as stated following the previous burglary we are sending out an urgent warning to the public about these drugs now being in public circulation.

"Anyone taking them is putting their health at serious at risk. Taken in excess these drugs could lead to serious injury or death. It is therefore imperative that we locate these drugs to ensure no one comes to harm.

"Anyone who thinks they've taken any of these drugs should go straight to A&E and take the packaging with them. You don't know how you will react to a particular drug or medicine. Everyone is different and drugs can affect people in different ways.

"I would like to get a message out to anyone involved in the misuse of drugs in the Dorset area to be aware that use of such substances can prove fatal to the user."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190123251. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
