# Update - appeal following alleged serious assault in Bournemouth

13 December 2017

* * *

Officers investigating an alleged serious assault outside a nightclub in Bournemouth have released a man under investigation.

Dorset Police received a report at 2.19am on Tuesday 12 December 2017 of a serious assault outside Halo nightclub on Exeter Road between staff members and two men.

It was reported that a short time before the assault took place, one man had an altercation with staff members of the nightclub before leaving the area.

He then allegedly returned to the nightclub in a black Vauxhall Corsa and drove directly at staff members.

One staff member suffered injuries during the incident, which are not believed to be life-threatening or life-changing.

It was reported the driver attempted to make off from the scene, but was stopped nearby by other members of staff. During this altercation, one of the staff members suffered an injury to his shoulder and required hospital treatment.

A 19-year-old man from Blandford was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and a driving offence and has been released under investigation. He suffered a minor injury during the incident.

A 21-year-old man from Poole, who was arrested on suspicion of assault, has been released without charge. He was not connected to the incident.

Detective Constable Amy Burbidge, of Bournemouth CID, said: "Following our enquiries we now have a clearer picture of what is alleged to have taken place.

"I am still appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident and has not yet spoken to Dorset Police to please contact me urgently."
