# Witness appeal following robbery and assault in Poole

06 May 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating a robbery and assault in Poole are asking witnesses and anyone with information to come forward.

The incident happened at around 5.30am on Saturday 6 May 2017 along Haven Road.

The victim, a 21-year-old woman from Lymington in Hampshire, and her friend had met two men during the evening.

After they had already parted in Haven Road, the suspect returned with his car to the two women and it was reported that he then assaulted one of them and stole her rose-gold-coloured iPhone. The victim and her friend sustained cuts and bruising.

Officers attended, searched the area and stopped a vehicle. A 24-year-old Poole man was arrested on suspicion of robbery, assault and driving offences. He is helping officers with their enquiries.

Detective Sergeant Andy Haworth, of Poole and Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing for witnesses and anyone with information about the incident to come forward.

"In particular, I am keen to speak with the driver of a van that the two women tried to flag down as he may have vital information.

"The iPhone has not been recovered yet but may be in the Glen Fern Road area. I would ask anyone who finds it to please contact us as soon as possible."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 6:65. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
