Officers investigating a serious injury collision on Portland are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

At 6.46am on Wednesday 11 March 2020 Dorset Police received a report of a collision on the A354 Portland Beach Road near to the Ferry Bridge involving a blue Toyota Supra.

The driver of the Toyota - a Weymouth man aged in his 30s - was taken to hospital for treatment. His injuries are described as serious.

The road was closed to allow the emergency services to deal with the incident and for an examination of the scene to be carried out. It reopened at around 7.40am.

"I would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the collision and has not already spoken to police.

"I am also keen to hear from any motorists who were in the area at the time and may have relevant dashcam footage to assist my investigation."
