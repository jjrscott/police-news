30 May 2017

* * *

Dorset Police is investigating the death of a woman in Bournemouth.

Police were called to a house along Northey Road in Bournemouth at 10.18pm on Friday 26 May 2017 following reports that a woman was found unresponsive in a garden pond.

Officers and paramedics attended, but sadly the 56-year-old woman was pronounced dead at the scene. Her next of kin have been informed and the coroner notified.

An investigation into the exact circumstances of the death is underway.

A post-mortem examination took place on Sunday 28 May 2017. The preliminary result of which was that the woman died as a result of drowning.

Detective Inspector Richard Dixey, of Dorset Police, said: "We are still trying to find out exactly what happened on Friday evening and are making a number of enquiries and working closely with the coroner.

"At this stage, it is unclear how the woman drowned and therefore we have to treat the incident as suspicious. However, we hope that our investigation will soon establish whether this is or is not the case."

A 68-year-old man was arrested on Friday evening in relation to this incident, but was released under investigation the following day.
