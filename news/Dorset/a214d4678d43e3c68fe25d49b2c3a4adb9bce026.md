Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following an alleged assault on Portland.

It is reported that at around 6.10pm on Saturday 6 March 2021 an altercation occurred involving two men and two women on Verne Common Road.

One of the men was allegedly punched and he sustained an injury to his mouth. It is also reported that one of the women was hit in her side.

Following enquiries, a 32-year-old woman and a 44-year-old man - both from the local area - were arrested on suspicion of assault. They have both been released on police bail while enquiries continue.

Police Constable Matthew Campbell, of Weymouth and Portland police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the area and witnessed what happened to please get in touch.

"I would also like to hear from any residents who may have captured anything on home CCTV systems or motorists who were driving in the area and may have dashcam footage to assist my investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210036929. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
