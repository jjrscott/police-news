# Update â€“ Man due in court in connection with incident in Bournemouth

01 March 2018

* * *

A man is due to appear in court charged in connection with an incident in Bournemouth.

At 7.22am on Saturday 3 February 2018 Dorset Police was called to reports that a woman was being held hostage at an address in Parley Road by a man allegedly armed with a gun.

Specialist firearm officers attended and established the woman was no longer inside the address. She was uninjured.

The man remained in the address and a cordon was put in place to allow officers to deal with the situation and to make enquiries while keeping the public safe.

Later that day, at 1.06pm, a 42-year-old man was arrested and subsequently released under investigation while enquiries continued. A loaded crossbow and two weapons, believed to be imitation firearms, were seized by officers.

At 11.39pm last night, Wednesday 28 February 2018, a 42-year-old man from Watford in Hertfordshire was charged with false imprisonment, arson, possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence, possession of a class A drug and two counts of criminal damage to property. He is due to appear before Poole Magistrates' Court today, Thursday 1 March 2018.
