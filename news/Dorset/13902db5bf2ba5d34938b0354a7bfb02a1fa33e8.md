Officers are appealing for witnesses to a road traffic collision near Dorchester to come forward.

At around 5.20pm on Saturday 9 September 2017 a blue Yamaha motorcycle and a black Yamaha motorcycle were involved in a collision on westbound carriageway of the A35 Puddletown bypass.

The ambulance service attended and the riders of the motorcycles - a 53-year-old man and a 28-year-old woman both from Weymouth - were taken to hospital as a precaution and later released.
