Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following a fail-to-stop collision in Poole.

A male cyclist aged in his 70s was riding over the Twin Sails Bridge toward Hamworthy shortly before 10am on Thursday 31 December 2020 when he was involved in a collision with a vehicle.

The cyclist came off his bike and lost consciousness. He was taken to hospital for treatment, having also sustained a cut to his head and pain to his leg and body but fortunately did not suffer any serious injuries.

Police Constable Jade Harper, of Poole police, said: "We are carrying out enquiries into this collision and are keen to identify the vehicle and driver involved.

"I would also like to speak to a member of the public who came to the aid of the cyclist and contacted the ambulance service as well as anyone else who may have witnessed this incident or captured it on dashcam."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210000566. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
