Detectives investigating a fire that was believed to have been started deliberately in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At around 1am on Monday 18 May 2020 Dorset Police was called by the fire service to a report of a fire in a wheelie bin outside an address on Franklin Road.

It was also reported that damage was caused to the front door of the property.

Detective Constable Siobhan Lovering, of Weymouth CID, said: "Thankfully the fire did not spread into the property and no one was injured during the incident.

"Officers have been carrying out a number of enquiries in the area, including house-to-house visits.

"I am keen to hear from anyone who may have seen someone acting suspiciously in the area around the time of the incident.

"If you have any information to assist my investigation, please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200069875. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
