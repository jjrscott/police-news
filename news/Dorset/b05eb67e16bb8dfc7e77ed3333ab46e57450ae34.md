# Appeal for witnesses following assault in Bournemouth

06 November 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an assault in Bournemouth that left a man with a fractured jaw.

Sometime between midnight and 1am on Saturday 3 November 2018 an assault occurred in the Spring Road area of the town.

The victim, a man aged in his 40s and from Christchurch, was walking along Spring Road when two men on the opposite side of the road said something to him.

Due to being partially deaf in one ear, the victim asked what they had said. The next thing he remembers is waking up on the ground bleeding.

He walked to his brother's home nearby and went to hospital. He has since had to undergo surgery for a fractured jaw.

Detective Constable Honor McAdam, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This assault left the victim with a nasty facial injury that has required surgery and ongoing treatment.

"We have already carried out a number of enquiries in relation to this incident such as searches of available CCTV and house-to-house visits and these remain ongoing.

"I am appealing to anyone who recalls seeing an altercation between a group of men in the Spring Road area at the relevant time to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180177810. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
