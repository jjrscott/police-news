# Dorset Police and partners host a road safety day at Poole High School

19 October 2017

* * *

Dorset Police and partners have delivered a full day of interactive road safety presentations at Poole High School, highlighting risks on the road, right through to what happens in the event of a collision.

Jill Buller, Assistant Head of 6th Form at Poole High School, said: “The students received a hard hitting presentation from the Fire and Rescue Service and a ‘Dying to Drive’ presentation from Dorset Police, concentrating on behavioural change and highlighting coping strategies when in the car.”

Students were also involved in a number of activities to allow them to experience first-hand the consequences of distractions and the use of substances while driving. A go-kart and ‘beer goggles’ were also on hand to illustrate a serious message about how drink and drugs can impair your vision.

Dorset Police worked with Dorset & Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service, Kwik Fit, Travis Perkins and 3D Driving Awareness, to deliver the day of road safety education on Wednesday 18 October 2017.

Travis Perkins delivered a highly impactful talk on the difficulty of blind spots and allowed students to complete ‘the line test’ to see how alcohol and drugs impact on an individual’s balance and stability.

They also found out what is involved in an MOT and heard from KwikFit who spoke to them about tyre safety. A number of students were also ‘clocked’ in a running race by a mobile speed camera, with Dwain Zapatos being crowned the fastest student who was travelling at 19mph!

At the end of the day, students took part in a quiz to see what they had learnt, with Alfie Smith scoring 24 out of 25, winning both a bike and matching helmet. Six other students were presented with a helmet as part of a raffle draw.

Laressa Robinson, Education Operations Manager for Dorset Police, said: “Feedback from the day was hugely positive – both students and staff were fully engaged and it was clear that the message had truly struck a chord with the 17 and 18 year olds. We are hopeful they will all move forward as safer road users, thinking clearly about their responsibilities.”
