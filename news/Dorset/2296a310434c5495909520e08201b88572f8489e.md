# Appeal after cyclist injured on beach in Christchurch

02 July 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for the public's help after a cyclist sustained serious injuries when she rode into a rope that had been tied across a promenade in Christchurch.

The incident happened when the victim - 63-year-old Janet Binning from Christchurch - was cycling along the path by the beach huts at Friars Cliff with her partner at around 10.15pm on Wednesday 26 June 2019.

Even though Janet had two sets of front lights on her bike, she did not see the rope and cycled straight into it at throat height. Janet was thrown off her bike and landed on her right shoulder about 10 feet away.

The rope, which is attached to a pulley and is used to lift the front hatch of a beach hut, had been tied across the pathway to railings opposite.

Janet's partner called for an ambulance and she was taken to hospital. She sustained a broken collar bone and a burn to her throat, which was caused by the rope.

Janet said: "Someone probably did it for a prank or a joke and had no idea of the dangerous consequences. I really want people to be aware how much harm these silly pranks can cause people. I am in a significant amount of pain and have been left fairly incapacitated for a while because of this."

Police Constable James Prowse, of Christchurch police, said: "This was a mindless and very dangerous act that has left the victim with serious injuries.

"The person or people behind this may have believed it was just a silly prank and I would urge them to contact us so we can establish what happened.

"I would also ask anyone who has any information about this incident to please come forward."
