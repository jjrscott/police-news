Officers investigating a serious injury collision in North Dorset are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

Dorset Police received a report at 5.49pm on Thursday 8 October 2020 of a collision involving a black Nissan Micra and a black Yamaha motorcycle on Landshire Lane near to the Gibbs Marsh Trading Estate in Stalbridge.

The rider of the motorcycle - a man aged in his 20s from Somerset - sustained life-threatening injuries and was taken to Southampton General Hospital by air ambulance. He remains in hospital in a critical condition and his family has been informed.

The driver of the Nissan was uninjured.

The road was closed to allow emergency services to deal with the incident. It reopened at around 1am on Friday 9 October 2020.

Police Sergeant Sarah Jones, of the traffic unit, said: "An investigation is underway to establish the full circumstances of this collision.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident and has not already spoken to police to please get in touch.

"I would also ask any motorists who have dashcam fitted to their vehicles and were travelling in the area the time of the collision, or just before, to please check their cameras for any relevant footage."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 8:314.
