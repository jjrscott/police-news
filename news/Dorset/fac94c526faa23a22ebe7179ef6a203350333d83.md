# Witness appeal following suspicious incident in Bournemouth

12 June 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating a suspicious incident in Winton are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

An 11-year-old girl was walking near to the junction of Luther Road and Cranmer Road between 8am and 8.15am today, Tuesday 12 June 2018, when an unknown man grabbed her wrist.

He did not say anything and the girl pushed the man away before running off to school, where she alerted teachers who then contacted police.

The girl was not injured.

The man is described as white and clean shaven.

Detective Sergeant Ian Allen, of Bournemouth CID, said: "While the man's intentions are not clear at this stage, this was obviously a concerning incident for the girl involved and we are making a number of enquiries including investigating CCTV opportunities in the area.

"I am also appealing for any witnesses and for anyone who may have been travelling in the area around the relevant time and has dashcam fitted to their vehicles to check their footage and contact us if they see anything suspicious.

"Officers will be increasing patrols in the area and can be approached with any concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180089943. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
