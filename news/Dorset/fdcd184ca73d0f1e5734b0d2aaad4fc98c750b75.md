Officers investigating an alleged burglary in Weymouth have made a third arrest.

It was reported that between 1am and 6am on Thursday 16 August 2018 a burglary occurred at a property in Brownlow Street while the occupants were asleep upstairs.

Entry was reportedly gained through an insecure ground floor window and an Acer laptop and keys were taken.

A 30-year-old woman and 35-year-old man, both from Weymouth, were previously arrested on suspicion of burglary and were released under investigation.

A 40-year-old local man has also now been arrested on suspicion of burglary and has been released under investigation.
