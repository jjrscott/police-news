# Appeal following distraction burglaries in Blandford

10 July 2017

* * *

A warning is being issued to residents following two reports of distraction burglaries in Blandford.

Any witnesses or anyone with information relating to the incidents are also being encouraged to come forward.

A woman aged in her 80s reported that a man had come to her address off St Leonard's Avenue at around 10.30am today, Monday 10 July 2017, stating that he was there to deliver some fencing to a neighbour and he needed to look in the woman's garden.

The woman accompanied him to her garden for around ten minutes, leaving her front door open.

She later found a wooden jewellery box, containing a number of items of jewellery, had been taken as well as Â£35 cash from her purse.

The woman did not see anyone go into the house but believes they must have entered while she was in the garden.

The man she met was described as white, aged in his early 20s, around five feet six inches tall, of slim build and with sandy-coloured hair. He was wearing a T-shirt and jeans.

Another woman aged in her 80s reported that a man had come to her address in Milldown Road at around 11.45am and gave a similar story that he was going to be fitting panels to a fence that backed onto the victim's garden.

He asked to walk through her house to the back garden but the woman refused and said she would take him round the side of her property.

She left her back door locked and the chain on the front door.

The man left and the woman did not see anyone enter the house.

However, she later discovered a number of Royal Dalton paperweights had been taken from her living room.

The man was described as white, around five feet eight inches tall, of slim build and wearing smart clothes.

Chief Inspector Guy Shimmons said: "We would urge anyone who has any information about either of these incidents, or who was approached in a similar manner by a man matching the descriptions given, to contact police.

"I would like remind all residents in Dorset not to open their doors to anyone they do not know.

"If you are unsure, always ask for ID and if you have any concerns about the caller's intentions, contact a family member or neighbour and inform the police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 10:227. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
