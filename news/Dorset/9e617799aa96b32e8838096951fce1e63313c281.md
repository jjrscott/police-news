# Appeal for information following purse thefts in Christchurch

03 March 2020

* * *

Officers are urging members of the public to be vigilant and appealing for information following purse thefts in Christchurch.

It was reported that at around 10.45am on Monday 2 March 2020 a woman aged in her 70s was shopping in Waitrose at Bargates when she realised her purse, which contained Â£45 cash as well as her bank card and bus pass, had been taken.

The bank card was subsequently used to carry out a balance enquiry at the Sainsbury's store in the town.

The purse was described as small and multi-coloured, mostly blue and pink, and also contained sentimental photographs.

A previous purse theft occurred at the Marks & Spencer store in High Street at around 11.30am on Monday 17 February 2020.

The victim was also a woman aged in her 70s but her bank card was not used on this occasion.

Police Community Support Investigator Kate Hann, of Dorset Police, said: "Both victims have been visited by officers and given advice and support. I would urge anyone with information about these thefts to please contact police.

"I would also urge shoppers in the area to remain vigilant to avoid becoming victims of this type of offence.

"Make sure your bag is kept close and secured at all times and there are also items such as purse bells that can make it harder for thieves to steal items from your bag. For more crime prevention advice visit www.dorset.police.uk/help-advice-crime-prevention/.

"Finally, I would like to appeal directly to the person who stole the purse on Monday 2 March to have a heart and hand it in with the photos as they are of great sentimental value to the victim."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200032850. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
