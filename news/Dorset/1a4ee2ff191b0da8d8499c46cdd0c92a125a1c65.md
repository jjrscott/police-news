Detectives have launched a murder investigation after a woman's body was found in Bournemouth - with one man arrested.

At around 2.40pm today, Sunday 2 October 2016, officers attended an address in Harley Gardens and found that a woman - believed to be aged in her 20s - had sustained serious injuries.

Sadly she was pronounced dead at the scene. Her next of kin have been informed. The coroner has been notified.

Detectives from Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT) are treating her death as suspicious and a murder investigation has been launched.

Armed officers, assisted by the NPAS helicopter, carried out a search of the area and at around 3.20pm today a 26-year-old local man was located at Hengistbury Head. He has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is currently assisting officers with enquiries.

The address in Harley Gardens has been cordoned off while crime scene investigators carry out their examinations.

Detective Inspector Mark Samuel, of the MCIT, said: "Following the discovery of a woman's body today, Dorset Police has launched a murder investigation.

"Enquiries are now underway to establish exactly what happened at this address in Harley Gardens.

"A cordon has been put in place at the address while crime scene investigators examine the scene. Officers are also carrying out house-to-house enquiries.

"I am appealing for anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious in the Harley Gardens area yesterday, Saturday 1 October, or today to contact Dorset Police as soon as possible.

"Officers from the local Neighbourhood Policing Team will be carrying out high visibility patrols in the area over the coming days to offer reassurance to the community and can be contacted with any concerns."
