# Update – women due in court in connection with reported theft at Poole supermarket

02 May 2019

* * *

Two women are due to appear in court in connection with the reported theft of items from a supermarket in Poole.

At 6.39pm on Monday 25 February 2019 two women entered Asda at Canford Heath and allegedly loaded a trolley with around £200-worth of items before leaving the store without making any attempt to pay.

Following a CCTV appeal issued by officers, two Poole women - aged 38 and 50 - have been issued with postal requisitions to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 10 May 2019 for an offence of theft.
