A man is due to appear in court in connection with a fatal collision in Bournemouth.

Officers were called to a collision involving a car and a pedestrian in Southbourne Road at 11.45am on Wednesday 26 April 2017.

The pedestrian, an 87-year-old Bournemouth woman, suffered serious injuries to her legs and head and was taken to hospital. Sadly she later died from her injuries.

The driver of the car, a 76-year-old man from Bournemouth, has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 17 November 2017 for an offence of causing death by careless driving and failing to stop after a road accident.
