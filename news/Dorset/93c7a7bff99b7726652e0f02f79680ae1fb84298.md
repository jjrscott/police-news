# Man charged following alleged fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth

05 December 2016

* * *

A man has been charged with causing serious injury by dangerous driving following an alleged fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth.

The 22-year-old from Bournemouth is due to appear before Bournemouth Magistrates' Court on Friday 13 January 2017. He has also been charged with two drug driving offences, driving with alcohol above the legal limit, failing to stop at the scene of a collision, driving without insurance and driving without a licence.

The charges relate to a serious road traffic collision which occurred on Pine Road at around 5.15pm on Tuesday 27 September 2016.

It is alleged a blue Ford Focus collided with a parked unattended Volkswagen Polo and a parked Mini Cooper. It was reported that the driver of the Focus failed to stop at the scene.

A 35-year-old woman from Blandford, who was collecting items from the back of her car at the time of the collision, sustained life-changing injuries and had to have part of her leg amputated.
