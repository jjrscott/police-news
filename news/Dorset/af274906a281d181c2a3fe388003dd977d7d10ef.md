# Appeal for information following theft in Shaftesbury

03 February 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a theft from a farm in Shaftesbury are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

Some time between 11.30am and 8.50pm on Saturday 18 January 2020 five show cockerels were taken from a secured outbuilding in the Mampitts Lane area. When their owner went to check on them he found that the barn door was open and some of his birds were missing.

The cockerels are of various breeds, including a Bearded Asil and a Shamo Stag, and are worth Â£300 each.

Police Constable Neil Hawkes, of Dorset Police, said: "We are continuing to make enquiries to identify who is responsible for these thefts and I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed any suspicious activity in the area at the relevant time to please contact us.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who may have come across any cockerels in unusual circumstances since Saturday 18 January."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200009080. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
