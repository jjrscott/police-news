# Serious injury collision in North Dorset â€“ witness appeal

13 July 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a serious injury collision are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward - with one man arrested.

At 11.12pm on Sunday 12 July 2020 a report was received of a collision on Marsh Lane in Hazelbury Bryan near Sturminster Newton involving a silver Mercedes Vito van and a telegraph pole.

A local man aged in his 30s sustained serious injuries and was taken to hospital by the ambulance service. His condition is described as life-threatening and his family has been informed.

A 39-year-old man from London was arrested on suspicion of driving offences and is assisting officers with their enquiries.

The road was closed to allow emergency services to deal with the incident and for the telegraph pole to be repaired.

Police Sergeant Lee Savage, of the traffic unit, said: "An investigation is underway and I am appealing to any motorists who may have witnessed the incident or the manner of driving of the van before the collision to please get in touch.

"I would also urge anyone with relevant dashcam footage to please contact Dorset Police.

"Finally, I would like to thank motorists for their patience while the road closures were in place. They were absolutely necessary to allow us to treat the injured people and carry out an examination of the scene."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 12:558. Alternatively, or alternatively to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
