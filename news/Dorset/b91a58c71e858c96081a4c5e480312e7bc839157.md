# Robbery in Poole – image appeal

18 March 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a robbery in Poole are issuing an image of the stolen bike and asking anyone with information to come forward.

At around 4.50pm on Tuesday 3 March 2020 a 10-year-old boy was cycling along Melbury Avenue at the junction with Milborne Crescent when a man approached and asked him for the time. The man also asked the victim if he could borrow his mobile phone.

Once the offender had finished using the phone, he gave it back to the victim. When the boy tried to get back on his bicycle, the man grabbed it by the handlebars and threw it from side to side, forcing the victim to let go.

The offender cycled off on the bike in the direction of Turbary Road.

The stolen bike is a red, white and black Scott mountain bike, worth around £2,600.

The offender is described as white, approximately five feet eight inches tall and of average build. He was wearing a dark blue tracksuit top and bottoms.

Police Constable Chantelle Gosney, of Poole police, said: "The victim was left feeling very distressed and I have been conducting a number of enquiries to try and identify the offender, including carrying out house-to-house visits and checking local CCTV footage.

"I have now obtained an image of the stolen bike and am appealing to anyone who recognises it, or has seen a similar bike for sale in unusual circumstances, to please get in touch.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who has any information about who was responsible for the robbery."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200033520. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
