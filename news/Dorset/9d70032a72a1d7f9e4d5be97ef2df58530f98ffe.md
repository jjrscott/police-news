Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a reported assault in Bournemouth - with one man arrested.

The incident happened at around 2.15am on Wednesday 15 February 2017 along Madeira Road.

It is alleged the victim - a local man aged in his 20s - was approached and punched to the side of the face by a man.

The victim sustained a fractured jaw during the incident.

A 21-year-old Bournemouth man has been arrested on suspicion of assault causing actual bodily harm and is currently on police pail pending further enquiries until the end of March 2017.

Detective Constable Laura McQueen, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I believe there were a number of people in the area at the time who may have witnessed the reported assault.

"I am particularly keen to speak to three men who were in Madeira Road and spoke to police officers at the time of the incident.

"I would also like to hear from a woman who we believe was with the alleged offender and would have witnessed the reported assault.

"Anyone with information that could help with my investigation should contact Dorset Police."
