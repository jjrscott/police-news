# Appeal for information following robbery in Poole

04 February 2019

* * *

Detectives investigating a robbery in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police received a report that at around 8pm on Saturday 2 February 2019 two male victims, aged 17 and 18, were in a black Vauxhall Corsa in Arne Avenue when they saw a group of four white male teenagers, aged around 16 to 17.

One of the victims shouted out to the group as he thought he saw someone recognised, but it turned out not to be him.

The group then approached the car and demanded that the victims get out and give them everything they had. It was reported that they shot at the victims with what was believed to be a BB gun and also smashed the car windscreen using a hammer or crowbar.

The group took one of the victim's keys before making off when he told them that police would be on their way.

Officers attended and a search of the area was carried out but the offenders were not located.

Neither of the victims sustained any serious injuries that required hospital treatment.

Detective Constable Neil Causebrook, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This must have been a very distressing incident for the victims and I would like to reassure members of the public that a full investigation is underway to identify those responsible.

"We are carrying out a number of enquiries and I would ask anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area around the time of the offence, or who has any information that can assist our investigation, to contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190017344. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
