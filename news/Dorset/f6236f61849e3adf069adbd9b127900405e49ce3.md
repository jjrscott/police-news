# Investigation into death of woman at Bestival - further update

12 September 2017

* * *

A man who was arrested in relation to the death of a woman at Bestival has been released under investigation.

Officers at the event were alerted just before 1am on Monday 11 September 2017 to reports of a concern for welfare for a woman who had attended the festival at Lulworth Castle.

Very sadly, following a search of the area the body of the woman was located in a wooded area on the edge of the festival site.

She has been named by her family as 25-year-old Louella Eve Fletcher-Michie from London.

An initial post-mortem examination took place yesterday evening, Monday 11 September 2017, which showed no clear signs of an assault. However, further examinations will need to take place over the coming weeks, including toxicology, in order to establish if there are any substances in her system or other suspicious circumstances.

A 28-year-old man, who was known to Louella, was arrested on suspicion of murder and supply of a controlled class A drug. He has now been released under investigation.
