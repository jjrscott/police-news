# Witness appeal following assault in Bournemouth

07 October 2019

* * *

Officers investigating an assault in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The assault by a woman on a female victim aged in her 20s occurred in the early hours of Saturday 28 September 2019 in Christchurch Road.

At around 3am the victim was with friends at Zephyr, sitting in the smoking area outside the front of the bar when a woman fell into them.

They helped her up and she turned round and punched one of the victim's friends to the face before walking off toward the Premier Inn on Christchurch Road, close to the St Swithun's roundabout.

The victim followed the woman and asked her why she had assaulted her friend. The woman then grabbed her and they fell to the floor. During the altercation the victim sustained a serious injury to her index finger, which resulted in her losing part of the finger.

The offender is described as white, aged in her mid 20s, around five feet four inches tall and of medium build with dark blonde medium-length hair. She was wearing all black clothing.

Police Constable Joshua Benoke, of Bournemouth police, said: "We have been carrying out a number of enquiries into this assault, which left the victim with a nasty injury.

"Following consultation with the victim, I am now appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information about the incident to please contact us."
