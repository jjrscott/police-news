Officers investigating the theft of a bike in Poole are issuing CCTV images of the suspect.

On Friday 4 December 2020 the victim left his bicycle locked outside of St Edward's School on Dale Valley Road. It is reported that at around 2.45pm a man climbed over the fence into the school grounds, cut the lock on the bike and threw it back over the fence, before riding off on it.

The bike is described as a Kona Lava Dome that is black and light blue.

Police Community Support Investigator Adam Cleaver, of Poole police, said: "I have now obtained CCTV images of the suspect and I would ask anyone who recognises him to please get in touch."
