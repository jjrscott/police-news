# UPDATE: Appeal for Good Samaritan to come forward

19 June 2017

* * *

A cyclist injured in a collision near Blandford has been reunited with his bike following an appeal for the Good Samaritan who helped him to come forward.

The collision occurred at around 6.30pm on Thursday 18 May 2017 on an unnamed road between Bulbarrow Hill and Winterborne Houghton between a stationary Mini Cooper and a cyclist.

The male cyclist - a local man aged in his 40s - collided with the car that had pulled over to the side of the road, causing the rider to dismount and fall heavily on the ground.

He suffered severe injuries to his face that required surgery.

A Good Samaritan stopped before the arrival of police and ambulance and took the injured cyclist's bike to his house for storage until he was released from hospital. The cyclist took down their details but unfortunately lost them while in hospital.

Police Constable Matt Weldon, of North Dorset police, said: "Following our earlier public appeal, I am pleased to say the Good Samaritan has come forward and the bicycle has been returned to the injured man."
