# Witness appeal following arson at house near Gillingham

22 May 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following a suspicious fire at a house near Gillingham.

At 9.08pm on Wednesday 17 May 2017 Dorset Police was contacted by Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service to reports of a fire at a derelict property in Milton on Stour.

Thankfully no one was in the address.

Following an investigation, it is believed the fire was started deliberately.

Police Constable Simon Rogers, of North Dorset police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who saw someone acting suspiciously in the area of the property at the relevant time to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who may have information about a vehicle which was seen near the property at around 8.30pm that evening.

"The property is fenced off and this was a deliberate act to set fire to the building. This incident has caused financial implications and great inconvenience to the owner of the property, the emergency services that attended and concern to neighbours who spent an anxious few hours concerned the fire might have spread to their properties."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170072599. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
