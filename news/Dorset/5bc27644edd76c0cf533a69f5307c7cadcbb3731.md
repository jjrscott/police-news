A further 14 people have now been charged with drink or drug driving offences as part of Dorset Police's summer drink and drug driving campaign.

They are due to appear at courts in Poole and Weymouth during July.

A total of 33 people have been charged as part of the campaign, which runs between Thursday 1 June 2017 and Friday 30 June 2017.
