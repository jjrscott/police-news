A man arrested in connection with a reported street robbery in Bournemouth has been released from under investigation.

It was reported that at around 5am on Sunday 13 January 2019 a local man aged in his 40s was approached by two men on Old Christchurch Road at the junction with Lorne Park Road. He was allegedly punched on the head and fell to the ground and his mobile phone, jewellery and cash were stolen.
