# Witness appeal following indecent exposure near Dorchester

15 March 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating an indecent exposure incident near Dorchester are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 11pm on Wednesday 14 March 2018 Dorset Police received a report that a man had indecently exposed himself in the Mill Lane area of Charminster.

The victim, a woman aged in her 60s, was in her lounge at around 10.40pm when she heard a knock on the window. She opened the curtain and saw a naked man standing outside.

The woman closed the curtains and heard the offender walking away a short time later.

Detective Constable Gerald Marchant, of Weymouth CID, said: "We are carrying out a number of enquiries into this incident and are continuing to support the victim.

"She was understandably shocked by this incident and was unable to provide a detailed description of the offender.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the Charminster area around the relevant time or who has any information about this incident to come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk, or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180038828. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
