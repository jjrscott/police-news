# Witness appeal following street robbery in Christchurch

30 August 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a street robbery in Christchurch.

At approximately 11pm on Wednesday 29 August 2018 a local man was walking on a pathway in Chewton Common when he was approached by an unknown man and punched in the face, causing him to fall to the ground.

While the victim was on the floor, he felt the man reach into his pocket and take his wallet before stamping on his head twice and leaving the area.

The victim sustained injuries to his head and was taken to Poole Hospital to receive treatment for his injuries, which were not believed to be serious.

The offender is described as a white man and approximately five feet four inches tall. He was wearing a blue or black hooded top and black Nike Air Max trainers.

Detective Constable Zachary Dredge, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident and has not yet spoken to police to come forward.

"Also, if you were in the area at the relevant time and saw someone acting suspiciously please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180139985. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
