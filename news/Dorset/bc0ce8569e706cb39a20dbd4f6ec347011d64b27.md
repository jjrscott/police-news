# Update â€“ Fatal collision in Dorchester

05 January 2018

* * *

A woman arrested in connection with a fatal collision in Dorchester has been released under investigation.

Police were called at 7.46pm on Wednesday 27 December 2017 to reports of a collision between a pedestrian and a car on The Grove. It is alleged the driver failed to stop at the scene.

The female pedestrian - 39-year-old Erika Prisacaru from Dorchester - was taken to Dorset County Hospital, but she sadly died from her injuries. She leaves behind her six-year-old son Andrei who is now being cared for by relatives. Erika's distraught family continues to be supported by specially-trained officers.

On Wednesday 3 January 2018 officers issued CCTV images of a dark-coloured convertible Audi A3 they wished to trace as well as photos of Erika and her son.

A 47-year-old local woman was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving, failing to stop at the scene of a collision and perverting the course of justice and has been released under investigation while enquiries continue. A vehicle has also been seized.

Inspector Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "I would like to thank the very many members of the public who have come forward in response to our appeals.

"I am still keen to hear from anyone who saw a dark-coloured convertible Audi A3 in either The Grove or Brewery Square at the relevant times on Wednesday 27 December and has not yet spoken to officers to please call Dorset Police.

"I would also ask for any motorists who were in these areas and have a dash cam on board to please contact us."

Anyone with information about the collision is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 3:315. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
