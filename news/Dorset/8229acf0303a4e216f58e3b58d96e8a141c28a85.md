# Witness appeal after elderly woman tied up and burgled in Christchurch home

02 February 2017

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses after an elderly woman was tied up and burgled in her own home in Christchurch.

The incident happened at around 9.30pm on Wednesday 1 February 2017 in the Oak Avenue area when the victim heard a knock at her front door.

She opened the door and a man and a woman wearing scarves over their faces forced themselves into her address.

They tied the victim to a chair with cable ties and stole cash and jewellery from the address before leaving.

The victim - aged in her 80s - managed to free herself from the ties and contact police. She suffered some bruising.

Detective Sergeant Andy Haworth, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was a terrifying ordeal for the victim in her own home.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the time and witnessed two people acting suspiciously to contact police or call Crimestoppers anonymously.

"Officers from the Neighbourhood Policing Team will be carrying out high-visibility patrols over the coming days to reassure the community and offer support and advice."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170016288. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
