Detectives are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward after a teenage boy was reportedly robbed in Bournemouth.

At approximately 2.45am on Wednesday 28 August 2019 it is reported that a 16-year-old boy was sitting with a friend in Winton Recreation Park on Fitzharris Avenue when they were approached by three male teenagers.
