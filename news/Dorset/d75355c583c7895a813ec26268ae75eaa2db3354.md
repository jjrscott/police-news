# Witness appeal after aggravated burglary near Wimborne

07 November 2017

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses after an aggravated burglary near Wimborne that left one man with head injuries.

Police received a call at 12.07am today, Tuesday 7 November 2017, reporting that two men had entered Colehill Sports and Social Club on Wimborne Road.

The victim - a man aged in his 50s - was closing the club, when the two men entered having smashed through a glass patio door.

He armed himself with a chair to challenge the offenders and during an altercation the victim was hit over the head with an unknown object. The two offenders then ran away on foot. It is not believed anything was stolen during the incident.

The victim was taken to hospital for treatment to a cut to his head and elbow.

The first offender is described as white, taller than five feet ten inches and of slim build. He was wearing a hooded top with the hood pulled up over his face. The second offender was described as having a similar appearance and clothing.

Detective Constable Chris Griffin, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was a particularly nasty incident for the victim to endure and I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed anything suspicious in the area at the time to please come forward.

"A search of the area was carried out with assistance from the dog unit and NPAS helicopter, but no one was located.

"I would like to reassure the public that a detailed investigation is underway to identify the offenders.

"Enquiries are continuing today, including house-to-house visits, and searches will be carried out in the vicinity to see if any possible weapons were discarded. A cordon will remain in place at the club to allow investigators to examine the scene."
