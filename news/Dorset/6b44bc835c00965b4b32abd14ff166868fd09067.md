A man has been charged with causing death by careless driving in connection with a fatal road traffic collision on the A31 in East Dorset.

The collision occurred at around 8.45am on Tuesday 30 April 2019 outside Henbury Stud Farm near Sturminster Marshall. It involved a green Kawasaki motorcycle, a white Ford Transit panel van and a white Citroen Relay dropside lorry.

Emergency services attended and very sadly the motorcyclist, named by his family as 40-year-old Andrew Mann from Poole, was pronounced dead at the scene.

A 41-year-old man from Poole was arrested and has been charged with causing death by careless driving. He is due to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Thursday 18 July 2019.

The man was also arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice but has not been charged and will face no further police action in relation to this offence.
