# Witness appeal following serious injury collision in Bournemouth

11 January 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a pedestrian sustained serious injuries following a collision in Bournemouth.

At 6.30pm yesterday, Thursday 10 January 2019, Dorset Police was called to reports of a collision involving a silver Ford Mondeo estate and a pedestrian at the roundabout on the junction of Redhill Drive and Whitelegg Way.

The injured pedestrian - a local man aged in his 50s - sustained serious injuries and was taken to Poole Hospital for treatment.

The driver of the Mondeo, a local man also aged in his 50s, was uninjured.

The road was closed initially to allow the injured man to receive vital medical treatment at the scene by paramedics and medics from the air ambulance. Traffic officers and collision investigators then carried out a detailed examination of the scene to establish the circumstances of the collision.

Police Sergeant Craig Tatton, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision and has yet to speak to officers to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would like to thank motorists and local residents for their patience during the road closures. These were entirely necessary to allow the injured man to receive medical treatment and for officers to establish what happened."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 10: 343. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
