# Witness appeal after reported robbery in Ferndown

07 February 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a reported robbery in Ferndown are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At 10.04pm on Friday 31 January 2020 it was reported that two members of staff were locking up the premises of Betfred on Victoria Road when they were approached by two men who had their faces covered and said they were holding knives. They allegedly forced them back inside, demanded money from the victims and made threats, with one of the offenders reportedly holding a knife to the throat of one of the victims.

One of the men reportedly left the store with Â£150 in coins. The other man was still at the scene when officers arrived and is reported to have made off by smashing his way through the glass door of the store before being detained nearby.

A knife was recovered from the scene.

A 34-year-old man from London was arrested and subsequently charged with robbery. He was due to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Monday 3 February 2020. Enquiries are ongoing to identify the second suspect.

Detective Constable Jordan Hopkins, of Bournemouth CID, said: "The victims were understandably shaken by this incident and we are carrying out number of enquiries to locate the second suspect.

"I would urge anyone who was in the area during the relevant time and has witnessed any suspicious activity or has any information to please come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200016164. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
