# Appeal after lead theft from lifts in Poole

19 December 2016

* * *

Police are appealing for witnesses following the theft of lead from two lifts in Poole.

The first incident happened at around 12.30am on Saturday 26 November 2016 at Nelson Court on Lagland Street.

A second theft happened in the evening of Sunday 11 December 2016 at the same location.

The offenders removed lead weights from two separate lifts.

Police Constable Chris Lee, of Poole police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area at the time of both incidents to come forward.

"I am aware that CCTV is being installed in the block of flats and the weights are to be replaced with reinforced concrete and not lead to prevent future theft occurring."
