# Witness appeal after object hurled at moving car in Poole

11 June 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after an object was thrown from a bridge at a moving car in Poole.

At around 1.50pm on Sunday 9 June 2019 the victim - a local woman - was driving her Ford Focus along Dorset Way near to English Ford when a rock or brick was thrown from the pedestrian bridge above.

The object damaged the front windscreen.

The offender is described as tall, of medium build and with light brown hair. He was wearing grey tracksuit bottoms and a white top.

Police Constable Ben King, of Poole police, said: "This was a reckless and very dangerous incident and it is nothing but sheer luck that no one was injured or killed.

"I am appealing to anyone who was either near the footbridge or travelling along Dorset Way at the relevant time and saw anything suspicious to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who may have captured the offender or incident on dashcam."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk, or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190087140. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
