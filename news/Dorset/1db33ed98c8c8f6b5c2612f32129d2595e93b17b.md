# UPDATE: Sudden death of man in Bournemouth

25 October 2016

* * *

Detectives investigating the sudden death of a man in Bournemouth have issued an update.

At around 3.40am on Friday 21 October 2016 officers were called by the ambulance service to reports that a 19-year-old local man was in a critical condition at an address in Wootton Gardens. Sadly he was pronounced dead at the scene a short time later.

The man's next of kin have been informed and the coroner notified.

Detective Inspector Neil Wright, of Bournemouth CID, said: "Following initial enquiries, we are not treating the man's death as suspicious.

"A post mortem examination conducted yesterday, Monday 24 October 2016, was inconclusive. Further toxicology tests will now be carried out. The man's family have been updated."

A 58-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of administering a poison/drug with intent to endanger life has been released on police bail until the end of January 2017 pending further enquiries.
