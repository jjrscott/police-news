# Appeal for information following robbery in Bournemouth

17 September 2020

* * *

Detectives investigating a robbery in Bournemouth are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The victim, a 16-year-old boy, was walking along Hawkwood Road in Boscombe with a friend between 6pm and 7pm on Saturday 5 September 2020 when they were approached by a group of three male teenagers. They ordered the victim to take off his trainers but he refused, at which point one of the group produced a knife.

The victim attempted to run off from the group but was grabbed near to the car park of Sainsbury's and assaulted. He then took off his trainers and ran away.

One of the offenders is described as white, aged around 14 years old, of slim build and possibly Italian with short black hair. He was wearing a dark blue hooded top and black tracksuit bottoms and was carrying a grey Nike bag.

The offender who produced the knife is described as white, aged around 15 years old and of slim build with short dark brown hair. He was wearing a coat, shirt and grey or black tracksuit bottoms.

The third member of the group is described as white, aged around 18 and of medium build with short brown hair. He was wearing a grey baseball cap, a shirt, a blue denim jacket and jeans.

Detective Sergeant Karen Penn, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We have been continuing to investigate this robbery and I am appealing for anyone with information that could help identify those responsible to please come forward.

"I understand there was a woman in the area at the time who the victim asked for assistance from and I would be keen to get her account as she may have witnessed this incident."
