# Witness appeal following robbery in Poole

03 November 2020

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following a robbery in Poole.

It is reported that at around 5.30pm on Sunday 1 November 2020 a man aged in his 20s, who was driving a van, stopped to park on Arne Avenue when five men approached his vehicle. One of the group was carrying a machete.

It is reported that the men told the victim to get out of the van, before the man holding the machete got in the vehicle and drove off toward Herbert Avenue. The other four men walked off in the opposite direction.

One of the men is described as white and aged in his 20s with a tattoo around his eye and the side of his face. It is believed he had a tooth missing.

Enquiries are ongoing to locate the van, which is described as a silver Ford Transit with the registration number MW62 VZS.

Detective Sergeant Karen Penn, of Dorset Police's Priority Crime Team, said: "A full investigation is underway and we have been carrying out a number of enquiries to try and locate the five men, including house-to-house visits.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the area and witnessed what happened to please get in touch.

"I would also urge any residents who have home CCTV systems installed to please check their systems for any relevant footage to assist my enquiries.

"Finally, if you have any information about the missing van and its whereabouts please get in contact."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200164621. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
