# Witness appeal following burglary in Verwood

22 August 2018

* * *

Officers investigating a burglary in Verwood are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Between 11.15am and 11.45am on Sunday 19 August 2018 the victim, a woman aged in her 70s, was at her home in The Chase when somebody walked in and stole her blue handbag from the kitchen before leaving the property.

The victim reported seeing a blue saloon style vehicle, which was caked in mud along the bottom, outside her home around the time of the offence. The suspect is described as a white man with blond hair and scruffy in his appearance.

Police Constable Liam Foster, of East Dorset police, said: "This incident has obviously caused the victim a great deal of concern as the offence occurred while she was in her own home and we have offered her support and crime prevention advice.

"We are also carrying out a number of enquiries to identify the offender and I am appealing for anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area around the time of the offence, or who saw a car or man matching the above descriptions, to please contact us."
