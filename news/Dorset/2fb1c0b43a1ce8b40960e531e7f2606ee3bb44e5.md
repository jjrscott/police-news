# Update - Alleged armed robbery in Bournemouth

23 April 2018

* * *

Two men are due to appear in court today charged in connection with an alleged armed robbery in Bournemouth.

At around 1.40pm on Saturday 21 April 2018 the victim, a 28-year-old Bournemouth man, was driving in a BMW along Wallisdown Road when he was held up in traffic prior to the roundabout near the BMW dealership.

It was reported that at this point the passenger door was opened by a man brandishing a knuckleduster and the driver's door was opened by another man threatening the victim with a knife and telling him to get out the car, which he did.

The two suspects then reportedly drove off with the BMW. The victim did not sustain any injuries.

A 21-year-old man from Poole and a 25-year-old man from Weymouth have been charged with robbery and possession of a knife blade/sharp object in a public place and are due to appear before Poole Magistrates' Court today, Monday 23 April 2018.

A 24-year-old woman from Poole who was arrested on suspicion of conspiring to commit robbery has been released under investigation.
