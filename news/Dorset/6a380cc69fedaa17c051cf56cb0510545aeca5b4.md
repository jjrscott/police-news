# Appeal for witnesses following medical incident near Christchurch

03 June 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward after a cyclist sadly died following a suspected medical episode at Hurn near Christchurch.

At 2.50pm on Sunday 24 May 2020 Dorset Police was called to a report that a male cyclist required treatment following what was believed to be a medical episode on the eastbound carriageway of the Avon Causeway, near to the Avon Causeway Hotel.

Officers attended, along with the ambulance service, and the cyclist - a man aged in his 50s from Bournemouth - was airlifted to Southampton General Hospital for treatment.

Very sadly, he subsequently died in hospital on Monday 1 June 2020.

Police Constable Andy Kennedy, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the family and loved ones of the man who sadly died and we owe it to them to carry out a detailed investigation to establish the full circumstances of this incident.

"I would urge anyone who witnessed the incident and has not already spoken to police, or who was driving in the area at the time and captured anything relevant on dashcam, to please contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200073303. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
