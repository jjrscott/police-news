# Witness appeal following serious assault in Boscombe

30 May 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a man was seriously assaulted in Boscombe.

Sometime around 9.55pm on Tuesday 29 May 2018 the victim - a local man aged in his 50s - was drinking with friends inside a flat in Cecil Road when an unknown man and woman attended the address. As the victim stepped outside, the male suspect slashed him across his face with a knife.

The victim sustained a cut to his face and attended hospital for treatment.

The male suspect was said to be wearing dark clothing and had his face covered. He was with a woman who was shorter and also wore dark clothing and had a hooded top with the hood up that was pulled tight around her face.

Detective Constable Tom Bancroft, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was a nasty and unprovoked assault, which has left the victim with a significant injury to his face.

"We are conducting a number of enquiries including house-to-house and CCTV in a bid to locate the two suspects.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the Cecil Road area at the relevant time and saw or heard anything suspicious to please contact me."
