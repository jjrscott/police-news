# Further update in relation to reported fraudulent use of bank card in Bournemouth

08 January 2021

* * *

A man has been charged in connection with the reported fraudulent use of a bank card in Bournemouth.

It was reported that at 1.37pm on Thursday 24 December 2020 the victim used his bank card at Tesco Express on Charminster Road, but had failed to collect his card from the machine.

At approximately 2pm the same day the card was allegedly used to make contactless payments on several occasions at local stores.

Following a CCTV appeal, a 36-year-old Bournemouth man was arrested and he has now been charged with three counts of fraud by false representation and theft. He is due to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 24 February 2021.
