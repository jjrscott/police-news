Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a reported assault in Bournemouth town centre.

At 5pm on Friday 14 December 2018 it was reported that an assault occurred on Horseshoe Common where three men are said to have approached a man who was sitting on a bench within the common.

The victim - aged in his 30s and from Poole - was reportedly punched and kicked a number of times by one of the men before he left the scene in a vehicle.

The victim sustained fractures to his eye socket and cheekbone and was taken to hospital for treatment.

A 30-year-old man from Bournemouth was arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and has been released under investigation while enquiries continue. The victim and arrested man are believed to be known to each other.

Detective Constable Dave Pearce, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I believe this incident was seen by a number of people and I would ask any witnesses who are yet to speak to officers to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180200623. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
