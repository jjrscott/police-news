# Witness appeal following fatal collision in Poole

16 March 2021

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses and anyone with dashcam footage to come forward following a fatal collision in Poole.

Just after 9pm on Monday 15 March 2021 a road traffic collision occurred on Dorset Way between the Tower Park roundabout and the Oakdale Road slip road involving a white Honda motorcycle.

Very sadly, the rider of the motorcycle - a local man aged in his 20s - died at the scene. His next of kin has been informed and the coroner notified.

The road was closed between the Fleetsbridge and Tower Park roundabouts to allow collision investigators to examine the scene safely.

Police Sergeant Mark Scammell, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with this young man's family and friends at this very difficult time.

"We are investigating the circumstances surrounding this collision and I would appeal to anyone who was travelling along Dorset Way at the time of the collision, or immediately prior to it, and saw the motorcycle involved to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who may have captured the motorcycle or the incident on dashcam.

"Finally, I would like to thank motorists for their patience and understanding during the road closure. This was entirely necessary to allow emergency services to deal with the incident and for collision examiners to carry out their investigations."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 15:758. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
