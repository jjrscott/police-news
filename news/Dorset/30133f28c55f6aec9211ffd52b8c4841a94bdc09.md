# Witness appeal following alleged robbery in Bournemouth

05 December 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating an alleged robbery in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward - with one man being arrested.

At 2.35am on Saturday 2 December 2017 a 26-year-old Bournemouth man was using a cash machine at the Post Office in Cunningham Crescent in the presence of three other men.

It was reported that while the victim used the ATM, the other three men attacked him punching him to the ground and kicking him before taking his wallet. He sustained cuts and bruises and was taken to hospital.

A member of the public saw the incident and intervened and the three suspects left.

Detective Constable Mark Richardson, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We believe that the victim knew at least one of the suspects.

"We have thoroughly investigated the scene and are continuing with our enquiries.

"I am appealing for any further witnesses to the incident or anyone with information about those involved to contact police."

A 26-year-old Bournemouth man was arrested on suspicion of robbery and has been released under investigation.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170187281. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
