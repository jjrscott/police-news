# Update â€“ appeal in relation to reported suspicious incident in Bournemouth

05 December 2017

* * *

A man has come forward following an appeal in relation to a reported suspicious incident in Bournemouth.

At around 12pm on Thursday 9 November 2017 Dorset Police received a report of a man believed to be acting suspiciously by Bournemouth railway station, the travel interchange and the nearby bridge under the Wessex Way.

Following a CCTV appeal, a man has now come forward to assist with enquiries and officers are satisfied there is no requirement for any further police action.

We would like to thank everyone who shared our appeal.
