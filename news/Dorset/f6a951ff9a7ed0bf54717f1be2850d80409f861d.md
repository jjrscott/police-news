# Witness appeal following robbery in Poole

15 October 2018

* * *

Detectives are issuing an appeal for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward as they investigate a knifepoint robbery at a shop in Poole.

At around 5.30am today, Monday 15 October 2018, a man walked into Broadstone News in Lower Blandford Road and produced a knife before demanding that the member of staff present hand over money from the till.

The offender made off from the store with around Â£200 in cash and is believed to have left the scene in a vehicle heading toward the Broadstone Roundabout.

The victim was not injured during the incident.

The offender is described as white, aged in his mid 20s, of slim build and around five feet ten inches tall. He was wearing a cream or white parka-style jacket, trousers, a mask covering his mouth and nose and a dark blue beanie hat.

Detective Constable Honor McAdam, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This must have been a very shocking incident for the victim and we are determined to identify the man responsible.

"We have launched a full investigation and are carrying out a number of enquiries, including a review of CCTV footage in the area.

"I am appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident, or any suspicious activity in the area around the time of the offence, to contact us.

"I am particularly keen to hear from a taxi driver who was waiting near the store and may be able to assist as a witness."
 Anyone with information about this incident is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180166818. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
