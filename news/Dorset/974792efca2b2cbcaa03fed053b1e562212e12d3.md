# Update â€“ man due in court in connection with reported assault in Poole

28 January 2021

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with an alleged assault in Poole.

It was reported that at around 4.20pm on Wednesday 4 November 2020 the victim - a 15-year-old boy - was walking along Ashley Road with his friends when one of them became involved in a verbal altercation at the junction with Pearson Avenue with two men who were in a Mercedes.

The victim also subsequently got involved in the altercation. It is alleged that the men got out of the Mercedes and the driver reportedly assaulted the victim.

Following enquiries and an image appeal, a 32-year-old local man came forward and attended a voluntary police interview. He has now been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 12 February 2021 for an offence of assault.
