# Appeal for information following incident involving dog in Purbeck

05 January 2021

* * *

Officers investigating an incident involving a dog that attacked a horse in Purbeck are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

At around 11.45am on Sunday 20 December 2020 a woman aged in her 70s was horse riding with a friend in Moreton Forest when they were approached by a group of around seven or eight people who had two dogs with them.

One of the dogs was described as an English Bull Terrier who the owners - a man and a woman - appeared to call 'Ocean'. As they walked past the horses, the dog slipped its lead and attacked the woman's horse. The horse twisted round in distress, throwing the rider off.

She did not sustain any serious injuries. Her horse suffered a graze to its leg.

A woman apologised to her and they managed to get the dog back on its lead before the group got into two cars parked nearby.

The male owner of the dog is described is white, aged in his late 30s to early 40s, around six feet tall and of stocky build with dark receding hair. He was wearing a dark hip-length coat and jeans and spoke with a local accent.

The female owner is described as white, of a similar age to the man, around five feet five inches tall and of stocky build with dark brown hair that was tied up on the top of her head. She may have been wearing a light yellow coat.

Police Constable Jennie Sykes-Martin, of Dorset Police, said: "We are making enquiries into this incident and I would urge anyone with information about the dog involved and its owners to please contact us.

"I would also like to appeal to the owners to do the right thing and come forward so we can take your account."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200191296. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
