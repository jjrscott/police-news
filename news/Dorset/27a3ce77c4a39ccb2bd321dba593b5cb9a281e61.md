# Further update â€“ investigation into death of woman in Wareham

31 May 2019

* * *

A man arrested in connection with the death of a woman in Wareham has been released from bail without charge.

At 2.59pm on Wednesday 29 May 2019 Dorset Police received a report from the ambulance service of the unexpected death of a woman aged in her 50s at an address in West Walls. Her family has been informed and is being supported by specially-trained officers.

Following enquiries, a 23-year-old local man who was known to the woman was arrested on suspicion of murder and was released on police bail.

A post-mortem examination was carried out today, Friday 31 May 2019, and - while the cause of death has not been confirmed - it has been established that there was no third party involvement and the death is no longer being treated as suspicious.

As a result, the arrested man has now been released from police bail without charge and will face no further police action. The woman's family has been updated.
