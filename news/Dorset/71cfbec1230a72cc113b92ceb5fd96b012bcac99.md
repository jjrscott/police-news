# Update - Robbery in Poole

16 August 2017

* * *

Two men who were arrested in connection with a robbery in Poole have been released without charge.

Sometime between 10.50pm and 11.30pm on Friday 20 January 2017 a man was driving his blue Ford Fiesta along Bourne Valley Road when he saw a man stood on the corner of Princess Road and slowed believing it was his friend.

As he pulled up, it was reported an unknown man opened the passenger door, jumped feet first into the car, kicked the driver and caused him to crash into a garden wall. The victim was then pulled out of the car and was further assaulted by two men before they ran down Princess Road. A mobile phone was stolen during the incident.

A 23-year-old man from Poole and a 30-year-old man of no fixed abode who were arrested on suspicion of robbery offences have been released from police bail without charge.
