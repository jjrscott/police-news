03 February 2017

* * *

Police are appealing for witnesses after a boy was bitten by a dog in Poole.

At around 12.20pm on Saturday 28 January 2017 an eight-year-old boy was riding on his skateboard alongside his mum on a footpath at Whitecliffe Park heading toward Baiter Park, when he was attacked by a white and brown medium-sized beagle-type dog accompanied by a white woman.

The boy sustained bruising to his left leg during the incident.

Police Constable Ben McSorley, of Poole police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the attack or has any further information that could help me with my investigation to please get in touch.

"I am particularly keen to speak to anyone who recognises the dog and its owner and may know of their whereabouts."
