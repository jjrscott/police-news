# Appeal following theft of bicycle in Bournemouth

05 December 2018

* * *

Officers investigating the theft of a pedal bike in Bournemouth are appealing for anyone with information to come forward - with an image of the bike being released.

The white-coloured bicycle was taken from the Talbot Campus at Bournemouth University at approximately 4pm on Sunday 25 November 2018.

Police Constable Shanena Cornwell, of Bournemouth police, said: "We do not have a make or model for the bike because it is custom-made by the victim.

"The bike is quite distinctive, so I am appealing to anyone who sees a bike matching the description or who comes across one for sale in suspicious or unusual circumstances to get in touch.

"Enquiries are continuing into the theft and I would appeal for any witnesses or anyone with information to contact police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180190148. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
