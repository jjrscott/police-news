# Witness appeal following criminal damage incidents in Bournemouth

07 February 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for the public's help to identify those responsible for damaging vehicles in Bournemouth.

On at least 10 occasions an offender or offenders have damaged the windscreen wipers and number plates of a yellow Ford Transit van parked in Bascott Road in the Wallisdown area of town.

All the incidents have occurred overnight between Tuesday 18 December 2018 and Wednesday 6 February 2019. It is reported that other residents' vehicles have also been damaged.

Police Constable Jennie Sykes-Martin, of Dorset Police, said: "We have spoken to a number of the victims and no one is aware of any reason as to why they are being targeted. We are therefore treating this series as mindless acts of vandalism.

"I would urge anyone who may know who is responsible for these incidents to please contact Dorset Police. I am also keen to hear from anyone else who has sustained similar damage in the area and may have important information that could assist my investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180203560. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
