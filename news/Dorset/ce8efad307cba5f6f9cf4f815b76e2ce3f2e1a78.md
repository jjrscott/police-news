# Witness appeal following assault in Poole

21 November 2016

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following an assault in Poole.

The incident took place at around 3pm on Friday 11 November 2016 on Alder Road in the town.

A 40-year-old local man was walking down the road when three men in a vehicle shouted something abusive to him out the window.

When the victim challenged the men, they got out of the vehicle and attacked him with a metal bar.

The vehicle was abandoned in the middle of the road during the incident.

The victim sustained cuts to his head and knees.

One of the offenders is described as white, just under six feet tall, of big build and aged in his late 40s. He wore a red and blue checked shirt and jeans and was described as looking scruffy.

Detective Constable Neil Jones, of Bournemouth CID, said: "It is unclear what type of vehicle was being driven by the offenders due to differing witness accounts.

"This was an unprovoked attack on a man who does not know why he was targeted.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the incident or knows who was responsible to contact Dorset Police."

No arrests have been made.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55160170201. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
