# Witness appeal following attempted rape in Weymouth

21 June 2016

* * *

Detectives in Weymouth are appealing for the public's help to identify a man who attempted to rape a woman in the town.

At around 4.15am today, Tuesday 21 June 2016, a woman was attacked just off Gloucester Mews in the town centre following a night out.

The victim, who is aged in her 20s, suffered minor injuries. She has met with specially-trained officers who will keep her updated throughout the investigation.

The offender is described as white, at least six feet four inches tall, of slim build and aged in his late 20s. He has short mousy brown hair and was wearing a blue sweatshirt or jacket, grey tracksuit jogging bottoms, black socks with white slide on flip-flop. He may also have been carrying a bright green hooded top.

Detective Inspector Kate Lill, of Weymouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who saw a man matching the description given in the Weymouth area in the early hours of this morning to please contact Dorset Police immediately.

"We understand that other groups of people in Weymouth were approached by this man between 11pm on Monday 20 June and 4.30am on Tuesday 21 June. If this was you, please get in touch as I believe you may have valuable information that could assist my investigation.

"Officers from the local Neighbourhood Policing Team will be carrying out high visibility patrols tonight and over the coming days to offer reassurance to the public while this incident is investigated."
