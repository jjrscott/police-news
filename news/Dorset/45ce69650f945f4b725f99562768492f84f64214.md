# Investigation into reported rape near Wareham - update

10 August 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating a reported rape near Wareham are issuing an update.

At 12.03pm on Tuesday 7 August 2018 Dorset Police received a report that an 18-year-old woman had been raped sometime between 10.30am and 11.30am by an unknown man in a wooded area off a country lane, which leads from Bindon Lane toward Woodstreet Farm and the B3071.

A 51-year-old Bournemouth man was arrested on Wednesday 8 August 2018 on suspicion of rape and was released under investigation while enquiries continued.

An investigation into the reported incident was led by detectives from Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team.

Detective Inspector Mark Jenkins, of MCIT, said: "We have carried out a full and very detailed investigation into this report.

"Following our enquiries, which have involved speaking to the woman, the arrested man and witnesses, we have established that the man and the woman were known to each other and that no offences were committed. As a result the 51-year-old man who was arrested will face no further police action and has been released without charge.

"Specially-trained officers are continuing to liaise with the woman and will ensure she is given access to receive the appropriate support.

"I appreciate this incident will have caused significant concern in the community and I would like to reassure them that we will always investigate such reports thoroughly and sensitively.

"I would also like to thank those members of public who contacted us following our public appeal and provided us with very important information.

"Finally, I would like to reiterate that any victims of sexual assault will be treated with respect and dignity. If you have been a victim of a sexual offence do not suffer in silence, come forward and report it to the police. We will thoroughly investigate such offences, we will safeguard victims and we will bring offenders to justice."
