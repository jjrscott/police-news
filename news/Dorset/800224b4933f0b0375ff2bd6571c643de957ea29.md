A man has been arrested in connection with reports of criminal damage to a boat in Weymouth.

Dorset Police received a report at around 9.30am on Monday 26 October 2020 that a bottle had caused damage to the windscreen of a boat in the harbour. Enquiries indicated the event was believed to have occurred at around 11.30pm on Friday 23 October 2020.

Following enquiries and a CCTV appeal, a 42-year-old local man was arrested on suspicion of possessing an article with intent to destroy or damage property and he has been released under investigation.

We would like to thank everyone who shared and responded to our appeal.
