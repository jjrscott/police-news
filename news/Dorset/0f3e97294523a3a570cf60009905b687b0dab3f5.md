# Appeal for information following burglary in Weymouth

11 February 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for information from the public following a burglary in Weymouth.

At around 8pm on Friday 8 February 2019 offenders gained entry to an address in Pugmill Lane in Chickerell and carried out an untidy search of the house.

A silver Raymond Weil wrist watch that had been specially engraved to mark the victim's 50th birthday was stolen. The watch has a silver metal strap and a white face with silver surround.

Police Constable Tom Arnold, of Weymouth police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the area and either saw someone acting suspiciously or a vehicle parked up that they didn't recognise to please contact Dorset Police.

"It is possible the stolen watch may be offered for sale locally and I would ask anyone who may either see it for sale or have information about it being offered in suspicious circumstances to check the inside of the watch for a personalised inscription. If you have any information that may be useful to my investigation please contact me."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190020807. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
