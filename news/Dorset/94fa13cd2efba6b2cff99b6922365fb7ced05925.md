# Witness appeal following serious road traffic collision in West Dorset

05 August 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a serious injury road traffic collision in West Dorset.

At 4.41pm on Saturday 4 August 2018 Dorset Police was called to a report of a three-vehicle road traffic collision on the B3157 coast road near Swyre. The collision involved a white Honda motorcycle, a grey Audi Q5 and a grey Vauxhall Astra.

Emergency services attended and the motorcyclist, a man aged in his 20s from the Yeovil area, was taken by air ambulance to Southmead Hospital in Bristol with injuries that are believed to be potentially life-changing.

The drivers and passengers of the other vehicles were not injured.

The road was closed to enable the emergency services to deal with the incident, for the scene to be examined and for the vehicles to be recovered.

Police Constable Stu Smith, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or the manner of driving of any of the vehicles involved prior to the incident to please contact Dorset Police. I'd also ask anyone with dashcam footage to get in touch.

"Additionally, I would also like to speak to two other motorcyclists who were believed to have been riding with the injured man and would ask that that they make contact with police.

"I would like to thank members of the public for their patience during the road closures, which were necessary to allow the casualty to be treated, for the scene to be thoroughly examined and for the vehicles involved to be recovered."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at scit@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 4:400. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
