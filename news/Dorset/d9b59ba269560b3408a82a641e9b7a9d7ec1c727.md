# Appeal for witnesses following assault on bus in Weymouth

11 October 2019

* * *

Officers investigating an assault on a teenage girl as she travelled on a bus in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

The incident occurred at around 9.40pm on Saturday 5 October 2019. The victim, aged 15, got on the number 1 bus at the Kings Statue and a man who appeared to be intoxicated was verbally and physically abusive toward her.

He pushed her in the face a number of times and grabbed her coat. The victim did not sustain any injuries.

The offender is described as white, aged in his 30s, around five feet nine inches tall and of slim build with short fair hair. He had tattoos on his neck, which appeared to be Chinese writing, and was wearing a black fleece and black jeans.

Police Constable Laura Hobson, of Weymouth police, said: "This must have been a very distressing incident for the young victim and we are determined to identify the man responsible.

"We are carrying out a number of enquiries into this assault. I understand there were several other people on the bus at the time of this incident and I would urge any witnesses to please contact us."
