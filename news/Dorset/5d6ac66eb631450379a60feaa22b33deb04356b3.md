# Detectives name child following launch of murder investigation

03 June 2016

* * *

Detectives who launched a murder investigation following the death of a two-year-old boy from Broadmayne have today named the child.

At 10.28am on Thursday 26 May 2016 officers were called by the ambulance service to an address in Broadmayne.

Two-year-old Harry House was taken seriously ill and was conveyed to Dorset County Hospital where sadly he was pronounced dead.

 A man and a woman, both aged 21 and from the Dorchester area, were arrested on suspicion of murder and have been released on police bail until the end of August 2016, pending further enquiries. They were both known to the child.

An inquest is due to be opened sometime next week.

Detective Chief Inspector Sarah Derbyshire, of Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team, said: "I can confirm that following the post-mortem examination on Wednesday 1 June 2016 the tragic death of this young boy is being treated as suspicious and a murder investigation, led by the Major Crime Investigation Team, was launched as a result.

"For investigative reasons we are unable to give the results of the post-mortem at this time.

"I would appeal for the family to be given privacy at this extremely difficult time."

Local Neighbourhood Policing Teams are carrying out additional patrols and anyone with concerns can speak to them as they will be able to offer reassurances.

The public are reminded that certain legal constraints apply as people have been arrested in connection with this investigation. Therefore Dorset Police would hate for anyone to accidentally impact on the investigation by posting well-intended but inappropriate comments on social media.

Anyone with information should call Dorset Police on 101 quoting incident number 26:107. Alternatively, call the free and anonymous Crimestoppers line on 0800 555 111 where mobile phone tariffs may apply.
