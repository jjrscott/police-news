# Update â€“ man due in court in connection with reported road rage incident near Dorchester

11 July 2018

* * *

A man arrested in connection with an alleged road rage incident on the A35 near Dorchester is due to appear in court.

Dorset Police received a report of an incident at around 12.25pm on Wednesday 7 March 2018 between the Stinsford roundabout and the Stadium roundabout.

It was reported that a black Audi A3 forced a Volkswagen Fox to stop, before a man got out of the Audi, smashed the window of the other car and then allegedly punched the victim - an 18-year-old man from Blandford - a number of times.

A 25-year-old Portland man has been issued with a postal requisition to appear before Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Monday 16 July 2018 for offences of assault and criminal damage.
