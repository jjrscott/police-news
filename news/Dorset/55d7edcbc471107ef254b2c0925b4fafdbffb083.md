# Update - Witness appeal following assault in Bournemouth

17 November 2017

* * *

A man arrested in connection with an assault in Bournemouth has been released from police investigation.

At around 10.30pm on Thursday 27 April 2017 two 17-year-old boys were cycling along Ringwood Road near Bearwood Motors when they heard a man shouting at them.

It was reported that one of the victims was dragged to the ground and assaulted while the second victim was grabbed by another man. It is alleged the boys were placed into a room at a premises along the same road for an unknown period of time before they were released. One of the boys sustained bruises to his head and a broken finger.

A 26-year-old man from Bournemouth was arrested on suspicion of assault and false imprisonment and released under investigation. He has now been released from police investigation.

Detective Constable Joanne Poultney, of Bournemouth CID, said: "A detailed and thorough investigation was carried out following this reported incident. Neither of the victims are wishing to support the police investigation and as a result of this and our enquiries, the decision has been made that no further police action will be taken against the arrested man."
