# Aggravated burglary in Bournemouth â€“ witness appeal

09 January 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following an aggravated burglary in Bournemouth.

At around 9.30pm on Monday 8 January 2018 the resident of a flat in Lorne Park Road, a man aged in his 20s who was at the address with three friends, went to answer a knock on the door.

He looked through the spyhole and saw a black man standing outside carrying a knife. The four occupants of the property fled through a window as four black men forced their way into the address. It was reported that the men were carrying knives and hammers.

The four men left the property without taking anything.

One of the occupants was treated by the ambulance service for an injury to his toe sustained when leaving the flat through the window. No further injuries were sustained.

Detective Sergeant Andy Haworth, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We are making a number of enquiries into this incident and I am appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information that can assist our investigation.

"I understand this case follows reports of two other aggravated burglaries in the Bournemouth area and, at this stage, we do not believe any of the incidents are linked.

"I would like to reassure the public that in each case a detailed investigation is underway and we are making extensive enquiries to identify the offenders."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk, or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180003894. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
