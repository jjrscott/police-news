# Appeal for information following fatal collision in Weymouth

22 March 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for information and anyone with dashcam footage to come forward following a fatal collision in Weymouth.

Officers were called at 11.41am on Sunday 22 March 2020 to reports of a head-on collision on the A354 Weymouth Relief Road involving a white Nissan Micra and a white Mercedes.

Very sadly the driver of the Micra, a 54-year-old man from Yateley in Hampshire, suffered very serious injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene. A woman, who was also travelling in the car, sustained life-threatening injuries and was flown by air ambulance to Southampton General Hospital. Their families have been informed and the coroner notified.

The driver of the Mercedes, a man from Bagshot in Surrey and aged in his 50s, sustained minor injuries.

The road was closed between the Jurassic and Stadium roundabouts to allow emergency services to treat the casualties. It reopened just before 5.30pm.

Police Sergeant Lee Savage, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the man and woman's family at this very difficult time.

"I am aware there were a number of vehicles in the area at the time of the collision and I would appeal to anyone who either witnessed the incident, or the manner of driving of either vehicle prior to the collision, to please contact Dorset Police urgently.

"I am also keen to hear from any motorists who were in the area with dashcam fitted, as they may have captured footage that could be relevant to our investigation.

"Finally, I would like to thank the public for their patience and understanding while the road was closed. This allowed us to treat the casualties and carry out a full examination of the scene."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at scit@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 22:88. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
