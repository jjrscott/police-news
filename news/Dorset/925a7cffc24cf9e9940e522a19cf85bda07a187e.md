# Appeal for information after fatal powerboat collision in West Bay

26 June 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating the circumstances surrounding a fatal powerboat collision on behalf of the coroner are appealing for witnesses or anyone with video footage to come forward.

Dorset Police was called at 3.13pm on Sunday 24 June 2018 to reports that a powerboat had overturned after colliding with another powerboat off the coast of West Bay near Bridport.

Sadly, a 53-year-old man from Canterbury in Kent was pronounced dead at the scene. His next of kin have been informed.

A woman who was the co-pilot was taken to Dorset County Hospital as a precaution for treatment to shock. The two occupants of the other boat suffered minor injuries.

The collision occurred during an organised race event.

Detective Sergeant Dave Wise, of Dorset Police, said: "Our thoughts are with the man's family at this difficult time.

"We are now carrying out an investigation into the full circumstances of the incident on behalf of the coroner.

"The collision occurred at a very busy time of the day just off the West Bay coast and I am appealing to anyone who saw what happened or was perhaps filming the race at the time and has footage to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would like to thank everyone who has so far come forward to assist with the investigation."
