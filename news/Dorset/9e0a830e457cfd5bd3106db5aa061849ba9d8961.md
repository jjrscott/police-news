# Appeal for witnesses following serious injury collision in Gillingham

14 July 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a road incident that left a man with possible life-threatening injuries in Gillingham are appealing for witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage to come forward.

At approximately 2.45pm on Monday 13 July 2020 officers were called to a report of a collision involving a Ford Fiesta and a pedestrian in a car park on Marlott Road.

The pedestrian, a 78-year-old local man, sustained possible life-threatening injuries and was flown by air ambulance to Southampton General Hospital for treatment. His next of kin has been informed and they are being supported by officers.

The driver of the Ford was uninjured.

The car park was closed to the public to allow emergency services to deal with the incident.

Police Sergeant Nikki Burt, of the Serious Collision Investigation Team, said: "Officers from the roads policing team attended the scene to carry out a detailed investigation into the circumstances of the incident.

"I am appealing to any witnesses who may have seen either the vehicle or pedestrian prior to the incident, or who witnessed how the man sustained his injuries and has not already spoken to police, to please come forward.

"Finally, I would like to thank members of the public for their patience and understanding as the closures impacted on local amenities and services. These were absolutely necessary to allow the emergency services to treat the injured man and for us to carry out an examination of the scene."
