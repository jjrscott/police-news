# Stabbing in Boscombe â€“ witness appeal

02 May 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a man was stabbed in Boscombe.

Dorset Police was called by the ambulance service just before 8pm today, Wednesday 2 May 2018, to Windsor Road following reports that a man had sustained stab wounds to his upper body.

The injured man, who is aged in his 20s, was taken to Southampton General Hospital by air ambulance for emergency treatment. His condition is described as potentially life-threatening.

Officers carried out a search of the area but no arrests have been made.

A cordon is in place while a full examination of the scene is carried out.

Detective Inspector Neil Wright, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am keen to speak to anyone who was in the Windsor Road area at the relevant time and who may have witnessed the incident or seen someone or a group of people running away from the scene.

"We have not yet been able to speak to the victim to ascertain whether he knows who is responsible for this serious assault.

"I appreciate this incident is understandably concerning for local residents and I would like to reassure them that a full and thorough investigation is underway."

Anyone with community concerns is encouraged to approach officers from their local neighbourhood policing team who will be carrying out additional patrols over the coming days.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 2:449. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
