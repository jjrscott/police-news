* * *

Officers investigating an assault in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 6am on Thursday 30 August 2018 the victim, a woman aged in her 40s, was walking along Mercery Road when she was approached by an unknown man, who pushed her and pinned her to the floor.

The man asked her if she was 'Ellen' and when it was established that she was not, he fled the scene.

The victim was left with a number of grazes as a result of the incident.

The offender is described as white and aged in his 20s. He was wearing jeans and trainers.

Police Constable Matthew Love, of Weymouth police, said: "This incident has understandably left the victim shaken and we have been carrying out a number of enquiries to try and identify the man responsible.

"I am appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information about this assault to please contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180140033. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
