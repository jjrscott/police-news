# Witness appeal after street robbery in Bournemouth

28 November 2017

* * *

Detectives are appealing for information after a street robbery in Bournemouth.

The incident happened at around 9am today, Tuesday 28 November 2017, when the victim was walking through Fampoux Gardens between Firbank Road and Green Road.

The victim - a 29-year-old local man - was approached by another man near to a bench who asked the victim for the time. As he rolled up his sleeve, the offender grabbed the victim's hand and verbally threatened him, before taking the watch.

The offender then walked off toward Firbank Road and out of sight.

The stolen watch is described as a TAG Heuer Carrera with the serial number WAR201E. It was purchased in 2016 for around Â£1,700.

The victim was not physically injured in the incident.

The offender is described as a white man, five feet ten inches tall, aged in his late 20s and of thin build. He had very short brown hair and brown stubble. He was wearing a navy blue tracksuit top and bottoms.

Detective Sergeant Andy Haworth, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the incident or who has seen anyone acting suspiciously in the area to come forward.

"We have been making house to house and CCTV enquiries and investigations into the incident are ongoing."
