* * *

A man has been charged in connection to an alleged street robbery in Bournemouth.

The incident was reported to have happened at around 9pm on Wednesday 17 January 2018 on Christchurch Road near the junction with Wharncliffe Road.

It was reported that the victim - a local man aged in his 40s - was approached by two men who allegedly stole his wallet. There was a further allegation that a woman then came up to the victim, searched his pockets and took his mobile phone.

A 33-year-old Bournemouth man was charged with receiving stolen goods and is next due to appear at Bournemouth Crown Court on 22 February 2018.

Detectives continue to appeal for the Good Samaritan who returned the wallet to the victim to come forward. He is described as a black man and approximately 19 years old.
