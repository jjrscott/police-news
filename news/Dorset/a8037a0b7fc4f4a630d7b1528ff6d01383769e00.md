# CCTV appeal following commercial burglary in Poole

04 January 2021

* * *

Officers investigating a burglary at a store in Poole are issuing CCTV images of the suspects and appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

At around 9.35pm on Wednesday 16 December 2020 five men forced entry to The Entertainer toy store on Poole High Street and a safe containing cash was stolen.

Two of the suspects are believed to have left the scene in a vehicle parked near to Jacobs Reeves Solicitors on the High Street, with the other three getting into a black Volkswagen Tiguan that was parked to the rear of the toy store.

Police Constable Matt Cutler, of Dorset Police, said: "We are carrying out enquiries into this burglary and are keen to identify the men involved.

"I appreciate the CCTV is not the best quality and some of the suspects' faces are obscured, but I am appealing for anyone with information as to their identity to please come forward.

"I also hope the images might jog someone's memory and I would urge anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area of Poole High Street between around 9.25pm and 9.45pm on Wednesday 16 December 2020 to please contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200189235. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
