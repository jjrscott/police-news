# Witness appeal following fatal road traffic collision in Bournemouth

17 October 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a fatal road traffic collision in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage to come forward.

Dorset Police received a report at 9.38pm on Wednesday 16 October 2019 of a collision involving a grey Triumph motorcycle and a pedestrian on Ringwood Road, outside of the Turbary Retail Park.

Officers attended, along with the ambulance service, and road closures were put in place to allow the emergency services to respond to the incident.

Very sadly the pedestrian, a woman aged in her 60s from Bournemouth, was pronounced dead at the scene.

The motorcyclist, a man aged in his 50s from Poole, was taken by air ambulance to Southampton General Hospital with life-threatening injuries.

The family of those involved have been informed and are being supported by specially-trained officers.

Inspector Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the families of those involved at this difficult time and we owe it to them to carry out a thorough investigation to establish the full circumstances of this incident.

"I would urge any witnesses who have not already spoken to police to please contact us.

"I would also urge anyone who was in the area at the time and has dashcam fitted to their vehicle, or anyone who lives nearby and has a home CCTV system, to check their footage for anything relevant.

"From our enquiries we also believe there was a Honda Jazz in the vicinity at the time of this collision and we would be keen to speak to the occupants of this vehicle as they may be able to assist our investigation as witnesses.

"Finally, I would like to thank members of the public for their patience and understanding while the road closures were in place. These were absolutely necessary to allow the emergency services to respond and for officers to be able to safely carry out a detailed examination of the collision scene."
