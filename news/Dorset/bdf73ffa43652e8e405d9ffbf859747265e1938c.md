# Man due in court following reported assault at Bournemouth supermarket

01 August 2018

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with an alleged assault on a member of staff at a Bournemouth supermarket.

Officers were called at 3.43pm on Monday 5 February 2018 to reports of an assault on a member of staff at Asda in St Pauls Road.

The ambulance service also attended and a man aged in his 20s was treated for injuries to his mouth and ears. He was taken to hospital but released later that same day.

A 28-year-old man from Weymouth has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 3 August 2018 for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, two counts of assault by beating, affray, possession of a class A drug and possession of a class B drug.
