# Further information regarding murder investigation in Bournemouth

19 June 2020

* * *

Detectives are releasing further information in relation to the ongoing murder investigation following the death of a man in Bournemouth.

At 2.20am on Friday 19 June 2020 Dorset Police was called by the ambulance service to reports of a 46-year-old Bournemouth man having sustained stab wounds at an address in Eldon Place in the Westbourne area of the town. He sadly died at the scene.

A woman in her 40s and a teenage boy, both from Bournemouth, were taken to hospital with injuries. A 31-year-old man from Bournemouth was arrested on suspicion of murder, but was also taken to hospital. None of the injuries are believed to be life-threatening.

A post-mortem examination is due to take place this afternoon, Friday 19 June 2020.

Bournemouth Neighbourhood Inspector Jon Wasey said: "I would like to reassure the community that our Major Crime Investigation Team is continuing with a thorough investigation to establish the full circumstances of what happened. Early enquiries indicate that all those involved are part of a wider family group.

"Local people will see an increased police presence as officers are carrying out house-to-house visits and CCTV enquiries and the scene is being investigated. This should not impact on any of the businesses in the area.

"If anyone locally has concerns, please raise these with our neighbourhood policing team."

Detectives are still appealing for anyone who may have information in relation to the incident to please come forward.
