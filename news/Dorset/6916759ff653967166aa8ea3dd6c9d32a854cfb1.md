18 March 2019

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with the reported theft of two bicycles from a sports club in Bournemouth.

At around 5.45pm on Tuesday 4 September 2018 two men allegedly entered the grounds of the West Hants Club on Roslin Road South and used bolt croppers to cut the locks of two bikes.

Following enquiries by officers, a 28-year-old Bournemouth man has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 19 March 2019 for offences of theft.
