Police are appealing for witnesses after a fail-to-stop collision in Dorchester.

The incident happened at around 5pm on Friday 3 February 2017 at the junction of the A35 and the A352 turning for Wareham.

A black Peugeot 207 was in collision with a black Ford Mondeo. The Mondeo failed to stop at the scene.

The female driver of the Peugeot was uninjured, however the vehicle suffered significant damage and cannot be driven.

Police Constable Tim Gooding, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or is aware of a Mondeo that has recently sustained damage to come forward.

"I would also ask that the driver of the Mondeo makes themselves known to police so they can assist with the investigation."
