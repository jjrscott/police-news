# Update about traffic issues during triathlon event in Weymouth

11 September 2016

* * *

Officers in Weymouth and Dorchester would like to thank the public for their patience during the Ironman event.

The event has been taking place today, Sunday 11 September 2016, and is privately organised.

Throughout the day there have been road closures in place which are now being gradually lifted as the event comes to an end. The area around Warmwell is already being re-opened for motorists.

Weymouth Neighbourhood Inspector Pete Browning said: "I am very grateful for most people's patience throughout the event.

"Unfortunately, there have been a number of incidents of interference with road signs. This irresponsible behaviour has exacerbated some of the traffic problems.

"We are working together with organisers of this private event to return the affected areas to normal as soon as possible.

"In addition we will also discuss received feedback with organisers to avoid issues during future events."
