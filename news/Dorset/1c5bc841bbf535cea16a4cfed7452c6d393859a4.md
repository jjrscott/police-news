* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses after a man was shot in the leg with an air rifle in Poole.

The incident happened at around 5.20pm on Monday 30 January 2017 along Rossmore Road near to the junction with Brixey Road.

It was reported that the victim - a 23-year-old local man - was walking down the street in the direction of the Co-op, when a black Ford Fiesta with heavily tinted windows drove past him in the opposite direction.

The vehicle slowed down, made a U-turn and an air rifle appeared through one of the windows. A shot was fired and a bullet hit the victim on the back of the leg. The car drove off.

The victim made his own way to Poole Hospital for treatment. His injuries are not life-threatening.

Detective Inspector Wayne Seymour, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who may have seen a black Ford Fiesta with heavily tinted windows acting suspiciously in the area at the relevant time to contact police.

"Anyone with information as to the occupants or other information that can assist with the investigation should get in touch or call Crimestoppers anonymously."
