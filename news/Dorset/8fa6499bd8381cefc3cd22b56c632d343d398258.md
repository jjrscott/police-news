Detectives in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses following an attempted street robbery in the town.

The incident happened sometime between 8.30pm and 9.30pm on Wednesday 11 January 2017 outside The Cutter pub in East Street.

The victim aged in his 40s was riding his bicycle when he was pulled off the bike by a group of men who verbally abused him.

The offenders then demanded his running shoes, coat and his bicycle before throwing empty cans of drink at him and then stamping on him.
