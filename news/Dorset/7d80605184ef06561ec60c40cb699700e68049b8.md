Police are appealing for witnesses following a serious road traffic collision near Dorchester.

The two-vehicle collision happened at around 11.35am on Tuesday 14 March on an unclassified road between the West Stafford bypass and Crossways.

The collision involved a silver Nissan X-Trail, which was travelling west, and a white Iveco panel van travelling east.

The driver of the Nissan, a 77-year-old man from the local area, suffered serious life-threatening injuries and was airlifted to Southampton Hospital.

His front seat passenger, a 76-year-old woman also from the local area, deteriorated at the scene and was taken to Dorset County Hospital with serious injuries.

The van driver also suffered serious injuries and was taken to Dorset County Hospital.

The road has been closed between the West Stafford bypass and Frome Valley Road in Crossways to allow emergency services to deal with the incident and for the scene to be cleared.

Police Sergeant Jon Wren, of the traffic unit, said: "We would like to thank motorists for their patience and understanding while the road closures are in place.

"We would ask any witnesses to the collision to contact the police."
