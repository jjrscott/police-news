Detectives investigating an aggravated burglary in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police was called at 10.07pm on Thursday 19 March 2020 to a report of a group of men wearing balaclavas entering an address on St Peter's Road.

During the incident, it is reported that two of the men grabbed a man and held a knife to his throat.

"I understand this may cause concern within the community, but I would like to reassure residents that enquiries are ongoing and local officers can be approached with any concerns."
