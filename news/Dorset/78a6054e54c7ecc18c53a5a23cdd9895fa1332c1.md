# Summer drink driving campaign â€“ total of 64 people charged

17 July 2018

* * *

An additional 11 people have been charged with drink driving offences during Dorset Police's summer drink drive campaign.

They are due to appear at courts in Poole and Weymouth in July and August. In total 64 people were charged during the campaign.

The campaign ran from Friday 1 June 2018 to Monday 16 July 2018 to coincide with the World Cup.

Throughout the operation officers requested breath tests from all drivers involved in road traffic collisions, irrespective of whether or not they suspected a drink driving offence.

Motorists were also tested during routine stop checks and if they were stopped for any other driving offence.

As in previous campaigns, anyone charged with a drink driving related offence during the campaign have had their name and court appearance details released to the media.

If you suspect someone of drink driving, please call police immediately on 999 with the vehicle registration number and direction of travel.
