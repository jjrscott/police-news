Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a serious assault in the town which left a man with a fractured jaw.

At around 4am on Sunday 7 August 2016 the 19-year-old was getting some food at Bistro Pizza takeaway shop on Old Christchurch Road, opposite the junction of Stafford Road, when he was assaulted by two unknown men.

The offenders were said to be with two women.

The victim, who lives in Christchurch, was taken to the Royal Bournemouth Hospital and then Poole Hospital for treatment. He has since undergone surgery to two fractures in his jaw.

Detective Constable Matt Manners, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was a vicious assault which has left the victim requiring surgery.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the area of Old Christchurch Road in the early hours of Sunday morning and saw an altercation between two men to please contact Dorset Police so I can establish exactly what happened."
