Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a reported robbery in Dorchester.

The victim was reportedly knocked to the ground during the incident and sustained bruising to her hands and knees.

The suspect is described a white, aged in his 40s, tall and of skinny build. He left the scene along an alleyway near to Alexandra Terrace.
