# Witness appeal following robbery on elderly woman in Bournemouth

27 June 2019

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward after an elderly woman was pushed to the ground and robbed in Bournemouth.

The incident occurred at around 8.30pm yesterday, Wednesday 26 June 2019, in Montgomery Avenue at the junction with Cunningham Crescent.

The victim - a local woman aged in her 80s - was walking along the road with her personal shopping trolley when she was pushed from behind by two men. The victim fell to the ground and the offenders stole her purse containing cash, a bank card and a bus pass. The purse is described as pale blue with flowers on it.

Passing members of the public went to the victim's aid and called for help. She did not require medical treatment.

Both offenders are described as aged in their 20s. One was white and wore a baseball cap and had blond hair. The second offender is described by the victim as having a dark skin tone and had short black hair.

Detective Constable Marie Greer, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the relevant time and either saw or heard anything suspicious to please contact Dorset Police.

"From our enquiries we have established the victim had withdrawn a quantity of cash from the Post Office in Cunningham Crescent prior to the incident and I would like to hear from anyone who was in the store yesterday evening and saw two men acting suspiciously.

"Finally, if anyone sees a discarded purse matching the description given I would ask them not to touch it but call Dorset Police."

Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team can be approached with any community concerns.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk, or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190097107. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
