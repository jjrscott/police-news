# E-fit appeal after indecent exposure in Bournemouth

11 April 2018

* * *

Officers are releasing an e-fit of a suspect following a report of an indecent exposure in Bournemouth.

The incident happened at around 7.15pm on Thursday 22 March 2018 when the victim - a woman aged in her 30s - was running along Bournemouth promenade.

The victim saw a man standing in a gap between two beach huts between the West Cliff zig zag and lift. He was fully-clothed at the time. When the victim ran back in the opposite direction a short time later the man was still there, but this time he was indecently exposing himself.

The suspect is described as white, aged in his late 30s to early 40s with an athletic build. He had sandy-coloured hair, which was short and styled. He was clean shaven and wearing a round neck black jumper, a white T-shirt underneath and light denim jeans.

Police Constable Jo Morgan, of Bournemouth police, said: "This was a very disturbing incident for the victim to experience and I am now issuing an e-fit of the suspect compiled from her description.

"If anyone recognises this man please contact Dorset Police or call Crimestoppers anonymously.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who was in the area and has information that may assist with my investigation.

"Officers continue to patrol the area and the neighbourhood policing team can be contacted with any concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180043391. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
