# Appeal for information following burglary on Portland

19 August 2019

* * *

Officers investigating the theft of machinery from a quarry site on Portland are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Between 5.30pm on Friday 16 August 2019 and 7am on Saturday 17 August 2019 two breakers for diggers were stolen from a quarry site off Easton Lane.

Police Constable Tom Arnold, of Weymouth police, said: "These pieces of equipment are worth several thousand pounds and it is likely the offenders would have required a trailer or large machinery to remove them from the site.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area on the night of Friday 16 August 2019 to contact us. I would also urge anyone who was driving in the vicinity and has dashcam fitted to their vehicle to check their footage for anything relevant."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190128561. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
