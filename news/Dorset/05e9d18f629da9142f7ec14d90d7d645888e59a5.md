Officers investigating a reported assault in Bournemouth say a man has come forward following an earlier CCTV appeal.

At around 11.15pm on Friday 1 February 2019 a verbal altercation occurred between two men off Westover Road. It is reported one of the men then headbutted the other.

The victim - a man aged in his 20s from the Oxfordshire area - sustained bruising and swelling to his forehead. He did not require medical treatment.

Offices issued a CCTV appeal today, Wednesday 13 February 2019, of a man they wished to speak to in connection with the incident. A man has now come forward and is helping officers with their investigation.
