# Street robbery in Bournemouth - witness appeal

06 December 2017

* * *

Detectives are appealing for information after a man was robbed in Bournemouth.

The incident happened just before 1am today, Wednesday 6 December 2017, on Lowther Road.

The victim - a 40-year-old local man - withdrew cash from a cashpoint outside Tesco Express on Charminster Road, before cycling toward Lowther Road.

As he turned into Lowther Road, he was pushed off his bicycle by two men and pinned to the ground. One of the men went through his pockets and stole his mobile phone and wallet containing cash and cards before the pair made off.

The victim suffered bruising to his ribs, but did not require hospital treatment.

Detective Sergeant Stewart Gates, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or saw any suspicious activity either near to the cashpoint or in the area of the robbery to please come forward.

"We are making a number of enquiries to see if any of the suspects were captured on CCTV and investigations are ongoing."
