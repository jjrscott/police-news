# Witness appeal after large fire at property in Beaminster

15 April 2017

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward after a suspicious fire at a property in Beaminster.

Police were called by Dorset and Wiltshire Fire Service at 4.10am today, Saturday 15 April 2017, to reports of a large fire at Parnham House.

Officers attended to assist the fire service while they tackled the extensive blaze.

The house suffered a significant amount of damage. The fire service continue to dampen down the property.

At this stage it is not believed anyone was inside the property at the time of the fire. A full search will be carried out once it is safe to do so.

The property is likely to be cordoned off for some time to allow investigators to examine the scene.

Detective Inspector Andrea Power, of Weymouth CID, said: "An investigation is currently underway to establish the cause and the circumstances around the blaze.

"We are treating the fire as suspicious and I would appeal to anyone who may have witnessed any suspicious activity in the area around the early hours of this morning to please contact police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 15:69. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestopeers-uk.org.
