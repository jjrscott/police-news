# Update – man appears in court in relation to reported distraction theft in Bournemouth

24 October 2019

* * *

A man has been charged and has appeared in court in connection with a reported distraction theft in Bournemouth town centre.

It was reported that at around 3.45pm on Friday 27 September 2019 a man aged in his 60s was approached by a group of men in Old Christchurch Road. He was allegedly distracted by one of the group and the contents of his shopping trolley was stolen.

The trolley contained a quantity of cash, a black Citizen leather watch strap, a bank card, a bus pass, a notebook and pens.

Following enquiries by officers, a 37-year-old man from New Milton was arrested and charged with theft. He appeared at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 18 October 2019 and entered a guilty plea.

He was sentenced to two months in prison and ordered to pay £180 compensation to the victim. The defendant also admitted a breach of a suspended sentence order and was sentenced to a further two months in prison.

Enquiries are ongoing to identify the other men believed to be involved in the incident.
