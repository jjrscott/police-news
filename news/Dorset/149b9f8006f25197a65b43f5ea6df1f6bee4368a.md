# Witness appeal after street robbery in Bournemouth

07 June 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses after a street robbery in Bournemouth.

The incident happened at around 11.30am on Wednesday 6 June 2018 on Clifton Road.

The victim - a Bournemouth woman aged in her 30s - was walking along the road when she was pushed and had her handbag stolen.

The offender then made off from the scene toward the seafront.

The victim discovered her handbag had been discarded further down the road, but her bank card was missing. She contacted her bank and cancelled the card and it is not believed the card had been used.

She suffered a minor shoulder injury during the incident.

The offender is described of skinny build and around five feet seven inches tall wearing a light grey hooded top with the hood pulled up, dark grey tracksuit bottoms and black trainers. It is not known whether the offender was male or female.

Detective Constable Dave Pearce, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We are making active enquiries in order to identify the offender.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident, or saw someone acting suspiciously in the area at the time of the offence, to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180086447. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
