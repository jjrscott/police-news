Officers investigating a fail-to-stop collision in Weymouth are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

It was reported that at around 3.30am on Sunday 1 December 2019 a grey van, believed to be a Volkswagen Transporter, was involved in a collision with three parked vehicles in Old Castle Road. The van failed to stop at the scene of the collision.

Police Constable Carl Wood, of Weymouth police, said: "The van has caused considerable damage to the parked vehicles and is also likely to have sustained significant damage itself to the front wing and front bumper as well as the rear bumper.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have either witnessed the van or caught it on dashcam or home CCTV around the time of the incident to please contact us.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who is aware of a vehicle matching the description given that has been damaged in unexplained circumstances since the early hours of Sunday 1 December."
