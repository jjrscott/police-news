# Witness appeal after attempted robbery in Christchurch

28 July 2016

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information following an attempted robbery in Christchurch.

The incident happened at around 5.25pm on Wednesday 27 July 2016 on a gravel track that runs through Mudeford Wood alongside the Somerford Bridge Sports Ground.

The victim, a local woman aged in her 20s, was walking her dog alone when she was approached from behind. A man took hold of the dog's lead and attempted to take the dog.

The victim refused to let go and the offender punched the victim twice in the face causing a black eye and damage to her cheekbone.

The offender is described as a white man aged in his late 20s, around five feet seven inches tall and of slim to medium build. He had dark hair and stubble. He was wearing a dark-coloured hooded top with the hood up. The man also appeared to have tattoos covering his right forearm.

Detective Constable Will Pearce, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was a cowardly attack on a lone woman during broad daylight.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the incident or seen a man acting suspiciously in the area either before or after the offence.

"I would also like to reassure the public that our Neighbourhood Policing Team has stepped up patrols in the area and can be contacted with any immediate concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55160113116.
