# Appeal after aggravated burglary in Bournemouth

08 January 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses after an aggravated burglary in Bournemouth.

The incident happened at around 8pm on Wednesday 3 January 2018 in the area of Yelverton Road.

The victim - a man aged in his 30s - was returning to his home address when he noticed a white vehicle nearby with one black man sat in the driver's seat and one white man at the rear of the vehicle.

As the victim opened his front door, the two men approached him and prevented him from closing the door.

They entered the property and demanded money from the victim. The white offender punched the victim repeatedly and at one point was threatening him with a knife.

During a struggle, the victim received small cuts to his left hand from the blade. He also suffered facial injuries.

The offenders made off in an unknown direction. Nothing was stolen.

The white offender is described as aged in his late 20s, around five feet eleven inches tall and of stocky build. He had a round face and was clean shaven and was wearing a black beanie hat and black hooded zip top.

The black offender is described as aged in his mid-20s, around six feet tall and of average build. He had a full beard and was wearing a grey hooded jacket pulled over his head.

Detective Inspector Neil Wright, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We are making active enquiries in order to locate the offenders and due to the incident happening in a busy part of town, we are appealing to anyone who saw anything suspicious around the time of the incident to come forward.

"CCTV enquiries are ongoing and we are currently speaking to local residents and businesses to see whether anyone has information that could assist with the investigation."
