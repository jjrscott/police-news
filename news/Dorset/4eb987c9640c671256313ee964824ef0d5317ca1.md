# Appeal for information after woman bitten by dog in Poole

27 May 2020

* * *

Officers investigating an incident where a woman was bitten by a dog in Poole are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

The victim, a woman aged in her 50s, was cycling along the Sterte Esplanade at around 1pm on Sunday 24 May 2020 when she was approached by a white dog, believed to be a standard Poodle or similar breed. The dog started attacking her leg and bit her.

The victim shouted over to a woman, who she believed to be the dog's owner. She came over and said she could not believe the dog would bite her and walked off without apologising or leaving her details.

The woman is described as white, aged in her 70s and around five feet five inches tall with short dark blonde curly hair. She was wearing a beige-coloured jacket and trousers and carrying a pale blue ball thrower.

The victim was left with a bite mark to her leg and was given a course of antibiotics.

Police Constable Jennie Sykes-Martin, of Dorset Police, said: "We are carrying out enquiries into this incident and I would urge anyone who was in the area and witnessed it to please contact us.

"I would also urge the owner of the dog involved to do the right thing and come forward so we can take your account."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200073660. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
