# Witness appeal following reported robbery in Bournemouth

13 January 2020

* * *

Detectives investigating a reported robbery in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 11.20pm on Saturday 11 January 2020 a man had arranged to meet a woman on St John's Road at the junction with Cecil Road. When he met her, it is alleged that two men approached the man and grabbed him by the chest while holding a knife.

It is reported that one of the men demanded money from the victim and stole his wallet from his trouser pocket.

The victim - a local man aged in his 40s - sustained a cut to his hand.

A 39-year-old man of no fixed abode was arrested on suspicion of robbery. He has been released on police bail pending further enquiries. A 42-year-old Bournemouth woman was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit robbery and has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

A second man - aged 40 and from Bournemouth - has also been arrested on suspicion of robbery. He is currently assisting detectives with their enquiries.

Detective Constable Michelle Lawrence, of Bournemouth CID, said: "Following initial enquiries, I believe there were a number of people in the area at the time.

"I would urge anyone who witnessed the incident and has not yet spoken to police to please come forward."
