Detectives investigating a reported assault and public order incident in Poole are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police received a report at 11.51pm on Thursday 16 July 2020 of a fight involving a group of people in the area of Ashley Cross Green.

Officers attended shortly afterwards and the altercation was no longer taking place. Two men - a 19-year-old from Poole and 32-year-old from Bournemouth - were found near to the scene with facial injuries. The older man also had a cut to his head and was taken to hospital for treatment.

Following enquiries, a 33-year-old man from Bournemouth was arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm and violent disorder, a 23-year-old man from Bournemouth was arrested on suspicion of violent disorder and an 18-year-old Poole man was arrested on suspicion of affray and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. All three are assisting officers with their enquiries.

Detective Sergeant Stefanie Belton, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We are continuing to investigate this matter and I would urge anyone with information that might assist us to please come forward.

"I understand there were a number of people in the area at the time and I am keen to hear from any witnesses or anyone who may have taken mobile phone footage of the incident."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200104406.
