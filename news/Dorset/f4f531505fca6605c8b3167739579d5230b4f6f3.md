# CCTV appeal following theft of bank card and subsequent fraudulent use

26 February 2021

* * *

Officers investigating the theft of a bank card and its subsequent fraudulent use are issuing two images of a man they would like to speak to.

Sometime between Wednesday 13 January and Friday 15 January 2021 the victim lost her bank card. She noticed it was missing on Friday 15 January, checked her bank account online and realised her card has been used to pay for online gambling transactions totalling Â£930\. It was also used in three shops in Boscombe.

Police Community Support Investigator Steph Garner, of Bournemouth police, said: "As part of my enquiries I have obtained CCTV images of a man we would like to speak to and I would ask anyone who recognises him to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210011310. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
