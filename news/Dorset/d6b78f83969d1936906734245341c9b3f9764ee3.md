# Dorset Police signs partnership agreement with local BID to support business community

15 February 2018

* * *

Dorset Police has entered into a partnership with the Ferndown and Uddens Business Improvement District (BID), which will help to build community safety on the industrial estates and in the wider area.

The partnership will see the BID fund an electric vehicle for use by the Neighbourhood Policing Team (NPT) to provide additional high visibility patrols within the community.

Space within the Ferndown Industrial Estate has also been provided as a remote working base for the NPT, as well as a contribution to support the Force’s drone team.

The base on the industrial estate will be used by Dorset Police to train officers in using new drone technology and equipment, while also providing additional aerial patrols of the area to ensure it continues to be a safe place for businesses to operate.

Cheyne Marley, Regeneration and Business Liaison Inspector, said: “This is a unique approach and Ferndown & Uddens BID have given us the opportunity to maximise the deployment of high visibility patrols in the area with a new vehicle and office space.

“As we expand the number of officers trained to search using innovative drone technology, it is great that the BID has also been able to support us to achieve new ways of working.

“It is hoped this approach could be mirrored in other areas of Dorset as a way of working more closely with our local businesses and providing community reassurance in the future.”

Russell Bowyer, Chairman of the Ferndown & Uddens BID, said: “This agreement heralds a new and closer relationship between the police and the business community.

"We hope that this relationship, together with other local initiatives, will help make our industrial estates an even safer location.”

The Partnership has been actively supported by the County’s Police and Crime Commissioner, Martyn Underhill. He said: “Keeping our communities safe requires the input of a host of organisations, including local businesses. Not only do they provide valuable information and intelligence, they are also able to give an insight into initiatives running in the business world that could be beneficial to policing.

“I am pleased to support this partnership with the Ferndown and Uddens BID. Working closer together will enable us to identify issues and develop solutions that will have a positive impact for residents across East Dorset.”
