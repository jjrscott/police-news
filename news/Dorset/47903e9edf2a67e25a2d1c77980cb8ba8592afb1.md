# Update – CCTV appeal following reported theft of cash in Bournemouth

18 September 2019

* * *

A woman has come forward in relation to a reported theft in Bournemouth.

At approximately 9.15am on Wednesday 11 September 2019 a quantity of cash was withdrawn from a cashpoint outside the Boscombe Superstore on Christchurch Road.

The person who withdrew the money became distracted and did not know that the transaction was successful. They entered the store without collecting their £100 withdrawal.

It is believed someone then reportedly took the money from the cashpoint.

A CCTV appeal was issued to identify two women as they may have information about the cash. A woman from Bournemouth aged in her 30s has come forward in relation to the reported theft and is assisting officers with their enquiries. No arrests have been made.
