# Appeal for witnesses following attempted robbery in Dorchester

11 March 2021

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following an attempted robbery in Dorchester.

At around 2.25pm on Tuesday 9 March 2021 Dorset Police received a report that a 17-year-old boy had been assaulted in an alleyway near to Tesco on Weymouth Avenue.

It is reported that he walked past two men who demanded his wallet. When the victim refused to hand it over, he was punched to the face.

The male offenders are described as being around 18 or 19 years old. One was described as approximately six feet tall and of slim build wearing a surgical face mask. The second man is described as wearing a black face mask and was shorter in height.

The victim sustained an injury to his nose and lip and attended hospital for treatment.

Police Constable James Curtis-Burchett, of Dorchester police, said: "An investigation is underway into this incident and I am appealing to anyone who was in the area and witnessed what happened to please get in touch.

"I would urge any motorists who were in the vicinity around the relevant time and have a dashcam fitted to their vehicle to please check it for any footage that may assist my enquiries."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210038253. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
