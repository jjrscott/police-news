# Man arrested following CCTV appeal after collision in Bournemouth

15 May 2018

* * *

A man has been arrested following a CCTV appeal after a road traffic collision in Bournemouth.

At 10.09am today, Tuesday 15 May 2018, Dorset Police was called by the ambulance service to reports of a collision in West Way involving a silver Citroen Saxo.

It was reported that the Saxo left the road and collided with a tree. The driver, a 22-year-old local man, sustained what is described as potentially life-threatening and life-changing injuries and was airlifted to Southampton General Hospital for emergency treatment. His family has been informed.

The road remained closed while collision investigators examined the scene.

Officers issued a CCTV image of a black Vauxhall Astra that was believed to have been travelling along West Way at the time of the collision.

A 42-year-old Bournemouth man has now come forward and was arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and is assisting police with enquiries. A black Vauxhall Astra has since been recovered.

Officers would like to thank everyone who has responded to the earlier appeal.
