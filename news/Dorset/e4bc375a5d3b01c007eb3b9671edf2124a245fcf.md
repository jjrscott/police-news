# Witness appeal following suspected arson in Poole

20 August 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following a suspected arson at a garage in Poole.

At around 1.45am on Sunday 19 August 2018 Dorset Police officers on patrol came across firefighters tackling a blaze outside the Library Road Garage in Library Road.

It is believed the fire had started at around 12.20am and was caused deliberately by setting a pile of tyres outside the garage alight. The fire spread to a parked car nearby and the garage itself, causing significant damage.

Nobody was inside the premises at the time of the incident.

Detective Constable Joanne Poultney, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We have carried out a number of enquiries into this incident including house to house, examination of the scene and exploring CCTV opportunities.

"As part of our ongoing investigation I am appealing to anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area around the time of the incident to contact police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180133631. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
