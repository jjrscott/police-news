# E-fit appeal after indecent exposure near Dorchester

05 April 2018

* * *

Officers investigating an indecent exposure near Dorchester are releasing an e-fit of the suspect.

The incident happened at around 10.15am on Saturday 17 March 2018 as the victim - a woman aged in her 50s - was walking her dog in Puddletown Forest.

She had got lost and flagged down a passing cyclist to ask for directions. As the man was giving her directions he indecently exposed himself.

The victim walked away from the man and as she tried to get her phone out he got back on his bicycle and rode off at speed.

The victim was not physically injured in the incident.

The offender is described as white, with dark hair that was starting to turn grey and aged in his 40s. He was of average build and was wearing glasses with a silver frame, black Lycra cycling trousers with a yellow strip down the sides, a dark-coloured long-sleeved cycle zip up top, dark shoes and dark-coloured gloves. He was also wearing a black cycling helmet.

The bicycle was described as a mountain bike with a purple frame.

Police Constable James Curtis, of Dorchester police, said: "This incident has understandably left the victim shaken and I am now in a position to issue an e-fit of the suspect.

"I would ask that anyone who may recognise the man from the image to please contact Dorset Police or call Crimestoppers anonymously.

"Officers have stepped up patrols in the area over the last few weeks and anyone with concerns can contact the neighbourhood policing team."
