21 May 2019

* * *

A man has come forward following a CCTV appeal in relation to an alleged assault on a member of staff at a fast food restaurant in Ferndown.

It was reported that at around 3.25am on Sunday 5 May 2019 a man who appeared to be intoxicated entered McDonald's in Ringwood Road carrying an open bottle of wine.

When challenged by the duty manager he reportedly became aggressive toward staff. After being locked out of the premises, he is alleged to have gone round to the drive through window and punched a female member of staff in the face.

Following a CCTV appeal issued by officers to identify the suspect, a man has come forward and is assisting police with their enquiries. No arrests have been made.
