Officers investigating a reported fail-to-stop collision in East Dorset have made a further arrest.

At 1.09am on Sunday 19 August 2018 Dorset Police was called to reports that a woman had been hit by a car as she crossed Ringwood Road, St Leonards.

The injured woman - aged in her 30s and from Ringwood - sustained serious but not life-threatening injuries and was taken to Poole Hospital for treatement.

The car reported to have been involved in the collision was described as a dark-coloured Volkswagen Golf and failed to stop at the scene.

A VW Golf was discovered a short distance from the scene and has been seized.

A 27-year-old Ringwood man has been arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and failing to stop after a road accident and has been released under investigation.

A 23-year-old Blandford man who was previously arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender has now been released without charge.

Police Constable Mark Burton, of the traffic unit, said: "We are still keen to hear from any witnesses or anyone with any information who has not already spoken to police.

"We are also continuing to appeal for anyone who was travelling in the area at the time to check if they have any relevant dashcam footage."
