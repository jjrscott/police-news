# Family appeal for missing elderly man believed to be in Dorset

19 April 2017

* * *

The cousin of a missing man who is believed to be in Dorset is appealing for the public's help to find him.

Michael Asher, aged 82 and from Maidenhead in Berkshire, was last seen at around lunchtime on Friday 31 March 2017 when he boarded a train, having bought a ticket to Poole.

Michael is described as white, six feet tall, of slim build and bald. He is known to dress smartly and wear a baseball cap.

Thames Valley Police launched a missing person investigation to find Michael, which has now been taken over by Dorset Police.

Subsequent enquiries have established that Michael arrived in Poole and has been travelling around the county on buses since that date, in particular Bournemouth, Poole and Swanage.

He has been known to frequent churches and synagogues. The last unconfirmed sighting of him was at a soup kitchen in Bournemouth.

Michael's cousin Pat Goodsave, said: "Michael's disappearance is very out of character, he enjoys his home comforts and in particular maintaining his garden.

"Michael please get in touch, I'm just so worried about you and want to know where you are."
