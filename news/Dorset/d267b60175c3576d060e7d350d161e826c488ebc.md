# Witness appeal following series of breaks to outbuildings in Purbeck area

06 February 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses and reminding the public to be vigilant following a series of breaks to outbuildings in the Purbeck area.

Sometime between 5pm on Friday 27 January and 9am on Monday 30 January 2017, two sheds and two metal storage units were broken into at Holton Lee. Nothing was stolen.

A second incident occurred between 8pm on Sunday 29 January and 5pm on Monday 30 January 2017 when a container at Sandford Holiday Park in Poole was broken into. Two Stihl hedge trimmers, two leaf blowers, a chainsaw and other items were stolen.

Overnight on Monday 20 January 2017 a storage container was broken into in Wareham Road. The incident was discovered at 8am the following morning. Nothing was stolen.

Officers are also investigating a further nine similar incidents in the area that have occurred since Friday 23 December 2016 and believe the offences may be linked.

No arrests have been made.

Police Community Support Officer Mike Gowans, of Purbeck police, said: "In most of these incidents the offenders have cut through the padlocks that were securing the outbuildings and containers.

"I would urge anyone with information about who is responsible for these crimes to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who has seen similar items offered for sale locally in unusual circumstances.

"Finally, I would like to remind residents and businesses to ensure they keep their storage containers and outbuildings secure and report any suspicious activity to Dorset Police immediately."
