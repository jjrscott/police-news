A man is due to appear in court in connection with an alleged armed robbery near Sherborne.

At around 12.30pm on Tuesday 9 January 2018 Dorset Police received a report of an armed robbery at the Spar store in Yetminster.

It was reported that a man armed with a knife jumped over the counter and stole the till drawer before making off in a blue vehicle. The vehicle was seen to drive off along Thornford Road in the direction of Chetnole.

The till drawer was later recovered near to the scene in Stonyacres.

A 39-year-old man from Yeovil has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Friday 23 March 2018 for an offence of robbery.

A 32-year-old woman, also from Yeovil, who was arrested on suspicion of robbery remains released under investigation.
