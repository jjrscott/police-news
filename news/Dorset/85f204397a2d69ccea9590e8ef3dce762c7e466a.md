# Witness appeal after fail-to-stop collision in Christchurch

31 May 2016

* * *

Police are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following a fail-to-stop collision in Christchurch.

The incident happened at around 7.20pm on Sunday 29 May 2016 in The Grove between a motorcycle and a car.

The motorcyclist - a 17-year-old boy - was thrown from his bike and slid down the road. He suffered minor grazing and bruising to his arm and leg and did not require hospital treatment.

The driver of the car failed to stop at the scene.

Police Constable Mark Palmer, of Dorset Police's Traffic Unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or manner of driving of either vehicle prior to the incident to contact me.

"Only minimal details of the car are known, but it is believed to be white, similar to a Citroen DS3, with a red and green stripe on the roof."

Witnesses and anyone with information should call Dorset Police in confidence on 101 quoting occurrence number 55160081423. Alternatively, call the free and anonymous Crimestoppers line on 0800 555 111 where mobile phone tariffs may apply.
