# Serious injury collision near Dorchester â€“ witness appeal

23 September 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward following a serious injury collision near Dorchester.

Dorset Police was called at 2.41pm on Wednesday 23 September 2020 to a report of a single vehicle collision involving a blue Ford Transit panel van that was travelling north on the Old Sherborne Road near to the Giants Head Caravan and Camping Park in Cerne Abbas.

The driver of the van - a Weymouth man aged in his 50s - sustained serious injuries and was taken to Dorset County Hospital for treatment. His condition is described as life-threatening and his next of kin has been informed.

The road was closed to allow emergency services to carry out a detailed examination of the scene. The closures were lifted at around 5.20pm.

Police Sergeant Rhys Griffiths, of the traffic unit, said: "An investigation is underway into this collision and I am appealing for any witnesses who have not already spoken to police to please get in touch.

"I would also urge any motorists who were travelling in the area and have dashcam fitted to their vehicle to check for any relevant footage to assist my enquiries.

"Finally, I would like to thank the public for their assistance while the road closures were in place as these were absolutely necessary to allow emergency services to deal with the incident."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 23:212. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
