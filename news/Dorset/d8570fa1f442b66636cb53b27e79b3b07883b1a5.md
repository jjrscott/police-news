# Arrests during day of action on countyâ€™s roads

15 January 2019

* * *

A day of action on the roads saw officers target those suspected of posing a high risk to fellow road users.

Officers from the traffic unit teamed up with local officers from neighbourhood policing teams to carry out the day of intensification in the Dorchester and Weymouth areas on Monday 14 January 2019.

A total of four motorists were arrested on suspicion of drug driving and a further driver was arrested on suspicion of driving while unfit through drink or drugs.

More than 30 vehicles were stopped during the day, with seven further motorists reported for minor offences such as careless driving and vehicle defects while a man wanted in connection with a burglary in another force area was also among those pulled over. One person was also given a penalty notice for possession of cannabis.

Inspector Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "This day of intensification was part of our proactive efforts targeting those we suspect of posing a risk to other road users in a bid improve the safety of the county's roads.

"As well as targeting those suspected of committing driving offences, the stopping of such a large number of vehicles also helps identify individuals linked to other types of crime and helps local policing teams build their wider intelligence picture in relation to issues such as county lines drug networks.

"We are planning more of these operations across the county and our Op Dragoon initiative will continue to identify those suspected of being high risk road users.

"This proactive work also relies on information from members of the public to help identify individuals suspected of regularly driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

"Anyone with information can visit www.dorset.police.uk, email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or call 101. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org. If you suspect someone is driving under the influence, dial 999 immediately."
