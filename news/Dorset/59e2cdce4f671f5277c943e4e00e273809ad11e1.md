# Witness appeal following road traffic collision in Bournemouth

20 July 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a serious road traffic collision in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

At 8.39am on Monday 20 July 2020 Dorset Police received a report of a collision at the Redhill roundabout.

The incident involved a grey Ford Mondeo, driven by a 53-year-old man, and an electrical pedal cycle, ridden by a 39-year-old woman. Both are from the Bournemouth area.

The air ambulance attended, but the woman was taken to hospital by land ambulance with a serious injury.

Police Constable Mark Palmer, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing for any witnesses to the collision who have not spoken with officers yet to come forward.

"Also, I urge anyone with dashcam footage that might assist our investigation to please get in touch.

"I would like to thank motorists for their patience while we had to close the road to allow emergency services to attend the incident."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 20:78. Alternatively, or alternatively to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
