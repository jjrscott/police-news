# Witness appeal following assault in Wareham

18 December 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following an assault in Wareham.

At around 11.15pm on Friday 15 December 2017 the victim, a 16-year-old boy, walked down North Street and passed Rapid Fit and Purbeck MG when a vehicle pulled up and a man got out.

The man approached the victim and punched him in the ribs and then pushed him over, causing the boy to bang his head on the ground. The man then got back into his vehicle, which drove off toward Wareham town centre.

The victim did not sustain any injuries that required hospital treatment.

The offender was described as white, aged around 24 and with a beard. He was driving a silver estate car, possibly an Audi or a BMW.

Police Constable Tom Renshaw, of Purbeck police, said: "While he did not sustain any injuries, the victim was understandably left shaken by this incident and we are making a number of enquiries to identify the offender.

"I would ask any witnesses to the incident, or anyone who saw a vehicle matching the description given in the area around the time of the incident to please contact police.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who may have dashcam or CCTV footage that may have captured the incident."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170194484. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
