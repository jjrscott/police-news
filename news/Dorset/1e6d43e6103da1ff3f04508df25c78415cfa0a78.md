# Witness appeal following reported armed robbery in Bournemouth

31 January 2017

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses following a reported armed robbery at a jewellers in Bournemouth.

Police were called at 4.27pm today, Tuesday 31 January 2017, to reports of an armed robbery at Franses Jewellers on Westover Road in Bournemouth.

It was reported that two men entered the store and threatened members of staff with handguns.

It is then alleged that an unknown quantity of items were stolen from the store before the pair made off in a black Ford Focus.

The vehicle was later recovered on the A338 near to the Blackwater Junction. Police closed one lane of the Spur Road while recovery of the vehicle took place.

It is not thought at this stage that anyone was physically injured during the incident.

Two men both aged 24 and a 30-year-old woman have been arrested on suspicion of robbery and are currently assisting officers with their enquiries.

Detective Inspector Andy Bell, of Bournemouth CID, said: "It has not yet been established whether the handguns reportedly used during the incident were real or imitation.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident at Franses Jewellers, or has any information that would help me with my investigation, to please get in contact.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who saw a black Ford Focus with registration number BG05 OJU being driven between Westover Road and the A338 Blackwater Junction at the relevant time."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 31:278. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
