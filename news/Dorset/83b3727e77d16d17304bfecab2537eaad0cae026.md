Officers investigating reports of a robbery in Shaftesbury are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward.

The incident happened at around 2pm on Wednesday 3 May 2017 in the Angel Lane car park.

The victim, a local man in his 30s, was approached by a teenage boy who struck him to the face before taking a bag - which was on the victim's shoulder - and leaving the scene.

The bag contained several electrical items including a laptop and a mobile telephone.

The offender is described as white, of slim build, around 15 to 18 years old, between five feet three inches and five feet eight inches tall and with shaggy, greasy and medium-length brown hair.

He had an ear stretcher in one of his ears and was wearing a black or navy jacket or coat with three white stripes down both arms and red panels on both sides in the lower back area as well as brown or green combat trousers.

Police Constable Dave Pearce, of North Dorset police, said: "I would ask anyone who witnessed this incident or who saw someone fitting the description running through the High Street or Bell Street in Shaftesbury around the time of this incident to please contact me."
