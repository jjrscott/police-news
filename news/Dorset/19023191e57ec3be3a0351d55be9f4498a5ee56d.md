# Witness appeal following serious collision near Bridport

15 November 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a serious road traffic collision near Bridport are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The incident happened at 9.40am on Sunday 15 November 2020 on the Coast Road near to the junction of Cogden Beach car park.

It involved a red Citroen Berlingo, driven by a local man in his 70s, travelling eastbound toward Weymouth and a red Ford Focus, driven by a local woman in her 20s, going in the opposite direction.

Police, fire and ambulance services attended and a road closure was put in place.

All occupants - a driver and a passenger in each vehicle - were taken to Dorset County Hospital. The injuries of the passenger of the Citroen are described as life-changing. Everyone else sustained minor injuries.

Police Sergeant Lee Savage, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing for any witnesses to the collision or the manner of driving of either vehicle beforehand who have not spoken with police yet to please come forward.

"Also, I would like to hear from anyone who might have relevant dashcam footage.

"I am grateful for motorists' patience affected by the road closure that had to be put in place, which allowed emergency services to attend the incident."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200172156. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
