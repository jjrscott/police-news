# Witness appeal following burglary in Verwood

24 November 2016

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a burglary in Verwood.

Sometime between 5pm on Monday 21 November and 8.50am on Tuesday 22 November 2016 offenders gained access to the garage of a property on Manor Road near to the roundabout which connects Pennine Way and Burnbake Road.

A number of items were stolen including a Landmaster chainsaw, a yellow plate hammer with a Honda motor and a red Trueshopping brushcutter.

Detective Inspector Neil Wright, of Bournemouth CID, said: "From our enquiries we believe the offenders would have spent some time gaining access to the garage.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious in Manor Road at the relevant time to contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who has seen these items for sale in unusual circumstances."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 22:88. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
