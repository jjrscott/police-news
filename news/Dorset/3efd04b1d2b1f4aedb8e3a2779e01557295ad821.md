Seven people have been arrested after warrants under the Misuse of Drugs Act were carried out in Weymouth.

Detectives working with the local Neighbourhood Policing Team executed warrants at three addresses in the town on Thursday 30 March.

Searches were carried out at properties in West Street, East Street and in the Preston Road area.

A quantity of suspected class A drugs was discovered and has been seized.

A 25-year-old man from London and a 21-year-old woman from London have been arrested on suspicion of possession of class A drugs and being concerned in the supply of class A drugs.

A 32-year-old man from Kent, a 23-year-old woman from London and three Weymouth men - aged 34, 40 and 43 - have also been arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of class A drugs.

All of those arrested have been released on police bail until the middle of June 2017.

Detective Constable Amanda Pierce, of Weymouth CID, said: "This was a joint operation involving CID and the Neighbourhood Policing Team.
