Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a vehicle reportedly failed to stop for police.

At around 8.56pm yesterday, Wednesday 31 October 2017, officers were called to reports of a suspicious vehicle at Sandford Holiday Park in Organford Road, Holton Heath.

Officers attended and at around 9.15pm it is alleged that a white Volkswagen Golf failed to stop for officers on the A35 by Upton Country Park.

The vehicle was abandoned in Creekmoor Park and Ride and two occupants were reportedly seen to run away.

A 25-year-old man from Eastbourne was arrested on suspicion dangerous driving, failing to stop for police, assaulting an officer in the execution of their duty, possession of drugs and money laundering offences. He remains assisting officers with their enquiries.

Officers carried out a search of the area for the second occupant, assisted by the NPAS Helicopter, but no one was found.

Detective Constable Adam Pilton, of Weymouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the relevant time to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am keen to hear from any motorists who witnessed the manner of driving of the Golf. I would particularly like to speak to the drivers of a white Vauxhall or Seat and a Vauxhall Astra or similar vehicle who were travelling along the A35 in the Upton area and may have witnessed the incident."
