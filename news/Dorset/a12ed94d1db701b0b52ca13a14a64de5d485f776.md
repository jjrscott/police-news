# Update – witness appeal following road rage incident in Ferndown

18 July 2017

* * *

A man has been given a conditional caution following a road rage incident in Ferndown.

Officers issued an appeal following the incident in the car park of Tesco Express on New Road at 8.38am on Friday 24 March 2017.

The offender reportedly shouted abuse at the victim, a Birmingham man aged in his 50s, and punched his closed window before kicking his car and breaking the wing mirror.

The suspect, a 30-year-old Bournemouth man, attended for a voluntary police interview and has received a conditional caution, with conditions to pay £50 compensation and write a letter of apology to the victim.
