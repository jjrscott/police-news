# Update - appeal after reports of a drink spiking incident on Bournemouth beach

18 June 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating reports a woman had her drink spiked on Bournemouth beach have arrested a man.

The incident was reported to have occurred sometime between 4.30pm and 6pm on Sunday 10 June 2018 in the area of Alum Chine.

The victim - a woman aged in her 30s - stated she had arranged to meet a man known as 'Johnny' who she had spoken to on a dating website. It is alleged they met on the beach and chatted on the sand near to Vesuvio restaurant, before the man went to buy bottles of alcohol for them to share.

After consuming some of the alcohol, the woman went into the sea for a short while before returning to the beach. She reported that she began to feel strange and disorientated and challenged the man before he walked off.

The victim is said to have fallen to the sand for a short time before being helped up by other members of the public, who then called Dorset Police.

A 40-year-old man from Bournemouth has been arrested on suspicion of administering a substance with intent to stupefy or overpower to allow sexual activity and has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.
