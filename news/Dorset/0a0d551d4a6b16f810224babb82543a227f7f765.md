Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a serious assault at a pub in Weymouth.

At 12.08am on Sunday 2 September 2018 Dorset Police was called by the ambulance service to a stabbing at the John Gregory pub on Radipole Lane.

It was reported that a local man aged in his 40s was approached by three or four men in the toilets of the pub and asked if he wanted to buy drugs. When the man refused, he was stabbed in the stomach.

The victim was taken to Dorset County Hospital for treatment to his injuries, which are not life-threatening or life-changing.

One of the offenders is described as a bald man, aged in his 40s, with a tattoo on his neck of possibly a dragon or a snake.

Detective Constable Kelly Wood, of Weymouth CID, said: "We have been carrying out a number of enquiries to identify the offenders, including CCTV trawls of the area.

"I am aware that there were a number of people in the pub at the time of the incident. I am appealing for anyone who witnessed what happened, and has not yet spoken to police, to please get in touch.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who may have any information that can assist my investigation."
