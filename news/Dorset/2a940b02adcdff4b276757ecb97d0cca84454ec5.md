Detectives are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward after a man was robbed at knifepoint in Bournemouth.

The victim, a man aged in his 20s, was walking along Stokewood Road some time between 2am and 2.30am today, Thursday 9 May 2019, when he was approached by two men on bicycles.

They were initially friendly before asking him for his wallet and phone. One of the men then took out a kitchen knife and held it up to the victim.

The victim handed over his wallet and phone before the men left in the direction of Winton.

Detective Constable Ben Swain, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This must have been a very frightening ordeal for the victim and we have launched a full investigation to identify the offenders.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident, or who has any information that can assist our investigation, to contact us."
