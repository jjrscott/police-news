# Appeal for witnesses following Poole assault

15 May 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward after a woman was assaulted in Poole.

The victim, a local woman aged in her 50s, was walking from Longfleet Road into Kingston Road at around 6pm on Wednesday 8 May 2019.

She saw a group of men sat on benches in a pedestrian space and one of the men approached her and asked for a pound. The victim said she did not have one and apologised before continuing to walk up Kingston Road.

Shortly afterwards she was pushed from behind and fell to the ground, landing on her right hand side. She got to her feet and ran off toward Wimborne Road.

The victim attended hospital the next day and was found to have three fractured ribs, as well as bruising to her knee, thigh and elbow.

Police Constable Adam Carr, of Poole police, said: "This woman was subjected to an unprovoked assault and we are determined to identify who is responsible.

"I am appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information to contact us. I understand a woman who was passing by stopped to ask the victim if she was alright and I would be keen to speak to her as she may be able to assist with our investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190069691. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
