* * *

Officers investigating an incident of criminal damage in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 10.20am on Friday 3 May 2019 the victim, a local man aged in his 30s, was sitting in his blue car in Milton Close when a brick was thrown through the window. The vehicle was stationary at the time.

Police Constable Ben Turner, of Weymouth police, said: "Fortunately the victim did not sustain any injuries but was understandably left very shaken by this incident.

"He did not see who threw the brick and I am appealing for anyone who was in the area at the time and may have witnessed the incident, or who has any information that can assist our investigation, to come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190066509. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
