A man has been charged in connection with a reported assault in Blandford.

Officers were called at 9.12pm on Monday 7 May 2018 to Damory Court Street following reports that a 31-year-old man had been assaulted.

It was alleged that he was assaulted with a claw hammer before being driven at by a man in a Mercedes car.

The victim sustained injuries to his face and stomach and was taken to hospital for treatment.

A 30-year-old Blandford man has been charged with attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent, criminal damage and dangerous driving. He is due to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Monday 7 January 2019.

Two other local men, aged 29 and 42, who were arrested in connection with the incident have now been released from under investigation and will face no further police action.
