Detectives investigating a serious assault in Bournemouth have arrested two men.

At 5.47pm on Saturday 7 October 2017 it was reported that an altercation had taken place involving a group of people at the Kings Arms in Wallisdown Road during which a man in his 50s sustained injuries.

Shortly afterwards a further incident was reported at the school playing field in Talbot Drive involving a van. Following this a 23-year-old man was found unconscious and taken to hospital for treatment to serious but not life-threatening injuries. A teenage boy also sustained minor injuries.

Two men aged 29 and 40 and both from Bournemouth have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and released under investigation.

Detective Inspector Andy Roberts, of Bournemouth CID, said: "A full investigation is underway to establish what happened and we believe the two incidents are linked. As a result, officers will continue to carry out enquiries in the area and for public reassurance.

"Any witnesses to either incident or anyone with information about those involved should contact Dorset Police as soon as possible."
