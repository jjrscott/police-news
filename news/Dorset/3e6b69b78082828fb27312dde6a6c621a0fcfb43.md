# Witness appeal following fatal collision on A35 Puddletown bypass

17 October 2018

* * *

Officers investigating a fatal road traffic collision on the A35 Puddletown bypass are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage of the incident to come forward.

At around 7.30pm on Tuesday 16 October 2018 a collision occurred on the eastbound carriageway between the Northbrook Interchange at the A354 Blandford turning and the Tolpuddle Ball junction. It involved a green Skoda Fabia and a black Ford Galaxy.

Officers attended, along with the ambulance and fire services.

Very sadly, the driver of the Skoda - a 45-year-old man from Weymouth - was pronounced dead at the scene. His family has been informed and is being supported by specially-trained officers. The coroner has also been notified.

The driver of the Ford, a 61-year-old Weymouth man and his 60-year-old male passenger also from Weymouth, were both taken to hospital for treatment to injuries that are not believed to be life-threatening.

Police Sergeant Fern Graham, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the family of the man who sadly died and we are determined to carry out a detailed investigation to establish the full circumstances of this collision.

"I am appealing for anyone who witnessed the collision, or the manner of driving of either vehicle involved prior to the incident, to contact us.

"I would also urge anyone who was travelling in the area and may have captured the incident on dashcam to check their footage.

"I would like to thank motorists for their patience and understanding while the road closures on the A35 have been in place and can assure members of the public that they are absolutely necessary to allow the emergency services to deal with the incident and for a thorough examination of the collision scene to take place."
