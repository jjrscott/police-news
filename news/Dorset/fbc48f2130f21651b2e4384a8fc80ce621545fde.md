# Weymouth to receive enhanced town centre patrols as part of ‘100 Days of Summer’ policing campaign

08 June 2020

* * *

Weymouth police will be providing an improved visible presence in the town centre this summer in a bid to reduce anti-social and criminal behaviour following the success of the '100 Days of Summer' initiative last year.

The initiative will see officers on dedicated foot patrols in the town centre at key locations and times from the end of May for 100 days.

Police constables and police community support officers (PCSOs) will be visible around the town on a daily basis and will be supported by special constables.

Weymouth and Portland Neighbourhood Policing Team Sergeant Sam Goom said: "We are committed to ensuring that residents and visitors to Weymouth feel safe and are able to enjoy their time here.

"Reports of anti-social behaviour and violence in the town were down last year compared to previous years due to the success of our 100 Days of Summer Initiative and we are keen to continue this positive trend.

"Weymouth remains a safe place but there is always room to make things better for residents and visitors."

Officers and PCSOs will be able to make use of dispersal powers to direct people away from the town or surrender alcohol if they have been acting in an anti-social manner. Anyone who continues to come to notice will be considered for further action such as community protection notices and criminal behaviour orders.

Weymouth town centre beat manager Police Constable Chris Meade, said: "We regularly receive feedback from the community that they want our officers to be out and about on foot patrol rather than on patrol in vehicles.

 "We're confident our 100 Days of Summer initiative will again have a significant impact on the town centre and surrounding areas."
