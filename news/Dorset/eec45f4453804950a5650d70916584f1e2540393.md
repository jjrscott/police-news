# Image appeal to identify owners of suspected stolen property

23 December 2020

* * *

Officers are issuing images of suspected stolen property recovered from an address in Bournemouth in a bid to identify the owners.

The two heart-shaped dark grey memorial-style stones with paw prints on were located at a property in the town on Monday 30 November 2020.

Enquiries have been carried out to try and identify the owners, but these have so far proved unsuccessful.

Police Constable Ben Aldous, of Dorset Police, said: "We are keen to identify the owners of these stones and I am issuing these images in the hope that they can be traced.

"I would urge anyone who recognises them to please contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200189662. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
