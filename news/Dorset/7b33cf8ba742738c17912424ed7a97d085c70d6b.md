A man arrested in connection with a reported burglary at an address in Bournemouth has been released without charge.

The incident is reported to have occurred in the Springbourne area at the address of a vulnerable woman aged in her 60s.

At around 5.30pm on Saturday 10 February 2018, CCTV captured an unknown man in the victim's kitchen looking through cupboards. It was alleged the man stole a number of food items.

Following enquiries by officers, a 51-year-old Bournemouth man was arrested on suspicion of burglary but he has now been released without charge.
