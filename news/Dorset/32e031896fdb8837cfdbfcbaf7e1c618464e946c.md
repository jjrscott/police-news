Officers continuing to investigate a burglary at a home in Poole are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

A dwelling burglary occurred at an address in Denison Road at around 5.25pm on Monday 2 November 2020. Two offenders gained entry to the property and stole a number of items of jewellery before heading out of the address and onto Waterloo Road at around 5.30pm.

The stolen items include 18 carat gold male and female wedding rings, two pairs of Pandora earrings and gold square cufflinks, as well as a number of bracelets.

Police Constable Liam Moss, of Dorset Police's Priority Crime Team, said: "Our investigation into this burglary is ongoing and I would urge anyone with information that might assist our enquiries to please come forward.

"I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area on the evening in question. I would also encourage anyone who was travelling along Denison Road or Waterloo Road up to toward the Darby's Corner Roundabout around the relevant time to please check any dashcam footage.

"Finally, I would like to hear from anyone who has come across any jewellery matching the descriptions given being offered for sale in unusual circumstances locally or online."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200165246. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
