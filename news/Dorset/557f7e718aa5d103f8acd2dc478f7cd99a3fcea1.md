# Appeal for information after cat killed in Weymouth

16 September 2020

* * *

Officers investigating an incident where a cat was killed in Weymouth are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police received a report that a cat had been found dead in Wyke Oliver Road in Preston at around 6.20am on Saturday 5 September 2020. It was reported that the cat had been beheaded.

The cat's owner was advised by a vet that due to the manner of the injury sustained, they believed a sharp instrument had been used to cause it and it was not likely to have been caused by another animal.

Police Constable Jon Park, of Dorset Police, said: "This was a despicable and concerning act targeting a defenceless animal and I would urge anyone with information about who is responsible to please come forward.

"This has understandably been very traumatic for the owner of the cat, who has lost her much loved pet."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200133481. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
