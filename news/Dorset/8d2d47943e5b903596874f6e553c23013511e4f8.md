# Update - alleged robbery in Poole

19 April 2018

* * *

A man arrested in connection with a reported robbery in Poole has been released from investigation.

The incident is said to have occurred at around 9.50pm on Saturday 11 November 2017 when a Poole man aged in his 20s picked up two men from outside Sainsbury's in Pitwines Close.

The men then reportedly forced him to pull over in a nearby layby on Newfoundland Drive, which backs on to Emerson Road. They allegedly threatened the victim and forced him out of the vehicle before driving off in it.

The car was found the following day in a residential car park in Perry Gardens in Poole.

A 28-year-old Poole man was arrested on 16 November 2017 on suspicion of robbery. He was released pending further enquiries and has now been released from investigation. No further police action will be taken against him.

Detectives issued a CCTV image of a second man believed to have been involved in the case but he has not been identified.
