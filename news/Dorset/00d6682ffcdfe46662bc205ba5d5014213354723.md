# Police appeal for dash cam footage after alleged dangerous driving in Weymouth

14 September 2016

* * *

Police are appealing for dash cam or CCTV footage following alleged dangerous driving in Weymouth.

Officers received reports from a member of the public that they had witnessed a green Renault Megane driving dangerously on previous occasions in the Chapelhay area of the town.

At around 3.15pm on Monday 12 September 2016 the vehicle was spotted by police at Boot Hill. The vehicle did not stop for officers when requested.

The car was seen to travel along Westwey Road, turning left onto Abbotsbury Road, onto Pottery Lane, then to Longcroft Road and Corporation Road. The car was found abandoned a short time later along Bedford Road.

A 21-year-old Weymouth man was arrested at a nearby address on suspicion of driving offences and is currently on police bail until the middle of October 2016 pending further enquiries.

Police Constable Brian Di Stefano, of Weymouth police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the vehicle being driven in the area at the time and has any information that can assist with my investigation.

"I would also ask that anyone who has dash cam or CCTV footage of the vehicle driving through Weymouth please contacts me."
