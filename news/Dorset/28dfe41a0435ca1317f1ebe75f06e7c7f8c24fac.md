A man arrested in connection with a reported burglary at a store in Poole will face no further police action.

Dorset Police received a report of a break-in at Broadstone News in Lower Blandford Road at around 3.10am on Friday 15 January 2021. It was reported that two people forced entry to the premises and attempted to steal cigarettes from behind the counter but left when they were disturbed.

It was subsequently reported that vape liquids, lighters, lighter fluids, cigarette papers and stamps had been stolen.

A 29-year-old Poole man was arrested on suspicion of burglary and was released under investigation. He has now been released from under investigation and will face no further police action in connection with the burglary.
