# Renewed appeal for witnesses following serious injury collision at Lytchett Minster

16 September 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a serious injury collision at Lytchett Minster are renewing their appeal for witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage to come forward.

Dorset Police was called at 5.23am on Monday 14 September 2020 to reports of a collision on the A35 near the Axim Centre involving a white Mitsubishi Outlander and a white Keeway Logik motorcycle.

The rider of the motorcycle - a 28-year-old man from Weymouth - sustained very serious injuries and was taken to Southampton General Hospital for treatment. He remains in hospital in a life-threatening condition.

The driver of the Mitsubishi, a man aged in his 40s and from Poole, was uninjured.

The A35 was closed between the Bakers Arms roundabout and Morden Park Corner. It was reopened at around 11.20am.

Police Sergeant Sarah Jones, of the traffic unit, said: "Following enquiries we have established that two vehicles drove past the collision directly after it happened. I would appeal directly to the drivers to please get in touch as you may have important information to assist my investigation.

"I would also like to renew my appeal for anyone who was travelling along that stretch of the A35 at the relevant time and either witnessed the collision, saw either vehicle immediately prior or has captured any relevant footage on dashcam to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 10:40. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
