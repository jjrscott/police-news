# Witness appeal following purse theft in Christchurch

22 June 2016

* * *

Police in Christchurch are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a purse theft in the town.

Sometime between 10am and midday on Friday 17 June 2016, a local woman aged in her 70s pulling a red and white spotted trolley was waiting to cross the road outside the Co Op store on Fairmile, opposite Rutland Road, when a man knocked into her.

The pensioner wobbled but managed to stay on her feet. Her shopping trolley fell over and most of her shopping, including her purse, spilled onto the pavement.

As the victim began picking up her shopping she noticed the man bend down and pick something up. He then ran away toward Arcadia Road.

The following day the victim noticed her purse containing bank cards and cash was missing.

The offender is described as white, of skinny build, approximately five feet four inches tall and aged in his 20s. He was wearing a black baseball cap, black jerkin-type coat, black trousers and black boots with laces, described as old hockey boots.

Police Constable Alexandra Seymour, of Christchurch police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was on Fairmile last Friday and either witnessed the incident or saw a man matching the description in the area to please contact me."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting quoting incident number 18:175. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
