Detectives are appealing for witnesses after a man was reportedly stabbed in Poole town centre.

It was reported at around 1.20am today, Saturday 29 July 2017, that a man in his 20s had sustained two deep wounds to his armpit and arm following an assault in the area of Lagland Street.

He was treated by paramedics and taken to hospital for treatment.

A 20-year-old man from Poole has been arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm and is assisting detectives with their enquiries.

Detective Sergeant Andy Haworth, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We have arrested a man and made a number of enquiries into this incident.

"I am keen to hear from any witnesses or anyone with any information that might assist with our investigation.

"At this time, the knife believed to have been used in the alleged assault has also not been recovered and I would urge anyone who comes across a knife apparently discarded in the vicinity not to touch it but to please contact police immediately."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170116251. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
