# Witness appeal following robbery in Bournemouth

10 July 2017

* * *

Detectives are appealing for the public's help to find two men who robbed another man in Bournemouth.

The incident happened sometime between 3am and 4am on Sunday 9 July 2017.

The victim - a Thai man aged in his 20s and visiting Bournemouth - was walking along Exeter Park Road when he was approached by two men. The offenders assaulted the victim and stole his mobile phone and headphones.

Immediately after the incident a group of around 10 people walked past and the offenders pretended they were friends with the victim, before hugging him and handing back the stolen items.

The victim sustained neck pain following the incident.

The first offender is described as white, aged in his early 30s, of medium build, approximately six feet tall and with dark hair. He was wearing a grey Adidas top with stripes down the sleeves and grey or dark-coloured jogging bottoms.

The second offender is described as white and was wearing similar jogging bottoms to his accomplice.

Detective Constable Sara Watts, of Bournemouth CID, said: "An investigation is underway and officers have spoken to the victim and are carrying out CCTV enquiries.

"I am keen to speak to the group of people who walked past the incident as I believe they may be able to help me with my investigation.

"I would also urge anyone else with information about this incident to please contact Dorset Police.

"Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team will be carrying out high-visibility patrols in the coming days to offer reassurance to the community."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170104391. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
