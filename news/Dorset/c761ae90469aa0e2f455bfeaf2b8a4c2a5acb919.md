# Theft of catalytic converters in Dorchester area â€“ public appeal

02 April 2021

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following a series of thefts of catalytic converters from vehicles in the Dorchester area.

The incidents occurred between around 9.45pm and 11pm on Wednesday 31 March 2021. Vehicles were targeted in Knighton Lane in Broadmayne, Rectory Road and Paynes Close in Piddlehinton and Broken Cross in Charminster.

Officers also believe an earlier incident in Wareham may also be linked to these offences.

Police Constable Dave Ash, of Dorchester Police, said: "We are carrying out enquiries into these thefts, which I appreciate have caused considerable inconvenience to the owners of the vehicles involved.

"I would urge residents with home CCTV systems, or anyone who was driving in any of the relevant areas on the night of Wednesday 31 March 2021, to check their footage for anything that might assist our investigation.

"We will do all we can to investigate reports of this nature but we would also urge members of the public to take some simple security steps where possible to help stop these offences from happening.

"Park the rear of your vehicle close to fences, walls or a kerb or keep your vehicle in a garage where possible. Alternatively, aim to park in a well-lit and well-populated area.

"If you've been a victim or witness any suspicious activity in the area, please report this to us."
