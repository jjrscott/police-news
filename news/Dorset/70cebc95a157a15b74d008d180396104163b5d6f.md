Detectives investigating a serious assault in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police received a report at 4.37pm on Monday 10 February 2020 that a man had sustained a stab wound during an altercation in the car park at Sainsbury's in Pitwines Close.

The victim - aged in his 50s - was taken to hospital by the ambulance service for treatment. His condition is described as stable.

Officers attended and carried out a search of the area to try and locate the offender.

A cordon was put in place to allow an examination of the scene to be carried out.

Detective Sergeant Leo Glendon, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We believe the offender was with another man at the time of the incident and enquiries are ongoing to try and locate them.

"I understand there may have been a number of people in the area and I am appealing to any witnesses who have not already spoken to police to please come forward.

"I appreciate this may cause concern within the community but I would like to reassure members of the public that a full investigation is underway. There will be an increased police presence in the area and local officers can be approached with any concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200021460. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
