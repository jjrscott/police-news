# Tribute to Dorset Police Detective Constable Jon Hicken

16 October 2019

* * *

Tributes have been paid to serving Dorset Police Detective Constable Jon Hicken who very sadly died in Bournemouth on his way to work.

Jon, who was 47 years old, was found unconscious in Boscombe Chine Gardens at Boscombe Pier, on the morning of Sunday 6 October 2019. Sadly, he was pronounced dead at the scene. There were no suspicious circumstances as Jon died of natural causes.

Dorset Police's Chief Constable James Vaughan said: "We are all deeply saddened by the death of our serving police officer Jon Hicken.

"At this very difficult time, our thoughts are with Jon's family and close friends, many of whom are Dorset Police colleagues. I have relayed to them my deepest condolences.

"Following 10 years of service from 1997 until 2007 with West Midlands Police, Jon transferred to Dorset Police. He held a variety of posts within Dorset Police working both in uniform policing roles and more recently as a detective within CID and public protection.

"Jon was widely regarded as an excellent police officer. He dedicated his professional life to protecting the most vulnerable in the community and has been instrumental in removing dangerous offenders from the streets of Dorset.

"As a person Jon was a popular approachable man who had the ability to find humour in the most difficult of circumstances. He was a dedicated family man who often shared his pride in his family with colleagues.

"Jon was well respected among his peers and his loss will be deeply felt by the policing family both on a professional and personal level."

The family is requesting privacy at this very difficult time.
