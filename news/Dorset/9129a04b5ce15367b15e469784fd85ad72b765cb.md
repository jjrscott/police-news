Officers investigating a road traffic collision in Bournemouth that left a man with serious leg injuries are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

At around 6.50pm on Friday 1 January 2021 a collision occurred on Christchurch Road, near to the junction with Roseberry Road, involving a black BMW 320D and a black Lexomoto scooter.

The rider of the scooter, a 19-year-old man from Bournemouth, sustained serious leg injuries and was taken to Poole Hospital for treatment.

The driver of the BMW was uninjured.

Road closures were put in place to allow the emergency services to deal with the incident.

Police Constable Andy Fields, of the traffic unit, said: "We are carrying out a full investigation to establish the circumstances of this collision and I would urge any witnesses who have not already spoken to police to please come forward.

"I would also urge anyone who was driving in the area at the relevant time and has dashcam fitted to their vehicle to check their footage for anything relevant."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at scit@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210000314.
