# Witness appeal following fail-to-stop collision in Weymouth

02 August 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward following a fail-to-stop collision in Weymouth.

At approximately 6.15am on Wednesday 24 July 2019 it was reported that a cyclist was involved in a collision with a red Honda Civic on Greenhill near to the junction with Westerhall Road.

The cyclist, a local man aged in his 50s, came off his bicycle as a result of the collision and sustained bruising.

Police Sergeant Richard Barnett, of Weymouth police, said: "The driver of the Honda failed to stop at the scene and I have been making enquiries to locate them.

"I am keen to hear from anyone who may have captured the collision on dashcam.

"I believe there were a number of people in the area at the time and I am also appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision and has not yet spoken to police to come forward."
