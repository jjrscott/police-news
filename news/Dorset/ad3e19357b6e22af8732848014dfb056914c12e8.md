# Update in relation to reported assault on bus in Poole

22 May 2020

* * *

A woman has come forward following a CCTV appeal in relation to a reported assault on a bus in Poole.

At around 11.10pm on Tuesday 28 April 2020 a man and a woman got on a bus on Longfleet Road and attempted to pay for two tickets with a quantity of change. The bus driver asked if they could pay using a contactless card, which is the preferred payment method due to COVID-19 (coronavirus).

The woman was allegedly verbally abusive toward the bus driver, however the man proceeded to pay by card and they sat down on the bus.

It is reported that at around 11.20pm the woman went to the front of the bus and leant around the protective screen where the driver was sitting and demanded his name and number, before grabbing him by his clothing and stating: "I hope you catch the coronavirus".

Following a CCTV appeal, a local woman aged in her 30s has now come forward and is assisting officers with their enquiries. No arrests have been made.
