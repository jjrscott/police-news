Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a fatal road traffic collision near Shaftesbury.

Dorset Police was called at 8.28am today, Tuesday 19 December 2017, to a report of a road traffic collision on the B3091 near to St James' Common involving a black Honley motorcycle, a black Mercedes C180 and a black Volkswagen Polo.

Sadly, the rider of the motorcycle, a 35-year-old man from Sturminster Newton, was pronounced dead at the scene. His next of kin has been informed and is being supported by specially trained officers. The coroner has been notified.

The driver of the Volkswagen, a woman aged in her 60s from Shaftesbury, sustained minor injuries.

A man aged in his 50s, who was the driver of Mercedes, was uninjured.

The road was closed to allow collision investigators to carry out a full and thorough examination of the scene.

Police Sergeant Mark Scammell, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who travelled along the B3091 between Shaftesbury and Guys Marsh earlier this morning prior to the collision to please get in touch.

"I wish to speak anyone who witnessed the incident, or the manner of driving of either of the vehicles prior to the collision.

"I am keen to hear from anyone who has a dash cam fitted in their vehicle that may hold vital evidence.

"Also, I would like to thank motorists for their patience while the road closure was in place to allow emergency services to deal with the collision."
