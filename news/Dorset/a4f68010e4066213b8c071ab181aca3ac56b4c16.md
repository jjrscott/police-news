05 June 2020

* * *

Officers investigating an incident of criminal damage and subsequent theft in Poole are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

Some time between Saturday 23 May and Sunday 24 May 2020 a beach hut on Shore Road near to the Jazz Café was broken into and two others had damage caused to them. It was reported that one beach hut had the door removed and two others had their windows smashed.

Various items, including a kayak, a surfboard, wetsuits, a DAB radio and binoculars were taken. Most of the items were found nearby, however a men’s size XL wetsuit and various items of sentimental value are still missing.

Police Community Support Investigator Chris Hardy, of Poole Police, said: “We are continuing to investigate this incident and I am keen to hear from anyone who has information about the outstanding items to please get in touch.

“I am also appealing to anyone who witnessed the beach huts being broken into, or who has any information that could assist my investigation, to contact Dorset Police.”

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200073165. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
