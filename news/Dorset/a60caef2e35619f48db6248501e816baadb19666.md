# Witness appeal following robbery in Weymouth

18 March 2020

* * *

Detectives investigating a robbery in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Between 4am and 5am on Wednesday 11 March 2020 the victim, a woman aged in her 20s, was walking through the underpass under Westwey Road, near to Westham Bridge, when a man cycled past her and pulled in front to block her path. He grabbed her by the throat and snatched her phone from her hand.

The man then went through the pockets of her jacket and took her purse before cycling off in the direction of Westham Bridge.

The victim did not sustain any injuries.

The offender is described as white, aged in his 30s and of medium build with stubble on his face. He was wearing a maroon beanie hat with orange stripes and an orange bobble on top and a black jacket with a white North Face logo on the chest.

Detective Constable Dave Pearce, of Weymouth CID, said: "This was understandably a very distressing incident for the victim and we have been carrying out a number of enquiries to try and identity the man responsible.

"I would urge anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area on the night of the robbery, or who may have information as to the identity of the offender based on the description of the clothing given, to please contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200037832. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
