# Witness appeal following burglaries in North and East Dorset

01 December 2016

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following a series of burglaries in North and East Dorset.

Between Friday 25 November and Tuesday 29 November 2016 there have been a number of reported burglaries to properties in rural areas of Dorset - Blandford, Child Okeford, Lytchett Matravers, Pimperne, Tarrant Gunville, Verwood, Wimborne and Winterborne Whitechurch.

A number of high-value garden machinery items have been stolen including chainsaws, hedge trimmers, tree surgery equipment and leaf blowers.

A silver Volvo estate V70, registration number Y79 LYA, has been seen in the area at the time of each of the incidents.

No arrests have been made.

North Dorset Neighbourhood Inspector Rob Chalkley, said: "The offenders have been targeting garages and outbuildings in rural locations.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have seen a silver Volvo with registration number Y79 LYA during the relevant time period, or has any information about the driver, to contact Dorset Police.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who has seen the items described for sale in unusual circumstances.

"Thankfully this type of offending is rare and by working with local communities I am keen to prevent this issue escalating.

"Local residents can help prevent such crimes by being vigilant and implementing some simple prevention measures, particularly in the lead up to Christmas."

Members of the public should consider the following advice to protect their property:
• Secure access to your outbuilding by locking gates and using thorny bushes next to walls and fences.
• Make a note of serial numbers of equipment and photograph valuable plants and ornaments.
• Use external security lights which are activated by movement.
• Use strong padbars and close shackle padlocks to secure doors and locks or grilles to secure windows.
• Chain cycles, mowers, ladders and tools to a strong anchorage point.
