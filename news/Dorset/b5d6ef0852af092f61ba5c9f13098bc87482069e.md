# Dorset Police targets commercial and heavy goods vehicles in safety crackdown

20 February 2020

Roads policing officers from Dorset Police carried out an operation on the Ashley Heath interchange on the morning of Thursday 20 February 2020 targeting commercial and heavy goods vehicles.

The operation worked alongside HM Revenue and Customs, Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency, Dorset Council, Driver and Vehicle Licencing Agency, Environment Agency, National Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service and Datatag.

Nine vehicles were dealt with for excessive weight with one Ford Transit van reportedly carrying pallets being almost two tons over weight – over 50 per cent above its maximum weight limit. As a result the driver will have to attend court to explain their actions.

Two vehicles were dealt with for having no tachograph, which records how many hours of driving they’re doing, while another was seized due to not holding valid insurance. Three vehicles were given a prohibition notice that prevented them from carrying on their journeys due to being seriously unsafe.

One driver had an offensive weapon seized after he couldn’t explain why he was carrying a baseball bat on his back seat and another driver was reported for driving whilst disqualified.

Numerous other heavy goods and commercial vehicles were dealt with for offences including no MOT, missing number plates, defective tyres, waste offences, not wearing seatbelts and non-payment of the HGV levy.

Inspector Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit said: “It’s important we target all road users and the results from today’s operation, which forms part of a national week of action around heavy goods vehicles demonstrates our commitment to ensuring the roads are as safe as possible for all.

“We were joined by numerous other enforcement colleagues enabling us to target a greater variety of offences with their specialist powers, knowledge and expertise.

"If you have concerns about road users in your community, please report them to us by visiting www.dorset.police.uk or by calling 101.”
