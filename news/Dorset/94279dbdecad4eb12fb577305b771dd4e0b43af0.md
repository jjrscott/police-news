# Appeal for witnesses following reported assault in Weymouth

30 September 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a reported serious assault in Weymouth.

At approximately 4.15am on Friday 27 September 2019 it was reported that an assault took place involving a group of men on Maiden Street at the junction with Church Passage.

The victim - a local man aged in his 30s - sustained injuries to his neck and was taken to hospital for treatment.

It is believed that the men were known to each other.

Following enquiries, a 28-year-old Portland man has been arrested on suspicion of wounding with intent and is currently assisting officers with enquiries.

A 26-year-old man from Weymouth was also arrested on suspicion of wounding or inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent and has been released on police bail while enquiries continue.

Detective Constable Jeremy Cuff, of Weymouth CID, said: "As part of my enquiries I have viewed CCTV from the night, which shows that there were a large number of people in the area at the time of the alleged assault.

"I am appealing to anybody who witnessed the incident and has not yet spoken to police to come forward."
