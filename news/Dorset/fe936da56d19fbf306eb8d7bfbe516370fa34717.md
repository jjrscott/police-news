# Update â€“ man charged following reported assaults in Bournemouth

31 May 2019

* * *

A man has been charged following reported assaults on staff members at a Bournemouth store.

The first alleged incident at the Co-op in Holdenhurst Road occurred at around 4.40pm on Thursday 16 May 2019 when a man entered the store and stole two chocolate bars. When challenged by a staff member he reportedly spat at them before leaving the store.

The same man returned to the store at around 12pm on Sunday 19 May 2019 and reportedly pushed a second staff member with both hands before spitting in his face and hitting him on the back of the head.

Following a CCTV appeal, a 29-year-old man from Bournemouth has been charged with two counts of assault by beating and theft from a shop. He is due to appear at Poole Magistates' Court on Tuesday 18 June 2019.
