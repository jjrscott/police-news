* * *

Officers investigating the theft of two mobility scooters in Verwood are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The scooters were stolen from outside flats in Howard Road some time between 10.30pm on Wednesday 24 April and 8am on Thursday 25 April 2019.

The mobility scooters were both new models made by Rascal Mobility. One is red and the other black.

Police Sergeant Jane Moore, of East Dorset police, said: "Both the victims rely on their mobility scooters and have understandably been left upset at losing their essential transport.

"I am appealing for any witnesses to the theft, or anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area of Howard Road on the night of Wednesday 24 April 2019, to contact police.

"We would also like to hear from anyone who comes across a mobility scooter matching the descriptions given in unusual circumstances."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190061964. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
