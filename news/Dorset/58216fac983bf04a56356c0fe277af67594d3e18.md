# Update – CCTV appeal following reported theft by finding in Bournemouth

27 November 2019

* * *

A man has come forward and is assisting officers with their enquiries into an alleged theft by finding incident in Bournemouth.

It was reported that at around 12.35pm on Sunday 13 October a woman aged in her 50s went to withdraw £100 from a cashpoint outside Asda in St Pauls Road and took her receipt but forgot to take her money. When she returned a short time later the money had gone.

Following a CCTV appeal to identify an individual officers wanted to speak to in connection with the incident, a 42-year-old Bournemouth man has come forward and is assisting officers with their enquiries. No arrests have been made.
