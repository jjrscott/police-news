# Witness appeal following thefts in North Dorset

24 February 2020

* * *

Officers investigating thefts from vehicles in Gillingham are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Between Thursday 20 February and Sunday 23 February 2020 a number of overnight thefts occurred from unattended vehicles, as well as from sheds and garages, in the Wyke area. It is believed the offenders were targeting work tools. Items stolen include Makita drills and a circular saw.

It is reported that three white men wearing hoods and masks were seen behaving suspiciously in the area at the time. It is also reported that an early model silver Ford Focus hatchback was seen in the vicinity at the time of the offences.

Inspector Simon Perry, of Dorset Police, said: "A thorough and detailed investigation is underway into these thefts and police have increased patrols in the area.

"I am keen to hear from anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area at the relevant time, or who may have recently come across work tools for sale in unusual circumstances, to please get in touch.

"I would also urge residents to consider installing shed or garage door alarms as a preventative measure, which are relatively inexpensive and can act as an effective deterrent."
