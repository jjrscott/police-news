Officers are appealing for witnesses after a collision between a car and a church wall in Lytchett Minster.

Police were called at 10.11am today, Saturday 28 October 2017, to reports that a silver Vauxhall Astra had collided with the perimeter wall at Lytchett Minster Parish Church. It is believed at least six gravestones were also damaged in the collision. It is alleged that the vehicle had been stolen.

Two men aged 20 and 21 and both from Poole were arrested on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle and driving offences and are currently assisting police with enquiries.

A 16-year-old girl who was arrested at the scene was later de-arrested and will be voluntarily assisting police.

No one was injured in the incident.

Police Constable Hannah White, of Dorset Police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or the manner of driving of the vehicle prior to the incident to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who saw the vehicle described driving around the Poole area earlier this morning."
