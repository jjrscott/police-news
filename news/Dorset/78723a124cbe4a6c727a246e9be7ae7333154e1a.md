# Witness appeal following aggravated burglary in Swanage

03 November 2019

* * *

Detectives investigating an aggravated burglary in Swanage are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At 7.55pm on Saturday 2 November 2019 Dorset Police received a report of a burglary at Georgian Gems jewellers on the High Street involving a number of men. It was reported that the men were in possession of weapons, including crow bars and sledge hammers.

Officers, including armed police, attended the scene and searches were carried out in a bid to locate the offenders.

It is reported that the offenders left the scene in a vehicle.

There were no reports of any injuries. The safe was stolen from inside the jewellers.

A white Volkswagen Golf has been recovered as part of the investigation.

Detective Inspector Neil Wright, of Bournemouth CID, said: "A full and thorough investigation is underway to identify and arrest the offenders. We are carrying out a number of enquiries today, including house-to-house visits.

"There were a number of people in the area at the time and I am appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident, or saw the offenders abandon the vehicle, and has not already spoken to police to come forward.

"I would like to hear from any motorists who may have been travelling in the area at the time and captured any relevant dashcam footage. I am also keen to hear from anyone who may have filmed all or part of the incident on their mobile phone.

"I understand this incident must have caused some concern to members of the public and officers from the local neighbourhood policing team can be approached with any concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190173160. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
