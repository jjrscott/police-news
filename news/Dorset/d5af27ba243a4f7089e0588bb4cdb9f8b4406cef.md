* * *

Officers investigating an incident in Gillingham have issued a update.

At 4.26am on Thursday 9 June 2016 police were called to reports that a man had sustained serious injuries at an address in Newbury in the town.

Officers and the ambulance service attended the address and a local 42-year-old man was taken to Yeovil Hospital with a shoulder injury. His condition was not serious.

Detective Chief Inspector Pete Little, of Dorset Police, said: "A firearm was recovered at the scene.

"Following a thorough investigation, the injuries are believed to be self-inflicted and we are not looking for anyone else in relation to this incident.

"The man has been arrested on suspicion of firearm offences and wasting police time and is currently assisting officers with their enquiries.

"I would like to thank local residents for their patience while officers carried out their investigations in relation to this incident.

"There will be an increased police presence in Gillingham over the weekend as local officers offer reassurance to the community, should they have any concerns."
