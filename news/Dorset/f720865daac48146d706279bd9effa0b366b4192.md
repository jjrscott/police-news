# Update - pair due in court in connection with fatal collision near Bere Regis

25 January 2019

* * *

Two men are due to appear in court in connection with a fatal road traffic collision near Bere Regis.

At 4.40pm on Saturday 14 July 2018 Dorset Police was called to reports of a three-vehicle collision on the westbound lane of the A35 Dorchester bypass near Bere Regis, just before the single carriageway becomes a duel carriageway.

The collision involved a white BMW, a white Land Rover Freelander and a silver Mercedes.

Very sadly the driver of the Freelander - who was named by his family as 49-year-old David Grant-Jones - sustained serious injuries and died at the scene.

His wife, 59-year-old Heather, who was a front seat passenger in the vehicle, sustained serious injuries and was flown by air ambulance to Southampton General Hospital for treatment.

Three male occupants of the BMW, aged 26, 27 and 39, also sustained serious injuries and were taken to hospital for treatment.

No one from the Mercedes was injured.

A 38-year-old Ferndown man and a 28-year-old man from Surrey have been issued with postal requisitions to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Monday 25 February 2019 for offences of causing death by dangerous driving and causing serious injury by dangerous driving.
