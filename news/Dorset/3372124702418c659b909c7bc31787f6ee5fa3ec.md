21 May 2019

* * *

A man is due to appear in court charged in connection with an injury collision in Wimborne.

At 1.53am on Saturday 15 December 2018 a single-vehicle collision was reported to Dorset Police involving a blue Ford Focus that had left Leigh Road, was in collision with two lamp posts and landed on its roof.

The driver of the car - a local man aged in his 20s - sustained a fractured pelvis and was taken to hospital for treatment.

A 20-year-old man from Ringwood has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 24 May 2019 for offences of drink driving, drug driving, driving while disqualified and driving without insurance.
