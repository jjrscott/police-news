# Exercise tests multi-agency response to missing people investigations

11 December 2017

* * *

The latest exercise to test the multi-agency response to finding missing people in Dorset was held on Brownsea Island on Friday 8 December 2017.

Specially trained officers from Dorset Police were joined by colleagues from the Coastguard, RNLI, Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue, Dorset Search and Rescue, Hampshire Search and Rescue Dogs, Dorset Search Dogs and the Royal Life Saving Society as well as the NPAS helicopter.

The first live scenario they encountered involved three missing people, including a 10-year-old boy, and a second scenario involved a vulnerable man who had been reported missing.

The services worked together to plan and co-ordinate the search and locate the missing people.

Earlier this year an exercise was held in Holt Heath Nature Reserve after officers took part in a week-long specialist training course to become Lost Person Search Managers to further improve the Force's capability for finding missing people.

The Brownsea Island exercise also marked the completion of Dorset Police's second training course for a further 11 Lost Person Search Managers.
 Superintendent Mike Rogers, of Dorset Police, said: "Exercises such as this are a valuable way of testing the response of the various agencies involved to major incidents, the roles they each play and how they work together in such scenarios.

"They help us test our plans and resilience and ensure that our staff are up-to-date with the latest practice.

"I would like to thank all the personnel from the various agencies and organisations who contributed to the exercise as well as the National Trust for its permission and support to run the event on Brownsea Island."
