# Dorset Police urge all motorists - â€˜leave your phone alone'

15 November 2016

* * *

Dorset Police are working with police forces across the South West in a week-long crackdown on people using their mobile phones while driving.

It comes as figures from the RAC show that the number of motorists who illegally use mobile phones while at the wheel is rising.

Of the 1,714 motorists surveyed, 31 per cent said they used a handheld phone behind the wheel, as compared with 8 per cent in 2014.

The number of drivers who said they sent a message or posted on social media rose from seven per cent to 19 per cent, while 14 per cent said they had taken a photograph or video while driving.

Department for Transport figures show that a driver impaired or distracted by their phone was a contributory factor in 492 accidents in Britain in 2014, including 21 that were fatal and 84 that were classed as serious.

Chief Constable for Gloucestershire and the National Police lead for Road's Policing, Suzette Davenport, said: "It's obvious that someone's driving ability is impaired by using a mobile phone. What people often don't realise is that studies have found that talking on a hand-held mobile phone can impair driving as much as getting behind the wheel when you're above the drink drive limit.

"It is quite simple, people can't do both and I'm hoping that the message will finally start to sink in. Using a mobile when driving should be as unacceptable as drink driving."

New rules, expected to come in in 2017, will see fines and points doubling for drivers caught using handheld mobile phones.

Inspector Matt Butler, from the Alliance Roads Policing department, said: "We are pleased to be carrying out a series of proactive operations to catch those using their phones behind the wheel.

"People have become addicted to using their phones whilst driving, for a variety of reasons from sending a text to scanning their newsfeed. I can assure all drivers that there is nothing to be seen on their phone that is more important than their own safety and the safety of drivers and pedestrians around them.

"I urge all motorists to be considerate, be safe and put their phones away whilst behind the wheel."

Acting Police and Crime Commissioner, Colin Pipe, said: "Drivers of all vehicles have a fundamental responsibility to behave with due care and attention, to drive safely and ensure they do not put themselves or others in danger.

"Police officers cannot be everywhere and the responsibility to drive safely is not dependent on the risk of being caught offending. A licence to drive is not the same as a licence to own a firearm but it can be just as lethal in the wrong hands."
