# Appeal for information following road rage incident in Bournemouth

20 November 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a road rage incident in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

The incident occurred at around 1.55pm on Friday 30 October 2020 on Wimborne Road, near to the Redhill Roundabout.

The victim, a man aged in his 50s, was driving his white Vauxhall Astra along Wimborne Road and as he approached the traffic lights by the roundabout he moved into a gap in front of a lorry in the nearside lane.

The lorry sounded its horn and the victim made a gesture out of the window in response.

When the victim came to a stop in traffic the lorry driver got out of his vehicle and pulled open the car driver's door. He shouted at the victim and as the car driver pulled his door shut, the lorry driver kicked the door twice before getting back into his vehicle and driving off.

The paintwork of the victim's vehicle was damaged in the incident.

The lorry driver is described as being aged in his 50s and of slim build with a bald head and yellow teeth. He had a passenger in his vehicle.

Police Constable Andrea Watson, of Dorset Police, said: "We have been continuing to make enquiries into this incident and, after further contact with the victim, I am now appealing for any witnesses or anyone who may have captured the incident on dashcam to please come forward.

"I would also urge the lorry driver involved to do the right thing and contact us so we can take his account of the incident."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200163768. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
