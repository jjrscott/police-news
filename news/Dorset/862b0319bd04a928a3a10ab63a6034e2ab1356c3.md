# Updated appeal - fatal fail-to-stop collision in Poole

19 January 2019

* * *

Officers are renewing their appeal for witnesses following a fatal collision in Poole where a car reportedly failed to stop at the scene.

Police were called at 11.07pm on Friday 18 January 2019, to reports of a collision between a pedestrian and a car on Poole Road in Branksome.

The 71-year-old female pedestrian was taken to Poole hospital but sadly died from her injuries. Her family have been informed and the coroner notified.

The road was closed to allow emergency services to deal with the incident and collision investigators to examine the scene. It has since reopened.

Police Sergeant Fern Graham, of Dorset Police's traffic unit, said: "My thoughts are with the woman's family at this difficult time and we have specially-trained officers supporting them.

"Following further investigations we believe the offending vehicle made off from the scene.

"We are looking to identify a small light-coloured vehicle similar to a Renault Clio and a dark-coloured saloon similar to a Mercedes E Class. We understand these vehicles were following an ambulance eastbound along Poole Road around the time of the incident.

"We continue to investigate the full circumstances and would renew our appeal to anyone who witnessed the incident and has not yet spoken with officers to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would also ask any motorists who may have been driving in the area at the time to review their dashcam footage and report anything that may be relevant to us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 18:491. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
