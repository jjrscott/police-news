Detectives are appealing for information after a man was reportedly knocked unconscious and robbed in Christchurch.

The incident happened in the early hours of Monday 26 June 2017. A 32-year-old Christchurch man left The Boathouse on Quay Road at around 1.30am. As he made his way toward Arthur Road at the junction with Arthur Lane, it is alleged two men assaulted the victim, beating him unconscious. He woke to discover his phone, wallet and house keys were missing.

He attended Royal Bournemouth Hospital for treatment to concussion and a fractured thumb.

A 24-year-old Christchurch man was arrested on suspicion of robbery and has been released under investigation.

Detective Constable Mark Richardson, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident to please contact Dorset Police.

"We believe the victim encountered three men outside The Kings Arms on Castle Street before making his way toward Arthur Road, and I would ask that if you saw anyone acting suspiciously in this area please get in touch with us."
