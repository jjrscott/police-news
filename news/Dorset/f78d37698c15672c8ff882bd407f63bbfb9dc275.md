# Witness appeal following fatal collision in Weymouth

16 November 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a fatal collision in Weymouth.

Dorset Police was called at 9.41am on Monday 16 November 2020 to reports of a very serious injury road traffic collision on Lynch Lane involving a pedestrian and a lorry.

Very sadly, the pedestrian - a local woman aged in her 50s - died at the scene. Her family has been informed and the coroner notified.

The lorry driver was not physically injured.

Lynch Lane was closed at the junction of Lanehouse Rocks Road while emergency services attended the scene.

Police Constable Leanne Steedman, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with this woman's family and friends at his very difficult time.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in Lynch Lane at the time of the incident and witnessed what happened to please contact Dorset Police.

 "I would also ask any motorists who were travelling in the area and may have captured any relevant footage on dashcam to please get in touch.

"Finally, we closed the road to allow emergency services to respond to the incident. While I appreciate this caused inconvenience to motorists and local business, they were entirely necessary and I would like to thank them for their patience and understanding."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 16:139. Alternatively, or alternatively to stay 100% anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
