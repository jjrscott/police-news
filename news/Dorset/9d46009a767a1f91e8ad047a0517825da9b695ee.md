# Witness appeal following road rage incident in Weymouth

04 April 2018

* * *

Officers investigating a road rage incident in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The incident occurred at around 10.40am on Monday 2 April 2018 at the Wessex roundabout, which connects the B3157 Granby Way, B3157 Hampshire Road and Radipole Lane.

A silver Peugeot 206 stopped at the roundabout and a white panel van pulled up behind it and was beeping its horn.

The driver, a woman aged in her 20s, became flustered and she and her passenger, a man also aged in his 20s, got out to swap drivers.

As the man walked round behind the Peugeot he could see the driver of the van shouting and swearing. The driver then intentionally drove forwards in his van, hitting the man in the legs and causing him to fall back against the Peugeot.

The van then reversed back before pulling forward around the Peugeot and drove off, causing the man to take avoiding action.

The victim did not sustain any serious injuries that required hospital treatment.

The driver of the van is described as a white man, of stocky build and bald and was wearing a navy blue jumper.

Police Constable Orchard, of Weymouth police, said: "It is very fortunate that the victim did not sustain more serious injuries and we are carrying out a number of enquiries to identify the van driver involved.

"I understand there were a number of other vehicles in the area at the time and I would urge anyone who witnessed the incident or who has dashcam fitted to their vehicle that may have captured it to please contact police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180048572. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
