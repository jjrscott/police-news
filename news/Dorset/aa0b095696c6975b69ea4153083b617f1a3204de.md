# Appeal for witnesses following aggravated burglary in Hamworthy

24 March 2019

* * *

Detectives investigating an aggravated burglary in Hamworthy are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 7.30pm yesterday, Saturday 23 March 2019, police were called to an address in Maryland Road in Hamworthy.

It was reported that two men, one of whom was known to one of the occupants, had attended the address and a short time later they were joined by three other men.

One of these men - described as black, around six feet two inches tall, of medium build and wearing black clothing - was reportedly in possession of a knife.

Another was said to be holding a black Taser device. He is described as white, around five feet nine inches tall, aged in his mid 30s with a receding hairline and was wearing jeans and a jacket.

The men took a number of items from the property, including a PlayStation 4 and a rose gold Samsung S7 Edge mobile phone, before all five suspects left the address together.

A white transit van was also reportedly seen in the area at the time of the offence, which may be linked to the incident.

During the incident one of the victims, a man aged in his 20s, sustained a cut to his hand and grazing to the other hand.

Officers attended and carried out a search of the area. Enquiries are ongoing to locate the suspects.

Detective Constable Katie Spyrou, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We have launched a full investigation into this incident to identify the men responsible.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area of Maryland Road around the time of the offence, or anyone with information that can assist our investigation, to contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190044186. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
