# Witness appeal after man stabbed in Weymouth

04 May 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward after a man was stabbed in Weymouth.

Officers were called at 2.14pm yesterday, Thursday 3 May 2018, to Westwey Road following reports that a man had sustained stab wounds to his leg.

The man - a 38-year-old from Weymouth - was taken to hospital for treatment. His injuries are not described as life-threatening.

A search of the area was carried out and investigations remain ongoing. No arrests have been made at this stage. Part of the Rodwell Trail was cordoned off as part of the investigation but this has since been lifted.

Detective Inspector Andrea Power, of Weymouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the Westwey Road area at the relevant time and may have witnessed the incident or seen anyone acting suspiciously to please come forward.

"We have been making various enquiries into this incident and will continue to do so, including house-to-house visits and CCTV searches.

"I would like to reassure local residents that a full investigation is underway and would encourage anyone with any concerns to please speak to officers from the local neighbourhood policing team. There will be an increased police presence while investigations are ongoing and additional patrols will continue over the next few days."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 3:248. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
