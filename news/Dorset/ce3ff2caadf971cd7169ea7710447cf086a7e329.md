The bus driver who died in a fatal collision on Portland has been named by his family as James Patrick Spelman.

At around 4.55pm on Tuesday 14 March 2017, a serious collision occurred in New Road involving a single-decker First Bus, a white Citroen Relay Luton van registered to a company from Dorchester and a blue Alfa Romeo registered to a man from Portland.

Sadly Mr Spelman, who was driving the bus, was pronounced dead at the scene.

The family of Mr Spelman has today, Wednesday 15 March 2017, issued the following statement: "James was a very well-known figure in Weymouth and Portland and we are very grateful for all the well wishes and support from the community.

"We would request absolute privacy at this extremely difficult time."
