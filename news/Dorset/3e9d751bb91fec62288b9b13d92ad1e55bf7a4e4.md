Detectives in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following a firearm incident in the Townsend area of the town.

At 4.49pm Dorset Police received a report that two men holding a firearm demanded access to a property on Jewell Road in Bournemouth.

They did not gain entry and ran away from the scene. Nobody was injured.

Officers assisted by armed response officers and the NPAS helicopter attended. No arrests were made and enquiries are ongoing.

Detective Sergeant Karen Penn, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I would like to reassure people that we don't believe there is any threat to the general public.

"I would like to hear from anyone who saw two men running away from the area at the time and am appealing for any witnesses to the incident and anyone with information about the men involved to contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 28:321. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
