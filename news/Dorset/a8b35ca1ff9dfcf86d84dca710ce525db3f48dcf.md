# Road reopened following incident involving overturned trailer

25 July 2017

* * *

A major Dorset road has reopened following an incident involving an overturned trailer, which was being towed by a car.

Dorset Police received a call at around 3.15pm today, Tuesday 25 July 2017, of a trailer overturning on the A338 north of the Blackwater Junction.

The trailer was carrying a mobile toilet, which had slid off onto the verge.

The car did not overturn and nobody was injured in the incident.

Specialist equipment was required to recover the trailer and toilet and a considerable amount of debris had to be cleared from the carriageway, which resulted in the road being closed for several hours.

All obstructions were cleared at around 7.45pm.

Chief Inspector Bob Acaster, of Dorset Police, said: "We would like to thank members of the public for their patience while the necessary recovery work was carried out to clear the carriageway and make it safe for road users."
