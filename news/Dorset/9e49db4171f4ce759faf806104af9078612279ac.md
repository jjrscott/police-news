# Cross border operation targets criminals in rural Dorset

02 February 2017

* * *

A proactive operation aimed at tackling rural crime across three counties took place over the weekend.

Officers from Dorset, Hampshire and Avon & Somerset joined forces for the operation which ran between 6pm on Saturday 28 January and 2am on Sunday 29 January 2017 to detect and deter rural crime.

Around 40 special constables from the three forces patrolled the rural areas surrounding Ringwood, Verwood, Wimborne, Blandford, Shaftesbury, Sherborne, Yeovil, Dorchester and Wareham, with over 100 people and vehicle checks carried out.

As part of the operation, a 21-year-old man was arrested in North Dorset on suspicion of driving offences and is currently on police bail until the beginning of April 2017 pending further enquiries.

Special Inspector Hannah-May Hawkins, who led the operation on behalf of Dorset Police, said: "Rural crime has a considerable effect on our communities and together with neighbouring forces we have been able to deliver an enhanced level of policing through the use of our volunteer special constables. This team has given up their personal time to conduct this operation to make our communities a safer place to live. Their activity has delivered high-visibility patrols giving the message to would-be offenders of rural crime that Dorset is not a soft touch and we will deal with crimes robustly."

Special constables are volunteer police officers with the same powers as a police officer. Special constables are able to assist Dorset Police in dealing with crime and safeguarding the public.
