Detectives investigating an alleged assault in Poole are appealing for witnesses to come forward - with one man being arrested.

At 5.59pm on Saturday 24 July 2016 Dorset Police received a report of an altercation on Sandbanks Road near the junction with Sherwood Avenue in which one man sustained a head injury. The victim, a 51-year-old man from Poole, was taken to Poole Hospital.
