# Appeal following fail-to-stop collision near Sherborne

18 December 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward after a motorist knocked an elderly man from his mobility scooter before driving away from the scene near Sherborne.

Just before 2pm on Wednesday 16 December 2020 a local man aged in his 80s was riding his mobility scooter along an unnamed road in the village of Alweston when he was struck by an overtaking silver vehicle as he attempted to turn right.

The mobility scooter was pushed down the road as a result of the collision, before the victim was tipped from the scooter. The victim fell off the scooter into the road and sustained nasty cuts to his head and right arm. He was taken to hospital for treatment and later released to be cared for at home by his family.

The collision was witnessed by another motorist who went to the victim's aid. The driver of the offending vehicle, possibly an estate car, failed to stop at the scene.

Police Sergeant Tom Renshaw, of Dorset Police, said: "This collision has left the victim with nasty cuts to his head and arm and he has been extremely shaken by what happened. He now faces Christmas having to recover from his injuries rather than celebrating with his loved ones.

"I only have limited details of the vehicle involved. This collision would have caused damage to the silver car involved so again I am keen to hear from anyone who has noticed damage caused to a silver car since Wednesday.

"Finally, I would strongly urge the driver involved in this collision to do the right thing and contact us so we can take an account from you."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200188928. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
