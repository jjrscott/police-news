# Trick or treat safely this year and respect those who don’t want to be spooked

28 October 2020

* * *

Dorset Police are asking members of the community to respect the 'rule of six' both indoors and outdoors this Halloween.

To help protect our emergency services and save lives, Dorset Police are asking parents, carers and Halloween fans to consider many fun alternatives this year. There are plenty of ways to enjoy Halloween, from spooky window dressings to ghostly film nights.

Inspector Matt Baxter from Dorset Police said: "This year we are asking everyone, whatever they are doing for Halloween, to take extra care in this Tier One area. We all need to follow the rule of six, wear a face covering when appropriate, wash hands regularly and make space. We might all want to consider alternative ways to enjoy Halloween this year.

"We are encouraging young people to create online parties where they can invite as many people as they like. We also recommend those that are vulnerable and do not want uninvited guests to the door download our 'Sorry, No Trick or Treat' poster to display in the front door or window of their homes.

"There will be additional patrols across the county, and we ask everyone to respect each other, especially neighbours and the vulnerable who might be shielding."

The poster can be downloaded from the Dorset Police website.

Halloween - some alternatives to trick or treating for families and young children:

• Organise a Halloween themed scavenger hunt around your house or garden.
• Arrange a virtual fancy dress party online and invite your friends and family.
• Out-boo your neighbours and have a window decorating competition.
• Get creative in the kitchen. Go online to find the recipes for spooky snacks.
• Decorate your living room and create your own scary cinema.
• Play Halloween inspired games with your friends and family. Try Dorset Council's colouring craft activity
