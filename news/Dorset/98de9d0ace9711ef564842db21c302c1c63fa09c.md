# Update in relation to sudden death in Bournemouth

23 March 2021

* * *

Detectives investigating the sudden death of a man following a reported altercation in Bournemouth are issuing an update.

At 8.20pm on Monday 22 March 2021 Dorset Police was made aware by the ambulance service of a sudden death at an address in Malvern Road.

It was reported that at around 6.30pm an altercation had taken place involving two men. A short time later one of them became unwell and the ambulance service was called.

Sadly, a 55-year-old Bournemouth man was pronounced dead. His next of kin has been informed and the coroner notified.

A 56-year-old man from Bournemouth was arrested on suspicion of murder. He has now been released under investigation following a post-mortem examination that took place on the afternoon of Tuesday 23 March 2021.

Detective Inspector Simon Huxter, of Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team, said: "Our enquiries to date and the initial findings of the post-mortem examination indicate that there is nothing to suggest the death was the result of an assault or any form of violence.

"The final cause of death is still to be determined as we await the results of various laboratory tests, which are expected to take a number of weeks.

"Specialist officers have updated the deceased man's family throughout our investigation and our thoughts remain with them for their sad loss.

"We are liaising with HM Coroner and our enquiries are continuing to confirm the full circumstances of the death."

A police cordon at the address in Malvern Road has now been stood down.
