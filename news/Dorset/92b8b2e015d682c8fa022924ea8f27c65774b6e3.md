# Witness appeal following road rage incident in Poole

30 August 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a road rage incident in Poole.

At around 5.30pm on Tuesday 28 August 2018 an altercation occurred on the B3068 near to Horizon Honda involving the occupants of a silver Ford Focus and a Volkswagen car.

During the incident a fight took place. A 40-year-old man from Bournemouth was taken to hospital for treatment to serious but not life-threatening injuries.

Detective Sergeant Ian Allen, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was a nasty assault that was witnessed by several children in other cars who were frightened by what they saw.

"Following initial enquiries I have been unable to trace the VW car and I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the time and can help identify the vehicle or may have relevant dashcam footage to please contact me.

"Finally, I would like to make a direct appeal to the occupants of the VW car to please make contact with me so I can establish exactly what happened and whether any other injuries were sustained."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 55180139369. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
