# Appeal following suspicious behaviour in Dorchester

27 August 2019

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a man was seen acting suspiciously in the Fordington Fields area of Dorchester.

At approximately 12.15am on Monday 26 August 2019 a woman was inside an address when she noticed a man with a torch standing in the corner of a car park on Kensington Walk.

The woman left her address and approached the man to ask him what he was doing, but he did not respond and left the area.

The man is described as white, aged in his late 30s, five feet ten inches tall and of large build. He was wearing dark-coloured jogging bottoms, a T-shirt, a dark-coloured bomber jacket and a beanie hat.

Detective Constable Gerald Marchant, of Weymouth CID, said: "I am keen to find out what the man was doing in the area and am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed a man acting suspiciously at the relevant time to get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190133547. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
