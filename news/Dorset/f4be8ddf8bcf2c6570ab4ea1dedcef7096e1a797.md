# Witness appeal following theft of lead from school on Portland

01 September 2016

* * *

Officers investigating a theft of lead from a school on Portland are asking witnesses and anyone with information to come forward.

During an inspection of Brackenbury Infants School on Three Yards Close on Monday 22 August 2016, it was discovered that 50 per cent of the lead of one of the roofs had been stolen, with the remaining amount cut up ready to be taken away.

It is unknown when this theft happened, although it would be after the beginning of August.

Police Constable Kevin Miller, of Weymouth and Portland police, said: "The same school was victim of another lead theft in May this year. The cost of this was in excess of Â£5000.

"I am appealing for any witnesses who have seen suspicious activity around the school throughout August to come forward.

"Anyone with information about those responsible should contact us as soon as possible."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 22:186. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
