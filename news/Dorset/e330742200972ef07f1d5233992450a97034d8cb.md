A man has been charged in connection with the reported theft of a child's bicycle from outside a Bournemouth shop.

At around 6pm on Tuesday 26 March 2019 a local 12-year-old boy left his Apollo racer bike insecure outside the Co-op on Wimborne Road in Moordown. He returned to discover it had been reportedly stolen.

A CCTV appeal was issued by officers on Thursday 18 April 2019. On Friday 26 April 2019 a 29-year-old local man was arrested on suspicion of theft.

He has been charged with theft of a pedal cycle and is due to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 14 May 2019.

The bike has been recovered but is reported to have been damaged.
