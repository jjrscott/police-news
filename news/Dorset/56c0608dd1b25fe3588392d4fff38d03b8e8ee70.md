# Appeal for information following fail-to-stop collision in Christchurch

11 November 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage to come forward following a fail-to-stop collision in Christchurch.

Some time between 9.45pm and 10.15pm on Friday 1 November 2019 a collision occurred in Saxon Square involving a taxi and a man on a bicycle.

The cyclist, aged in his 40s, did not sustain any serious injuries but his bicycle was badly damaged. The taxi driver reportedly made off from the scene without giving his details.

He was believed to be driving an independent taxi, which was yellow and possibly a Vauxhall Astra or similar vehicle. The driver is described as white, aged in his 50s and with grey, medium-length hair and glasses.

Police Constable Sam Kinsella, of Christchurch police, said: "We have been making enquiries to try and trace the vehicle involved and identify the driver but have so far been unsuccessful.

"I am appealing to any members of the public who witnessed this incident or who may have captured it on dashcam to please contact us.

"I would also urge the driver involved to do the right thing and come forward to give your account."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190173543. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
