# Update – Reported robbery at shop in Poole – witness appeal

07 November 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating a reported robbery at a shop in Poole have arrested a woman.

The incident happened at around 11.20am on Tuesday 6 November 2018 at St Mary's News on St Mary's Road.

It was reported that two men wearing scarfs around their faces entered the store and threatened members of staff with a weapon, believed to be a hand gun. It is not known if it was real or a replica.

The men then reportedly took a quantity of cigarettes, cash and a phone before making off in a black Vauxhall Corsa or similar vehicle.

No one sustained any physical injuries.

Officers attended and a search of the area was carried out. Attempts to identify those responsible remain ongoing.

A 25-year-old Poole woman has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit robbery and is assisting officers with their enquiries.

Detectives are still appealing for anyone with information about the incident who has not already spoken to police to come forward. They are also keen to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time of the incident and may have relevant dashcam footage
