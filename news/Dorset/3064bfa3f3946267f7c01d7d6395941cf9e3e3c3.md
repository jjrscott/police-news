# Two arrests made in connection with burglaries in North Dorset

25 June 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a series of reported burglaries in North Dorset have arrested two people and are issuing crime prevention advice to residents.

Between Friday 14 June and Monday 24 June 2019 eight burglaries occurred in the north of the county.

There were five incidents in Shaftesbury - two in Beaufoy Close, one in Anstee Road, one in French Mill Rise and another in Badger Walk. Two occurred in Sturminster Newton at addresses in North Fields and Selwood Close and one in Orchard Close in Stourpaine.

In each incident it is reported that access was gained via insecure doors at night and in the early hours of the morning when the occupants have been inside.

On Monday 24 June 2019 a 30-year-old man of no fixed abode was arrested on suspicion of burglary and a 42-year-old woman from Wiltshire was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit burglary with intent to steal. They remain assisting officers with their enquiries.

Inspector Simon Perry, of North Dorset police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity at addresses in these areas between the relevant dates to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would also like to remind all residents that they can take a number of simple crime prevention steps to help protect themselves from becoming victims of crime. This includes ensuring that all doors and windows are closed and locked.
