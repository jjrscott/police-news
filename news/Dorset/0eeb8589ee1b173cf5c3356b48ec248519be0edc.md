# Witness appeal following disturbance in Bournemouth

19 May 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a report of a disturbance in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The incident occurred at around 10.20am on Saturday 16 May 2020. Two men, aged in their 20s, who are known to each other, were reportedly involved in an altercation on Moore Avenue, between the junctions of Springwater Road and Coleman Road.

One of the men allegedly caused damage to a pane of glass in the door of a property, causing a slight injury to his hand. The other man then followed him onto the road and reportedly pushed him to the floor and kicked him in the ribs.

The two men were known to each other.

Police Constable Mark Carlton, of Dorset Police, said: "We are continuing to investigate this incident and have spoken to both parties involved. No arrests have been made.

"I am now appealing for any independent witnesses who have not already spoken to police to please contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200069179. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
