# Update – CCTV appeal following reported burglary at Bournemouth store

18 July 2019

* * *

A man has been interviewed by police in connection with a reported burglary at a shop in Westbourne.

A CCTV appeal was issued in relation to a reported break-in that occurred at 1.20am on Tuesday 21 May 2019 at the Tesco Express in Poole Road.

A quantity of scratchcards, worth more than £1,000, were allegedly stolen from the store and a number of them were reportedly cashed in at Central Convenience Store in Seamoor Road later that same morning.

Following enquiries by officers, a 44-year-old Bournemouth man has attended for a voluntary interview with police and is assisting with the investigation. No arrests have been made.
