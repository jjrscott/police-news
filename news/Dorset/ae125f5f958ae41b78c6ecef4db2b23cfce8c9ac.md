# Man found not guilty following the death of a family member in Bournemouth

11 February 2021

* * *

A man has been found not guilty of manslaughter by reason of insanity following the death of a family member in Bournemouth.

Giuseppe Vittorio Stefano Zerega, 31 and of Old Christchurch Road in Bournemouth, was found not guilty at Winchester Crown Court on Thursday 11 February 2021 following a trial. He was also found not guilty in relation to two counts of attempted murder.

The case is due to be listed for a sentencing hearing on Friday 26 February 2021.

At 2.20am on Friday 19 June 2020 Dorset Police was called by the ambulance service to a report that a man had sustained stab wounds at an address in Eldon Place in the Westbourne area.

The victim, 45-year-old Fabio Menegon, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

During the incident, a woman aged in her 40s sustained a number of stab wounds, including a cut to her lower eyelid, as well as a bite mark on her hand. A teenage boy also sustained a stab wound to his arm and a bite mark on his thumb. Their injuries were not life-threatening.

Officers located Zerega in the garden of the neighbouring property and he was arrested and taken to hospital for treatment to injuries he sustained during the incident.

Following an assessment by mental health professionals, he was subsequently detained under the Mental Health Act.

A post-mortem examination revealed that Mr Menegon died from stab wounds to the head and trunk.

Detective Chief Inspector Jez Noyce, of Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT), said: "The particular circumstances made this a very tragic case and my sympathies remain with the family and friends of Fabio Menegon as they try to come to terms with their loss."

The partner of Fabio Menegon has provided the following tribute: "I don't think anyone can understand the horror that we have experienced and are continuing to live through. No words could possibly describe the loss of Fabio; of our hopes, our trust, our relationship and the pain and emptiness that we are living with.

"Fabio was one of a kind. He was a true gentleman, big-hearted, devoutly Catholic and a deeply faithful man. He was a life partner and a stepfather to love and be grateful for; a brother to cherish. Nothing mattered more to Fabio than family and friends. Fabio made a difference in the lives of all he touched; his smile could light up a whole room, he was so warm and welcoming.

"All I want is to have our old life back, but that's impossible. I miss the inside jokes. I miss hearing about his day at work. I miss his laugh. I miss his touch and the sound of his voice when he'd tell me he loves me. We have so many memories that I will treasure for the rest of my life.

"I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone at Dorset Police who has assisted with this investigation, all of the staff at University Hospitals Dorset who treated us and to everyone who has been there to support us and Fabio's family throughout this time and who continue to do so.

"Fabio lives on in our hearts no matter how broke they are."
