# Update â€“ photo appeal following reported hate crime incident in Poole

08 August 2018

* * *

A man has come forward in connection with a reported assault and racially aggravated public order incident in Poole.

It was reported that at around 12.05am on Sunday 8 July 2018 the victim, a male taxi driver aged in his 40s, picked up two men and a woman in Market Street. Another woman tried to get in the vehicle as well but the driver said he had no more room and she left.

It was reported that moments later, the vehicle was driving in Old Orchard when one of the male passengers jumped forward out of his seat and made racist remarks toward the taxi driver.

The driver stopped the vehicle and told the man to get out, but he refused. The driver took his phone out and took a photo of the man, who then reportedly hit the victim's hand, causing the phone to strike him in the face. The man then allegedly hit the taxi driver directly in the face.

Following a photo appeal being issued, a 50-year-old man from Poole has come forward to officers and is assisting them with their enquiries. No arrests have been made.
