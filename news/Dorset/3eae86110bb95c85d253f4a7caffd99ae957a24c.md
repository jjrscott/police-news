27 September 2019

* * *

Officers are asking for the public's help to identify a man who assaulted a pensioner in Poole by grabbing her around the throat and forcing her to the ground.

The incident occurred at 3pm on Thursday 19 September 2019 in Whitecliff Park.

The victim reports she was walking her dog in the park when she witnessed a man beating his dog. She approached the unknown man and challenged him. The suspect is said to have held the victim by her throat, forced her to the ground and shouted abuse at her.

The suspect is described as white, around five feet 11 inches tall, aged in his mid-40s and with short white hair. He was described as wearing a hearing aid, a dark green short-sleeved top with a logo on the front and had a strap across his chest. His dog is described as a large white dog, possibly an Italian Spinone.

Police Constable Fiona Tricks, of Poole police, said: "This was a very violent and frightening incident involving an elderly woman and I need to identify and speak to the suspect. I have also been in contact with the RSPCA.

"I am aware this incident occurred on a sunny day and there would have been a number of people in the area. I would ask anyone who witnessed this incident and has not yet spoken to police to please contact me.

"Finally, I would urge the suspect to please come forward so we can establish the full circumstances surrounding this incident."
