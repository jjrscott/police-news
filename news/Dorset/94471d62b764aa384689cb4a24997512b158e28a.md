# UPDATE â€“ Reported fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth

31 October 2016

* * *

A second man has been arrested following a reported fail-to-stop road traffic collision in Bournemouth.

At around 4.47am on Thursday 27 October 2016 a collision occurred in Poole Road at the junction of Queens Road involving a gold Vauxhall Tigra and a cyclist. It was reported that the Tigra failed to stop at the scene and was found abandoned nearby a short time later. It has been recovered by officers.

The cyclist - a local man aged in his 30s - sustained serious injuries and was taken to Poole Hospital for treatment. His condition is not believed to be life-threatening.

A 19-year-old man from Bournemouth has been arrested on suspicion of driving offences and is currently assisting officers with enquiries.

A 21-year-old Bournemouth man arrested on Saturday 29 October 2016 on suspicion of driving offences has been released from police bail without charge.

It is alleged the Tigra had failed to stop for police officers in the early hours of Thursday 27 October 2016 and a police follow was aborted around two hours and 20 minutes prior to the collision.

However, as a marked police vehicle was in Poole Road at the time of collision the matter has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) as is mandatory in such circumstances. It would be inappropriate to comment further while the investigation takes place.
