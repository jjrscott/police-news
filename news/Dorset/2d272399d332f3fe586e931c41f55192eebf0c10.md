# UPDATE: Reported assault on woman in Bournemouth

15 December 2016

* * *

Officers investigating an alleged assault on a woman in Bournemouth are renewing their appeal - with one arrested man being released without charge.

The 44-year-old local man, who had been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, has been released with no further action. A 58-year-old local man who was arrested on suspicion of wounding with intent is still assisting officers with their enquiries.

The incident was reported to police at 10.28pm on Tuesday 13 December 2016 by the ambulance service after a local woman was found with serious injuries at Charminster Supermarket in Charminster Road.

The woman, aged in her 20s, was taken to hospital with serious head injuries. Her condition remains life-threatening.

The incident was subsequently linked to an alleged assault at an address in nearby Shelborne Road and it is believed that the injured woman had made her way from Shelborne Road to the supermarket where calls were made to emergency services.

The victim and arrested man are known to each other.

Detective Inspector Neil Wright, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am still appealing to anyone who witnessed or heard the incident in Shelborne Road to please contact Dorset Police.

"I also believe people were talking to the injured woman outside the supermarket on Charminster Road. I would ask them to come forward as they may have important information that could help with our investigation."
