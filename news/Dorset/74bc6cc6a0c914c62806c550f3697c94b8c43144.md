# Recovered items following warrant - public appeal

01 November 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for the public's help to find the owners of a number of items recovered following a warrant near Wimborne.

Dorset Police executed a warrant under the Theft Act at 2.30pm on Tuesday 30 October 2018 at an address in Holt.

During the large-scale search a number of power tools and gardening equipment were seized by Police, some of which are alleged to have been stolen.

Immediately before the search, a reportedly stolen vehicle was also recovered nearby and a 17-year-old boy from Ringwood was arrested on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle and going equipped for theft of a motor vehicle.

A 32-year-old man of no fixed abode was arrested on suspicion of theft and another 17-year-old boy from Wimborne was arrested on suspicion of dwelling burglary and theft. All three have been released under investigation.

Inspector Stuart Pitman, of East and North Dorset police, said: "We suspect these recovered items may have been stolen from private and business addresses and I am keen to reunite them with their owners.

"Efforts are being made to identify the remaining items from previous burglary reports, but I would urge anyone who has been a victim and may not have reported the offence to police to please come forward.

"We are fully committed to protecting our rural communities and I see this as a continuation of our efforts to achieve this.

"We are determined to identify anyone who is involved in suspected burglaries or handling stolen goods and would like to reassure the public that we will do everything within our powers to do so, including executing warrants and through proactive operations."
