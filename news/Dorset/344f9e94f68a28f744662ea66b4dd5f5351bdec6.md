# Man due in court in connection with reported assault and criminal damage in Bournemouth

12 February 2021

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with an alleged assault and criminal damage incident in Bournemouth.

At around 7.15pm on Saturday 11 July 2020 a male care worker aged in his 40s was out for a walk with other care workers and a patient on Cunningham Place. The patient became distressed and began to struggle with the carers.

It is reported that two men who were in the area came to assist the patient and the carers explained to the men that they were looking after the person.

Despite this, an altercation allegedly occurred and the victim was struck on the head, causing a small bump to his forehead. His mobile phone was also reportedly damaged during the incident.

Following an image appeal, two men were identified.

A 29-year-old man of Bournemouth has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 23 February 2021 for two counts of assault by beating, possession of an offensive weapon, criminal damage and causing racially-aggravated harassment, alarm or distress.

Attempts continue to be made to locate a second man.
