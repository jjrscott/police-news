# Man cleared of manslaughter charge in relation to death of man in Weymouth

23 December 2020

* * *

A man has been cleared of a manslaughter charge in connection with the death of a man at an address in Weymouth.

At 4.13pm on Saturday 4 April 2020 Dorset Police was called to a report of a possible assault at an address on Dorchester Road.

Officers attended, along with the ambulance service, and found 32-year-old David Thomson with a serious head injury. He was taken to hospital for treatment where he sadly died on the morning of Sunday 5 April 2020.

A full investigation was carried out by detectives from Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT).

41-year-old Daniel Michael Ribton, from Weymouth, was arrested in connection with the incident and subsequently charged.

Following a five-day trial at Winchester Crown Court, the jury found him not guilty of manslaughter and assault on Friday 11 December 2020.

He was previously formally found not guilty of an alternative charge of murder.

The jury did not reach a verdict in relation to a second defendant, who was also charged in connection with the incident, and he is due to face a re-trial in 2021. The date is yet to be confirmed.

Detective Inspector Wayne Seymour, of MCIT, said: "We respect the decision of the court and our thoughts remain with the family and friends of Mr Thomson."
