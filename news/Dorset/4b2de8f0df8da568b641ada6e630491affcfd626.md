# Public appeal following burglary at hair salon in Shaftesbury

16 November 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a burglary at a hair salon in Shaftesbury.

Overnight on Friday 13 November into Saturday 14 November 2020 a break-in occurred at Kalypsos salon on High Street. An alarm was activated at the premises at 2.17am on Saturday 14 November and it is believed that this is when the burglary occurred.

During the incident, a glass panel of the front door was smashed and around Â£3,000 worth of retail stock, including GHD hair straighteners, GHD hair dryers, Paul Mitchell gift sets and Joico gift sets, was stolen

It is possible that the person or people involved ran from the salon along Mustons Lane toward Bell Street.

Police Constable Nick May, of North Dorset police, said: "This crime has had a large impact on the owners of the business, who have already suffered a significant financial hit as a result of having to close during the coronavirus restrictions.

"I am appealing for any local residents and businesses who have not been approached by officers to please check their CCTV systems for any suspicious people or vehicles in the area at the relevant time.

"I would also urge anyone who has been offered similar items for sale in suspicious circumstances to get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200171135. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
