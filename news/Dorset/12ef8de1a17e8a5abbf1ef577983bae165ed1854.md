A man has come forward following an appeal in relation to a reported incident involving out of control dogs in East Dorset.

The incident occurred at around 10.05am on Wednesday 19 February 2020 on the track between the Avon Causeway and Hurn Bridge Sports Club. It was reported that two dogs off the lead chased two women who were riding their horses.

One of the horses tripped, causing the rider to fall and she was taken to hospital for treatment to a broken collar bone.

Following an appeal to identify the owner of the dogs involved, a man has come forward and is assisting officers with their enquiries into the incident.
