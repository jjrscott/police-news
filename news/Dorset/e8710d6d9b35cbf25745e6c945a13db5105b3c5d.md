A man has been charged and is due to appear in court in connection with a reported burglary in Bournemouth.

At 10.30pm on Thursday 30 August 2018 Dorset Police received a report from a homeowner who was away from their residence in Glenferness Avenue and had been alerted by a doorbell video camera to someone at his property at around 9.40pm. He received a further report from his alarm company at 9.50pm following an activation at his house.

It was subsequently reported that entry had been forced to the property but nothing appeared to have been taken.

Following a CCTV appeal issued by detectives, a 37-year-old Poole man was arrested and has been charged with burglary. He is due to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court today, Tuesday 30 October 2018.
