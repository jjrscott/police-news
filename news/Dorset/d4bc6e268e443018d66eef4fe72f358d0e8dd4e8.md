# Man jailed for burglaries in Bournemouth

10 March 2021

* * *

A man who admitted burglaries at two homes in Bournemouth has been jailed for more than four years.

Andrew Roy Donoghue, aged 38 and of Suffolk Road, Bournemouth, appeared at Bournemouth Crown Court on Tuesday 9 March 2021 and admitted two charges of burglary. He was sentenced to a total of 52 months in prison.

At around 12pm on Monday 21 September 2020 the occupant of a home in Dulsie Road was asleep when they woke to find an intruder going through the drawers in their room. The man ran out of the room and out of the front door.

It was discovered that a ceramic pot of coins and a bottle of aftershave had been stolen. Damage was also caused to the front door.

Officers reviewed CCTV from properties in the road and Donoghue was identified as the suspect. An identification procedure was carried out and the victim positively identified the defendant.

The second charge related to a burglary that occurred at around 10am on Wednesday 14 October 2020 at a home in Rosemount Road. The resident returned home and heard someone in the rear of the property.

She went toward the rear of the house and saw a person running away. She discovered somebody had searched the premises and a number of items had been taken including laptops, GHD hair straighteners, a bank card and a silver hip flask.

Donoghue was arrested later that day for an unrelated matter at the address where they found a number of the stolen items from the Rosemount Road property. He was subsequently arrested in connection with the burglaries as well.

Police Constable Liam Moss, of Dorset Police's Priority Crime Team, said: "Andrew Donoghue forced his way into his victim's homes and it must have been very distressing for them to discover the defendant in their properties.

"I hope this case demonstrates we will do all we can do support victims of burglaries and ensure those who commit these offences are held accountable for their actions.

"I would also like to thank residents in Dulsie Road, Rosemount Road and the surrounding areas for their assistance and co-operation as we carried out our enquiries into these offences."
