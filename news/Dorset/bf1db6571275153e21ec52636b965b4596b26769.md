# Murder investigation in Bournemouth â€“ family tribute

22 December 2016

* * *

The family of Hayley Wall who died from injuries sustained in a reported assault in Bournemouth have issued a tribute.

At around 10.28pm on Tuesday 13 December 2016 Dorset Police received a report by the ambulance service that a local woman had been found with serious injuries outside Charminster Supermarket in Charminster Road.

The incident was subsequently linked to an alleged assault at an address in nearby Shelbourne Road and it is believed that the injured woman had made her way from that address to the supermarket where calls were made to emergency services.

The woman, identified as 25-year-old Hayley Wall, was taken to hospital with serious head injuries. Sadly she died in hospital in the early hours of today, Thursday 22 December 2016.

A murder investigation is underway, led by detectives from Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT).

In a tribute, Hayley's family said: "We would like to say as a family thank you to anybody who helped Hayley when she was hurt. Our little 'Wiggy' and her beautiful smile will be sorely missed."

Christopher Wall, 58 and of Bournemouth, has been charged with wounding with intent and is next due to appear before Bournemouth Crown Court on Thursday 19 January 2017.

Detectives are still appealing for three women who cared for Hayley before the ambulance arrived to come forward and have issued a CCTV image of them.

They are also keen to hear from anyone who saw Hayley as she walked from Shelbourne Road to Charminster Road between 9pm and 10.30pm on Tuesday 13 December 2016.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 13:426. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
