Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward as they investigate a burglary in Bere Regis.

A garage in the Rye Hill area was broken into some time between 6pm on Monday 25 May and 5pm on Tuesday 26 May 2020. Two high-value Trek Bike bicycles, which were secured within the garage, were taken. They have a combined total of Â£8,000.

Police Community Support Investigator Adam Cleaver, of Dorset Police, said: "We are carrying out an investigation into this burglary and I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed any suspicious activity in the area between the relevant dates to please contact police.

"I would also like to hear from anyone with any information about who may be responsible for this burglary or who comes across the bikes for sale in unusual circumstances."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200074395.
