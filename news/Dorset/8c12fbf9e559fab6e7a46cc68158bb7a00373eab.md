# Murder investigation in Christchurch â€“ family tribute

10 September 2018

* * *

An event is being held in Christchurch for people to remember Sharon Perrett.

37-year-old Sharon was sadly pronounced dead at an address in Park Gardens in the early hours of Sunday 26 August 2018.

Officers are investigating the circumstances of her death and 38-year-old Daniel Raymond O'Malley Keyes, of Christchurch, has been charged with Sharon's murder.

Sharon's family have paid tribute to her, saying: "She'd light up the room with her beaming smile and outgoing personality."

The family have requested privacy at this difficult time.

Highcross Church on Amethyst Road in Somerford, Christchurch, will be open from 3pm to 5pm on Sunday 16 September for anyone who would like to attend in order to remember Sharon.

This will not be a formal service but will be an opportunity for people to light a candle, pray or sit and reflect. The vicar Rev Paul O'Connor will be present should anyone like to speak with him and there will be a book of condolence for people to leave messages.

Details of Sharon's funeral have not yet been confirmed and her family want her friends to know that there will be a delay but one will be arranged in the future.

The family say they are grateful to Sharon's friends who have started an online fundraising page.

They also want to thank Detective Inspector Rich Dixey and his team for all their support.

Sharon's family are urging anyone with any information in relation to her death to contact police if they have not already done so.

Anyone with information about the incident who has not already spoken to officers is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 26:57. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
