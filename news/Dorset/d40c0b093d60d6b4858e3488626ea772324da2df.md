Officers are appealing for information from the public after concern was raised for the welfare of a fisherman seen on the beach in Bournemouth.

Dorset Police received a report at 9.25am on Friday 9 October 2020 raising concern for a man who had been seen fishing in the area of Boscombe Pier on the night of Thursday 8 October 2020.

The man had a tent and fishing equipment with him and at 6am on Friday 9 October 2020 the member of the public saw the tent and equipment were still there but there was no sign of the man.

The fisherman is described as white, aged in his 40s to 50s with a receding hairline and bald on top. He was wearing a dark grey hooded top, light grey T-shirt with a large blue motif, dark navy jeans and black trainers with white soles.

Chief Inspector Steve Yeoman, of Dorset Police, said: "We have spoken to the coastguard and understand there was a large swell in the area last night so we are keen to locate this man to ensure he is all right and has not come to any harm.

"The last sighting of him was in the area of the pier at around 12.30am on Friday 9 October 2020 and we are carrying out searches, with assistance from HM Coastguard.

"I would urge anyone with information as to who this man might be or his whereabouts to please contact us immediately.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who saw this fisherman in the area last night or in the early hours of today."

Anyone with information or knowledge as to the described man's whereabouts is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 9:108.
