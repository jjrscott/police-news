# Witness appeal following road rage incident in Weymouth

01 August 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a road rage incident in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At approximately 5.55am on Tuesday 30 July 2019 a man was driving along Louviers Road in a grey Hyundai Ioniq when a vehicle braked heavily and slowed down in front of him.

The man overtook the car, believed to be a silver Vauxhall Astra, and continued his journey.

It was reported that the Vauxhall driver then began to follow closely behind the man.

When the vehicles reached Radipole Lane and the junction with Field Barn Drive the Vauxhall driver pulled out in front of the Hyundai and prevented him from driving ahead. Two men got out of the Vauxhall and started shouting abuse at the Hyundai driver.

When the Hyundai driver began to pull away, the Vauxhall driver got back in his vehicle and drove toward the victim causing him to move into the central reservation and damage the bumper of his car.

The Vauxhall driver is described as a white man of stocky build. He was wearing a beanie hat, a hooded top and blue jeans. The passenger is described as a white man, approximately six feet tall and of stocky build with a beard. He was also wearing a beanie hat, a hooded top, blue jeans and trainers.

Police Constable Caroline Orchard, of Weymouth police, said: "I am continuing to make enquiries into this incident but so far I have been unable to locate the offending driver.

"I would urge anyone who may have witnessed this incident or captured it on dashcam footage to get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk, or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190117750. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
