# Anti-social behaviour on Portland â€“ witness appeal

13 October 2016

* * *

Officers investigating an incident of anti-social behaviour on Portland are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At around 3.45pm on Monday 3 October 2016 a teenage girl was seen to behave anti-socially toward other young people by a bus stop at the junction of Reap Lane and Avalanche Road.

The offender, who was riding a BMX bicycle, shouted and swore and is said to have kicked another teenager.

A man pushing a child in a red buggy was walking in the area at the time and attempted to intervene. He was verbally abused by the girl.

Police Constable Darren Tharme, of Weymouth and Portland police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident and has yet to speak to officers to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly keen to hear from the man who was pushing a buggy in the area and made efforts to intervene."
