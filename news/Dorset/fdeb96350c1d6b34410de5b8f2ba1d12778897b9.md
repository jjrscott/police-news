# Witness appeal after reported street robbery in Bournemouth

08 October 2016

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses after a reported street robbery in Bournemouth - with one man being charged.

At around 7.50pm on Thursday 6 October 2016 a local woman aged in her 60s was travelling on the 5a bus from Bournemouth town centre when a man reportedly started talking to her.

The woman got off the bus on Fernheath Road and it is alleged the same man followed her and stole her handbag along Verney Road.

The victim fell to the ground during the incident where she sustained a cut to her eye needing three stitches and bruising to her face. She attended Royal Bournemouth Hospital for treatment.

A number of items were reportedly inside the handbag and have not yet been recovered. These include a dark grey purse containing cash and bank cards and a brass door key on a silver fob.

A 38-year-old Bournemouth man has been charged with robbery and was due to appear at Bournemouth Magistrates' Court this morning, Saturday 8 October 2016.

Detective Constable Matt Bradley, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to any witnesses who have not yet spoken to police to come forward.

"I would also ask the public to remain vigilant for the items listed and please report any such items to police."
