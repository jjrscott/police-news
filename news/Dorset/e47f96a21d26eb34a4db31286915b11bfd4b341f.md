# Witness appeal following fatal road traffic collision in East Dorset

25 August 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following a fatal road traffic collision near Verwood.

At around 5.45am today, Saturday 25 August 2018, a collision involving a blue Peugeot 208 and a pedestrian occurred on the B3081 Verwood Road, near to the Somerley Household Waste Recycling Centre.

Very sadly the pedestrian - a 23-year-old man from Verwood - was pronounced dead at the scene. His family have been informed and the coroner has been notified.

The driver of the Peugeot - a 29-year-old woman - was uninjured.

Road closures have been put in place to allow the emergency services to attend the incident and to allow for an investigation of the scene.

Police Sergeant Fern Graham, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the family of the young man involved and they are being supported by specially trained officers.

"We are carrying out an investigation into the details of the collision and I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or has any information that can assist our enquiries to contact police.

"I am also keen to hear from any motorists who may have captured the incident on dashcam.

"Finally, I understand the road closures may cause some inconvenience to motorists but I would like to reassure members of the public that they are entirely necessary to allow the emergency services to deal with the incident and establish what happened."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at scit@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 25:105. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
