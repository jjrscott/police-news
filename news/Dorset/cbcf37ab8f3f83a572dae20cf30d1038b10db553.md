# Man due in court in connection with serious injury collision at Lytchett Matravers

16 February 2021

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with a serious road traffic collision at Lytchett Matravers.

Dorset Police was called at 5.23am on Monday 14 September 2020 to reports of a collision on the A35 near the Axim Centre involving a white Mitsubishi Outlander and a white Keeway Logik motorcycle.

The rider of the motorcycle - a 28-year-old man from Weymouth - sustained very serious injuries and was taken to Southampton General Hospital for treatment. He has since been discharged from hospital and is continuing his recovery at home.

Following enquiries, a 46-year-old man from the Poole area has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 23 February 2021 for an offence of driving without due care and attention.
