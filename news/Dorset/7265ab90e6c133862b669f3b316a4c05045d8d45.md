# Witness appeal following fail-to-stop collision in Weymouth

25 November 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a fail-to-stop collision in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 3.55pm on Sunday 22 November 2020 a green Volkswagen Golf was involved in a collision with a silver Volkswagen Golf on Spa Road near to the junction with Kings Road.

It is reported that the silver Volkswagen Golf initially stopped just before the bridge, before leaving the scene in the direction of Dorchester Road.

Officers attended to carry out enquiries in the area. No one was injured in the collision.

Police Constable Katherine Rupp, of Weymouth police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the area and witnessed what happened to please get in touch.

"I am also keen to hear from any motorists who were travelling along Spa Road at the relevant time and may have captured any dashcam footage to assist my investigation.

"Finally, I would like to appeal directly to the driver of the silver Volkswagen Golf if they see this appeal to contact us so we can take your account."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200175943. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
