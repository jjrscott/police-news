Officers investigating a fail-to-stop collision in Poole are appealing for anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

At 4.10pm on Monday 8 July 2019 it was reported that a cyclist was knocked off her bicycle by a white van opposite Hollywood Bowl on Poole Road.

The cyclist, a local woman, sustained minor injuries.

Police Constable Debbie Day, of Poole police, said: "The driver of the van failed to stop at the scene and I am making enquiries to locate them.

"I am keen to hear from anyone who may have captured the collision on dashcam.

"I believe there were a number of people in the area at the time and I am also appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision and has not yet spoken to police to come forward."
