# Update to investigation into report of rape on Portland

09 September 2019

* * *

A man arrested in connection with a reported rape of an 11-year-old girl on Portland has been released on police bail.

It was reported that the victim was with her 14-year-old friend when she met a male cyclist in the area of Easton Square at around 3am on Saturday 31 August 2019.

The two girls and the cyclist then walked onto Park Road, past the Tesco supermarket and down a track to an old stone windmill next to the stone quarries to the south of Easton, where the offence is reported to have occurred.

On the evening of Saturday 7 September 2019 detectives arrested a 22-year-old local man on suspicion of rape. He has been released on police bail while enquiries continue.

An 18-year-old local man who was arrested on Sunday 1 September 2019 on suspicion of rape has been released from the investigation and will face no further police action.

Inspector Wayne Seymour, of Dorset Police, said: "Our investigation continues and I would yet again appeal for anyone who saw two girls with a male cyclist in the Easton area in the early hours of Saturday 31 August 2019, or who has any information that may assist our investigation, to please come forward."
