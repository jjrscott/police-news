# Warn vulnerable members of the community about fraud this Christmas

08 December 2017

* * *

**As part of this year’s Christmas campaign, Dorset Police is reminding the public to be aware of fraud and spread the word.**

Christmas can offer fraudsters increased opportunities to trick people. Unfortunately fraud is often targeted at vulnerable and elderly members of the community.

Fraudsters are cunning in their tactics and it is not always easy or obvious to tell straight away whether it is a scam. Fraud can be conducted in many ways, some of the most common are cyber-crime, telephone scams and doorstep crime such as distraction burglary and rogue traders.

Detective Inspector Neil Wright, from the Volume Crime Team, said: “One of the most important things you can do this festive period is make yourself aware of common fraud trends and then simply talk to and educate friends, relatives and neighbours, so they know how to protect themselves from becoming victims.

“People often feel embarrassed about being a victim of fraud, but there is no reason to be. It can happen to anyone as fraudsters are clever and extremely manipulative. Please ensure you report fraud or attempted scams as it helps us to understand the new trends and techniques being used by criminals so that we can work to combat them, as well as warn others before they become victims.”

Action Fraud is nationally responsible for the assessment of all reports of fraud and ensures that reports reach the right place. Action Fraud should be your first point of contact if you or someone you know has been a victim. Call 0300 123 2040 or visit www.actionfraud.police.uk
