13 July 2018

* * *

A woman who was in a critical condition in hospital has sadly died.

At 11.14am on Wednesday 11 July 2018 Dorset Police received a report from a hospital that they were concerned for the welfare of a female patient in her 40s, who had been transferred to the critical care unit after being admitted to hospital on Saturday 7 July 2018. It had been reported that she had sustained bruising and had collapsed.

Very sadly the woman died in hospital yesterday evening, Thursday 12 July 2018. Her family has been informed and the coroner has been notified.

Detectives from Bournemouth CID have been investigating the circumstances of how the woman came to be in such a critical condition. A property in Knowlton Road formed part of that ongoing investigation.

Detective Inspector Neil Wright, of Bournemouth CID, said: "As a result of our investigations there is currently no indication of any third party involvement in this woman's death and it is not being treated as suspicious. Our enquiries will now be centered on collecting information on behalf of the coroner."

A post-mortem examination will be held in due course to establish the cause of death.

A 40-year-old man from Poole who was arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm with intent remains released under investigation.

A 28-year-old man from Poole who was arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm has also been released under investigation.
