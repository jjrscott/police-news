# Appeal for information following report of man impersonating police officer in Bournemouth

07 March 2019

* * *

Officers investigating reports of a man impersonating a police officer in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At 5.36pm on Wednesday 6 March 2019 Dorset Police received a report from a woman in Wellington Road reporting that a suspicious man had attended her address claiming to be a police officer and wanting to search her home. The man was not in uniform.

The woman asked to see the man's ID and he responded by saying: "You don't need to see my ID, I'm undercover."

The man had a set of handcuffs and an earpiece in his right ear.

The woman let him into a communal area but then told him she was calling police, at which point the man left the scene.

The man is described as white, aged around 20 and with dark hair. He was wearing a black jacket and dark trousers and had a bandage on a finger on his left hand.

Police Constable Joe Terry, of Bournemouth police, said: "We would urge anyone with information about this incident or anybody who has experienced anything similar to contact us.

"I would urge residents to be vigilant and not to let anyone into your home if you have any doubts about their identity.

"Our officers will always carry their identification and will be willing to show it if asked. If there is any doubt contact Dorset Police on 101 to check their validity."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190034799. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
