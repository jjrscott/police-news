# Survey asks public how they want to communicate with Dorset Police

18 November 2020

* * *

The public is being asked how they would like to communicate with Dorset Police as part of the second phase of a major survey.

The survey seeks people’s views on how they would prefer to contact Dorset Police, as well as how they would like to learn more about the ongoing work being carried out by the Force.

Findings will be used to help the Force develop the way it communicates with the public, and anyone who lives, works in or visits the county is now being asked to spend a few minutes completing the survey.

Phase two of the survey launched on Wednesday 18 November and closes on Monday 14 December 2020.

Chief Constable James Vaughan said: “The Force receives thousands of calls, emails and other messages every week, and we work hard to communicate openly and quickly.

“We want to make sure the public can receive help or information from us as effectively as possible, and so as we continue to invest in new technology and make improvements, it’s essential we know what matters most to the people who we serve.”

The survey looks into which option members of the public would choose if they wanted to report a non-emergency matter to Dorset Police, and how they would expect to be treated if they had to make an emergency call to the Force.

It also asks people which methods they would prefer Dorset Police to use to provide information to the public, and what types of public engagement they regard as being the most important.

This is the second part of the Force’s countywide survey, called Your Dorset. Your Police. Your View.

The first part, launched in October, looked into how much residents knew about some of the national and regional crime-fighting organisations the Force works alongside, such as the South West Regional Organised Crime Unit and the National Crime Agency. It also provided an opportunity for the public to find out more about the work carried out by these teams.

Chief Constable James Vaughan continued: “Listening to your views is important to Dorset Police. Findings from previous surveys have helped shaped the Force we are today and the information we receive from you over the next few weeks will help steer our future direction.

“This survey is important to help us make sure we provide the best service possible, so please take a few moments to complete it and let us know your thoughts.”
