# UPDATE â€“ Arrest made following reported religiously aggravated assault in Bournemouth

15 August 2016

* * *

A man has been arrested in connection with a reported religiously aggravated assault on a woman in Bournemouth.

At around 2.20am on Saturday 13 August 2016 it was reported that a Turkish woman aged in her 20s was walking in Charminster Road close to Cemetery Junction when she was approached by a man who was walking towards Bournemouth town centre.

It is alleged the man made a religious comment to the woman before punching her on the side of her face. She sustained bruising to her head but did not require medical treatment.

A 55-year-old man from Bournemouth was arrested yesterday evening, Sunday 14 August 2016, on suspicion of racially or religiously aggravated assault and is currently assisting officers with enquiries.

Officers from the local Neighbourhood Policing Team will be carrying out high-visibility patrols in the area to reassure the community and can be contacted with any concerns.
