# Appeal for good Samaritan to come forward following alleged assault in Weymouth

30 October 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for a good Samaritan to come forward following a reported assault on a vulnerable man in Weymouth.

Dorset Police was called to the Weymouth & Portland Borough Council building on Commercial Road at around 3.15pm on Monday 29 October 2018.

The vulnerable 46-year-old victim was brought into the reception area by a woman reporting that he had been assaulted and that he was very upset. She did not leave any details and left once the victim was safe in the office.

It was alleged that the victim was hit across the face in the area of the Commercial Road car park. He did not require medical treatment.

Following enquiries, officers arrested a 15-year-old boy from Weymouth on suspicion of assault. He has been released under investigation.

Police Constable Ryan Lloyd, of Weymouth police, said: "I would like to praise the woman for coming to the victim's aid and taking him to a place of safety.

"I am appealing to her to please make contact with us as she may have vital information that could assist with the investigation.

"I would also ask anyone who witnessed the incident to contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180175029. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
