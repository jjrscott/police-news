# UPDATE â€“ Renewed appeal following fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth

28 October 2016

* * *

Officers investigating a fail-to-stop road traffic collision in Bournemouth are calling on two passing motorists to come forward.

At around 4.47am yesterday, Thursday 27 October 2016, a collision occurred in Poole Road at the junction of Queens Road involving a gold Vauxhall Tigra and a cyclist. The Tigra failed to stop at the scene and was found abandoned nearby a short time later. It has been recovered by officers.

The cyclist - a local man aged in his 30s - sustained serious injuries and was taken to Poole Hospital for treatment. His condition is not believed to be life-threatening.

Police Constable Craig Tatton, of Dorset Police's Traffic Unit, said: "As part of my investigation I have established that a silver van, possibly a Vauxhall Vivaro or a Renault Traffic, and a yellow taxi were travelling along Poole Road at the time of the collision.

"I would urge those drivers, or any passengers, to please contact Dorset Police urgently as I believe they may have important information that could assist my investigation.

"I am still keen to hear from anyone who saw the Tigra being driven in the Bournemouth area prior to the incident or immediately after."

The Tigra had failed to stop for police officers in the early hours of Thursday 27 October 2016. The police follow was aborted around two hours and 20 minutes prior to the collision.

However, as a marked police vehicle was in Poole Road at the time of collision the matter has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) as is mandatory in such circumstances. It would be inappropriate to comment further while the investigation takes place.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55160162150. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
