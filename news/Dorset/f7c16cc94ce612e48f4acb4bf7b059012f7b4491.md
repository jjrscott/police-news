# Witness appeal following assault on elderly dog walker in Poole

18 January 2019

* * *

Officers investigating an assault on an elderly dog walker in Poole are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

At around 2.45pm on Wednesday 19 December 2018 the victim - a local man aged in his 80s - was walking his Border Collie off the lead in Hamworthy Park when he heard a noise between his dog and another dog, which was also off the lead. As he separated them, he was approached by the offender. He stated the victim's dog was attacking his and pushed the victim to the ground. He sustained grazes to his face and elbows.

The offender then picked up the victim's dog and threw it over a nearby fence or bridge. It is not reported the dog sustained any injuries.

He is described as aged in his 20s to 30s, of medium build, with dark mid-length hair and a beard. He wore jeans and dark clothing and was walking a brown and white Spaniel with a part of his tail missing.

Police Constable Phil Pearson, of Poole police, said: "We have only recently been able to speak to the victim due to illness and while this incident happened a number of weeks ago I hope that someone may recognise the offender from the description given of him or his dog.

"I would ask anyone with information about the offender, or anyone who witnessed the incident and is yet to speak to officers, to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180203243. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
