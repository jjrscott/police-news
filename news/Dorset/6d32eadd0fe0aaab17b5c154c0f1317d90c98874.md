# Man due in court in connection with dishonestly administering Botox

31 October 2016

* * *

A man is due to appear in court this week in connection with dishonestly administering Botox.

The 40-year-old of Uxbridge in Middlesex has been issued with a postal requisition to appear before Bournemouth Magistrates' Court on Friday 4 November 2016.

He is facing three counts of causing grievous bodily harm and two of fraud by false representation. The alleged offences date back to November 2011 and July 2013 in Poole and Bristol.

It is claimed that the man dishonestly made a false representation to others that he was qualified and a legitimate supplier, prescriber and administer of Botox.

A 49-year-old woman of Lytchett Matravers has also been issued with a postal requisition to appear at the same court on the same date in connection with the same alleged offence. She is facing two counts of fraud by false representation and one charge of possessing goods for sale with a false trademark.
