# Independent investigation underway into death of a man following police contact

12 April 2017

* * *

An independent investigation is underway into the death of a man following police contact in Poole.

Police were called at 4.12pm and 4.19pm on Tuesday 11 April 2017 due to concern for the welfare of a man who was reported to be acting erratically and walking in and out of traffic in Poole.

When officers arrived, a man matching the description was found on The Avenue. He was restrained while officers assessed the situation.

While with officers he suffered a medical emergency. The ambulance service was requested to attend and officers performed CPR while awaiting their arrival.

The man was taken to Poole Hospital for further treatment. Sadly, his condition deteriorated and he died in hospital this morning, Wednesday 12 April 2017.

His next of kin have been informed and are being supported by specially-trained officers.

As is mandatory in such circumstances where there has been a death following police contact, Dorset Police has referred the matter to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) who are now investigating.
