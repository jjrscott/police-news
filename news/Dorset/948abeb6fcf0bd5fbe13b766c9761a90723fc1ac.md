# Renewed appeal in search for missing Swanage man

04 March 2018

* * *

Officers searching for missing Swanage man Gerald Turner are renewing their appeal for help from the public to find him.

The 67-year-old was reported missing at 11.30am today, Sunday 4 March 2018, having last been seen at his home address in Church Hill at around 3am.

Police and other organisations have been carrying out extensive searches around the Swanage area today and officers are appealing for members of the public to check their CCTV or dashcam footage for sightings of Gerald.

He is described as around five feet seven inches tall and of slim build with short, thick, dark hair and a greying goatie beard and moustache. It is believed he was wearing a black waterproof jacket, blue cotton tracksuit type trousers and green wellies.

Gerald is known to become confused easily and has been upset recently so police are becoming increasingly concerned for his welfare.

Searches have been carried out at a number of locations in Swanage and along the local coastline. Dorset Police has been supported by HM Coastguard, DorSAR (Dorset Search and Rescue), Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service and Wessex 4x4. Search teams have been assisted by the NPAS helicopter, coastguard helicopter, police drone unit and dog units.

Chief Inspector Rob Chalkley, of Dorset Police, said: “We are making every effort to locate Gerald and I am grateful to all the agencies and voluntary organisations for assisting with our searches, and to everyone who has shared our appeal.

“I would ask members of the local community to check any CCTV systems they have for any potential sightings of someone matching Gerald’s description, particularly between around 5.30am and 7.30am today. I would also ask any motorists who were travelling in the area around that time and may potentially have dashcam footage to do the same.

“Gerald requires medication and it is not believed that he has it on him so he may have fallen ill and I would appeal to local residents to check their gardens and any outbuildings in case he has taken shelter there.”

Anyone with information or knowledge as to Gerald's whereabouts is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 4:179.
