# Witness appeal following road traffic collision in Poole

11 January 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a road traffic collision in Poole.

On Tuesday 2 January 2018 at approximately 6.15am a man was riding along Penn Hill Avenue at the junction with Kings Avenue on a grey Yamaha motorcycle when a silver vehicle pulled out in front of him.

The motorcyclist was forced to brake to try and avoid the vehicle. As a result, he hit the kerb and collided with a metal fence.

The man, aged in his 20s and from Bournemouth, sustained facial injuries as a result of the incident.

Police Constable Jonathan Rowland, of Poole police, said: "The silver vehicle briefly stopped at the scene but did not speak to the victim and drove off before exchanging details.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident, or who knows who was driving the silver vehicle, to please get in touch."
