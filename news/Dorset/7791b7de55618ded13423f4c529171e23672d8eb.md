# Appeal to trace woman who came to aid of assault victim

18 April 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating reports of an assault on a Poole woman are appealing for a person who helped her to contact them.

A woman was reportedly assaulted by a man who was known to her as they were driving in a car in the Poole area on Sunday 26 March 2017.

He punched her in the face a number of times and then drove toward Dorchester.

At around 10pm the 20-year-old woman was eventually able to get out of the car along with her two-year-old daughter and, although she did not know the area, saw a sign stating it was one mile to Dorchester.

She then walked up the verge of a busy road to a house in the distance and knocked on the door.

A woman at the house offered to call the police but she refused. The woman then gave her a lift to her home to the Poole area.

It is believed the woman who gave the victim a lift home was driving a white BMW.

Detective Constable Michelle Lawrence, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am keen to speak to the good Samaritan who gave this victim a lift home as part of my investigations.

"I would be grateful if she, or anyone who has more information about this incident, could contact me."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170052453. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
