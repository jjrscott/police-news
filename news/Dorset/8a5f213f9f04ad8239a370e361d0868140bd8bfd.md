# Witness appeal following robbery in Poole

14 November 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating a robbery in Poole are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 9.50pm on Saturday 11 November 2017 the victim, a Poole man aged in his 20s, picked up two men from outside Sainsbury's at Pitwines Close.

The men then forced him to pull over in a nearby layby on Newfoundland Drive, which backs on to Emerson Road. The men threatened the victim and forced him out of the vehicle before driving off in it.

The victim did not require hospital treatment as a result of the incident.

The victim's car, a distinctive grey Vauxhall Corsa Sting with a large white stripe running down the middle from front to back, was found the following day in a residential car park in Perry Gardens in Poole.

One of the offenders is described as white, aged in his late 20s, five feet ten inches tall and of medium build with short brown hair and stubble. He was wearing light blue jeans, a black hooded top and black and white trainers.

The other man is described as white, aged in his early 30s, five feet eleven inches tall and of slim build with brown hair and stubble. He was wearing a black windproof jacket.

Detective Constable Kat Rawlings, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We have made a number of enquiries into this incident and I am keen to hear from anyone who has information that can assist our investigation.

"I would urge anyone who witnessed the robbery or who saw a vehicle matching the description given being left in Perry Gardens to please contact us."

Detectives are also keen to speak to a man called 'Adam' who the victim also gave a lift to on the evening of Saturday 11 November 2017. The victim dropped Adam off at the junction of Bird's Hill Road and Longfleet Road in Poole shortly before picking up the two offenders.

Anyone with information about the incident is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170176424. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
