# Witness appeal following reported assault on Portland

10 August 2020

* * *

Detectives investigating an alleged assault on Portland are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 1.30am on Sunday 9 August 2020 officers attended a report of an assault on Fortuneswell. It is alleged that two local men aged in their 20s were assaulted by two other men.

One of the victims was reportedly hit in the face with a large rock, knocking him to the ground, before one of the men allegedly stamped on his head and knocked him unconscious.

It is reported the second man punched the second victim in the face causing minor injuries, before the two men left the area toward King Street.

The victims were taken to hospital for treatment by the ambulance service.

Following enquiries, a 20-year-old man from Portland was arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm and has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Detective Constable Jacqui Gravenor, of Weymouth CID, said: "This was an unprovoked incident that left one of the men with head and facial injuries and a full investigation is underway.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the reported assault and has not already spoken to police to please come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200117854. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
