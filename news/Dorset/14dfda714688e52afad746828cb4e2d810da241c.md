# Witness appeal following alleged fail-to-stop collision near Wareham

19 September 2016

* * *

Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an alleged fail-to-stop collision in Sandford.

At around 9pm on Sunday 18 September 2016 a collision occurred in Forest Edge Road involving a silver VW Passat.

It is alleged the vehicle did not stop for police officers as it travelled along the A351 between Holton Heath and the Bakers Arms roundabout.

The vehicle continued into Sandford before colliding with a fence in Forest Edge Road. The driver of the car failed to stop at the scene.

Police Constable Susan Tagg, of Weymouth police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or who saw the vehicle being driven in the area to please contact Dorset Police.

"We have been informed the vehicle may have been travelling with a black BMW car at some point and I would like to hear from anyone who knows who was driving either the Passat or BMW."

A 25-year-old man from Poole has been arrested on suspicion of driving offences and has been released on police bail pending further enquiries until the middle of November 2016.
