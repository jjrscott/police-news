# Witness appeal following suspicious incident in Weymouth

15 June 2017

* * *

Officers investigating a suspicious incident in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At around 8pm on Sunday 11 June 2017 a 16-year-old girl was walking along the Rodwell Trail in the direction of Portland.

As she reached the bridge that crosses over Old Castle Road, she was spoken to by a man who was walking in the opposite direction.

He asked her for a lighter, which she provided, and then asked her if she wanted to go for a walk with him.

The girl said no and tried to walk off but the man put his hand on her shoulder and slid it down her back before attempting to usher her in the direction of Sandsfoot Castle.

The girl walked away and the man made no attempt to keep her there.

She was not physically injured in the incident.

The man is described as white, in his 30s, of slim build and between five feet six inches and five feet 11 inches tall.

He was wearing a blue Adidas zip-up hooded top with the zip undone and a black top underneath.

Police Constable Kieren Bill, of Weymouth police, said: "We are continuing to investigate this incident and I am keen to hear from any witnesses or anyone with further information.

"I would urge anyone who saw a man matching the description given in the area at the relevant time to please contact us.

"Local officers will also be carrying out increased patrols in the area."
