# Appeal following dog bite incident in Southbourne

22 December 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a woman was bitten by a dog during an incident in Southbourne.

At around 7am on Wednesday 9 December 2020 the victim was running with a friend along the beach near to the Bistro on the Beach restaurant when she approached an elderly woman who was with a small dog on a lead.

They became aware that a second dog, which was wearing a high-visibility coat with writing on it, had begun attacking the elderly woman's dog.

She called out to the victim and her friend to help. As she attempted to pull the dogs apart, the victim - a local woman aged in her 30s - sustained an injury to her hand.

The owner of the offending dog arrived and pulled her dog away. She had a Labrador dog with her and stated that she had only owned the offending dog for ten days.

It is not known what breed the offending dog is. Its owner is described as a white woman, aged in her 50s and of petite build and wore glasses and a bobble hat. It is suspected she was also bitten in the incident.

Police Constable Jennie Sykes-Martin, of Dorset Police, said: "I am appealing to the dog owner, or anyone who knows who she is from the description given, to please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200185766. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
