13 December 2017

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a fatal collision in Bournemouth in which a young boy has sadly died.

At 3.54pm today, Wednesday 13 December 2017, Dorset Police was called to reports of a very serious collision involving a black Vauxhall Corsa and a five-year-old boy as he crossed Naseby Road.

The boy, from Bournemouth, sustained a serious head injury and was taken to Poole Hospital. Very sadly he died a short time later. His parents have been informed and the coroner notified.

The driver of the car, a local woman aged in her 20s, was shaken but uninjured.

The road is closed while emergency services deal with the incident and collision investigators examine the scene.

Police Sergeant Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "It is with great sadness for me to say that this young boy died from the injuries he sustained in the collision. Our thoughts are with all his family and friends.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision and has yet to speak to officers to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would ask anybody who was in the area at the time to consider any dashcam or CCTV footage they may have which could assist us in our investigation."
