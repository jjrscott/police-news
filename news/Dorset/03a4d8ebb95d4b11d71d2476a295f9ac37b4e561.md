# Update â€“ man arrested in connection with reported assault in Poole

17 March 2020

* * *

A man has been arrested in connection with a reported assault in Poole Park.

At around 9.30am on Saturday 1 February 2020 a woman was walking through the park near to the mini golf course. It was reported that a man approached her and accused her of following him before he allegedly placed his hand on her arm, preventing her from moving forward.

The victim - a woman in her early 20s - reportedly attempted to walk past him but the man moved to block her each time.

It was reported that a man who witnessed the incident came to the victim's aid and walked her into town.

Following enquiries by officers and a CCTV appeal, a 32-year-old man of no fixed abode has been arrested on suspicion of assault and has been released on police bail.
