# Update – man charged in connection with reported fraud offences in Bournemouth

07 February 2020

* * *

A man has been charged in connection with the alleged fraudulent use of a debit card in Bournemouth.

It was reported that between 2pm and 3pm on Monday 30 December 2019 a work van was broken into on Tregonwell Road and the victim's wallet and a Dewalt drill were stolen.

At 3.24pm on the same day, the victim's card was allegedly used in a nearby shop to carry out contactless payments to buy tobacco totalling £47.

Following enquiries by officers and a CCTV appeal, a 45-year-old man has been arrested and charged with handling stolen goods and fraud by false representation. He was due to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 7 February 2020.
