# Update - man appears in court in connection with reported road rage incident in Weymouth

22 August 2018

* * *

A man has appeared in court in connection with a reported road rage incident in Weymouth.

The incident is said to have occurred at around 10.40am on Monday 2 April 2018 at the Wessex roundabout, which connects the B3157 Granby Way, B3157 Hampshire Road and Radipole Lane.

It is reported a silver Peugeot 206 stopped at the roundabout and a white panel van pulled up behind it and was beeping its horn. The driver, a woman aged in her 20s, became flustered and she and her passenger, a man also aged in his 20s, got out to swap drivers. It is alleged the driver of the van intentionally drove forwards, hitting the man in the legs and causing him to fall back against the Peugeot.

The man did not sustain any serious injuries that required hospital treatment.

A 48-year-old man from Weymouth appeared before Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Monday 20 August 2018 charged with an offence of dangerous driving and is next due to appear at Bournemouth Crown Court on Thursday 20 September 2018.
