# Serious injury collision in Poole â€“ court update

23 April 2019

* * *

A 17-year-old boy is due to appear in court this month in connection with a serious injury collision in Poole.

At around 11.30am on Tuesday 2 October 2018 a collision occurred on Creekmoor Lane involving a blue and white motorcycle and a red Seat Ibiza car.

The male motorcyclist, aged 17 and from Bournemouth, was taken by air ambulance to Southampton General Hospital with serious injuries. He was subsequently discharged.

The driver of the Seat was uninjured. He was interviewed voluntarily by officers for a suspected offence of driving without due care and attention. He has since been released from the investigation without charge.

The motorcyclist has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Youth Court on Tuesday 30 April 2019 for offences of dangerous driving, driving without insurance and driving while disqualified.
