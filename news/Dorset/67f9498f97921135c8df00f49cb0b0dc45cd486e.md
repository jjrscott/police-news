# Witness appeal following sexual and physical assault in Weymouth

06 February 2020

* * *

Officers investigating an incident of sexual assault and physical assault against two people in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Some time between 3am and 4am on Sunday 2 February 2020 a man and a woman were walking along The Esplanade near to Marks & Spencer when two men approached them from the beach. One of the men slapped the female victim on the bottom and made sexual comments towards her. She ignored him and they walked on, but the pair followed them.

The second man then began to repeatedly punch the male victim in the face. The woman tried to intervene but was pulled away by the offending man, preventing her from helping him.

As the victims ran away from the area, they saw another member of the public approach the men to confront them. However, he too was assaulted by them. The victims reported that this man was knocked to the ground and kicked in the head before the offenders fled the scene.

It was at this point the female victim realised her handbag, which had been across her body, was missing. The handbag strap was later located on the beach. Her phone and debit card have since been recovered.

The female victim did not receive any injuries as a result of the incident. The man received bruising to his face, but did not require hospital treatment. It is not known if the man who intervened sustained injuries.

The offenders are described as white, aged in their early 20s, of slim build and around five feet nine inches tall. Both men are described as speaking with a London accent. The first man was wearing a hooded top and jeans and the second man was wearing a T-shirt and blue jeans.

Police Constable Tom Legg, of Weymouth police, said: "The victims were understandably left shaken by this completely unprovoked assault and we are carrying out a detailed investigation to identify the men responsible.

"I would appeal to any witnesses or anyone who was in the vicinity around the time of the offence and saw or heard anything suspicious to please contact us. I am especially keen to hear from the man who intervened and was assaulted.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who may recognise the men from the description given."
