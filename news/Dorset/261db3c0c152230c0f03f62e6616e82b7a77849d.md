# Want to join the Special Constabulary?

12 December 2016

* * *

Recruitment to join the Special Constabulary with Dorset Police is now open, and will run until Thursday 5 January 2017.

Special constables are trained volunteers who provide a valuable link between the police and the local community. With the same powers as regular officers, they work in their free time covering a variety of police duties.

Whilst final numbers will depend on Force demand, Dorset Police intends to recruit 32 new special constables to join the Force from April 2017.

Special constables carry out a huge variety of roles, working closely with the community to tackle crime and disorder at a local level. Dorset Police needs people from diverse backgrounds with different skills and experiences to help us deliver excellence in local policing across the county.

Chief Constable Debbie Simpson, said: "Volunteers are essential for ensuring that we understand and represent the community that we serve. We are looking for committed and conscientious individuals to join us and help make a real difference to the diverse communities of our county."

Special Inspector Rob Scott, said: "I have now been a special for six years and work within the Alliance Roads Policing Department, where the focus is on reducing the numbers killed or seriously injured on our roads. I joined the Special Constabulary to give something back to the community and be part of a team. I continue to walk away from each shift with a sense of achievement that I have made a difference in the time I have been on duty."

Special Inspector Ben Muspratt, said: "I joined as a special constable as I wanted to see what the Force did and assist with protecting the public. You get out of the role what you put into it. Dorset Police invest a huge amount into the Special Constabulary and I feel that I have the right skills to perform my role successfully because of this."

"Some join with a view to seeing if they would like to become a regular police constable, but many of us get a huge amount out of being a special and enjoy the flexibility and variety it brings to our working lives. There are numerous opportunities to play an important role in protecting our communities."

We will be holding a live web chat on Wednesday 21 December from 7pm. Potential applicants are encouraged to join the chat and ask existing special constables any questions they might have about the role, or tweet questions in advance using the #DPSpecials
