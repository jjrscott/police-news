# Public appeal following suspicious letters to childminders in Dorset

08 April 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating incidents in which threatening letters have been sent to childminders in Dorset are issuing advice to the public.

Dorset Police has received a number of separate reports from registered childminders working in East and North Dorset who received a letter in the post on Saturday 8 April 2017 from the same named individual who states they wish to work with them. The letters are distressing and threatening.

Detective Constable Nick Hodge, of Weymouth CID, said: "The words contained within this letter have caused a great deal of distress to those who have received it.

"From our enquiries we are satisfied the person purported to have sent the letters is not responsible. We are therefore treating this as a malicious communications series.

"We are taking this extremely seriously and a thorough investigation to identify the person responsible for sending these letters is now underway.

"I would urge anyone who has received one of these threatening letters, and has not yet spoken to the police, to please make contact urgently.

"Finally, I would ask anyone who knows who may be responsible for sending these letters to please come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170051219. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
