Detectives investigating a reported sexual assault in Purbeck have arrested a man.

The incident is reported to have occurred during the night of Wednesday 15 July 2020 into the morning of Thursday 16 July 2020 in the area of Durlston Country Park near Swanage.

A woman aged in her 20s was camping at a small cove in the park with a group of other people and during the night she reported that she was sexually assaulted.

An image appeal of a man officers wished to speak to was issued on Friday 17 July 2020.

A 20-year-old man from Poole has subsequently been arrested on suspicion of sexual assault and is assisting officers with their enquiries.
