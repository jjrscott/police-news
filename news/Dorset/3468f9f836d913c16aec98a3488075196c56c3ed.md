# Update in relation to reported assault in Bournemouth

18 May 2020

* * *

A man has come forward following an image appeal in relation to a reported assault and public order incident in Bournemouth.

The appeal related to two separate incidents at the golf course in Meyrick Park on the evenings of Monday 6 April 2020 and Monday 20 April 2020. It was reported that on the first occasion a man attempted to challenge a group of four men who were hitting golf balls toward members of the public and they threatened to take his mobile phone as he was attempting to film the exchange.

On the second occasion it was reported that the man came across the same group in similar circumstances and one of the men allegedly physically assaulted him in an attempt to take his phone from him.

Following an image appeal issued by officers, a man has come forward and is assisting officers with their investigation. No arrests have been made.
