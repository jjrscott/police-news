Detectives investigating the death of a man at a farm near Blandford have released one arrested man on police bail and a second man has been released under investigation.

At 8.25pm on Friday 28 September 2018 Dorset Police received a report that a 25-year-old local man had sustained serious injuries following an incident at Hanford Farm.

He was later pronounced dead at the scene.

An initial post mortem examination carried out on the evening of Saturday 29 September 2018 indicated the cause of death as blunt force trauma.

Two Shaftesbury men, aged 25 and 27, were arrested on suspicion of murder. The 25-year-old man has now been released on police bail and the 27-year-old man has been released under investigation as detectives from Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT) continue their enquiries.

The three men involved were all known to each other.

Detectives are still appealing for anyone with information about the incident, who has not already spoken to officers, to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 28:454.
