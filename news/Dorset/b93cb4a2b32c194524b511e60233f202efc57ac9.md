# Update - image appeal following reported fail-to-stop collision in Gillingham

22 May 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a reported fail-to-stop collision in Gillingham say a man has come forward.

At around 11.30am on Friday 12 April 2019 a woman was driving her silver Kia Sportage near the riding stables off Common Mead Lane when she pulled in behind a Volkswagen van to allow a tractor to pass. However, it is alleged as the tractor passed it scraped the side of her car and ripped off the bumper.

The tractor driver allegedly failed to stop at the scene.

A photo appeal was issued by officers on Thursday 16 May 2019. A 27-year-old man from Bristol has since come forward and is assisting officers with their investigation. No arrests have been made.
