# Residents alerted to fraud in Dorset

17 May 2017

* * *

Dorset Police is alerting residents to new and emerging fraud trends affecting the county.

Every month, Dorset Police will be updating the new Fraud Alert page on the Force website, with emerging fraud trends that are affecting the residents of Dorset.

Fraud often affects the most vulnerable in the community, but anyone can become a target. Fraudsters do not just target individuals, they target businesses too.

Detective Sergeant Andrew Kennard from the Economic Crime Unit, said: "People often feel embarrassed about being a victim of fraud, but there is no reason to be. It can happen to anyone and it is important you tell us.

"Reporting fraud helps us to understand the new trends and techniques being used by criminals and gives us the opportunity to warn others before they become victims."

The UK has a centralised fraud reporting centre called Action Fraud. They record all incidents, refer cases to the police for investigation and provide specialist support and advice.

The Fraud Profile for Dorset shows that 2,406 crimes were reported between April and September 2016. The total victim loss was £4.6 million pounds and the most commonly targeted victims were aged between 60 – 79yrs.

Detective Sergeant Andrew Kennard continued: "It's easy to be caught out. Fraudsters are clever and know how to gain your trust. Make sure you don't give out any personal information to anyone unless you have confirmed who it is you are speaking to.

"Remember: You will never be asked for your personal banking details, such as passwords and PIN numbers. If you are, hang up and contact the organisation/company back by using a number you know, such as one from your latest bill, in the telephone book or from their official website.

"If you receive a suspicious phone call, hang up immediately, dial 1471 and note the number that called you, then contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040, or online at actionfraud.police.uk. Action Fraud will alert Dorset Police.
