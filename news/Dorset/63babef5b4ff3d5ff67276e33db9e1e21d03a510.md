Officers are appealing for anyone with information to come forward after a number of dead ducks were located in Bournemouth having apparently been shot with an air rifle.

Three dead ducks have been reported in the area to the rear of the Littledown Centre between Thursday 30 April and Saturday 2 May 2020. Criminal damage to a picnic area has also been reported and officers have also received reports of teenagers gathering in the area in breach of COVID-19 (coronavirus) social distancing restrictions.

Police Constable Michelle Yarrow, of Dorset Police, said: "We understand these incidents have caused concern to members of the public who are using this area safely and we are appealing for anyone with information as to who is responsible to please contact us.

"We would also like to hear from anyone who has witnessed any suspicious activity in the area during the relevant period."
