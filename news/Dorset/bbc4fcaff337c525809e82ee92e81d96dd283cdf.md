# Witness appeal following fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth

03 April 2021

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage to come forward following a fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth.

The incident occurred at around 8.15am on Thursday 25 March 2021 on Iford Lane at the junction with Exton Road involving a car and a cyclist.

The cyclist - a 16-year-old boy from Bournemouth - attended hospital for treatment. He sustained bruising to his back.

The car is described as dark in colour and was similar in size to a Vauxhall Corsa.

Police Constable Tom Ringer, of Bournemouth police, said: "The car failed to stop at the scene and an investigation is underway to try and identify the vehicle.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed what happened or has relevant dashcam footage to please get in touch.

"I understand that an elderly couple stopped to see if the cyclist was all right. I would like to appeal directly for them to please come forward if they witnessed the collision and have any information that may assist my enquiries."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210047505. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
