# Update â€“ man arrested in connection with alleged hate crime on Portland

18 February 2020

* * *

A man has been arrested in connection with an alleged hate crime on Portland following a CCTV appeal.

It was reported that at around 8.20pm on Tuesday 28 January 2020 the driver of the number 1 First bus stopped at Victoria Square to allow passengers on. A man boarded the bus and went to sit down without paying for a ticket.

When the driver asked the man to pay his fare, he allegedly refused and became aggressive, using racially abusive language toward the driver. He also reportedly made threats to kill him before trying to grab the victim's face and hands.

The driver, a man aged in his 60s, did not suffer any injuries as a result of the alleged assault.

Following a CCTV appeal and enquiries by officers, a 28-year-old man of no fixed abode has been arrested on suspicion of causing racially or religiously aggravated intentional harassment, alarm or distress.

He was also arrested on suspicion of racially or religiously aggravated assault in relation to an incident in the area of St Thomas Street in Weymouth at around 9am on Tuesday 28 January where a woman was allegedly assaulted and subjected to verbal abuse.

The arrested man is assisting officers with their enquiries.

We would like to thank members of the public who shared our appeal and those who responded with information.
