# Witness appeal following fatal road traffic collision in Christchurch

18 March 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a fatal road traffic collision in Christchurch are appealing for witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage to come forward.

A 3.15pm today, Monday 18 March 2019, Dorset Police received a report of a collision on Somerford Road involving a pedestrian and a blue Ford Focus.

Emergency services attended and road closures were put in place to allow them to deal with the incident.

Very sadly the pedestrian, a woman from Christchurch aged in her 80s, was pronounced dead at the scene. Her family has been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers. The coroner has also been notified.

The driver of the Ford, a man aged in his 50s and from Christchurch, was arrested on suspicion of driving offences and is assisting officers with their enquiries.

Inspector Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the family of the woman involved and we are carrying out a full investigation to establish the exact circumstances of the collision.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident and has not already spoken to officers to please make contact with us.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who may have captured the incident on dashcam.

"Finally, I would like to thank motorists and members of the public for their patience and understanding during the road closures, which were absolutely necessary to allow the emergency services to deal with the incident and to enable a proper examination of the collision scene."
