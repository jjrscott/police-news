* * *

Officers investigating the theft of a digger from a farm in Middlemarsh are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 1.15am on Tuesday 10 March 2020 the victim was woken by the sound of the digger's engine starting up. A red pick-up style truck towing a flatbed trailer was then seen leaving the site with the mini digger loaded onto it in the direction of Sherborne.

Police Constable James Curtis-Burchett, of Dorset Police, said: "We are making a number of enquiries into this incident and I would like to hear from anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area at the relevant time.

"I am particularly keen to speak to a motorist who was passing at the time the theft was occurring and may have information that could help my investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200036941. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
