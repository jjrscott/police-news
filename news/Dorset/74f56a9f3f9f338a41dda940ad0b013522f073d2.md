Two men have been charged following a detailed investigation by detectives into reported knifepoint robbery incidents in Bournemouth town centre.

At 5pm on Monday 1 July 2019 a report was received that a local man aged in his 20s was walking through the grounds of St Peters Church off Hinton Road when a man approached him from behind, produced a machete-type knife and demanded money. A small amount of cash and a mobile phone were reportedly stolen.

At 6.45pm that same evening Dorset Police received a report from a woman who said she saw a man running toward Bournemouth Lower Gardens armed with a knife. A further call was received from a man who stated he had been threatened by a man with a knife at around 6pm. He alleged that demands were made for money, although nothing was handed over.

Following enquiries by officers, two men were arrested.

A 19-year-old Bournemouth man has been charged with attempted robbery, robbery and two offences of possessing a knife blade or sharp pointed article in a public place. He is due to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court today, Thursday 4 July 2019.

An 18-year-old Bournemouth man was also charged with handling stolen goods. He is due to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 9 August 2019.

Detective Inspector Gavin House, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We are continuing to make enquiries into these matters and I would urge anyone with information about these incidents or who has been approached in similar circumstances to contact us."
