# Witness appeal following serious injury collision near Bere Regis

21 December 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a serious injury collision near Bere Regis.

At 7.54am on Monday 21 December 2020 a collision occurred on the A35 at the Bloxsworth junction involving a refuse lorry and a red Peugeot 2008.

The driver of the Peugeot - a woman aged in her 50s and from the Bridport area - sustained serious injuries and was taken to Southampton General Hospital. Her condition remains serious.

The driver of the lorry - a man aged in his 50s and from Christchurch - was uninjured. He was arrested on suspicion of driving offences and is assisting officers with their enquiries.

The A35 was closed between Morden Park Corner and the Bere Regis roundabout while emergency services treated the injured driver and examined the scene. It was reopened at 2.45pm.

Police Constable Jay Griffin, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was travelling along the A35 at the time of the collision and either saw what happened or captured anything of relevant on dashcam to please contact Dorset Police.

"I appreciate the road closure caused delays, but I would like to thank motorists for their patience while we treated the injured woman and examined the scene."
