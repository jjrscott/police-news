One man has been arrested following an incident in which two young women fell seriously ill after taking a drug called 'Golden Monkey' which is believed to be a form of ecstasy.

At 8.23am on Sunday 24 July 2016 it was reported to Dorset Police that a 19-year-old woman and a 20-year-old woman, both from Weymouth, had been taken to hospital after using the substance.

Both women were taken seriously ill at Dorset County Hospital but are now in a stable condition.

A 20-year-old Weymouth man has been arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of ecstasy and is currently assisting police with enquiries.
