# Witness appeal following burglary in North Dorset

11 February 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a burglary in North Dorset are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Some time between 1am on Saturday 8 February and 2pm on Sunday 9 February 2020 a burglary occurred at Ambassador Pools and Spas near West Stour. 30 boxed inflatable hot tubs, along with pumps and power units, were taken from a container on the site. The items' combined value totals Â£15,000.

It is believed the items were transported in a van, which was also stolen from the Ambassador Business Park. A tracking device on the van shows that it was driven toward Gillingham, where it stopped in the Highgrove area for around 45 minutes. The van was then driven to Stourhead where it was set fire to.

Police Constable Warren Cummings, of North Dorset police, said: "We are carrying out a full investigation into this burglary and making a number of enquiries to identify those responsible.

"I am really keen to hear from anyone who saw any suspicious activity in the area at the relevant time. Additionally, I would urge anyone who comes across any inflatable hot tubs for sale in unusual circumstances to please get in touch."
