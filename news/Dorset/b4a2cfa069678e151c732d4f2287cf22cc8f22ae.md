# Appeal for information following assault in Poole

30 March 2020

* * *

Officers investigating the assault of a woman in Poole are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

The victim, a woman who was dressed in her uniform for work at a nursing home, was walking in the Sherborn open space in Canford Heath at around 1pm on Friday 27 March 2020. She came in through the entrance from Verity Crescent and was approached by two male teenagers on bicycles.

The woman was hit on the head by something, believed to be a bag, and knocked to the ground. One of the teenagers kicked her in the back a number of times and then spat in her face before saying to her "you have got corona" as the other teenager told him to stop.

The teenager who assaulted the woman is described as being aged 16 to 18 with pale skin and possibly light brown hair. He was wearing a grey tracksuit with the hood up and a blue bag. He was riding a blue bike.

Police Community Support Investigator Chris Hardy, of Poole police, said: "This was a truly despicable assault and the victim believes she was targeted because she was dressed for her work at a nursing home.

"We are committed to supporting those who are helping our communities at this difficult time. We are determined to identify those involved and are carrying out a detailed investigation into the incident.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the incident or who may have any information about the
identity of the offender, to please contact police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200045377. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
