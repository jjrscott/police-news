# Family tribute following fatal road traffic collision in Bournemouth

17 December 2017

* * *

The family of a young boy who sadly died following a collision in Bournemouth is paying tribute to him.

At 3.54pm on Wednesday 13 December 2017 Dorset Police was called to reports of a very serious collision involving a black Vauxhall Corsa and a five-year-old boy as he crossed Naseby Road.

Sadly, the young boy, five-year-old Shane Junior Bartlett, died as a result of the collision in Poole Hospital.

Shane's family has issued the following statement: "Sadly our son Shane Junior Bartlett was taken from us on 13 December. Our bright, happy, cheeky, loving child had the most beautiful smile and would brighten up your day, which would brighten up everyone else's life every day.

"He will be missed by so many people, especially mummy and daddy.

"He has left a hole that will never be filled, and his twin has lost his partner and best friend. His brothers and sister are so empty without that smile from Shane Junior.

"The family would like to say thank you for everyone's support and donations, and Winton Primary School for their help through this difficult time. No words can describe how grateful we are.

"We now ask that our family is left in peace and privacy at this time to grieve for the loss of our baby."
