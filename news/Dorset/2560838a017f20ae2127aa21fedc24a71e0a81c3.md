Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a reported assault in Wimborne.

Just after 10.20pm on Friday 25 September 2020 it is reported an assault occurred outside Rohan clothing shop in The Square.

It is alleged the victim, a 36-year-old man from West Moors, was approached by a man who verbally abused him and then punched him, causing him to fall to the ground and lose consciousness for several seconds. He was taken to hospital as a precaution, but did not sustain serious injuries.

A 25-year-old man from Verwood was arrested on suspicion of assault and has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Police Constable Steve Hawke, of Dorset Police, said: "We are carrying out a number of enquiries into this incident and I am appealing to anyone who was in the area and witnessed what happened to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200144976. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
