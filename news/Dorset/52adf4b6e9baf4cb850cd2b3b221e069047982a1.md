# Update â€“ further arrests following alleged serious assault in Poole

17 November 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating an alleged serious assault in Poole have made two further arrests.

An investigation was launched following an incident at Sterte Close at around 2.20am on Monday 9 October 2017.

Emergency services attended and two men were found with stab wounds to their backs. A 34-year-old man of no fixed abode sustained injuries that were initially believed to be life-threatening and a 45-year-old man from Poole was seriously injured but both have since left hospital.

A 22-year-old man and a 20-year-old man, both from London, have now been arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm with intent. Both have been released under investigation.

A 31-year-old Poole man was previously arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and was released under investigation. A 43-year-old man, of no fixed abode, was arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender and was also released under investigation.
