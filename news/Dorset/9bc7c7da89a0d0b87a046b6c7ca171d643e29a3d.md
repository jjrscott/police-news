# Further update in relation to reported burglary and fraudulent card use in Poole

03 March 2021

* * *

A man arrested in connection with a reported burglary and subsequent fraudulent card use in Poole will face no further police action.

It was reported that at around 5pm on Sunday 20 December 2020 a door to a property in Dorchester Road was smashed and entry was gained.

A quantity of cash was allegedly stolen, as well as two bank cards and items of jewellery.

The bank cards were reportedly used to make contactless transactions at shops in the nearby area at around 5.30pm that same day.

Following enquiries, a 21-year-old Bournemouth man was arrested on suspicion of burglary and was released under investigation. He has now been released from under investigation and will face no further police action.
