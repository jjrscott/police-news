Officers investigating a fatal road traffic collision on the A31 in East Dorset have arrested a man.

Dorset Police was called at 8.46am on Tuesday 30 April 2019 to a report of a collision outside Henbury Stud Farm near Sturminster Marshall. The collision involved a green Kawasaki motorcycle, a white Ford transit panel van and a white Citroen Relay dropside lorry.

Emergency services attended and very sadly the motorcyclist, a 40-year-old man from Poole, was pronounced dead at the scene.

The occupants of the other vehicles involved did not sustain any serious injuries.

A 41-year-old man from Poole has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by careless driving and perverting the course of justice and has been released on police bail pending further enquiries.

Inspector Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "Our investigations into the circumstances surrounding this collision remain ongoing and I am renewing our appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident, or the manner of driving of any of the vehicles involved prior to it, to please contact us. We would also like to hear from anyone who was driving in the area at the time of the collision and may have relevant dashcam footage."
