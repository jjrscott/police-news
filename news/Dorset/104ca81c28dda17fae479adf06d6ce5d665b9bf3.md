# Witness appeal after alleged threats with a knife in Wimborne

08 July 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating an incident in Wimborne in which it is alleged a taxi driver was threatened with a knife are asking for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward.

At 11.52pm on Saturday 7 July 2018 it was reported that a male taxi driver had stopped at the BP petrol station in Wimborne Road to ask for directions when a man approached his car and threatened him through the open window with a knife. The taxi drove off and the driver was uninjured.

Officers attended and a 38-year-old man from Wimborne was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and possession of an offensive weapon in a public place. He is helping officers with their enquiries.

Detective Inspector Andy Roberts, of Bournemouth CID, said: "Residents may have heard a loud bang while officers attended the area. I would like to reassure the public that this was a tactic used by officers during the arrest.

"I am appealing for any witnesses to the incident, who have not spoken to police yet, to come forward to help us with our enquiries."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180106565. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
