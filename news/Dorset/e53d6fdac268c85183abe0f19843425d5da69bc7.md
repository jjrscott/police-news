Officers investigating a burglary at a home in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The burglary occurred between 1am and 6am yesterday, Thursday 16 August 2018, at a property in Brownlow Street while the occupants were asleep upstairs.

Entry is believed to have been gained through an insecure ground floor window and an Acer laptop and keys were stolen.

Police Constable Andy Dickinson, of Weymouth police, said: "We have made a number of enquiries into this incident, including house to house and examination of the scene.

"Our investigation is ongoing and I would appeal to anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area around the relevant time, or who has any information that can assist our enquiries, to contact us.

"I would also like to remind residents to make sure that wherever possible you never leave doors or windows insecure and don't give burglars an easy opportunity to access your property."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180131915. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
