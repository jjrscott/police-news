# Renewed appeal for information following report of rape in Bournemouth

29 October 2018

* * *

Detectives are renewing their appeal for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following a report of a rape in Bournemouth.

On the evening of Friday 19 October 2018, the victim - a local woman aged in her 40s - was at the Buffalo Bar on Wimborne Road.

She left the bar at approximately 11pm and returned home in the early hours of Saturday 20 October. It is believed the incident occurred during that time period somewhere in the Winton area and investigations are continuing to establish the exact location.

During the night, the victim also lost her handbag. A man and woman found the handbag containing the ID with the victim's home address and returned it to her the following morning but did not give details.

Following an appeal issued by detectives, the man who found the handbag has now come forward and spoken with officers. He reported that the bag was found in the area of The Banks Medical Centre in Wimborne Road.

The victim reported the incident to police at approximately 6.30pm on Tuesday 23 October 2018.

Detective Inspector Gavin House, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I would like to thank everyone who shared our original appeal and the man who found the handbag for coming forward.

"We are continuing to investigate this incident and the victim continues to be supported by specially-trained officers.

"Further to our previous appeal, I would like to hear from anyone who may have seen any suspicious activity in the Wimborne Road area - particularly near to The Banks Medical Centre where the handbag was found - between 11pm on Friday 19 October 2018 and 3.30am on Saturday 20 October 2018.

"Local officers from the neighbourhood policing team can be approached with any concerns."
