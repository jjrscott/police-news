18 February 2021

* * *

A man has been arrested in connection with a reported burglary and subsequent fraudulent card use in Poole.

It was reported that at around 5pm on Sunday 20 December 2020 a door to a property in Dorchester Road was smashed and entry was gained.

A quantity of cash was allegedly stolen, as well as two bank cards and items of jewellery.

The bank cards were reportedly used to make contactless transactions at shops in the nearby area at around 5.30pm that same day.

Following enquiries and a CCTV appeal, a 21-year-old Bournemouth man has been arrested on suspicion of burglary and has been released under investigation as officers continue to carry out enquiries.
