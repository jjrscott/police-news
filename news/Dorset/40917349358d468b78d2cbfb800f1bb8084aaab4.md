# Appeal to find stolen laptop belonging to late teenage cancer victim

24 November 2017

* * *

Detectives are making a public appeal to find a laptop that was stolen during a burglary while the occupant was saying goodbye to her 15-year-old daughter who tragically died four days earlier.

Sometime between 10.45am and 1pm yesterday, Thursday 23 November 2017, offenders smashed a door to gain entry to an address in Leybourne Avenue.

A white Xbox One, Apple MacBook Air, daisy Pandora earrings and a quantity of cash were stolen.

Natalie Elbrow, 47, discovered her home had been burgled after she returned from Julia's House in Poole where she had been saying goodbye to her daughter Daisy.

Daisy tragically died in Poole Hospital on Sunday 19 November - five days after her 15th birthday - following a bravely-fought seven-month battle with a rare cancer known as renal cell carcinoma. Doctors discovered the main tumour was in her kidney but it had also affected her spine and lungs and spread to her liver and lymph nodes.

The teenager, who was a pupil at Bourne Academy, underwent specialist chemotherapy and spent most of the time following her diagnosis in hospital.

The MacBook and Pandora earrings belonged to Daisy. Funds for the laptop were raised through a raffle organised by the stroke unit at Poole Hospital. A Crowdfunding page was also set up for Daisy.

Natalie said: "Daisy was a real fighter. She fought that cancer to the very end and was so brave.

"She spent more time in hospital than out and that laptop meant everything to her. She was so weak that she was forced to spend most days in bed and it gave her a portal to the outside world. It had all her things on it and all her photos. It meant so much to Daisy and I desperately want it back."

Detective Sergeant Adam Woolman, of Dorset Police, said: "This burglary was committed while Natalie was saying goodbye to her late daughter. I am sure everyone will be incensed by this crime and I urge anyone who knows who was responsible for this offence, or knows where Daisy's laptop is, to please do the right thing and either come forward or hand it into a police station."
