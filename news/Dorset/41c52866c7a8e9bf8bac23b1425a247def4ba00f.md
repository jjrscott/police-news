# Witness appeal following fatal road traffic collision in North Dorset

15 February 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a fatal road traffic collision in North Dorset are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At 12.22pm today, Friday 15 February 2019, Dorset Police received a report of a collision on the C13 by the junction with Mill Street near to Fontmell Magna. The collision involved a white Mercedes lorry and a silver Peugeot 207.

Officers attended, along with the ambulance and fire services following reports two people were trapped in the Peugeot.

Very sadly one of the occupants of the Peugeot, a 70-year-old man from Bath, was pronounced dead at the scene. His family has been informed and are being supported by specially-trained officers.

The other occupant of the Peugeot, a woman aged in her 60s, was taken to Southampton General Hospital with serious injuries that are believed to be life-threatening.

The driver of the lorry did not sustain any serious injuries.

Road closures were put in place to allow emergency services to deal with the collision and for an examination of the scene to be conducted. The road was reopened shortly after 7pm.

Police Sergeant Lee Savage, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the family of those involved at this time and we will be carrying out a thorough investigation to establish the full circumstances of the collision.

"I am appealing to any witnesses to the collision or manner of driving of the vehicles involved immediately prior to the incident to contact us. I would also urge anyone who was driving in the area at the time and has dashcam fitted to their vehicles to check their footage.

"Finally, I would like to thank motorists for their patience and understanding while the road closures were in place. These closures were absolutely necessary to allow us to respond to the incident and for a thorough examination of the collision scene to take place."
