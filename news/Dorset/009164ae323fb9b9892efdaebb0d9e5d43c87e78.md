# Assault on teenage boy in Poole â€“ witness appeal

12 February 2021

* * *

Officers are appealing for anyone with information to come forward after a teenage boy was assaulted in Poole.

Sometime between 3pm and 3.30pm on Tuesday 9 February 2021 the 13-year-old victim was walking along Brampton Road with another boy, who was riding a bike, when they were approached by the suspect.

The suspect followed the pair until they got to Somerby Road, where he forcibly asked to go on the bike before grabbing hold of it.

The victim intervened and pushed the suspect, allowing the other child to cycle away. It is reported that the suspect continued to follow the victim along Brampton Road and a short time later he punched the victim in the face.

The boy sustained swelling and busing to his face and was taken to hospital for treatment to a potentially broken nose.

The suspect is described as white, aged around 15 years old, around five feet two inches tall, with blond hair, blue eyes and a pointed chin. He wore a shiny grey coat with dark-coloured trousers and dark-coloured shoes.

Police Constable Elliot Penn, of Dorset Police, said: "This was an unpleasant and unprovoked incident that has left the boy and his family understandably shaken and upset.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the area of Brampton Road at the relevant time and either witnessed the incident or saw a man matching the description given to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would also ask any residents or motorists in that area to check their home CCTV or dashcam footage in the event they captured anything of relevance."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210023851. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
