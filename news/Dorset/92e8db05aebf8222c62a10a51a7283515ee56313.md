# Appeal after distraction burglary near Ferndown

04 November 2016

* * *

Detectives investigating a distraction burglary in West Moors near Ferndown are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward.

The incident happened at around 3.15pm on Tuesday 1 November 2016 at an address on Glenwood Way.

A local female pensioner answered the door and a man told her that there was a drainage issue. He was allowed entry and the victim followed the man through the property when she was pushed by him causing her to fall backward.

The offender then stole her handbag and made off.

He is described as white, six feet tall and in his late 20s. He has short light brown hair and was wearing jeans.

Detective Sergeant Mark Shields, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was a callous attack on an elderly person that has understandably left her shaken.

"I would ask anyone who may have seen the described man in the area at the time or anyone with information about him to contact us.

"Victims of bogus callers or distraction burglaries are usually elderly and live by themselves and I'd urge everyone to help reduce the chance that the people you care about and your elderly neighbours are subject to this type of crime.

"Do not buy, sell or sign up to any work on the doorstep no matter how urgent they say the work is. If you are suspicious of the caller's intentions, tell them to go away and call a family member or neighbour and inform the police. If they won't leave, then call 999."

Members of the public should consider the following advice when answering the door:

LOCKED - Is the back door locked?
STOP - Am I expecting anyone?
CHAIN - Put the chain on BEFORE opening the door.
CHECK - Ask for the caller's identification. Shut the door leaving the caller on the doorstep and phone the number in the phone book NOT the one on the card they give you, as this could be an accomplice around the corner - especially if it is a mobile number. A genuine caller will be happy to wait while you do this.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 1:295. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
