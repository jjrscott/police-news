# Update â€“ officers name man who died at farm near Blandford

05 October 2018

* * *

Detectives are now in a position to name a man who died at a farm near Blandford.

At 8.25pm on Friday 28 September 2018 Dorset Police received a report that a 25-year-old local man had sustained serious injuries following an incident at Hanford Farm. Sadly he was later pronounced dead at the scene.

He has today, Friday 5 October 2018, been named by officers as Marcin Tameczka, who was a Polish national living locally. An inquest into his death was opened today and has been adjourned to 25 April 2019.

Formal identification took place on Wednesday 3 October 2018. His family are being supported by specially-trained officers.

An initial post mortem examination carried out on the evening of Saturday 29 September 2018 indicated the cause of death as blunt force trauma.

Two Shaftesbury men, aged 25 and 27, were arrested on suspicion of murder. The 25-year-old man was released on police bail and the 27-year-old man was released under investigation as detectives from Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT) continue their enquiries.

The three men involved were all known to each other.

Detectives are still appealing for anyone with information about the incident, who has not already spoken to officers, to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 28:454. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
