A man has been arrested following a reported firearms incident in Bournemouth.

At 10.09am today, Friday 3 November 2017, Dorset Police received a report that a man was believed to be in possession of a firearm in Bournemouth town centre. No threats were made to members of the public and nobody was injured.

Searches were carried out to locate the man. While responding to the incident, officers detained a man in Old Christchurch Road. However, it was very quickly established that he had no involvement in the incident.

Following further enquiries, officers attended an address near Fordingbridge in Hampshire and a 55-year-old man from Bournemouth was arrested on suspicion of possessing a firearm. He is currently assisting officers with their enquiries.
Two air weapons were recovered.

Detective Chief Superintendent Mark Callaghan, of Dorset Police, said: "This was a fast-moving incident and I would like to thank the public for their patience and understanding while this incident was ongoing and praise the professionalism of officers involved, including colleagues from Hampshire who assisted with the arrest of the man."
