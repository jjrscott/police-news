# Dorset Police officers to appear on Jeremy Kyle on Monday night

03 March 2017

* * *

Dorset Police officers are set to feature in an ITV documentary with Jeremy Kyle on Monday night at 8pm.

Kyle Files investigates high-profile issues that impact on people's lives across Britain, with the next episode focusing on dangers at the wheel.

Jeremy joined officers from the No Excuse and Traffic teams back in October to film the 30 minute documentary covering a speeding motorcyclist, a drug driver, a person using a mobile phone at the wheel and Operation Dragoon - our approach to tackling the most dangerous road users.

Dorset Police will be tweeting throughout the programme using the hashtag #KyleFiles asking members of the public to submit any questions in relation to the programme and road safety.

Questions will be answered during a LIVE Facebook Q&A video from the Dorset Police Facebook account immediately after the programme with Inspector Stu Pitman, Police Constable Simon Hatch and Special Constable Kier Dagnall who are all featured in the show.

Speaking during filming, Jeremy Kyle, said: "I think it goes to show that certainly here in Dorset, this force is doing everything in a proactive way to prevent and try and end death and injury on their roads. Thumbs up to them - fascinating."

Inspector Stuart Pitman, of Dorset Police, said: "This provided a great opportunity to promote the hard work of Dorset officers in reducing road casualties to a national audience.

"I am pleased we are able to demonstrate our strategy in both targeting high-risk road issues and addressing community concerns, which has successfully contributed to the reduction of the number of people killed and seriously injured on Dorset roads during 2016."

To submit a question to be answered at 8.30pm live on the Dorset Police Facebook account, please email webchat@dorset.pnn.police.uk or tweet @DorsetPolice including the hashtag #KyleFiles
