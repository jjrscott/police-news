# Assault in Poole - witness appeal

01 September 2017

* * *

Officers in Poole are appealing for witnesses after a man was assaulted.

The incident happened at around 1.10pm on Wednesday 23 August 2017 along Dorchester Road.

The victim - a 21-year-old local man - was walking along the pavement when a man in a new-looking dark grey Nissan drove past him and shouted abuse.

The car was then reversed and the driver got out, walked up to the victim and punched him in the face before returning to his car and driving away.

The victim required stitches at hospital.

The offender is described as white, aged in his late 40s, around six feet tall and of large build. He had short thinning hair with light-coloured shorts and a dark T-shirt.

Police Constable Tom Renshaw, of Dorset Police, said: "We believe this was an unprovoked assault and I am appealing to anyone who may have any information about the offender or witnessed the incident to please contact me."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170130943. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
