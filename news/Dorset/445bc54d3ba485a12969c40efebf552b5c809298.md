# Image appeal following indecent exposure in Bournemouth

13 January 2021

* * *

Officers investigating an incident where a man indecently exposed himself in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At around 2.10pm on Friday 8 January 2021 a local man aged in his 20s entered the public toilets on Southbourne Overcliff Drive shortly after another man. It is reported that the man who entered first proceeded to stand in the doorway and perform a lewd act in front of the other man.

The victim challenged the man and he left the toilets and walked off along the beach in the direction of Hengistbury Head.

Police Constable Ben Carter, of Bournemouth police, said: "This incident left the victim feeling scared and in fear of what may have happened next had he not challenged the man.

"As part of my enquiries I have obtained an image of the man. While I appreciate you cannot see his face in the picture, I am hoping someone may recognise him from the clothing he is wearing.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time and may have witnessed what happened."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210003350. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
