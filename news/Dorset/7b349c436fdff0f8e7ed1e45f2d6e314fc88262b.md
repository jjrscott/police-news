Detectives continue to investigate reports of an altercation where a man sustained stab wounds in Gillingham and are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

Officers were called at 11.17pm on Sunday 13 May 2018 to the incident that is alleged to have occurred in the car park at the Red Lion pub, High Street.

It was reported that the altercation occurred between a group of people and a 25-year-old Gillingham man sustained a stab wound to his chest. He was airlifted to Southampton General Hospital for treatment. He has since been discharged.

A 24-year-old man of no fixed abode was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and wounding with intent. Two local men aged 41 and 45 were arrested on suspicion of assault. A 17-year-old girl from Southampton was arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

Further arrests were made yesterday, including two men aged 25 and 28 and both from Gillingham who were arrested on suspicion of assault. A 26-year-old man of no fixed abode was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.

All seven people are assisting police with enquiries.

Two local men aged 20 and 22 were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder but have since been released without charge.
