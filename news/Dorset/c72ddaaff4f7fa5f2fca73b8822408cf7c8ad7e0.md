At 8.50pm on Saturday 25 January 2020 Dorset Police received a report from the ambulance service that a man had been found with serious injuries in a doorway near to Bar 7 in Christchurch Road in Boscombe. It was reported that the man had been involved in an altercation inside the bar at around 7.30pm and was subsequently assaulted outside the premises.
