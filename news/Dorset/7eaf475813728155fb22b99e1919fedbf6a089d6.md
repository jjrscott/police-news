# Appeal for witnesses following medical incident near Bournemouth Airport

09 January 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a cyclist sadly died following a suspected medical episode near Bournemouth Airport.

At 4.48pm yesterday, Tuesday 8 January 2019, emergency services were called to a report of a cyclist who suffered a medical episode on the B3073 Parley Lane between Bournemouth Airport and the Hurn Bridge junction.

Despite the best efforts of members of the public, the ambulance service, fire service and air ambulance crew, the cyclist - a local man aged in his 50s - was sadly pronounced dead at the scene at 5.45pm.

His family has been informed and a file is being prepared for the coroner.

Road closures were put in place as the emergency services dealt with the incident and were lifted at around 6.30pm.

Police Sergeant Phil Lee, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thought and condolences are very much with the man's family at this sad time.

"I wish to thank motorists for their patience while Parley Lane was closed while emergency services carried out their vital work and for essential investigation work to take place. It was opened as soon as it was safe to do so.

"While this death is not being treated as suspicious, we are carrying out an investigation to establish the full circumstances.

"I am appealing for any witnesses who may have seen the cyclist travelling between Hurn Bridge and Bournemouth Airport or any motorists travelling in the area at the time who may have relevant dashcam footage to contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at scit@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 8:307.
