# Witness appeal after serious assault in Poole

13 July 2017

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses after a serious assault in Poole.

The incident happened at around 8.30pm on Wednesday 5 July 2017 on Arne Avenue.

The victim - a 29-year-old Poole man - was leaving an address when he was spotted by an acquaintance who was sitting on a bus that was parked at a nearby bus stop.

He got off the bus and ran toward the victim. The victim fell over and was punched in the face and bitten on the cheek.

The force of the bite resulted in a chunk of the victim's cheek being ripped off, which has required surgery.

The offender then made further threats toward the victim before making off.

Detective Constable Jessica Pearcey, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I believe the incident was witnessed by members of the public, particularly those on the bus or at the bus stop at the time.

"I would ask these people, or anyone else with information, to please contact Dorset Police.

"Officers have been making various enquiries since the incident, including house to house and checking for the availability of CCTV and continue to make active enquiries to locate the suspect."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170102109. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
