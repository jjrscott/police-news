29 November 2018

* * *

Four people are due to appear in court in connection with a disturbance following a concert in Poole.

At 10.40pm on Thursday 17 May 2018 officers were called to reports of a group of people fighting in the bar area of the Lighthouse in Kingland Road following an Elvis Presley tribute concert.

During the altercation a man aged in his 50s sustained facial injuries and was taken to hospital for treatment. He suffered severe bruising and cuts, as well as a shoulder injury.

Four police officers who attended were reportedly assaulted as they went to detain those believed to be involved. None of the officers required hospital treatment.

A 56-year-old man from the Poole area has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 7 December 2018 for an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

Two woman, aged 20 and 53 and also from the Poole area, and a 19-year-old man from the Blandford area have been issued with postal requisitions to appear at the same court on the same date for offences of assaulting a constable in the execution of their duty.
