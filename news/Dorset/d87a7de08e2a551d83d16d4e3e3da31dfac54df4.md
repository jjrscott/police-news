# Witness appeal following reported robbery in Poole

23 January 2017

* * *

Detectives are appealing for a group of people who witnessed a reported robbery in Poole to come forward.

Sometime between 10.50pm and 11.30pm on Friday 20 January 2017 a man was driving his blue Ford Fiesta along Bourne Valley Road when he saw a man stood on the corner of Princess Road and slowed believing it was his friend.

As he pulled up, it is reported an unknown man opened the passenger door, jumped feet first into the car, kicked the driver and caused him to crash into a garden wall. It is alleged the victim was then pulled out of the car and was further assaulted by two men before they ran down Princess Road.

It is alleged the victim's mobile phone was stolen during the incident.

Detective Constable Aston Starkie, of Bournemouth CID, said: "It is believed that a group of people were stood on the bridge on Bourne Valley Road at the time of the reported incident. A taxi driver also drove past.

"I would urge these people to please get in contact with Dorset Police as they may have important information that could assist my investigation."

A 23-year-old man from Poole and a 29-year-old man of no fixed abode have been arrested on suspicion of robbery offences and have been released on police bail until mid-April 2017 pending further enquiries.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170010214. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
