# Appeal for information following reported indecent exposure in Weymouth

17 May 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a reported incident of indecent exposure in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 11am on Tuesday 7 May 2019 a Community Safety Patrol Officer on duty in the town centre was approached by a woman who reported that an intoxicated man was exposing himself.

Officers attended and a 38-year-old local man was arrested on suspicion of indecent exposure in the area of Weymouth train station. He has been released under investigation as enquiries continue.

Police Constable Gareth Morris, of Weymouth police, said: "We are continuing to investigate this incident and I am appealing for any witnesses who have not already spoken to police to contact us.

"I am particularly keen to speak to the woman who first informed the Community Safety Patrol Officer that she had witnessed the man exposing himself in Westham Road, as they were unable to take her details at the time."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190068395. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
