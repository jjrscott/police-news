Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a four-vehicle collision near Bridport.

Dorset Police was called at 11.05am today, Monday 1 April 2019, to reports of a multi-vehicle collision on the westbound carriageway of the A35.

Four vehicles were involved - a blue Vauxhall Grandland, silver Ford Transit van, grey BMW and a silver Skoda Octavia.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who may have captured the incident on dashcam."
