# Update - Police day of action in West Dorset

11 May 2018

* * *

A man is due to appear in court this month charged in connection with drug offences.

On Monday 6 November 2017 officers carried out a day of action in Bridport, Dorchester and Weymouth as part of an ongoing operation to target suspected drug dealers and vulnerable people.

As a result of proactive patrols in Weymouth, a 23-year-old man and a 27-year-old man- both from Weymouth - were arrested on suspicion of possession and drug supply offences and were released under investigation while enquiries continued.

The 23-year-old man, of no fixed abode, has been issued with a postal requisition to appear before Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Monday 21 May 2018 for an offence of offering to supply amphetamine.

A 27-year-old man has been released from under investigation and has been told there will be no further police action.
