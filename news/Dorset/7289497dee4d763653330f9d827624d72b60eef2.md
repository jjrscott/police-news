# Robbery in Bournemouth Gardens - witness appeal

19 August 2016

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses after two people were robbed in Bournemouth Gardens.

The incident happened at around 3.20am today, Friday 19 August 2016, when the victims - a 17-year-old male student from Saudi Arabia and an 18-year-old female student from Italy - were sat on a bench opposite the mini golf in the Lower Gardens.

The pair were approached by two men who are described by the victims as being of Arabic appearance. One was wearing a balaclava and the other wearing a coat with a hood covering his head.

One of the offenders pointed a blade toward the victims and demanded money. He then snatched a mobile phone from one of the victims and a handbag from the other victim.

Both offenders then ran off past the Pavilion toward Westover Road.

Detective Constable Neil Jones, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This type of incident is completely unacceptable and I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the incident or saw two men matching the description acting suspiciously in the area around the time of the incident to contact me.

"Police regularly conduct patrols throughout the town centre and Bournemouth Gardens to proactively prevent crime and disorder and we will continue to do so following this incident to offer further reassurances to the public."
