# Criminal damage in Christchurch - witness appeal

30 September 2016

* * *

Police are appealing for witnesses after a car was damaged in Christchurch.

The incident happened at around 7am on Thursday 29 September 2016 when the victim - a local woman aged in her 40s - had opened her car boot in Ramsdown car park on Matchams Lane.

She heard glass smashing and saw that one of the rear windows of her Ford Fiesta had a big hole in it.

Police Constable Andy Kennedy, of Christchurch police, said: "The victim did not see anyone or hear anything apart from the glass smashing and it is not known what caused the damage.

"I am appealing to anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious in the area at the time of the incident to come forward."
