* * *

Officers investigating a series of break-ins at an industrial estate in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Between 9pm on Sunday 20 September and 3am on Monday 21 September 2020 five commercial premises on the Granby Industrial Estate were broken into and various items taken.

The stolen items include a quantity of aluminium taken from one business that was formed into billets and rounds and has serial number markers on the surface starting with 'WQ'.

Police Constable Matthew Love, of Weymouth police, said: "These types of offences have a serious impact on local businesses and we will do all we can to identify those responsible.

"Our investigation is ongoing and I would like to hear from anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity on the night of Sunday 20 September into the early hours of Monday 21 September 2020 in the areas of Cambridge Road, Kent Close or the Granby Industrial Estate.

"I would also urge anyone who may have seen any vehicles acting suspiciously in the area over the weekend or who comes across the stolen aluminium to please come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200142117. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
