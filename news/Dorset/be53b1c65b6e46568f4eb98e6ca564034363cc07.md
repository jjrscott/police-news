# Witness appeal following robbery in Bournemouth

31 December 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating reports of a robbery in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The victim, a local man aged in his 20s, was walking in Roumelia Lane in Boscombe at around 4.30am on Christmas Day when two men walked past him.

Seconds later he was pushed to his knees and when on the floor one of the offenders kicked him while the other patted his pockets. They pulled on his trouser leg and the trousers came off.

The men made off down Roumelia Lane toward Adeline Road with his trousers, which had the victim's iPhone, house keys and wallet in the pockets. In the wallet was a bank card, ID card and between £200 and £300 in cash.

The victim was taken to hospital for treatment to cuts and bruising to his face and knees.

The offenders were described as white, around five feet nine inches tall and of average build and were wearing dark clothing.

Detective Constable Steph Ashworth, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was a violent incident and we are carrying out a detailed investigation to identify those responsible.

"I am appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident, or any suspicious activity in the area of Roumelia Lane around the relevant time, to contact us."
