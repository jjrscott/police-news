# Witness appeal following burglary near Dorchester

16 September 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a commercial burglary near Dorchester are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 11.35pm on Sunday 1 September 2019 a burglary occurred at a commercial premises off Dorchester Road in Grimstone.

It is believed that two offenders arrived at the premises in a small white van, possibly a Vauxhall Combo. One of them, wearing a hooded top and of average height and slim build, is reported to have got out and used an angle grinder to cut the chain on a gate before they drove into the yard.

A padlock was also cut from a shipping container, possibly with the angle grinder as well, and the offenders spent around 20 minutes at the property before driving off toward Yeovil. It is not clear whether anything was taken at this stage as the container had recently been emptied by the owner.

Police Constable Simon Rogers, of Dorchester police, said: "We are continuing to investigate this burglary and I am appealing for anyone with information that can assist us to please get in touch.

"I am keen to hear from anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area on the night of Sunday 1 September 2019. I understand a number of vehicles drove past while one of the offenders was cutting the chain to the gate, although he stopped when he saw the lights approaching.

"I would also urge any motorists with dashcam fitted to their vehicle who were driving in the area at the time to check their footage for anything relevant."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190138401. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
