# Witness appeal following burglary at Bournemouth cemetery

16 January 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a break-in at a storage container at a Bournemouth cemetery are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 10pm yesterday, Tuesday 15 January 2019, Dorset Police received a report of suspicious activity in the area of North Cemetery in Strouden Avenue.

Officers attended and discovered that a container in the grounds of the cemetery, which is used to store gardening equipment, had been broken into. A section of fencing backing onto Howard Road had been cut and a number of items, including strimmers and chainsaws had been taken.

Police Sergeant Adam Gill, of Bournemouth police, said: "It is believed the total value of the items taken was several thousand pounds and we have been carrying out a number of enquiries to identify who is responsible for this crime.

"I am appealing for any witnesses or anyone who saw any suspicious activity in the area of the cemetery around 10pm last night to please contact us.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who has been offered gardening equipment for sale in unusual circumstances since yesterday evening."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190007857. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
