Officers in Weymouth and Portland are issuing advice to residents following a series of motorbike thefts and a spate of thefts from cars.

There have been more than 20 incidents in the area since the start of April and officers are appealing for anyone with information to contact them.

The cars targeted have been unlocked or with high value items left on display.

Officers are encouraging motorcyclists to make sure their bikes are properly secured and motorists are being warned not to leave valuables in their vehicles.

Officers will also be stepping up overnight patrols during the half term break next week.

Police Constable Darren Tharme of Weymouth and Portland police, said: "I would urge anyone who sees individuals behaving suspiciously around motorcycles and cars, has any information about stolen motorbikes or those using them to please contact us.

"I would also like to advise motorcycle owners to ensure their vehicles are secured at all times with a suitable wheel lock when unattended and, if possible, parked in a garage or secure area overnight.

"Please remove or hide valuables from view and ensure your vehicle is secure."
