# Witness appeal following two road traffic collisions in Bournemouth

05 December 2020

* * *

Officers investigating two road traffic collisions in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Both incidents happened on Beechey Road with the first collision reported at 2.26pm on Saturday 5 December 2020. This involved an ambulance and two cars - a Peugeot 207 and a Hyundai i40.

A short time later a report was received that a second collision had occurred at the same location involving a Skoda Kodiaq car and Agility City motorcycle.

No injuries were sustained.

A road closure was put in place to enable officers to deal with the incident.

Chief Inspector Danny Thompson, of Dorset Police, said: "I am appealing for any witnesses to either collision or anyone with information about the manner of driving of any of the vehicles involved to please come forward.

"I would like to thank motorists for their patience while the road closure was in place. This was necessary to keep everyone involved at the scene safe."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 5:450. Alternatively, or alternatively to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
