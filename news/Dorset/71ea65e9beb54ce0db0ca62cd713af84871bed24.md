# Witness appeal after theft of post box in Weymouth

22 August 2016

* * *

Police in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a Royal Mail post box was stolen.

Sometime between 9pm on Saturday 13 August and 6pm on Sunday 14 August 2016, a post box was stolen from the junction of Nottington Lane and Church Lane in the Buckland Ripers area. The incident was reported to Dorset Police at 3.30pm on Friday 19 August.

Deputy Neighbourhood Inspector Tony Burden, of Weymouth police, said: "The residents of Buckland Ripers are now without a post box and for some people this is the only post box they can easily access.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed this incident or has any information about who may have been responsible to please contact Dorset Police urgently.

"I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who has seen a Royal Mail post box being offered for sale locally."
 Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55160125303. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
