Officers investigating a reported burglary at an address in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

It is reported that between 12.55pm and 1.05pm on Wednesday 17 March 2021 a burglary occurred at an address in Alder Road.

A man was allegedly seen to run out of the address and get into a silver BMW vehicle that was parked at a nearby bus stop.

Electronic items, including tablets and a mobile phone were reportedly stolen, as well as items of jewellery and bank cards.

Following enquiries two men from Poole, aged 34 and 43, were arrested on suspicion of burglary. They have been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Police Constable Liam Moss, of Dorset Police's Priority Crime Team, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the area and witnessed what happened to please get in touch.

"I am also keen to hear from any motorists who were driving along Alder Road around the time of the incident and may have captured anything of relevance on dashcam footage."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210042649. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
