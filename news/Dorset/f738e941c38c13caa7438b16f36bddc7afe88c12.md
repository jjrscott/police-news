# Appeal for information after items recovered in Poole

22 March 2021

* * *

Officers are issuing an appeal to try and reunite the owners of recovered items in Poole with their property.

At around 9pm on Thursday 18 March 2021 Dorset Police received a report that two young people were seen acting suspiciously with an electric mobility scooter on Sandy Lane in Upton.

When a member of the public began to approach the scooter, the male teenagers ran off and left the scooter in the road.

A bag was found on the scooter that contained a Mac garden strimmer, a DeWalt boxed jigsaw tool and a boxed hammer drill.

The scooter is described as a red ShopRider mobility scooter.

Police Constable Sarah Donnelly, of Poole police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who has lost any of the items described recently to please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210043552. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
