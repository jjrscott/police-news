# Witness appeal following assaults in Weymouth

30 October 2018

* * *

Officers investigating assaults on two people in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police received a report at around 1.15am on Saturday 27 October 2018 of an incident in the rear car parks of The Richmoor and Mon Ami Hotels on The Esplanade in Weymouth.

It was reported that two holidaymakers - a man aged in his 30s and a woman aged in her 40s - were assaulted by a group of five people, three men and two women, at the location. One of the men in the group also reportedly made racially-aggravated threats of violence toward the victims.

The male victim sustained two bite wounds as a result and was taken to hospital for treatment. The woman did not sustain any injuries that required medical treatment.

Two parked motor vehicles in the area of the incident were also damaged, with one sustaining a smashed windscreen.

Police Constable Anneka Harding, of Weymouth police, said: "We are appealing for anyone may have witnessed the incident or seen the people involved in the area around the relevant time.

"Officers have made a number of enquiries and carried out forensic work as we seek to identify those involved.

"I would ask that anyone who can identify them, or who has any information that can assist our investigation, contacts us immediately."

Anyone with information about the incident is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180173844. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
