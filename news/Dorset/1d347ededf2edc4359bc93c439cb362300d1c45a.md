The collision occurred at around 11.30am today, Tuesday 2 October 2018, on Creekmoor Lane. It involved a blue and white motorcycle and a Red Seat Ibiza motor car.

The male motorcyclist, aged 17 and from Bournemouth, was taken by air ambulance to Southampton General Hospital with serious injuries.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who may have captured the incident on dashcam.

"Finally, I would like to thank motorists for their patience and understanding during the road closures, which are absolutely necessary to allow the emergency services to work at the scene and for a detailed examination to take place."
