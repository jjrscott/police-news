# Witness appeal following reported attempted theft near Gillingham

10 January 2017

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a reported attempted theft from a motor vehicle near Gillingham.

At around 8.30pm on Sunday 8 January 2017 officers were called to reports that three men were attempting to break into a Land Rover Defender which was parked on the old A303 road in Bourton.

It is alleged the men were disturbed by the owner and are believed to have got into a grey or silver-coloured Vauxhall Astra which was waiting nearby.

The victim - a local man aged in his 40s - sustained a minor injury to his leg which is alleged to have been caused by an air pistol or BB gun.

Two men aged 20 and 34 and both from Shaftesbury have been arrested on suspicion of attempted theft from a motor vehicle, criminal damage, assault and possession of an air weapon while committing an offence. They have been released on police bail pending further enquiries until the middle of February 2017.

Detective Constable Andy Lovering, of Weymouth CID: said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or knows who was responsible to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who may have seen two men hitchhiking on the B3081 near to Port Regis School between Gillingham and Shaftesbury at around 7pm to 8pm the same evening."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 8:350. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
