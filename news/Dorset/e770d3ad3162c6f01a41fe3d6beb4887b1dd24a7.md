A man is due to appear in court in connection with a reported assault on Portland.

It was reported that at around 1.30am on Sunday 9 August 2020 two men were assaulted on Fortuneswell. One of the victims was reportedly hit in the face with a large rock and had his head stamped on, knocking him unconscious.

Following enquiries, a 21-year-old man from Portland was arrested and he has now been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 10 February 2021 for an offence of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent.
