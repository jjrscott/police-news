# Witness appeal following hate crime incident in Christchurch

23 November 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward as they investigate a hate crime incident in Christchurch.

The incident occurred in the car park of Wickes in Somerford Road between 12pm and 12.30pm on Saturday 21 November 2020. The victim, a local man aged in his 40s who is originally from Poland, became involved in a verbal exchange with a man who reportedly entered the car park at high speed before parking in a disabled bay, nearly colliding with the victim as he did so.

The man was racially abusive toward the victim before approaching him with his arms raised and fists clenched and swinging punches at him. The victim dodged the punches and returned to his own vehicle.

The offender is described as white, aged in his 50s, around five feet nine inches tall and of slim build. He was driving a blue car, believed to be a Ford C-Max.

Police Constable James Prowse, of East Dorset police, said: "We take hate crime very seriously and are carrying out a number of enquiries to identify the man responsible for this offence.

"I am appealing to any witnesses, or motorists who were in the car park at the time and may have captured something relevant on dashcam, to please contact us.

"I understand a number of people approached the victim after the altercation to check he was all right and I would be keen to hear from these individuals as they may be potential witnesses."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200175485. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
