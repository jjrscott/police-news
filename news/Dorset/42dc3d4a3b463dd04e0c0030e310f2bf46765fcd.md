* * *

Three people arrested in connection with a reported serious assault in Bournemouth will face no further police action.

At 1.02pm on Monday 15 July 2019 we received a report that two boys aged 16 and 17 had suffered stab wounds in Boscombe Spa Road.

The victims were treated by the ambulance service and taken to hospital. Their condition is not described as life-threatening.

A 17-year-old boy from London, a 25-year-old man also from London and a 26-year-old man of no fixed abode were arrested on Monday 15 July 2019 on suspicion of attempted murder. Following enquiries, they will face no further police action.

On Tuesday 16 July 2019 firearms officers arrested two men and two women at an address in Windham Road in Bournemouth. An 18-year-old London man and a 20-year-old man from Bournemouth were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. A 20-year-old woman from London and a 61-year-old Bournemouth woman were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. They have all been released on police bail while enquiries continue.

Detective Sergeant Mark White, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I would like to renew my appeal for witnesses who were in the area of Boscombe Spa Road at the relevant time, and have not yet spoken to police, to please come forward.

"Residents can continue to expect there to be an increased police presence in the Boscombe Spa Road and Windham Road areas while enquiries into this incident remain ongoing and officers from the local neighbourhood policing team can be approached with any community concerns."
