Officers are investigating a collision in Bournemouth and appealing for any witnesses or motorists with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

It was reported at 10.07am on Friday 5 June 2020 that a collision occurred involving a black Renault Clio and a pedestrian on Fisherman's Avenue near to Fisherman's Walk.

The pedestrian, a local man aged in his 60s, sustained injuries to his spine and neck and was taken to hospital for treatment by the ambulance service. He has since been discharged and is recovering at home.

The driver of the Renault was uninjured.

Police Constable Hollie Wilson, of Bournemouth police, said: "We believe there were two people in the area at the time of the collision and I am appealing for them to come forward as they may have information to assist my investigation.

"They are described as a man pulling a trolley bag full of leaflets who was in company with a young woman.

"I would also like to hear from any motorists who were in the area and may have captured any relevant dashcam footage."
