# Murder investigation launched in Boscombe

03 May 2018

* * *

Detectives have launched a murder inquiry following the death of a man who was found injured in a Bournemouth street.

At 4.17pm yesterday, Wednesday 2 May 2018, Dorset Police was called by the ambulance service to reports that a man had been found with head injuries in Churchill Road in Boscombe.

The man, who is aged in his 40s, was taken to hospital in a life-threatening condition but he sadly died from his injuries earlier today, Thursday 3 May 2018.

His next of kin have yet to be informed. The coroner has been notified.

A full investigation is now underway led by detectives from Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team.

Senior Investigating Officer Neil Devoto, of the MCIT, said: "At this time we are treating the death as suspicious and enquiries are underway to establish how he came to sustain his injuries. A post-mortem examination will be held in due course and this should give us more indication of the exact cause of his death.

"We are aware that there were a number of people in the area when this man came to sustain his injuries and I would urge anyone who witnessed what happened or has any information that could assist our investigation to please come forward.

"From our initial CCTV enquiries we know there were a number of school children in the area and I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who was on their way home from school and may have seen or heard something that could be relevant to my investigation."

A cordon has been put in place in Churchill Road and the road remains closed between Borthwick Road and Walpole Road while crime scene investigators examine the area.

Officers are also carrying out house-to-house visits and making CCTV enquiries.

Neighbourhood Inspector Cheyne Marley said: "I appreciate this incident is understandably concerning for residents and I would like to reassure them that a full and thorough investigation is underway.

"Detectives from Bournemouth CID continue to investigate a separate stabbing incident that happened close by. From our initial enquiries, there is nothing to suggest these two incidents are in any way linked.

"Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team, supported by Bournemouth Borough Council's Operation Galaxy team, will be carrying out additional patrols in the area over the coming days and can be approached with any community concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 2:317. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
