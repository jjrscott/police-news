Officers are investigating a serious road traffic collision in Poole and are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The incident, which happened in the car park of Asda Stores in West Quay Road and involved a silver Vauxhall Insignia and a pedestrian, was reported to police at 2.08pm on Friday 18 September 2020.

The pedestrian, a 69-year-old local woman, was taken to Southampton General Hospital by the ambulance service with life-threatening injuries. The driver of the car, a 39-year-old man from Poole, was uninjured.

Specialist officers from the roads policing unit attended and carried out extensive scene investigations.

Police Sergeant Sarah Jones, of the traffic unit, said: "At this time of day there would have obviously been a number of people in the car park and I am appealing for any witnesses who have not yet spoken with police to please come forward.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who may have captured relevant footage on dashcam."
