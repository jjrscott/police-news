07 November 2019

* * *

Two people arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender during an investigation into the death of a man in Weymouth will face no further police action.

Dorset Police was called at 10.17am on Saturday 7 September 2019 by the ambulance service following reports of the sudden death of a 75-year-old man - named by detectives as John Cornish - at an address on The Esplanade in Weymouth.

Following enquiries into the circumstances surrounding the death and a post-mortem examination, Aaron Kirk Brown, 38 and from Weymouth, and 28-year-old Hannah Jayne Rebecca Day of no fixed abode were arrested and subsequently charged with manslaughter and robbery. Hannah Day was also charged with theft and five counts of fraud by false representation.

They last appeared at Winchester Crown Court on Tuesday 5 November 2019 and are next due to appear at the same court on Friday 6 December 2019.

During the course of the investigation two men from Weymouth, aged 37 and 66, were also arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender and were released under investigation.

Both men have now been released from the investigation and will face no further police action.
