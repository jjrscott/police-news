# Witness appeal following robbery in Sherborne

02 September 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a woman was robbed as she walked through Sherborne town centre.

At 7.15am on Monday 2 September 2019 the victim - a local woman aged in her 20s - was walking along Lenthay Road when she noticed a man sitting on the wall of the cemetery.

As she passed the man, he stood up and began following her into Horsecastles, Acreman Street, Digby Road and into Pageant Gardens.

As she reached Pageant Gardens, the man shouted at the victim. She turned around and the offender grabbed her handbag, a mobile phone she was holding and a plastic carrier bag.

He went into her bag, took her purse out and rifled through it. He stole a Â£10 note and two bank cards before he threw the rest of her belongings on the floor.

One of the bank cards was subsequently used to make a fraudulent contactless payment.

Police Constable Glen Caddy, of Dorset Police, said: "This was a very frightening incident for the victim and I am appealing to anyone who was in the Sherborne area at the relevant time and either saw or heard anything suspicious to please contact me.

"Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team can be approached by members of the public with any community concerns."
