04 April 2018

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a reported serious assault and criminal damage incident in Poole.

At 10.06pm on Wednesday 4 April 2018, Dorset Police received a report of a man banging on the door of an address in Dale Close.

It is alleged that the offender used a hammer to cause damage to a number of vehicles in the area, and also to windows of properties in the street.

When officers arrived at the scene, it is reported that the man attempted to seriously assault a police officer. They sustained minor injuries as a result of the incident.

A 35-year-old Poole man has been arrested on suspicion of assault, affray, criminal damage, possession of an offensive weapon in a public place and attempted murder and is currently assisting officers with their enquiries.

Chief Inspector Stewart Dipple, of Dorset Police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident, and has not yet spoken to police, to please get in touch.

"I believe that a large number of vehicles are reported to have been damaged, specifically in the Dale Close and Dale Road area. If you find that your vehicle has been damaged, please contact police.

"A full investigation is now underway. I would like to reassure the community that officers from the local neighbourhood policing team are available and can be approached by members of the public with any concerns."
