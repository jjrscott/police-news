# Appeal for information following reported theft in East Dorset

04 September 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a report of a theft at a farm in East Dorset are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police received a report that an orange Kubota chipper machine had been stolen from a farm in the Gaunts Common area near Wimborne overnight on Friday 30 August 2019.

Following enquiries by officers and information received, the chipper machine was located in Poole along with a number of other suspected stolen items. A subsequent search of an address revealed a small number of suspected cannabis plants.

A 28-year-old Poole man has been arrested on suspicion of handling stolen goods and being concerned in the production of a class B drug and has been released under investigation as enquiries continue.

Police Sergeant Jane Moore, of East Dorset police, said: "I am pleased that we have been able to locate the chipper that was reported stolen and return it to the owner.

"We are continuing to investigate the theft and I am appealing to anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity or vehicle movements in the Gaunts Common area on the night of Friday 30 August 2019, or who has any information in relation to the offence, to contact us.

"Finally, this case also demonstrates the importance of recording the serial number of high value items so they can be traced if they are reported stolen and returned to their owners."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190138320. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
