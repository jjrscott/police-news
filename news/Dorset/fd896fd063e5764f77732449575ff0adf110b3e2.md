# Appeal for information following robbery in Bournemouth

26 November 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for the public's help after a man aged in his 70s was robbed in a Bournemouth town centre car park.

At around 7.10pm on Saturday 24 November 2018 the victim was getting into his car in the grounds of St Andrew's United Reformed Church off St Stephen's Road when he was approached by a man.

Before he got a chance to close the driver's door, the offender threatened to stab the victim and demanded his wallet. No knife was seen.

A struggle occurred between the victim and offender and the victim sounded the car horn in an attempt to spook him. This was successful and the offender left the scene through nearby bushes and onto the School of English car park.

The victim, a local man, discovered his mobile phone had been stolen. He sustained minor injuries to his legs.

The offender is described as white, aged in his 30s, six feet tall and of big build. He had short dark hair, was clean shaven and wore a black waist-length jacket and black trousers. He spoke in an Eastern European accent.

Detective Constable Tom Bancroft, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We have carried out a number of enquiries but unfortunately the incident was not covered by CCTV.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the St Stephen's Road area at the time and saw a man matching the description given to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk, or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180189625. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
