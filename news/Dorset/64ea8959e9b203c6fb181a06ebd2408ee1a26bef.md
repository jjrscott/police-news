Officers searching for a wanted man are appealing for help from the public to find him.

Mourad Zaidi, aged 49, is wanted by Dorset Police in relation to the alleged possession of a false passport and failing to appear at court.

The French national, who may be using a different name, is described as around five feet six inches tall and of medium build with shaved grey hair.

He has links to the Bournemouth and Poole areas.

Detective Sergeant Ian Allen, of Dorset Police, said: "We have been carrying out various enquiries as we attempt to locate Mourad Zaidi but these have so far been unsuccessful.

"I would urge anyone with information as to his whereabouts, or who sees a man matching the description given, to please contact us.

"I would urge anyone who sees Zaidi not to approach him but to immediately contact Dorset Police on 999."

If you see Mourad Zaidi you should dial 999 immediately. Anyone with other information should call 101, quoting occurrence 55190092084 or Crimestoppers in confidence on 0800 555 111.
