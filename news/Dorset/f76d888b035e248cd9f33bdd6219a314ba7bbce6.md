# Man arrested following reported fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth

30 October 2016

* * *

Officers have arrested a man in relation to a reported fail-to-stop road traffic collision in Bournemouth and are appealing for a second man to come forward.

At around 4.47am on Thursday 27 October 2016, a collision occurred in Poole Road at the junction of Queens Road involving a gold Vauxhall Tigra and a cyclist. It was reported that the Tigra failed to stop at the scene and was found abandoned nearby a short time later. It has been recovered by officers.

The cyclist - a local man aged in his 30s - sustained serious injuries and was taken to Poole Hospital for treatment. His condition is not believed to be life-threatening.

Police Sergeant Nikki Burt, of Dorset Police's Traffic Unit, said: "We believe a second man was travelling in the Tigra at the time of the collision and I am appealing for him to come forward.

"We continue to appeal for witnesses and anyone with information about the incident to contact police.

"I would particularly like to speak to the driver or passengers of a silver van, possibly a Vauxhall Vivaro or a Renault Traffic, and a yellow taxi that are believed to have been travelling along Poole Road at the time of the collision."

A 21-year-old Bournemouth man has been arrested on suspicion of driving offences and is currently on police bail until the middle of December 2016 pending further enquiries.

It is alleged the Tigra had failed to stop for police officers in the early hours of Thursday 27 October 2016 and a police follow was aborted around two hours and 20 minutes prior to the collision.

However, as a marked police vehicle was in Poole Road at the time of collision the matter has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) as is mandatory in such circumstances. It would be inappropriate to comment further while the investigation takes place.
