Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a serious collision on the A35 near Dorchester.

The collision occurred to the west of Winterbourne Abbas just before 3.30pm today, Wednesday 27 December 2017 between two cars - a blue Ford Fiesta and a red Volkswagen High Up.

Three people are currently being treated for serious injuries.

Road closures have been put in place on the A35 between Dorchester and Bridport in both directions and are likely to be in place for some time. Motorists are asked to find alternative routes.

Police Inspector Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "Officers are currently at the scene dealing with the incident, along with colleagues from the fire and ambulance services. An air ambulance is also in attendance.

"I would appeal to anyone who witnessed the collision or the driving of either vehicle immediately prior to the incident to please contact Dorset Police.

"I wish to thank everyone for their patience while the road closures are in place, which are absolutely necessary to allow us to tend to the injured and investigate this collision thoroughly."
