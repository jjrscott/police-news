Officers investigating a reported road rage incident in Sturminster Newton are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The incident occurred at around 8.45pm on Thursday 23 May 2019 outside the Royal British Legion building in Bath Road.

It was reported that a man driving a Volkswagen Golf had been involved in some kind of altercation with another man who was out walking his dogs. It was alleged that the driver had been in possession of a knife.

When officers attended both men had left the scene. A vehicle was stopped in the town following a search and a 30-year-old Weymouth man was detained.

He was arrested on suspicion of affray and possessing an offensive weapon in a public place and has been released under investigation.

Police Constable Ed Messinger, of North Dorset police, said: "We are continuing to make enquiries into this incident but we have so far been unable to locate the alleged victim of this incident so we can obtain his account.

"I would urge this man or anyone who directly witnessed the incident to please contact police."
