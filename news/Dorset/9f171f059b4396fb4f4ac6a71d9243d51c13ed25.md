# Update â€“ CCTV appeal following reported hate crime incident in Bournemouth

12 August 2020

* * *

A man has been identified and is assisting officers with their investigation in relation to an alleged racially aggravated public order incident in Bournemouth.

At around 1.15pm on Tuesday 14 July 2020 a man entered an office building on Richmond Hill and asked about getting a job. A staff member told him the process and the man reportedly became verbally abusive and aggressive toward them, including using racially aggravated language.

Following a CCTV appeal, a local man aged in his 50s is assisting officers with their enquiries. No arrests have been made.
