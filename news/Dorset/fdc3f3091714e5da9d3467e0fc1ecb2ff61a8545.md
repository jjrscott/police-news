# Renewed appeal following fail-to-stop collision in Poole

10 August 2016

* * *

Officers investigating a fail-to-stop collision in Poole which has left a cyclist with a brain injury have renewed their appeal for the public's help.

A 55-year-old local man was riding from Broadstone and had travelled around the roundabout at the junction with Longmeadow Lane when the incident occurred.

A grey Mazda convertible was coming from Upton Road and failed to give way and hit the cyclist causing him to fall from his bike. The driver failed to stop at the scene.

The 55-year-old victim suffered concussion, a broken collar bone and cuts and bruises and he was treated at Poole Hospital.

Doctors have now established that the victim sustained a brain injury and his recovery is expected to take some time.

The incident happened at around 11.40am on Friday 22 July 2016.

Police Constable Julie Loveless, of Dorset Police's Traffic Unit, said: "We appealed for witnesses shortly after the collision and I would urge anyone who recalls seeing the incident and has not yet spoken to police to please come forward.

"I am particularly keen to speak to anyone who is aware of a grey convertible Mazda that sustained damage to the front driver's side. You may have been asked to repair or assess a similar vehicle or seen a convertible Mazda with damage.

"I would urge anyone with information to please come forward immediately."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 22:168.
