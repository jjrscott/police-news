Detectives investigating a stabbing in Poole are appealing for any witnesses to come forward.

Officers were called at 12.35pm today, Friday 16 June 2017, to reports that a man had sustained stab wounds in Hatch Pond Road on the Nuffield Industrial Estate.

Paramedics and the air ambulance also attended the scene and the victim, a man aged in his 30s, was taken to Southampton General Hospital with serious life-threatening injuries.

Hatch Pond Road has been closed while the emergency services deal with the incident.

A 27-year-old Swanage man was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder in Wimborne Road shortly after the incident and is currently assisting officers with enquiries.

Detective Inspector Neil Wright, of Dorset Police, said: "We are continuing to investigate this incident and I would urge any witnesses or anyone who has any further information to contact police immediately.

"There will continue to be a heavy police presence in the area and officers from the local Neighbourhood Policing Team will be visiting businesses and members of the local community to offer reassurance."
