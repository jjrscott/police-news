# Man due in court in connection with death of elderly man in Poole

02 January 2019

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with the death of an elderly man in Poole.

At 8.31pm on Monday 17 December 2018 Dorset Police was called by the ambulance service to reports that a man aged in his 80s had been assaulted at an address in Phyldon Close in Poole.

The man - named by detectives as 82-year-old Charles Roy Taylor - sustained a serious head injury and was taken to hospital for treatment. Very sadly, he died in hospital on the evening of Tuesday 1 January 2019. His family has been informed and is being kept updated by specially-trained officers.

26-year-old Matthew Locks from Poole, who was known to Mr Taylor, was arrested at the scene and later charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent. He appeared at Poole Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 19 December 2018 and the case was adjourned to Thursday 17 January 2019 at Bournemouth Crown Court.

Following the death of Mr Taylor, a murder investigation has been launched by detectives from Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT).

Detective Inspector Richard Dixey, of MCIT, said: "We have regularly updated the family of Mr Taylor during the course of the investigation and our family liaison officers will continue to support them.

"Due to the ongoing court process it would be entirely inappropriate for Dorset Police to comment any further at this stage as it is vital that the justice system is allowed to follow its course."

Anyone with information about the incident who has not already spoken to officers is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence 55180202137. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
