Dorset Police is issuing advice to those celebrating Halloween to make it is a happy and safe time for everyone.

If you are going trick or treating this Halloween we want you to have fun and be safe, but remember, not everyone wants you to call at their home.

Dorset Police is encouraging members of the public who do not want to be bothered by trick-or-treaters to download and print a poster available at www.dorset.police.uk/Halloween and place it in the front door or window of their home. A poster is also available on the site for retailers, focusing on the sale of flour and eggs.

Bob Bunney, from the Prevention Department, said: “In recent years we’ve seen an increase in the number of people participating in Halloween fun.

“We’d say to anyone who’s going trick-or-treating to think about other people, particularly the elderly and vulnerable, as they may get worried if strangers are continually calling at the door during the evening.

“We don’t want to discourage anyone or spoil anyone’s fun, but we’d ask people not to call at homes displaying the poster.”

To have fun and stay safe this Halloween, follow these top tips:
• Children should always be accompanied by an adult when they are trick-or-treating.
• Only go to houses of people you know and who are happy for you to call.
• Stay safe, keep to places that you know and are well lit. Do not take short cuts through gardens, alleyways or parks.
• Watch out for traffic - drivers might not see you.
• Carry a torch and a fully charged mobile phone (if you have one).
