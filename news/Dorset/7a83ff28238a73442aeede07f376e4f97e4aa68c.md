Police investigating a burglary at a workshop in Christchurch are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward.

Between 7.45pm on Friday 19 August and 7.30am on Saturday 20 August 2016, entry was gained to a property on Wilverley Road.

A search was carried out and a number of items were stolen including a large tool box with Snap-on tools inside with a total value of approximately Â£10,000.

Two Solus Edge diagnostic machines still in their boxes were also stolen from the property.

On Saturday 20 August at 9.24am police received a report that a van had been stolen from Purewell Electrical also on Wilverley Road, Christchurch.

The vehicle contained a number of large household appliances and tools.

The van has since been recovered from the West Midlands area with nothing inside.

Police Constable Lucy Syme, of Christchurch police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who saw any suspicious activity in the Wilverley Road area between the relevant times to get in touch.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who has seen or heard of Snap-on tools or any of the other items stolen being sold in suspicious circumstances."
