Detectives are issuing an appeal for information after a street robbery in Bournemouth.

The victim - a 21-year-old local man - was walking along St Peter's Path in the grounds of St Peter's Church, from St Peter's Road toward Hinton Road, at around 7pm on Thursday 25 October 2018.

He was hit on the back of the head with a solid object, causing him to stumble forward. Two men then pushed him to the ground, before taking cash and a rucksack which contained a hooded top. The pair then made off in the direction of St Peter's Road.

The victim was taken to hospital with cuts to his head and face.

One of the offenders was wearing a grey tracksuit, the other offender was wearing a black tracksuit.

Detective Sergeant Mark Portelli, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We are making active enquiries to identify the offenders including assessing any CCTV available and I am appealing for anyone with information to please come forward.

"I would particularly like to hear from anyone who witnessed two men matching the above description acting suspiciously in the area around the time of the incident."
