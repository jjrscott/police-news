# Image appeal following animal cruelty incident in Christchurch

08 February 2021

* * *

Officers investigating an animal cruelty and public order incident in Christchurch are issuing images of a man they would like to speak to.

At around 9.30am on Monday 25 January 2021 a woman attended Central convenience store in Bure Lane, Mudeford, and left her dog - a small French Bulldog - outside with her mother and young son.

When the woman came out she was informed an unknown man had approached the dog and kicked it with some force to the stomach before going into the shop.

She went back in and challenged the man, who became aggressive and verbally abusive toward her.

Police Constable Jon Park, of Dorset Police, said: "This was a distressing incident for the woman as well as her family members who witnessed the attack on the dog.

"We are making enquiries into this matter and I am issuing images of a man who we would like to speak to as part of our investigation.

"I would urge anyone who has information as to his identity to please contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210015827. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
