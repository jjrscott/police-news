Dorset Police received a report from the fire service at 11.45pm on Wednesday 23 September 2020 that a blaze had taken hold of the former hotel in Gervis Road.

Officers attended to assist the fire service with road closures and evacuation of neighbouring properties. A cordon remains in place at the scene.

"Detectives from Bournemouth CID are continuing to working closely with Dorset & Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service to investigate the full circumstances of the incident.

"I would appeal to anyone who has any information about the fire to please contact us."
