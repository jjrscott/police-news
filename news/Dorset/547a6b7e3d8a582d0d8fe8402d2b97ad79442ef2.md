# UPDATE: Photo appeal following reported sexual assault in Wimborne

14 November 2017

* * *

A man has come forward following a photo appeal issued in connection with a reported sexual assault in Wimborne.

The victim, a local woman aged in her 40s, was out drinking with friends in Wimborne on the night of Saturday 4 November 2017 when she began talking to a man.

When they left the Rising Sun public house in the early hours of Sunday 5 November 2017 the man reportedly insisted on walking the victim back to her home address in the town, before he sexually and physically assaulted her.

A 32-year-old man from Poole has this evening, Tuesday 14 November 2017, contacted officers and is assisting them with enquiries. No arrests have been made.
