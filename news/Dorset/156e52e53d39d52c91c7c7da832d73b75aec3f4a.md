# Witness appeal following robbery in Weymouth

18 May 2016

* * *

Officers in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward after a robbery in the town.

The incident happened at around 4am on Sunday 8 May 2016 in Great George Street when the victim, a 27-year-old Weymouth man, was walking toward Gloucester Street.

When he reached the area of a tattoo parlour, he was struck to the back of the head, which caused him to fall forward on to the floor. He managed to kick at the male offender who spoke in an Eastern European language, possibly to another person nearby.

The offender then punched the victim in the chest twice. The victim gave up defending himself and handed over his wallet. The offender walked away - possibly in the direction of Iroka in Gloucester Street. The incident was reported later that day.

Police Constable Ade Walker, of Weymouth police, said: "Unfortunately, the victim was unable to give a description of the offender and this is all the information we have.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the robbery or has any information about those responsible to contact Dorset Police."

No arrests have been made.
