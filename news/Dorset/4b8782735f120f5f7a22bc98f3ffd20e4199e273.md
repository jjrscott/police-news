# Witness appeal after assault on boy in Dorchester play park

27 June 2016

* * *

Detectives in Dorchester are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a boy was assaulted in a play park.

Sometime between 5pm and 5.20pm on Saturday 25 June 2016, a nine-year-old boy was playing alone in a park in Woodland Crescent in the Poundbury area when he was approached by a man and pushed off a swing.

The offender is described as between five feet 10 inches and six feet tall and of slim build. He was wearing a black hooded top with the hood up, light blue jeans and shoes with the Nike tick. The sole was a different colour to the shoe. One of the laces was undone.

He was seen to leave the park and walk toward Sheepdown Road, into Whitecross Square and along Harewood Road.

The boy was understandably upset following the incident.

Detective Inspector Kate Lill, of Weymouth CID, said: "This was a very unusual incident and I am appealing for the public's help to identify the man responsible.

"I am keen to hear from anyone who saw a man matching the description given in the vicinity of the park at around 5pm on Saturday evening. If you have any information, please contact Dorset Police urgently.

"Officers from the Neighbourhood Policing Team will be carrying out high-visibility patrols in the area over the coming days to reassure the community."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 25:321. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
