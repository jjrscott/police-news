Officers investigating a reported dangerous driving incident near Dorchester are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

The incident is alleged to have occurred at around 2.45pm on Monday 8 April 2019 in the area of the Warmwell roundabout.

The vehicle was located a short time later near to West Stafford.

A 32-year-old Southampton man has been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and has been released under investigation.

Detective Constable Mark Walsh, of Weymouth CID, said: "We are continuing to investigate this incident and I am appealing for any motorists who may have witnessed it to contact us.

"I would also urge anyone who was driving in the area at the time and has dashcam fitted to their vehicle to check their footage for anything relevant."
