# Murder investigation in Christchurch â€“ renewed witness appeal

26 August 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating the death of a woman in Christchurch are issuing a renewed witness appeal.

At around 2.45am today, Sunday 26 August 2018, officers were called to an address in Park Gardens following a report that a 37-year-old local woman had sustained serious injuries.

Sadly she was pronounced dead at the scene. Her family have been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers. The coroner has been notified.

Detectives from Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT) are treating her death as suspicious and a murder investigation has been launched.

A 38-year-old Christchurch man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is assisting officers with their enquiries.

The address in Park Gardens was cordoned off to allow crime scene investigators to carry out examinations.

Officers are now appealing for witnesses who may have come across the woman when she was out in Southbourne the previous evening, Saturday 25 August 2018.

Detective Inspector Rich Dixey, of MCIT, said: "We are particularly keen to speak to two people who came to the aid of a woman aged in her 30s who was apparently intoxicated by the bus stop outside Lloyds Bank in Southbourne Grove between around 8pm and 10pm last night. These people may have offered to call an ambulance for the woman.

"We are also continuing to appeal for anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious in the Park Gardens area last night or early this morning to contact us if they have not already spoken to officers."

Local officers will be carrying out increased patrols in the area as the investigation continues and can be approached by members of the community with any concerns.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 26:57. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
