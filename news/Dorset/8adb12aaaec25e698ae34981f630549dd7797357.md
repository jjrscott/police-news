# Appeal following distraction burglaries in Poole

11 July 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for anyone with information to come forward following three reports of attempted distraction burglaries in Poole.

At approximately 3.30pm on Monday 10 July 2017 a woman aged in her 80s reported that two men had come to her address off Sandy Lane asking to look at the bottom of their garden as the neighbouring property was planning to have new fencing put up.

The woman refused the men access and they left the area in a white pick-up truck with two folding ladders in the back.

The first man was described as white, approximately 20 years old, of slim build with light coloured hair. He was wearing a baseball cap and brown trousers. The second man was described as tanned, aged in his 30s, of large build and with dark hair. He was wearing navy trousers and a navy top.

A second incident took place at 4pm when at least two men were seen in the garden of a property off Blandford Road in Poole. The victim, a woman aged in her 90s, approached the men who were looking to put up fencing in her garden.

The victim declined the offer and the men left the property in a large white van with a green strip down the side.

At 4.30pm on the same day a woman aged in her 80s reported that two men attended her address on Lake Road to inform her that the fence at the bottom of her garden was broken.

The woman accompanied one of the men to her garden to look at the fence.

The second man made an attempt to enter the property but was stopped by her husband who was still inside the house.

The first man was described as white, aged in his early 20s, clean shaven and of slim build. He was wearing a beige baseball cap. The second man was described as white, approximately 50 years old with a local accent.

Detective Constable Charlie Soutine, of Bournemouth CID, said: "If you have any information about these three incidents, or if you have been approached by someone matching the descriptions given, please contact Dorset Police.

"I would like to remind residents that if you are unsure who is at your door, or have any concerns about the caller's intentions, contact a family member or neighbour and inform the police."
