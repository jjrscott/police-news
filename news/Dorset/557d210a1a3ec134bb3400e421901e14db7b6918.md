# Renewed appeal to find man missing in West Bay

24 February 2018

* * *

Officers searching for a missing Sussex man believed to be in the West Bay area are renewing their appeal for the public's help to find him.

Mark Purdy, who is 64 years old, left his home in Sussex at 9am during the morning of Friday 23 February 2018. He told his family that he was going for a walk but he never returned. Later he messaged to indicate that he is in the West Bay area of Dorset and was very upset.

At around 7pm there was a possible sighting of him at The George pub.

Mark is described as white, five feet eleven inches tall and of slim build. He has thick grey hair and uses glasses. He may be wearing casual trousers or jeans, a plain jumper, a deep red fleece and black shoes.

Chief Inspector Steve White, of Dorset Police, said: "We have continued our searches for Mark throughout the night. At around 1am this morning, Saturday 24 February 2018, at The Watchouse Cafe officers found property believed to belong to him, including some clothing, spectacles, a mobile phone and wallet.

"HM Coastguard, Dorset Search and Rescue (DorSAR), the NPAS helicopter as well as Dorset Police are still searching the area today in an effort to locate Mark as we remain very concerned for his welfare.

"Anyone who may have seen Mark since yesterday should contact police urgently."

Anyone with information or knowledge as to Mark's whereabouts is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 23:434. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
