# Witness appeal following arson at nature reserve in West Dorset

19 April 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an arson incident at a nature reserve in West Dorset which destroyed an important historical hut.

At around 11am on Saturday 14 April 2018 it was reported that an old railway hut had been set alight at the Powerstock Common Nature Reserve, owned by Dorset Wildlife Trust.

It is believed the fire was started deliberately and the hut has been completely destroyed.

Police Community Support Investigator Katerina Hubackova, of Dorset Police, said: "The hut was an important historical building in the context of the history of the old railway line and this has now been lost. It was also a registered bat roost for a number of species, including the lesser horseshoe bat.

"I would appeal to anyone who was in the reserve and saw someone causing this damage or witnessed suspicious activity in the area over recent days to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 55180055365. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
