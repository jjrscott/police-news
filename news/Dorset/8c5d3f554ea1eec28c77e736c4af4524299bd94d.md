# Witness appeal after fatal collision in Weymouth

19 December 2016

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses following a fatal road traffic collision in Weymouth.

The incident happened at 6.38am this morning, Monday 19 December 2016, on Abbotsbury Road near to the junction with Franklin Road.

A white Mercedes van being driven by a 56-year-old Weymouth man was in collision with a road sign.

He was treated by officers and paramedics and taken to Dorset County Hospital, but was sadly pronounced dead a short time later.

The road was closed at the junctions of Chickerell Road and Newstead Road to allow investigators to examine the scene and to allow the vehicle to be recovered. The road has since reopened.

Police Inspector Joe Pardey, of the Dorset Police's Road Policing Team, said: "Early indications are that the driver may have suffered a medical episode at the wheel.

"I am appealing for any witnesses who saw the collision or the manner of driving of this vehicle prior to the incident to contact police."¬ù

The next of kin have been informed and the coroner has been notified.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 19:47. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
