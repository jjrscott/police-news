# Family tribute to man killed in fatal collision near Wimborne

28 August 2020

* * *

The family of a man who sadly died in a fatal road traffic collision near Wimborne has paid tribute to an 'incredible loving person and a fantastic father'.

At 8pm on Tuesday 18 August 2020 Dorset Police was called to a report of a two vehicle collision on Blandford Road near to Kingston Lacy involving a white BMW 114i and a white Skoda Fabia.

Emergency services attended the scene and the driver of the BMW - a woman aged in her 50s from Warminster in Wiltshire - was very sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

The driver of the Skoda - 40-year-old Daniel Williams from St Leonards - was also very sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

The family of Daniel Williams has issued the following tribute to their loved one:

"Daniel will be sadly missed by all of his family and friends. Daniel was the most incredible loving person and a fantastic father to his young children who he loved dearly.

"Daniel was a loving man with a kind heart and the funniest sense of humour, he was always happy with an infectious smile. He did all he could to make others happy and would always put himself out to help others and nothing was too much trouble.

"Daniel has left a huge hole in everyone's lives and will be sorely missed."

Sergeant Nikki Burt, of the traffic unit, added: "Our thoughts are with the families of both of those who very sadly died in this collision and they are being supported by officers.

"We are continuing to investigate the circumstances of the collision and I would urge any witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage who has not yet spoken to police to please contact us."
