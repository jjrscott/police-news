# Witness appeal following public order incident in Poole

21 November 2018

* * *

Officers investigating a public order incident in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 9.20pm on Thursday 15 November 2018 a woman was walking along Poole High Street with her four-year-old daughter in the direction of Poole Quay when she noticed a man standing in an alleyway near to The Salvation Army charity shop.

The man was verbally abusive toward the woman so she ran away and he followed her a short distance toward the traffic lights at Old Orchard.

The woman went into Sainsbury's at Orchard Plaza to seek assistance and did not see the man again.

He is described as white, aged in his 40s, around six feet tall, of slim build and clean shaven with black shoulder-length hair. He was wearing black round-framed glasses, a navy blue coat and slim-fit jeans and was carrying a blue bag.

Police Constable Riona Hanley, of Poole police, said: "This must have been a distressing incident for the woman, particularly as she was with her four-year-old child, and we are carrying out a number of enquiries to identify the man involved.

"I am appealing for anyone who witnessed this incident, or who saw a man matching the description given in the area at the relevant time, to contact us.

"I would also urge the man involved to come forward so he can assist with our investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180184921. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
