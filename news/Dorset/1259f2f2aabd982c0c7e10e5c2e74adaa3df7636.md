# Serious road traffic collision in Poole â€“ witness appeal

01 March 2021

* * *

Officers investigating a serious road traffic collision in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The incident happened on Commercial Road at 6.03pm on Sunday 28 February 2021.

A black Yamaha motorcycle with a pillion passenger was travelling from the Civic Centre toward Bournemouth when it was in collision with a pedestrian who was crossing the road.

Police, together with the ambulance service, attended and the road was closed while a detailed examination of the scene was conducted by specialist officers.

The pedestrian, a local man in his 70s, was flown to Southampton General Hospital with life-threatening injuries. The 26-year-old male motorcycle rider from Bournemouth and the 31-year-old female pillion passenger from Poole were taken to Poole Hospital with serious injuries.

Sergeant Lee Savage, of the traffic unit, said: "We are carrying out enquiries to establish the full circumstances of this collision.

"I would ask for any witnesses to the collision itself, or anyone who saw the motorcycle or pedestrian immediately before, to come forward.

"Also, I would urge anyone who has dashcam fitted to their vehicle to please view it to see if they have captured the collision or the moments before.

"Finally, I would like to thank motorists for their patience during the road closure, which was necessary to enable emergency services to attend the scene in a safe manner."
