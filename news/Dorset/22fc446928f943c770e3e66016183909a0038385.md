* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with an alleged burglary in Dorchester.

Dorset Police received a report of a burglary at an address in Prospect Road sometime between midnight and 2.40am on Sunday 3 December 2017.

It was reported that three coats and a shoulder bag were stolen. The items were found nearby but a credit card and small amount of cash was not recovered.

The card was allegedly used at a takeaway restaurant at 2.40am the same day. Two further transactions on the card were reportedly carried out at Dorchester train station later on Sunday 3 December 2017.

An 18-year-old Weymouth man has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Friday 23 February 2018 for three offences of fraud by false representation and one charge of theft.

A 19-year-old Weymouth woman was arrested on suspicion of burglary and has been released without charge.
