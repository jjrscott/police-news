# CCTV appeal following indecent exposure incident in Wimborne

14 January 2021

* * *

Officers investigating an indecent exposure incident in Wimborne are issuing an image of a man they would like to speak to.

At around 3.15pm on Saturday 12 December 2020 the victim - a 16-year-old girl - was walking along West Street when a man approached her to ask for directions. The victim did not know the answer, so she got her phone out to find out.

As she was looking for the directions on her phone, it is reported that the man pulled his jogging bottoms down and indecently exposed himself to the victim.

Police Constable Ryan Higgins, of East Dorset police, said: "This was an extremely frightening incident for the victim and I am carrying out a number of enquiries to identify the offender.

"I have obtained a CCTV image of a man I would like to speak to and would ask anyone who recognises him to please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200187674. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
