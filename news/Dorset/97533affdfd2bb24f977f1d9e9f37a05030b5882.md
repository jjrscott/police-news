* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses after a woman was approached by an unknown man in Bournemouth.

At around 1am today, Tuesday 7 March 2017, a 19-year-old Bournemouth woman was walking alone along Lansdowne Road when she was grabbed from behind around the upper body by a man.

The man is described as being of Asian descent, possibly Indian, aged in his late 20s, of medium build and approximately five feet seven inches tall. He had a partially grown moustache and was wearing a light-grey hooded top.

The victim screamed causing the offender to run off in the direction of Asda on St Pauls Road.

Detective Sergeant Karen Penn, of Bournemouth CID, said: "The woman received an injured back which did not require treatment.

"It is unclear what the motives were behind this incident.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or has any information that may help me with my investigation to please contact police."
