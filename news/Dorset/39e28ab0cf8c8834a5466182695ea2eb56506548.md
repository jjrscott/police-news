# Witness appeal after road rage incident in West Moors

10 November 2016

* * *

Police are appealing for witnesses after a cyclist was threatened with a knife during a road rage incident in West Moors.

The incident happened at around 3.55pm on Tuesday 8 November 2016 along Pinehurst Road.

The victim - a local man aged in his 20s - was cycling along when two men in a new five-door Peugeot or similar looking vehicle made verbal threats toward him.

He ignored the threats and continued along Station Road. The car then stopped at Glenwood Road and the driver got out and again made threats toward the victim, who carried on cycling.

As the victim reached St Mary's School, a second vehicle - a new looking BMW or Audi five-door saloon - pulled up next to him and two teenagers got out and began shouting abuse at the cyclist. One pulled out a stanley knife and held it toward the victim's face and made threats to assault him. The other teenager kicked the victim's back wheel.

The victim managed to continue cycling along Station Road and out of sight of the offenders. He was not physically injured in the incident.

Police Constable Faris Siwadi, of Ferndown police, said: "The victim was left shaken by the incident. It happened at a busy time of the day and I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed what happened to contact police."
