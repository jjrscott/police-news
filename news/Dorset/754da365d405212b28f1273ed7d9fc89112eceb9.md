Detectives are appealing for information from the public after a man was found with a head injury in Lyme Regis.

Shortly before 9am yesterday, Thursday 15 February 2018, Dorset Police received a report that a man had presented at Lyme Bay Medical Practice in Silver Street with a head injury.

The man, aged in his 40s and of no fixed abode, was taken to Dorset County Hospital for treatment. His injury is not believed to be life-changing or life-threatening.

Further enquiries established that the man had been found by a member of the public in a driveway near to the medical centre.

The man was able to give an initial account that he had been drinking at the local Royal Standard pub in Marine Parade the previous night and claimed he may have been assaulted by two other men.

The injured man was wearing a blue anorak with beige lining, navy blue jumper, blue jeans, boots and a blue backpack.

Detective Sergeant Rhys Griffiths, of Weymouth CID, said: “We are still trying to establish exactly how the man came to sustain the injury and I am appealing for anyone with information to contact police.

“I would be keen to hear from anyone who saw a man matching the description given around the area of the Royal Standard pub on Wednesday evening or in the area of the Lyme Bay Medical Practice yesterday morning.”

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk, or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180024239. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
