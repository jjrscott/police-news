# Witness appeal following a number of assaults in Sherborne

01 July 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating a number of assaults in Sherborne that are likely to be linked are asking witnesses and anyone with information to come forward.

The first incident occurred at about 12.50am on Sunday 1 July 2018 in the White Hart pub on Cheap Street. It was reported that an argument ensued between two women, which resulted in a man hitting one of the women in the face with a snooker cue.

At approximately ten minutes later an assault took place on one man by a group of people in Higher Cheap Street.

The third incident happened at around 1.17am in an address in Bristol Road. Officers received a report that a group of people had forced entry through the front door and assaulted two men, one of them believed to be the victim in the second incident.

The two men were taken to hospital with severe facial injuries.

Detective Sergeant Rhys Griffiths, of Western CID, said: "We believe that all three incidents are linked.

"They left one woman with a black eye and two men with serious facial injuries.

"We need to establish what exactly happened during all three incidents and therefore I am appealing for any witnesses, who have not yet spoken with us, to come forward and tell us what they saw.

"I am also very keen to hear from anyone who has any knowledge about the group involved in the second and third incident."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180101901. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
