# Public appeal in search for missing man from Swanage

04 March 2018

* * *

Officers searching for a missing Swanage man are appealing for help from the public to find him.

Gerald Turner, aged 67, was last seen at his home address in Church Hill at around 3am today, Sunday 4 March 2018. He was reported missing at around 11.30am and searches are being carried out in the Swanage area to locate him.

Gerald is described as around five feet seven inches tall and of slim build with short, thick, dark hair and a greying goatie beard and moustache. It is believed he was wearing a black waterproof jacket, blue cotton tracksuit type trousers and green wellies.

Chief Inspector Jim Beashel, of Dorset Police, said: “Gerald is known to become confused easily and it is believed he has been upset recently so we are becoming increasingly concerned for his welfare.

“We are carrying out extensive searches in the Swanage area, with support from the coastguard and DorSAR (Dorset Search and Rescue).

“I would ask anyone who has any information as to Gerald’s whereabouts or who sees a man matching his description to contact police immediately.

“I would also urge Gerald if he sees this appeal to contact us or your family as we all want to ensure you are safe and well.”

Anyone with information or knowledge as to Gerald's whereabouts is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 4:179.
