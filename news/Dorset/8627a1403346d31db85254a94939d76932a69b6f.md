# Appeal for information following reports of suspicious behaviour in Dorchester

01 April 2021

* * *

Officers investigating reports of suspicious behaviour involving a man in Dorchester are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

It was first reported on Monday 15 March 2021 that a man had been approaching female staff members from Dorset County Hospital outside the hospital in the area of Bridport Road between the hours of around 12pm and 2.30pm and making inappropriate comments.

At least five members of staff have reportedly been approached. There were no reports of any threats made or any attempted physical contact.

The man is described as white, aged in his 30s and of medium build with short brown hair that is described as receding and wispy. He is reported to have been wearing jeans, a white vest, green padded gilet and wellington boots and on another occasion was said to be wearing a dark-coloured jacket that was possibly leather.

Police Constable Natalie Skinner, of Dorchester police, said: "These staff members have been made to feel very uncomfortable as they have gone to and from their place of work and it is completely unacceptable for any women to be made to feel this way.

"We have been carrying out targeted patrols around the hospital over the relevant times of the day. We are determined to identify this individual and ensure this behaviour does not continue.

"I would urge anyone with information about the man involved to please contact us.

"Anyone with concerns for their safety can contact the local neighbourhood policing team or approach officers as they carry out their patrols in the area."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210041518. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
