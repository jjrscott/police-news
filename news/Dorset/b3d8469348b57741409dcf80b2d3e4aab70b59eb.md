# Scam prevention advice and warning to Dorset residents

12 March 2020

* * *

Officers are urging residents to remain vigilant following three phone scams across Dorset.

At 1.28pm on Wednesday 11 March 2020 Dorset Police received a report from a Poole woman, aged in her 80s, that she was called by someone who claimed to be a police officer in Croydon. They advised the victim that her bank card had been used fraudulently to purchase a washing machine.

The victim did not provide her bank details and terminated the phone call.

A similar call was made earlier on the same day at around 9.30am to a man aged in his 70s in the North Dorset area. It is reported that the caller said he was from London police and asked the victim to confirm his address, before the line disconnected.

A third report was received at 2.36pm of a call to a woman in Weymouth aged in her 70s from someone purporting to be from the fraud squad. They told the victim that she needed to transfer her money to a safe account.

Fraud Investigator Shane Cherrett, of Dorset Police, said: "Thankfully, no bank details were passed in any of the three incidents and the victims were given advice and support.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have been targeted in a similar way recently to please get in touch.

"Our advice is very simple. Always be aware and take steps to verify the identity of a caller who is asking for money. A genuine caller will not mind waiting or calling back to allow you to do this.

"The police will never ask for personal information over the phone and neither will your bank.

"If you are concerned about the validity of something - stop and speak to someone for help and advice.

"Anyone with concerns can contact Action Fraud or Dorset Police."
