# Witness appeal after assault incident in Bournemouth

13 May 2019

* * *

Officers investigating an assault incident in Bournemouth are appealing for any witnesses to come forward.

At around 6.15pm on Saturday 4 May 2019 a local 14-year-old girl was standing on a wall in Mallard Close looking into the woods toward Strouden Park when she reports she was grabbed around the waist and pulled back by an unknown man. He did not say anything or make any further attempt to touch her.

The girl did not sustain any physical injuries.

The suspect is described as white, approximately six feet tall, of skinny build, with black and grey stubble and aged in his late 30s or early 40s. He had bony large hands with chipped, dirty nails and wore a black hooded top with the hood up. He smelt of alcohol.

Police Constable Phil Stevens, of North Bournemouth police, said: "We have now been able to speak to the girl, who was left very upset following the incident. A full investigation is underway and I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the relevant time and saw a man matching the description given to please contact Dorset Police.

"Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team are aware of this incident and can be approached with any community concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190067378. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
