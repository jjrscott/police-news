# Witness appeal after distraction burglary in Christchurch

13 December 2016

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses after burglars targeted a vulnerable elderly woman in Christchurch.

The incident happened around mid-afternoon on Friday 9 December 2016 at a property in The Grove.

The victim answered her front door to two men who told her they were from the council and had come to check a tree in her rear garden.

One of the men went round the back of her property, when a neighbour saw the suspicious activity and challenged the man. He told the neighbour he was from Bournemouth Council, but when the neighbour said they were in Christchurch the offender said he had made a mistake. He returned to a white van and the two men drove off.

On returning inside the house, the victim noticed her purse was missing along with a large quantity of cash.

One of the offenders is described as white, aged in his late 20s, tall and of big build.

Detective Constable Christian Bryant, of Dorset Police, said: "This was a horrible crime on an elderly woman and I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed suspicious activity in the area at the time to come forward.

"Victims of bogus callers or distraction burglaries are usually elderly and live by themselves and I'd urge everyone to help reduce the chance that the people you care about and your elderly neighbours are subject to this type of crime.

"I would like to praise the actions of the neighbour in this instance for challenging the suspicious activity.

"Do not buy, sell or sign up to any work on the doorstep no matter how urgent they say the work is. If you are suspicious of the caller's intentions, tell them to go away and call a family member or neighbour and inform the police. If they won't leave, then call 999."

Members of the public should consider the following advice when answering the door:

LOCKED - Is the back door locked?
STOP - Am I expecting anyone?
CHAIN - Put the chain on BEFORE opening the door.
CHECK - Ask for the caller's identification. Shut the door leaving the caller on the doorstep and phone the number in the phone book NOT the one on the card they give you, as this could be an accomplice around the corner - especially if it is a mobile number. A genuine caller will be happy to wait while you do this.
