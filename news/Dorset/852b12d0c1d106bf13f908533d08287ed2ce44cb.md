Detectives are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following an assault in Poole.

The incident happened at around 1.10am on Sunday 28 October 2018 on Old Orchard.

The victim - a 29-year-old local man - was walking with friends when he was approached by two unknown men who began shouting at him before assaulting him.

During the incident, part of the victim's ear was bitten off. He was taken to hospital for treatment.

"If you have any information about the incident or are able to identify either of the men described, please contact Dorset Police urgently."
