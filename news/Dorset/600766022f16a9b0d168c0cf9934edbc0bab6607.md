# Aggravated burglary in Bournemouth â€“ public appeal

11 January 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating an aggravated burglary in Bournemouth are appealing for the public's help for information.

At around 9.09pm on Tuesday 9 January 2018 three men wearing masks and carrying knives forced their way into an address in Stone Gardens in the Townsend area.

They threatened the occupant, a man aged in his 20s, and assaulted him before taking his wallet. A second occupant - a man aged in his 50s - was placed in a headlock by one of the offenders. Both men sustained minor injuries.

The offenders are described as being white, aged in their late 20s, of slim build and wore scarves to conceal their faces, baseball caps, hooded tops and jackets. They spoke with Liverpudlian accents.

Detective Constable Rebecca Joyce, of Bournemouth CID, said: "An investigation is underway to locate the three offenders and I would ask anyone who knows who is responsible for this offence or saw any suspicious activity in the area at the relevant time to please contact Dorset Police.

"I understand this case follows reports of three other aggravated burglaries in the Bournemouth area. At this stage we do not believe any of the incidents are linked however, initial enquiries suggest these were not random attacks.

"I would like to reassure the public that in each case a detailed investigation is underway and we are making extensive enquiries to identify the offenders."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk, or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180004507. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
