# Arrest following alleged assault in Wimborne

26 January 2017

* * *

Detectives have arrested a local 15-year-old boy following a reported assault in Wimborne.

The incident happened sometime between 11.30pm and midnight on Saturday 21 January 2017 after the victim - a local man aged in his 40s - had left the Cricketers Arms on Park Lane. He walked on his own toward Crown Mead when he was approached by a group of men aged in their late teens near to the steps for Wimborne Library.

It was reported that one of the group pushed the victim from behind and kicked him in the chest, causing him to fall over and hit his head on the ground.

The victim began to feel unwell on Sunday evening, 22 January, and attended hospital where he was found to have a fractured skull and bleed on the brain. His injuries are not believed to be life-threatening. The incident was reported to the police on Monday 23 January.

The boy was arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm without intent and is helping officers with their enquiries.
