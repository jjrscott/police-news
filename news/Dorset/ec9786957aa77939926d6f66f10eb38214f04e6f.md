# Update - Photo appeal following altercation between cyclist and driver

16 January 2018

* * *

Officers investigating an altercation between a cyclist and car driver in Poole say they have identified the woman involved.

The reported incident occurred at approximately 8.50am on Thursday 7 December 2017 in Bournemouth Road when the driver of a black Honda CRV - a local woman aged in her 40s - challenged a cyclist who she believed was about to go through a red traffic light.

It is reported the suspect, who was also a woman, verbally abused the woman, kicked and punched the car, attempted to rip the wing mirror off and then opened the passenger door and slammed it shut.

After the lights turned green the victim drove away and pulled over to examine her car. It is alleged the suspect approached the victim and again became abusive, produced a small pointed item from a compartment on the bike and threatened to stab the woman. She also reportedly rammed her bike into the victim.

Following a photo appeal, a woman came forward to assist officers with the investigation. As a result of an investigation the decision has been made that no charges will be brought and no further police action will be taken.
