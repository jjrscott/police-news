# Operation to target rural crime in West Dorset

24 June 2019

* * *

Special constables carried out an operation over the weekend to target rural acquisitive crime in West Dorset.

Between 7pm on Saturday 22 June and 4am on Sunday 23 June 2019 special constables carried out high-visibility patrols based on intelligence from the community to disrupt and target rural crime offenders.

During the operation, over 200 people and vehicle checks were carried out across the area. A traffic offence report was issued for no insurance to a female driver in Dorchester.

While on duty, the special constables also carried out arrest enquiries and searched for a vehicle that had earlier failed to stop for officers.

Special Inspector Ben Muspratt, of Dorset Police, said: "This high-visibility operation demonstrates that we are committed to tackling these types of offences.

"We want to send out a clear message to potential criminals that we will continue to patrol these areas in order to prevent rural crime."

Special constables are volunteer police officers with the same powers as a paid officer. To find out about becoming a special constable, visit https://www.dorset.police.uk/recruitment/special-constabulary/
