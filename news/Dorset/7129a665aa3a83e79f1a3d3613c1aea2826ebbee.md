# Appeal for information following collision in Poole

30 September 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a road traffic collision in Poole are appealing for the driver involved and anyone else with information to come forward.

It was reported that at around 4.35pm on Tuesday 8 September 2020 a collision occurred on Mannings Heath Road involving a cyclist and a white transit van.

The cyclist, a man aged in his 40s, was knocked off his bicycle and required hospital treatment for an injury to his leg.

The driver of the van stopped and asked if the cyclist was all right, but the injured man did not obtain their details at the scene.

The driver is described as white, aged in his 30s to 40s, around five feet eight inches tall and of medium build with a bald head. He was wearing a white T-shirt and tracksuit bottoms and is believed to have spoken in an Eastern European accent.

Police Constable Riona Hanley, of Poole police, said: "The cyclist involved in this collision suffered a nasty leg injury that has resulted in him having to spend a significant period off work.

"We have carried out a number of enquiries, but have so far been unable to identify the van or driver involved.

"I would ask anyone with information that might assist our investigation to contact us, especially anyone who was in the area and may have relevant dashcam footage. While I appreciate the van driver did stop at the scene, we do not have his details so I would like to appeal directly to him to please contact us so we can take your account."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200136413. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
