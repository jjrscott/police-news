# Witness appeal following two burglaries in Bournemouth

30 August 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating two burglaries in Bournemouth that may be linked are asking for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward.

Between 10pm and 11pm on Wednesday 29 August 2018 a woman was found inside two different flats on Seabourne Road in the Southbourne area of the town.

On both occasions she was found by the residents of the flat, challenged and then left the address. Nothing was stolen and no injuries were caused.

The woman is described as black, of slim build, in her late 20s or early 30s with long braided or dreadlocked hair.

Detective Sergeant Ian Allen, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We don't know the identity of the woman and it is not clear what her motive was.

"We are currently investigating both incidents and would urge residents to ensure that their doors and windows are locked, wherever possible, and that any suspicious behaviour is reported.

"I am appealing for anyone who saw a woman matching the description or anyone acting suspiciously in the Seabourne Road area last night to contact police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 29:566. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
