# Witness appeal following reported robbery in Boscombe

24 December 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a reported robbery in Boscombe.

At 7.49am today, Monday 24 December 2018, officers were called to reports of a man armed with a knife in Sea Road. It is alleged that demands were made for money. Enquiries are underway to establish if any money was handed over.

A local man aged in his 30s sustained a puncture wound to his collar bone and was taken to hospital for treatment. He has since been discharged from hospital.

Armed officers, supported by colleagues, attended the incident and carried out a search of the area.

A 35-year-old man of no fixed abode has been arrested on suspicion of robbery and is assisting officers with their enquiries.

A small knife was recovered from the scene.

Detective Sergeant Mark Richardson, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We are carrying out a thorough investigation into this incident. We believe that a second man may have been involved and I would urge anyone who witnessed the incident or saw someone acting suspiciously in the area of Sea Road this morning to please contact Dorset Police.

"Part of our enquiries will be to establish whether the injured man and arrested man are known to each other."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 24:72. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
