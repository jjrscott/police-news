# Proposed merger - release of full business case and appendices

26 November 2018

* * *

**A number of documents are being published on the Future Policing website in accordance with the publication strategy for the proposed merger of Devon & Cornwall Police and Dorset Police.**

These include:

• Full business case with five separate sections:
• Strategic case with the operational thread
• Economic case
• Commercial case
• Financial case
• Management case
• Appendices for all of the above cases
• Full survey report from Enventure, the company that devised and managed the survey

The documents can be found on the Future Policing website, along with the summary of the full business case and the engagement report which were published in September.

Chief Constable James Vaughan, Dorset Police, Deputy Chief Constable Paul Netherton, Devon & Cornwall Police, Alison Hernandez, Police and Crime Commissioner for Devon, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly and Martyn Underhill, Police and Crime Commissioner for Dorset, discussed the business case on Tuesday 25 September 2018 during a productive Alliance Convergence Board meeting.

All four individuals agreed the business case, but did not reach a unanimous decision about whether to submit it to the Home Office.

The business case was therefore not submitted and the proposed merger will not go ahead.

The documents are now available to the public as it was agreed that they would be published for transparency as part of the publication strategy regardless of whether the merger went ahead or not.
