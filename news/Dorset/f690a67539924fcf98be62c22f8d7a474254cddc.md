# Car damage investigation – appeal to motorists

19 July 2017

* * *

Officers investigating how a car sustained damage from an unknown substance are appealing for any other affected motorists to come forward.

Sometime between 2pm and 3.15pm on Thursday 29 June 2017 a woman drove her silver Jaguar along Gravel Hill near Wimborne toward Burger King when she noticed liquid coming out of the back of a white van.

The victim - a local woman aged in her 40s - took her car to be washed but the liquid remained. She subsequently visited the garage who informed her the damage was permanent and appeared to be a corrosive.

The incident was reported to Dorset Police on Thursday 6 July 2017.

Police Constable Warren Cummings, of Poole police, said: "The victim has been told it is going to cost around £6,000 to have her car repainted.

"As part of my investigation I am keen to hear from any other motorists who were travelling in the Gravel Hill, Wimborne and Poole area on the relevant day and discovered damage on the paintwork of their vehicle.

"I am carrying out other enquiries including CCTV to identify the van involved.

"I would ask that anyone who has noticed damage on the paintwork of their vehicle or knows the details of the van involved to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170102711. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
