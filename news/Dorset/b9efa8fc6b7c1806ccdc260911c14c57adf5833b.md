* * *

Detectives investigating a reported theft and a robbery in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

The first incident happened at around 7.45pm on Friday 15 June 2018 when it is alleged that a 16-year-old boy was approached near to Bournemouth Pier by a group of teenage boys and assaulted before having his wallet taken. The boy suffered a black eye.

A second incident was reported to have occurred a short time later at around 8.30pm on the beach near to the pier. It is alleged a 14-year-old boy was approached by a group of teenage boys and had a portable speaker taken. No threats were made on this occasion.

Detectives investigating both reports believe the incidents to be linked.

A 14-year-old boy from Bournemouth was arrested on suspicion of theft and robbery and has been released under investigation.

Detective Constable Dave Pearce, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the relevant times and witnessed anything that could assist with my investigation to please contact Dorset Police."
