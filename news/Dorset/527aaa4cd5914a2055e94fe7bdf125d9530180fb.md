# Television appeal following theft of sheep in North Dorset

13 June 2018

* * *

An appeal for information regarding the theft of a large number of sheep in North Dorset has featured on national television.

Around 50 sheep were taken from a farm near Blandford, one of four similar incidents in the county during recent weeks.

Officers are continuing to investigate the theft and an appeal for witnesses has featured on the BBC Crimewatch Roadshow today, Wednesday 13 June 2018.

At around 7am on Wednesday 18 April 2018 it was discovered that the sheep had been taken from a field in the area of Hayward's Lane near Child Okeford overnight.

There were a total of 150 sheep in the field and the 50 ewes that were taken were all heavily pregnant. The sheep were tagged and the breeds involved were white-faced Lleyn and black-faced North of England mule.

A further incident between 12noon on Saturday 21 April and 1.15pm on Sunday 22 April 2018 saw 32 ewes and 62 lambs stolen from a field in the area of Mill Lane near Wimborne.

It was also reported that on the night of Saturday 26 May 2018 17 ewes were stolen from a field in the area between Crossways, Owermoigne and Moreton and between 6pm on Sunday 3 June 2018 and 8.30am the following day approximately 25 ewes and 45 lambs were removed from a field off Maiden Castle Road near Dorchester.

Police Constable Rob Hammond, of North Dorset police, said: "These incidents have understandably caused concern among the rural community in Dorset and I hope that this television appeal will prompt anyone with information that can assist our investigations to come forward.

"Dorset Police's Rural Crime Team has continued to provide crime prevention advice and reassurance to local farmers and more information can be found at www.dorset.police.uk/help-advice-crime-prevention/rural-crime/.

"We would urge all members of the rural community to be aware of unusual vehicle movements in areas where livestock are present, particularly at night, and report any suspicious activity to police immediately."
