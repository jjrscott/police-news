# Two charged following reported Dolphin Shopping Centre assault

03 January 2017

* * *

A man and woman have been charged following a reported assault in Poole.

The incident happened at around 5.05pm on Sunday 18 December 2016 at the Dolphin Shopping Centre.

It is alleged that an altercation took place between a man and a woman and members of security staff at the shopping centre where a man made verbal threats toward one of the staff members before repeatedly punching them in the face.

The woman also reportedly scratched the victim's neck before the incident carried on outside, where the woman kicked the staff member who had fallen on the ground and attempted to punch a second member of staff.

One member of security staff suffered cuts and bruises and was treated at the scene by paramedics. A second one did not require medical treatment.

A 41-year-old man and 40-year-old-woman - both from Poole - have been charged with assault by beating and are due to appear before Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 10 February 2017.
