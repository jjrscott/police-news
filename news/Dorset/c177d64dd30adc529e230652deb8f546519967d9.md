# Recovered items â€“ public appeal to find owners

15 September 2016

* * *

Police in Poole are appealing for the public's help to find the owners of a number of items that have been recovered in the town - with photos being released.

The items were found inside a vehicle and a property on Friday 2 September 2016 as part of an ongoing investigation.

They include various hand tools, silverware, jewellery and a number of unique items.

Among the goods are an antique clock, a Honda GX 160 motor with a 'skidz' sticker on it, 18 gaming headsets with a yellow shop label on each box and an antique Dorset County Fire Service helmet.

Police Constable John Upsher, of Poole police, said: "We suspect these recovered items may have been stolen from private and business addresses and vehicles and I am keen to reunite them with their owners.

"I am releasing images of some of these items and I would urge anyone who recognises them or has had similar items stolen in recent months to please contact Dorset Police."

A 44-year-old Poole man has been arrested on suspicion of burglary and theft offences and has been released on police bail pending further enquiries until the middle of October 2016.
