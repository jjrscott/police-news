Two men are due to appear at court in connection with a fatal collision in Poole.

Police were called at 11.07pm on Friday 18 January 2019 to reports of a collision involving a pedestrian and a car on Poole Road in Branksome.

The 71-year-old female pedestrian - named by her family as Jackie Bradnick - was taken to Poole Hospital but sadly died from her injuries.

A 70-year-old Bournemouth man has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 30 August 2019 for an offence of causing death by careless driving.

A 51-year-old Poole man has also been issued with a postal requisition to appear at the same court on the same date for an offence of driving without due care and attention.
