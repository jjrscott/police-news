# Assault on teenage boy in Poole â€“ witness appeal

21 September 2020

* * *

Officers investigating an assault on a teenage boy in Poole are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At around 4pm on Sunday 13 September 2020 the victim - a local 14-year-old boy - was sitting on an area of grass off the A350 Holes Bay Road opposite TUF Fitness Gym with a friend when a man approached them.

The offender made an inappropriate sexual comment to the boy and his friend before he walked away. Around 20 minutes later the offender returned and started to follow the pair before he stopped and punched the victim in his left eye. The force of the assault caused the victim to fall to the ground. The offender further pushed the victim and then forced his thumb into the victim's eye.

The victim went to hospital for a check-up and sustained bruising and swelling.

The offender is described as white, aged in his 20s, of average build, with short dark hair and was wearing blue jeans and a navy blue Puffer-style jacket.

Police Constable Stuart Wilson, of Poole police, said: "This was an unprovoked assault on a teenage boy and I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident to please contact Dorset Police.

"The incident happened on a very busy road and I would ask motorists who were travelling along that stretch of road at the relevant time to please check their dashcams to see if they have captured the incident on camera."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200137946. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
