# Witness appeal following thefts in Ferndown

30 January 2020

* * *

Officers investigating the thefts of catalytic converters from the Ferndown area are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

It is reported that some time between 11am and 4pm on Wednesday 15 January 2020 a car was parked in the upper level of the Tesco car park in Pennys Walk. When the driver returned to his car, it would not start. After the vehicle was recovered it was found that the catalytic converter had been removed.

On the same day, between 9am and 7pm, a catalytic converter was also stolen from a 4x4 vehicle on Elm Tree Walk.

A further incident occurred between 8.50am and 5.10pm on Tuesday 28 January 2020 at the Hobbycraft and Haskins Garden Centre car park. Two men were seen to pull up in a black Vauxhall Astra, get out and jack the victim's car up in order to remove the catalytic converter. Both men are described as wearing black clothes and hats.

Inspector Simon Perry, of East Dorset police, said: "We are following a number of lines of enquiry into these incidents.

"Anyone who has witnessed any suspicious activity in the area, or who may have CCTV that may have captured the incidents, is urged to please get in touch.

"Additionally, we would always encourage owners to take measures to help prevent this kind of theft. It is best to park on a drive and in a well-lit area if possible. There are also catalytic converter cages that can be purchased to make them more difficult to steal.

"Sport Utility Vehicles and 4x4-style vehicles can often be targeted due to their height, making it easier for offenders to climb underneath."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200014246. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
