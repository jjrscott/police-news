# Appeal for witnesses after distraction burglary in Dorchester

09 August 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for information following a distraction burglary in Dorchester.

The victim, aged in her 80s, was at home at her address in The Grove when she was visited by a woman, who she assumed was the relief warden, at around 12.15pm on Thursday 3 August 2017.

The woman walked past the victim into the front room and she later discovered £45 had been taken from her purse. The offender left the property when the victim's carer arrived.

The same woman had visited the victim around a month earlier and distracted her by saying there was a smell in her kitchen and asked her to check it. On that occasion the victim found £40 had been taken from her purse.

The woman is described as white, aged in her 50s or 60s, around five feet seven inches tall with scruffy blonde hair. One of her arms was in pink plaster.

Police Constable Gill Cregg, of Dorchester police, said: "Officers have been making various enquiries into these offences as well as offering advice and reassurance to the victim.

"I would urge any witnesses or anyone with information to please contact me.

"I would also like to remind residents that if they have any concerns about the intentions of a visitor to their property to ask for identification as they should have no concerns about showing it if they are genuine.

"Never let anyone you do not know into your property if you have any concerns and contact a family member or neighbour and inform the police."
