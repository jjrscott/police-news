* * *

Detectives investigating an alleged robbery in Bournemouth town centre are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police received a report that at around 12.30pm today, Friday 7 September, a man aged in his 80s had his wallet stolen when he was by the bus stop in Gervis Place opposite Natwest bank.

It was reported that the man confronted the suspected offender, who pushed him causing him to fall over and then made off. The victim sustained a head injury, which is not believed to be life-changing or life-threatening.

The suspected offender was detained nearby by members of the public who had witnessed the incident.

A 39-year-old Bournemouth man has been arrested on suspicion of robbery and is assisting officers with their enquiries.

Detective Sergeant Ian Allen, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I understand there were a number of people in the area at the time and I am appealing for any witnesses who have not already spoken to police to contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 7:233. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
