Two giant tortoises reported stolen from Kingston Maurward College have been located.

An appeal was issued after a total of four Sulcata tortoises were stolen from the college overnight between Wednesday 22 August and Thursday 23 August 2018.

Officers can now confirm that two of the tortoises - Blastoise and Jeffery - have been located in Lytchett Matravers.
