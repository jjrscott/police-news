# Racially aggravated incident in Bournemouth â€“ appeal to locate suspect

15 August 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a racially aggravated public order incident in Bournemouth are appealing for help from the public to locate the suspect.

At 9.31pm on Tuesday 23 July 2019 a woman aged in her 40s and from Christchurch was walking along Stourwood Avenue toward the zig zag, opposite the Skyglass & Kettle pub, with her friend when a Labrador dog grabbed her dog around the neck.

The woman told its owner that it should be on a lead.

The suspect verbally abused the victim and threatened to throw a tennis ball at her. She managed to avoid the ball. He then hurled racial abuse at her friend - a British Asian woman aged in her 40s and from Bournemouth.

The suspect is described as white with tanned weathered skin, aged in his mid-50s, five feet 11 inches tall, with short hair and spoke with a strong Liverpool accent. He wore a green T-shirt, shorts and his black Labrador had a red collar. He was with an Asian woman.

Police Constable Rebecca Walker-Date, of Bournemouth police, said: "It has only recently been possible for officers to speak to both women about what happened.

"This was a very unpleasant and unprovoked incident, which left them both very upset. I am appealing to anyone who recognises the man from the description given to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190113917. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
