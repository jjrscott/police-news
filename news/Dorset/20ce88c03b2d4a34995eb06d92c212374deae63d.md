# Witness appeal following report of man with knife in Poole

17 October 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following a report of a man with a knife in Poole.

At approximately 1.05pm on Thursday 17 October 2019 a police car was flagged down by a female member of the public in a car who reported that she had just seen a man holding a knife on Ashley Road.

The man was described as wearing blue trousers with a scarf wrapped around his face.

The woman drove off in the direction of Sea View Road before officers were able to take further details.

Chief Inspector Steve May, of Dorset Police, said: "While this is the only report we have received of this nature, we have been carrying out a number of searches in the local area to try and identify a man matching the description.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the time and witnessed a man carrying a knife to please get in touch.

"The woman who made the report was driving a black two-seater Mercedes vehicle and I am making a direct plea for her to get in contact.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who was travelling along Ashley Road just after 1pm today and may have relevant dashcam footage to assist my investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 17:194. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
