# Update â€“ alleged criminal damage to tug boat in Poole

17 February 2021

* * *

Officers investigating alleged criminal damage to a tug boat in Poole have made an arrest.

At 9.11pm on Friday 29 January 2021 it was reported that a tug boat, which had been set loose, was stuck under the Poole Lifting Bridge.

It is reported that 'Rough Rider' - a Poole Harbour Commissioner tug boat - was released from its moorings, causing the heavy vessel to float into the channel and collide with an RNLI launch before coming to rest under the lifting bridge.

The rising tide caused damage to the bridge. The boat sustained substantial damage, including to its radar equipment that will require costly repairs.

Following enquiries, a 13-year-old boy from Bournemouth has been arrested on suspicion of attempting to cause criminal damage to property. He has been released on police bail pending further enquiries.
