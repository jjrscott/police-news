# Witness appeal following incident involving a cyclist in Wool

18 January 2018

* * *

Officers investigating an incident involving a cyclist in Wool are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

Between 5.45am and 6.15am on Wednesday 17 January 2018 a woman aged in her 50s was walking along Woolbridge Lane in the direction of the train station when she felt a tap on her shoulder and a tug on the rucksack she was wearing.

She turned round and saw someone on a bike. The woman put her arm out, which appeared to unbalance the cyclist before they rode off toward Wool Bridge.

The woman lost her balance, ended up on the ground and suffered an injury to her shoulder. She was taken to hospital and was treated for a sprain.

She was unable to say whether it was a man or a woman riding the bike, which had a pink or purple reflector or light on the rear wheel.

Detective Constable Lucy Johnson, of Weymouth CID, said: "We are making enquiries into this incident and are still trying to establish exactly what happened.

"I would like to appeal to the cyclist involved to come forward to speak to us to give an account and would also urge any witnesses to come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180008246. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
