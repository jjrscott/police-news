# Witness appeal following reported affray in Dorchester

17 March 2021

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an alleged affray incident in Dorchester - with one man arrested.

Dorset Police was called at around 3.50pm on Monday 15 March 2021 to a report of a man with a baseball bat in the Maumbury Road area near to the traffic lights junction.

It is alleged that an altercation occurred involving a group of men. Some of the group subsequently left in a vehicle.

Officers attended to carry out searches of the area and located the vehicle. A 22-year-old Dorchester man was arrested on suspicion of affray and possession of an offensive weapon in a public place and has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Police Constable Jeremy Brotherton, of Dorset Police's Volume Crime Team, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the area, particularly on Coburg Road or Edward Road, and witnessed what happened to please get in touch.

"We are carrying out enquiries to identify who was involved and whether anyone sustained any injuries to ensure they are all right.

"I would urge any motorists who were in the vicinity and have a dashcam fitted to their vehicle to please check it for any relevant footage."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210041467. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
