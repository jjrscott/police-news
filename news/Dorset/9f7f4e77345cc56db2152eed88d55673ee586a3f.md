# Statement in relation to body recovered at Portland Port

07 February 2019

* * *

On Monday 21 January 2019 a plane carrying pilot David Ibbotson and professional footballer Emiliano Sala was flying from Nantes to Cardiff when it lost contact with Air Traffic Control, north of Guernsey.

Sadly a search and rescue operation was unsuccessful in locating the plane and the two occupants. Subsequently AAIB and privately funded search teams were deployed to the relevant area. Using specialist equipment the teams succeeded in locating and identifying the plane and one body has been recovered.

This morning, Thursday 7 February 2019, the body was brought to Portland Port, Dorset, as this is the nearest part of the British mainland to where the plane was located.

The arrival of the body into Dorset has been reported to the Coroner for Dorset. The Coroner will investigate the circumstances of this death supported by Dorset Police. A post mortem examination will be held in due course.

While formal identification is yet to take place, the families of Emiliano Sala and David Ibbotson have been updated and will continue to be supported by specially-trained family liaison officers, during this difficult time.
