# Witness appeal after attempted robbery on bus in Christchurch

08 June 2016

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward after an attempted robbery on a bus in Christchurch.

The incident occurred at around 4.35pm on Monday 6 June 2016 on the 1A bus from Bournemouth to Christchurch.

The driver stopped at a scheduled stop close to the junction of Harewood Avenue in Bournemouth where a man got on the bus. As the bus arrived at the roundabout at Stanpit Road at the end of Purewell Road in Christchurch the man attempted to grab the driver's box of change.

The offender is described as black, aged in his 40s and had short frizzy hair and was wearing a baseball cap. He was dressed in dark clothing and possibly a leather jacket and carrying a rucksack which was red and black.

The driver was assaulted during the incident and sustained a minor injury. Nothing was stolen.

Detective Constable Luke Davis, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing for anyone who was on the bus at the time of the incident or who has any further information to contact me.

"I believe there may have been several young families on the bus at the time and it was reported that the offender may have been offensive and acted anti-socially prior to the offence being carried out.

"In particular I wish to speak to a woman with blonde hair who may have filmed the incident on her mobile phone. I believe this footage may assist me with my investigation."

Witnesses and anyone with information should call Dorset Police in confidence on 101 quoting incident number 6:338. Alternatively, call the free and anonymous Crimestoppers line on 0800 555 111 where mobile phone tariffs may apply.
