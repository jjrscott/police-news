# Witness appeal following armed robbery in Bournemouth

14 March 2019

* * *

Detectives investigating an armed robbery in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At 12.01pm today, Thursday 14 March 2019, Dorset Police received a report of a robbery at Franses Jewellers in Westover Road involving a number of men on two mopeds and a motorcycle. It was reported that one of the men was seen in possession of a Samurai sword.

There were no reports of any injuries. A number of items are believed to have been stolen.

Officers, including armed police, attended the scene and searches were carried out in a bid to locate the offenders. The searches were supported by the NPAS helicopter.

Three vehicles believed to be involved were recovered, one at the scene, one in Florence Road and another in Coach House Place. A sword has also been recovered.

Following information that the men involved may have travelled to the area of Bournemouth train station, trains were temporarily stopped to allow searches to be carried out.

Detective Inspector Gavin House, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I understand this incident must have caused some concern to members of the public and I would like to reassure them that a thorough investigation is underway to identify and arrest the offenders.

"I am appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident, or who saw the men making off from the premises, to contact police. I am also keen to hear from anyone who may have filmed all or part of the incident on their mobile phone, captured it on dashcam or seen the offenders abandoning the vehicles or discarding items in the relevant areas.

"This was a fast-moving incident and we would like to thank members of the public for their patience and understanding during the disruption that was caused while the searches were carried out.

"Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team will be carrying out patrols in the area and can be approached with any concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190038960. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
