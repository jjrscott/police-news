# Update â€“ arrest in connection with reported assault and road rage incident in Blandford

11 February 2021

* * *

A man has been arrested in connection with an alleged assault and road rage incident in Blandford.

Dorset Police received a report that between 3.25pm and 3.35pm on Wednesday 3 February 2021 a woman aged in her 30s was turning out of the car park at Tesco on Bournemouth Road when a male driver of another car coming down the road slammed on his brakes and beeped his horn.

It was reported that the woman carried on driving and the driver of the other car followed behind flashing his headlights and gesticulating for the woman to pull over.

They both got out of their vehicles in Vale Park off Bournemouth Road and the man allegedly pushed the victim into her car and pushed her face. The woman sustained a cut to her lip that did not require hospital treatment.

Following enquiries, a 51-year-old Blandford man has been arrested on suspicion of assault and has been released on police bail.

Officers are continuing to appeal for any witnesses or anyone who may have captured anything relevant on dashcam to come forward.
