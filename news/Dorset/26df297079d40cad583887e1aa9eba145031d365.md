# Assault on woman in Weymouth â€“ public appeal

12 October 2016

* * *

Police in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a woman was assaulted in the town.

At around 11.45am on Thursday 6 October 2016 a woman was walking alone in an alleyway off Court Road when she was approached from behind by an unknown man.

The offender pulled her to the ground by her wrists and threatened to assault her. Officers have no evidence to suggest the offence was sexually-motivated.

A long-haired woman, who was walking her dog nearby, disturbed the offender and he ran away. The victim, a 19-year-old woman from Poole, was not physically injured.

The offender is described as white, aged in his 30s, of medium build and with a long face and pointed chin. He had dirty hands and was wearing a dark grey hooded top with a white zip and the hood up, blue jeans and black work boots. He spoke with a Dorset accent.

Police Constable Darren Tharme, of Weymouth police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the area of Court Road at the relevant time and saw a man matching the description given to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly keen to hear from a woman who was walking her dog in the area and disturbed the offender. I believe they may have important information that will assist my investigation."
