# Murder investigation in East Dorset - victim named

30 April 2017

* * *

A man who was shot dead by intruders in the St Ives area of Ringwood today has been named by detectives.

At 3.03am today, Sunday 30 April 2017, police received reports that at least two intruders had entered a house in Castlewood.

One of the occupants - named by detectives as 61-year-old Guy Hedger - was shot.

Officers attended the address and Guy was taken to hospital where he was sadly pronounced dead a short time later.

A second occupant in the address at the time has been deeply affected by the incident and is being supported by specially trained officers.

A murder investigation has now been launched by detectives from Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT).

Guy's next of kin are aware and are being supported by specially trained officers. The family has requested privacy at this deeply traumatic time.

The address in Castlewood has been cordoned off while crime scene investigators carry out their examinations.

Detective Chief Inspector Sarah Derbyshire, of MCIT, said: "At this stage we are still trying to establish exactly what happened at the address in Castlewood and how and why the victim was shot dead.

"Currently we do not believe the offenders were known to the victim, however we continue to investigate all lines of enquiry.

"I am appealing for anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious in the area or was in the area at that time, to contact Dorset Police as soon as possible

"There will be a heavy police presence in the vicinity and officers from the local Neighbourhood Policing Team will be carrying out high visibility patrols to offer reassurance to the community and can be contacted with any concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 30:53. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
