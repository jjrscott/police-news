# Appeal for witnesses after assault on man in Weymouth

08 October 2019

* * *

Officers investigating an assault on a man in Weymouth are appealing for any witnesses to come forward.

At around 9.30pm on Wednesday 2 October 2019 the victim - a local man aged in his 20s - was walking along Putton Lane near to Bennetts Water Gardens when he was confronted by two unknown male suspects. One was holding a knife.

The unarmed suspect approached the victim, threw him to the ground, punched him in the head and then slammed his head into the ground.

The victim sustained swelling and grazes to his head.

The suspects were wearing black clothing, hooded tops and their lower faces were covered. One possibly had Adidas stripes down the side of their clothing.

Police Constable John Kirk, of Weymouth police, said: "This incident happened in a secluded area of Weymouth and I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the time and either saw or heard anything suspicious to please contact me."
