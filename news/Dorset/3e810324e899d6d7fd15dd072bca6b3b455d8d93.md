# Witness appeal after man found with head injuries

02 May 2018

* * *

Detectives have launched an investigation after a man was found injured in a Bournemouth street.

At 4.17pm today, Wednesday 2 May 2018, Dorset Police was called by the ambulance service to reports that a man had been found with head injuries in Churchill Road in Boscombe.

The man was taken to hospital for treatment. His condition is described as life-threatening.

A cordon has been put in place in Churchill Road and the road remains closed between Borthwick Road and Walpole Road while crime scene investigators examine the area.

Officers are also carrying out house-to-house visits and making CCTV enquiries.

Detective Inspector Neil Wright, of Bournemouth CID, said: "At this time we do not know how this man came to sustain his injuries and whether anyone else was involved.

"This incident happened at a busy time of the day and I would urge anyone who saw the man or witnessed what happened and has not yet spoken to officers to please contact us.

"From our initial CCTV enquiries we know there were a number of school children in the area and I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who was on their way home from school and may have seen or heard something that could be relevant to my investigation."

Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team will be carrying out additional patrols and can be approached with any community concerns.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 2:317. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
