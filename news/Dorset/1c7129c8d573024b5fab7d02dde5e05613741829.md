# Appeal for information following serious collision in Ferndown

26 September 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward as they investigate a serious road traffic collision in Ferndown.

Dorset Police received a report at 3.39pm on Saturday 26 September 2020 that a yellow Alfa Romeo Spider had collided with a gate at the entrance to the Dudsbury Golf Club off the B3073 Christchurch Road.

Officers attended, along with the ambulance service, and a man aged in his 70s from Ferndown was taken to hospital with serious injuries. His condition is believed to be life-threatening and his family has been informed.

Road closures were put in place to allow the emergency services to respond. They were lifted at around 5pm.

Sergeant Lee Savage, of the traffic unit, said: "We are carrying out enquiries to establish the full circumstances of this collision and I would ask for any witnesses to please come forward.

"I would also ask anyone who was travelling in the area at the relevant time and has dascham fitted to their vehicle to please check their footage for anything that might assist our investigation.

"Finally, I would like to thank members of the public for their patience and understanding during the road closures, which were necessary to allow the emergency services to respond to the incident and for an examination of the scene to be carried out."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 26:235. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
