# Update â€“ photo appeal following alleged assault in Bournemouth

29 September 2017

* * *

Officers investigating an alleged assault in Bournemouth have identified a man following a photo appeal.

At around 12.45pm on Saturday 12 August 2017 a man wearing a light-coloured chequered jacket and blue trousers boarded the M1 bus outside the Christopher Creeke pub on Holdenhurst Road.

He reportedly approached a woman who was on the bus with her child and made a number of racist comments.

It was reported that the man was told to stop by the bus driver, who contacted the police. He then got off and was challenged by the victim, a man aged in his 70s.

The man allegedly kicked the victim in the shin three times before walking off and going into The George Tapps pub on Old Christchurch Road.

A photo of the man was issued by police and a 67-year-old Bournemouth man has been identified and is assisting with enquiries. No arrests have been made.
