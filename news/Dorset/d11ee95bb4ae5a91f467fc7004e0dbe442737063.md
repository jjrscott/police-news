# Appeal for information following burglary in Bournemouth

08 June 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a burglary at a home in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Shortly before 3pm on Friday 5 June 2020 the victim - a man aged in his 70s - left his home in Canford Road to speak to his neighbour in the street. He returned home to find the glass in his back door had been smashed and a purse had been taken from the living room.

The purse contained cash as well as sentimental photographs of the victim's wife and father.

Shortly before the burglary was discovered, a man was reportedly seen emerging from the side of the address. He is described as white, around six feet two inches tall and aged in his thirties. He was wearing a brown jumper.

Police Constable Dave Wilcox, of Bournemouth police, said: "This burglary has understandably left the victim upset, particularly due to the loss of photographs of great sentimental value.

"We are making a number of enquiries into this matter and I would urge any witnesses or anyone with information to please contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200080276. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
