# Reported fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth â€“ man due in court

15 December 2017

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with a reported fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth.

At approximately 10.30pm on Friday 7 July 2017 it was reported a collision occurred outside Coffee and Dice on Christchurch Road involving a red Nissan X-Trail and a pedestrian. The pedestrian - a 20-year-old Bournemouth woman - sustained serious injuries and was taken to hospital for treatment.

It is alleged the red Nissan X-Trail reportedly failed to stop at the scene.

A 53-year-old man from Hampshire has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 19 December 2017 for driving without due care and attention, failing to stop at the scene of a collision, failing to report a collision and driving without insurance.
