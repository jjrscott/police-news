# Update â€“ woman due in court in connection with reported theft at Poole store

14 February 2019

* * *

A woman is due to appear in court in connection with the reported theft of gin from a shop in Poole.

At around 4.25pm on Monday 3 December 2018 a woman entered the John Lewis store on Poole Retail Park and allegedly put a bottle of gin in a bag before making off without paying.

Following a CCTV appeal, a 30-year-old Poole woman attended for a voluntary interview with police and has now been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 19 February 2019 for an offence of theft.
