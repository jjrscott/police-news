# Family tribute following fatal collision in Sixpenny Handley

18 February 2020

* * *

The family of a woman who very sadly died in a collision in Sixpenny Handley has issued a tribute.

The collision happened at around 6pm on Saturday 1 February 2020 on the B3081 about 300m south of the Sixpenny Handley roundabout and involved a red Volkswagen Up BlueMotion, a black Audi A3 and a green Isuzu Pick-up.

The VW driver, a 37-year-old woman from Ringwood named by her family as Ella Cooper, was taken to Southampton General Hospital with life-threatening injuries. She very sadly died on the morning of Friday 7 February 2020.

Her family said in a statement: "Ella was the kind of person you could not forget. She had the amazing ability to make so many feel special. Every day she lived life in full and made sure her many adventures were experienced with someone she loved.

"Ella was thoughtful, loving, generous, smart, hardworking and fiercely determined in all that she did.

"This year was set to be her best year yet as she looked forward to her wedding.

"So much of her life was still left to be fulfilled.

"We will miss her contagious energy, happiness and enthusiasm for life.

"She will be missed by all she met, her effect on others was profound.

"We love you Ella and the world is a little bit dimmer without you to brighten it."
