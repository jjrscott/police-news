# Update - photo appeal after reported burglary in Bournemouth

18 October 2018

* * *

A man has come forward following a photo appeal issued in connection with a reported burglary in Bournemouth.

The incident happened on Saturday 1 September 2018 when the victims - two women aged in their 20s - left the address of one of the women in Lowther Road at around 10.30pm.

When they returned at around 2.30am on Sunday 2 September, they found a number of items missing including an iPad, iPhone and car keys.

One of the women also found that her car - a silver Ford Fiesta - had been taken.

Later Sunday afternoon, the victim of the car theft was walking with her partner along Portchester Road, when they saw her car parked up.

It was reported that a man was sitting in the front passenger seat and a second man was sitting in a rear seat. When challenged, they both reportedly ran away, with the victim managing to take a photo of one of them before they made off. The keys were still in the ignition and the victim was able to recover her vehicle.

A 24-year-old man from Farnham in Surrey has come forward following the appeal, he has attended a voluntary interview with officers and been released under investigation as police continue their enquiries. No arrests have been made.
