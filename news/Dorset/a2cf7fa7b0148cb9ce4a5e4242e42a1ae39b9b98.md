Detectives have launched a murder investigation after the death of a teenage boy in Bournemouth - with four people being arrested.

Officers were called to reports of a fight outside Tesco Express on Wimborne Road in Winton at around 12.55am today, Saturday 16 July 2016.

A 17-year-old boy was found unconscious with serious injuries and was taken to Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospital where he was sadly pronounced dead. His next of kin have been informed and the coroner notified.

The circumstances surrounding the boy's death are suspicious and a murder investigation, led by Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team, has been launched.

A cordon has been set up along Wimborne Road at the junctions of Brassey Road, Victoria Park Road and Castle Road to allow crime scene investigators to examine the scene.

Three men aged 27, 24 and 23, and a 15-year-old boy, all from the Bournemouth area, have been arrested on suspicion of murder and are currently assisting police with their enquiries.

Detective Inspector Wayne Seymour, of the Major Crime Investigation Team, said: "Following the death of the boy enquiries are now underway to establish exactly what happened during the incident.

"I am appealing for anyone who may witnessed what happened or has any other information that may help with the investigation and who has not already spoken to police to contact us as soon as possible."

Witnesses and anyone with information should call Dorset Police on 101 quoting incident number 16:13. Alternatively, call the free and anonymous Crimestoppers line on 0800 555 111 where mobile phone tariffs may apply.
