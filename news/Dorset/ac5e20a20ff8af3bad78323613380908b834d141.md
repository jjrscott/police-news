# Witness appeal following altercation in Bournemouth

23 May 2016

* * *

Detectives in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an altercation in the town.

At 12.09am on Saturday 21 May 2016 police were called to reports of a disturbance on Meyrick Road close to the Britannia Hotel.

The incident involved two men in a dark-coloured vehicle, possibly a VW Passat, and a man riding a bicycle.

Detective Sergeant Ian Allen, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This incident was reported to us by a member of the public and officers were unable to locate anyone at the scene.

"It is possible the cyclist may have been assaulted during the incident. I would urge this man to please come forward and talk to officers to allow us to investigate the incident.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident or who saw either the vehicle or the cyclist immediately before or after the altercation."

Witnesses and anyone with information should call Dorset Police in confidence on 101, quoting incident number 21:03. Alternatively, call the free and anonymous Crimestoppers line on 0800 555 111, where mobile phone tariffs may apply.
