# Warning to motorists following car gatherings in Poole

14 July 2020

* * *

Officers are warning the public about dangerous driving following recent unauthorised 'car meets' in Poole.

Dorset Police is aware of a large gathering of cars and people in the Oakdale area on the evening of Friday 3 July and Friday 10 July 2020. It was reported that some of the vehicles were driving dangerously and at excessive speeds, with a large number of people stood by the side of the road watching them.

Officers from the traffic unit, No Excuse and the local neighbourhood policing team will be monitoring the area in the evenings to ensure the safety of the public and keep disruption to a minimum.

Inspector Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "We are aware that these events are taking place and we will be deploying resources into the area to target any dangerous driving incidents.

"We would discourage anyone from attending these events. However, if you are going you will be asked to abide by the laws of the road and be respectful of local businesses and residents.

"If you are seen to be driving dangerously, Dorset Police will take appropriate action to deal with this behaviour.

"Events of this nature can cause serious injury to participants and bystanders and we are committed to ensuring the safety of our roads and everyone involved.

"People watching these events also need to be reminded that we are still in a public health crisis and large gatherings are prohibited to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.

"I would also urge anyone who has video footage of people driving recklessly at one of these events to report it via Operation Snap - https://operationsnap.dorset.police.uk/."
