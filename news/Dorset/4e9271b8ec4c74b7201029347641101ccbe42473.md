# UPDATE: Witness appeal following fatal collision in Poole

23 October 2016

* * *

Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a fatal collision in Poole.

At around 5.37pm today, Sunday 23 October 2016, Dorset Police were called by the ambulance service to reports of a serious injury road traffic collision in Lindsay Road involving a blue Renault Clio which was travelling from Penn Hill toward Bournemouth and a green Kawasaki motorcycle travelling in the opposite direction.

Officers, paramedics and the air ambulance attended.

A 23-year-old local man who was travelling on the motorcycle was taken to Poole Hospital but sadly died a short time later. His next of kin have been informed and the coroner has been notified.

A second man, aged 21 and from Bournemouth, who was also travelling on the motorcycle, was flown by air ambulance to Southampton General Hospital and is said to be in a life-threatening condition.

The driver of the Renault, a 31-year-old local man, was uninjured.

Lindsay Road remains closed between the Frizzell roundabout and Burton Road while emergency services deal with the incident and collision investigators examine the scene.

Police Sergeant Joe Pardey, of Dorset Police's Road Traffic Unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or saw the manner of driving or riding of either vehicle prior to the incident to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would like to thank motorists for their patience during the road closures which have been necessary to allow emergency services to deal with the incident, treat the injured and examine the scene."
