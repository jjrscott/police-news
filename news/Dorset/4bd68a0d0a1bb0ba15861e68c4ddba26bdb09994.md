# Public appeal to find man missing in West Bay

23 February 2018

* * *

Officers searching for a missing Sussex man believed to be in the West Bay area are appealing for the public's help to find him.

Mark Purdy, who is 64 years old, left his home in Sussex at 9am this morning, Friday 23 February 2018. He told his family that he was going for a walk but he never returned. Later he messaged to indicate that he is in the West Bay area of Dorset and was very upset.

He is described as white, five feet eleven inches tall and of slim build. He has thick grey hair and wears glasses. It is not known what clothes he is wearing.

Chief Inspector Jim Beashel, of Dorset Police, said: "We believe there was a sighting of Mark at The George pub at around 7pm this evening. However, so far we have not been able to find him.

"As Mark seemed very upset when he sent the message to his family earlier today, we are concerned for his welfare and are trying to locate him as quickly as possible.

"Anyone who may have seen Mark today should contact police urgently."

Anyone with information or knowledge as to Mark's whereabouts is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 23:434. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
