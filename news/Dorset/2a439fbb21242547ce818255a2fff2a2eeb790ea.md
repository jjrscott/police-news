# Update in appeal following incident at Lodmoor Country Park

22 May 2018

* * *

Officers investigating an incident in which it is alleged that a man threatened a member of the public with a knife at a Weymouth country park have made an arrest.

At 4.48pm on Friday 18 May 2018 Dorset Police was called to reports of a man with a Swiss Army pen knife in Lodmoor County Park. It was also reported the man threatened a member of the public. The victim, a local man aged in his 50s, was not physically injured.

Officers attended and, despite a thorough search involving the dog unit and NPAS helicopter, the suspect was not located.

Today, Tuesday 22 May 2018, following a public appeal, officers have arrested a 62-year-old Weymouth man on suspicion of threatening a person with an offensive weapon in a public place. He is helping officers with their enquiries.

Police Constable Lisa Fisher, of Weymouth police, said: “I am grateful for anyone who has replied to our appeal already.

“However, I would urge anyone who witnessed the incident and has not yet spoken with officers to contact Dorset Police as I am still continuing my investigation to establish what exactly happened.”
