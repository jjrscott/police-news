Officers investigating an alleged fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth have arrested a man.

At around 12.25pm on Wednesday 10 February 2021 officers were called to reports of a two-vehicle collision on Alma Road involving a silver Kia Sportage and a blue Peugeot 106. It was reported that the Kia failed to stop at the scene.

The driver of the Peugeot, a man aged in his 40s, was taken to hospital for treatment to injuries that were not believed to be serious.

It is alleged that the Kia involved was stolen from an address in the Winton area between 2pm on Sunday 7 February 2021 and 8.45am on Monday 8 February 2021. The vehicle has now been recovered by police.

Following enquiries, a 31-year-old man from Bournemouth was arrested on suspicion of being the driver of a vehicle that failed to stop after a road accident and theft of a motor vehicle. He has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.
