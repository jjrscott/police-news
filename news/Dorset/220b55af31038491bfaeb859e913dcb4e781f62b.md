# Non-emergency number 101 available again

03 July 2016

* * *

Dorset Police's non-emergency number 101 is working again.

The technical issue which had affected the availability of the number since earlier today, Sunday 3 July 2016, has now been resolved.

A range of contact methods can be found on the Dorset Police website.

The 'Do It Online' section of the site includes services to report a non-emergency crime or incident, pass a message to an officer or request a call back, make a complaint or give compliments and feedback, submit a Freedom of Information request, or report lost property. It is also hoped that carrying out simpler enquiries quickly online will reduce demand on the 101 telephone service, making it quicker for people to speak to a call handler for more complex or urgent issues.

If life is in danger or a crime is in progress, always dial 999.
