# Road traffic collision on Portland - witness appeal

29 June 2017

* * *

Officers investigating a two-vehicle road traffic collision on the Portland Beach Road are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

Dorset Police was informed of the incident at 11.25pm on Wednesday 28 June 2017.

The collision involved a blue BMW, being driven by a local man, and a grey Peugeot 2008, containing two men.

Police Sergeant Nikki Burt, of the traffic unit, said: "For a reason yet unconfirmed the vehicles collided and as a result all three men sustained serious injuries and were extracted from their vehicles by the ambulance and fire services. The passenger of the Peugeot sustained life-threatening injuries. All three men were taken to Dorset County Hospital via land ambulance.

"The road had to be closed in both directions to enable forensic collision investigators to examine the scene and preserve the evidence. I would like to thank the public for their patience during the closure.

"I am appealing for any witnesses to the collision or the manner of driving of either vehicle prior to the incident to come forward."
