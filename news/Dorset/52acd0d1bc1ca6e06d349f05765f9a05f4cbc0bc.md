Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a serious injury collision in Blandford.

At 3.25pm today, Sunday 10 June 2018, a road traffic collision occurred on the A354 involving a white Land Rover and a silver Skoda Fabia.

The front seat passenger of the Land Rover, a 41-year-old woman from Faringdon in Oxfordshire, was medically trapped in the vehicle and had to be freed. The driver, a 42-year-old man also from Faringdon, sustained minor injuries. They were taken to Poole Hospital for treatment.

A woman, aged 53 and from Winterborne Stickland, who was travelling in the Skoda sustained a broken foot and was taken to Dorset County Hospital for treatment. The driver, a 61-year-old man, also from Winterborne Stickland, was taken to the same hospital with minor injuries.

The A354 was closed between the roundabout at Wimborne Road and the Tesco roundabout to allow officers to examine the scene and for the vehicles to be recovered.

Police Constable Tim Gooding, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who was travelling along the road at the relevant time and may have captured the incident on their dash cam."
