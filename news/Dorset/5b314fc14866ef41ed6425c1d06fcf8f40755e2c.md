# Technical issues with 101

03 July 2016

* * *

Dorset Police is currently experiencing technical issues with its non-emergency number 101.

Technicians are working to resolve the problem but at this time it is unknown when the fault will be fixed. Members of the public are asked to email enquiries@dorset.pnn.police.uk for any non-urgent matters. In addition, a range of information can be found on Dorset Police's relaunched website. The 'Do It Online' section of the site includes services to report a non-emergency crime or incident, pass a message to an officer or request a call back, make a complaint or give compliments and feedback, submit a Freedom of Information request, or report lost property. It is also hoped that carrying out simpler enquiries quickly online will reduce demand on the 101 telephone service, making it quicker for people to speak to a call handler for more complex or urgent issues. The emergency number 999 is not affected. This should be used if life is in danger or a crime is in progress.

An update will be issued when the fault affecting 101 is fixed.
