Officers investigating a serious injury road traffic incident on Portland are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

At around 1.45pm on Tuesday 4 August 2020 Dorset Police was called to a report of an incident involving a brown Ford Mondeo and a cyclist on Sweet Hill Lane.

The cyclist, a local man aged in his 70s, sustained serious injuries and was flown to Southampton General Hospital by air ambulance. His condition is described as critical and his next of kin has been informed.

Police Sergeant Mark Scammell, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the injured man and his family at this time.

"An investigation is underway to establish the full circumstances and I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident to please get in touch.

"I am also keen to hear from any motorists travelling in the area at the time who had dashcam fitted to their vehicle to check the footage for anything relevant."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 4:202. Alternatively, or alternatively to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
