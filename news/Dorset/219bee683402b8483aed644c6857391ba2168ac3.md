# Witness appeal following serious injury collision in Bournemouth

24 April 2017

* * *

A man who was involved in a collision with a lorry in Bournemouth has sadly become critically ill and officers would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident.

Officers were called just after 2pm on Wednesday 19 April 2017 to Holdenhurst Road near to the railway station following reports of a collision involving a Volvo heavy goods vehicle and a pedestrian.

The pedestrian - a 66-year-old man from Bournemouth - sustained injuries and was taken to Poole Hospital for treatment. His condition has subsequently deteriorated and he has been transferred to Southampton General Hospital where he remains in a life-threatening condition.

Police Sergeant Fern Graham, of the traffic unit, said: "The injured man has sadly taken a turn for the worse. There were a number of pedestrians and vehicles in the area at the time of the incident and I would ask anyone who witnessed the collision and has yet to speak to officers to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 19:243. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
