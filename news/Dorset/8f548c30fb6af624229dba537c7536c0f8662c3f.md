# Witness appeal following fatal collision near Bere Regis

15 July 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a fatal collision near Bere Regis.

At 4.40pm on Saturday 14 July 2018 Dorset Police was called to reports of a three vehicle collision on the westbound lane of the A35 Dorchester bypass near Bere Regis, just before the single carriageway becomes a dual carriageway.

The collision involved a white BMW, a white Land Rover Freelander and a silver Mercedes.

Very sadly the driver of the Freelander - a Weymouth man aged 49 - sustained very serious injuries and died at the scene. His next of kin have been informed and the coroner notified.

Four other people suffered serious injuries and are being treated in hospital.

Due to the number of people injured in the collision, the A35 was closed in both directions between Bere Regis and the Stinsford roundabout to allow the emergency services to land helicopters at the scene and tend to the casualties.

The road was reopened early this morning, Sunday 15 July 2018.

Police Sergeant Fern Graham, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was travelling along the A35 and either witnessed the collision or saw the manner of driving of either vehicle immediately prior to the incident to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who was in the area and may have dashcam that could be relevant to our investigation.

"Due to the seriousness of the collision and the number of people injured, it was necessary for us to close the A35 to allow the injured to be cared for as quickly as possible and for collision investigators to establish what happened. I appreciate these closures caused considerable delays for motorists and I would like to thank them for their patience and understanding."
