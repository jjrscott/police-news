A second boy has been arrested in connection with a disturbance in Bournemouth town centre.

At around 9.20pm on Saturday 7 July 2018 it was reported that an altercation took place in the Lower Gardens involving a large group of young people and a smaller group of men.

During the incident, three members of the smaller group were reportedly assaulted.

A man aged in his 20s sustained a large cut to his head and ear and another man, also aged in his 20s, suffered a deep cut to his lip and had two teeth knocked out. A third man sustained a suspected broken nose.

A 16-year-old boy from Poole was previously arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm and assault occasioning actual bodily harm and was released under investigation.
