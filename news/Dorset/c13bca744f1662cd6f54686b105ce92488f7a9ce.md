# Witness appeal following distraction burglary in Poole

23 February 2017

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses after burglars conned their way into an elderly man's home and stole a large sum of cash.

The incident happened at around 1.15pm on Saturday 18 February 2017 when two men arrived at an address in the Phyldon Road area claiming they were there to replace his thermostat.

The victim believed their visit was genuine and allowed them access to his home.

While inside, the victim heard a loud bang and went to his bedroom. He discovered that Â£3,000 had been stolen.

The offenders were seen to run off toward Uppleby Road and make off in a dark-coloured Land Rover Discovery.

The first man is described as white, aged 30 to 35, five feet six inches tall, of heavy build and with black hair.

The second man is described as white, aged 35 to 40, six feet tall, of heavy build and with brown hair.

It is believed the men were accompanied to the address by a woman who is described as being aged in her late teens or early 20s, five feet nine inches tall, of skinny build and with tanned skin. She had long bleach blonde hair, a bad complexion and was wearing a dark green tracksuit.

Detective Constable Neil Jones, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was a despicable and callous incident in which the offenders targeted an elderly vulnerable man in his own home.

"I am appealing to the public to help me find the people responsible for this incident. Did you see people acting suspiciously in the Uppleby Road area on Saturday lunchtime? Did you see two men and a women hanging around the area? If so I would urge you to please contact Dorset Police.

"Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team have been carrying out high visibility patrols in the area and this will continue over the coming days.

"I would like to remind residents not to keep large amounts of cash at home and not to let anyone in their property they don't know and are not expecting. If someone does knock on your door stating they are there to do some work, ask for their name, contact number and ID. A genuine workman will not mind waiting on the door step while you check their validity."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170024939. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
