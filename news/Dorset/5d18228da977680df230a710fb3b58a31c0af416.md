# Witness appeal following theft of eight cows from farm in Bere Regis

09 January 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for the public's help after eight cows were stolen from a farm in Bere Regis.

Sometime between the evening of Saturday 7 January and 7am on Sunday 8 January 2017 offenders broke into the farm by cutting through padlocks.

In total eight brown-coated Limousin cows - five male and three female - were stolen. A CCTV camera was also taken during the incident.

Police Constable Mark Wooldridge, of Wareham police, said: "We suspect the offenders used a tractor and trailer or 4x4 vehicle with a trailer to remove the cows from the farm.

"I am appealing to anyone who saw such a vehicle in suspicious circumstances in the area at the relevant time to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who has become aware of someone trying to sell this breed of cows.

"Officers from the local Neighbourhood Policing Team will be carrying out additional reassurance patrols in the area over the coming days."

No arrests have been made.
