# Appeal for witnesses following burglaries in Weymouth

09 October 2020

* * *

Officers investigating two burglaries in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Between 4.30pm on Monday 5 October and the morning of Tuesday 6 October 2020 entry was gained to the former Lupins Business Centre building on Greenhill and a black Makita radio was stolen.

A similar incident was reported to have previously occurred during the night between Thursday 10 September and Friday 11 September 2020. On that occasion a white Makita radio was stolen.

Police Constable Anneka Stone, of Weymouth Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "Both of these incidents occurred at a property that is in the process of being renovated.

"I am appealing to anyone who has recently seen any suspicious activity in the area to please get in touch.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who has seen any Makita radios for sale locally in unusual circumstances."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200150667. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
