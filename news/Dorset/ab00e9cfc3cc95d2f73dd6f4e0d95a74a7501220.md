# Update â€“ man arrested in connection with reported fraudulent use of bank card in Bournemouth

07 January 2021

* * *

A man has been arrested in connection with the reported fraudulent use of a bank card in Bournemouth.

It was reported that at 1.37pm on Thursday 24 December 2020 the victim used his bank card at Tesco Express on Charminster Road, but had failed to collect his card from the machine.

At approximately 2pm the same day the card was allegedly used to make contactless payments on four occasions at local stores.

Following a CCTV appeal, a 36-year-old Bournemouth man has come forward and has been arrested on suspicion of theft and fraud by false representation. He is assisting officers with their enquiries.

We would like to thank everyone who shared our appeal.
