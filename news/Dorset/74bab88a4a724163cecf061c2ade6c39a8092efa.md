# Witness appeal following sexual assault incident in Weymouth

12 June 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a woman was sexually assaulted in Weymouth.

At around 3.45pm on Thursday 6 June 2019 the victim - a local woman aged in her 40s - was riding her mobility scooter along the Rodwell Trail with her dog when she approached a man who was sitting on a bench.

It is reported the man sexually assaulted the victim and indecently exposed himself.

Officers have carried out house-to-house and CCTV enquiries and a full investigation remains ongoing.

Police Constable Dale Collins, of Weymouth police, said: "As part of my investigation I am keen to hear from anyone who was in the Rodwell Trail area at the relevant time and saw or heard anything suspicious.

"I am particularly appealing for two schoolboys, believed to be aged between 12 and 14, who cycled past the incident on one bike as they may have important information that could assist my investigation."

Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team are aware of this incident and can be approached with any concerns.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk, or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190085635. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
