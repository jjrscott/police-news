# Incident that left teenager with serious eye injury â€“ charge update

20 July 2018

* * *

A man and a woman are due to appear in court in connection with an incident in Poole that left a 13-year-old boy with a serious eye injury.

It was reported that the boy was walking along Wimborne Road, close to its junction with Tatnam Road and the Co-Op food store, between 8pm and 8.15pm on Sunday 31 December 2017 when he felt something hit him on the leg. He turned round and was hit by something in his eye.

The boy sustained a serious eye injury and was taken to hospital. He is continuing to have treatment.

A 20-year-old man from Poole has been issued with a postal requisition for an offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm and a 21-year-old woman, also from Poole, has been issued with a postal requisition for an offence of perverting the course of justice. They are both due to appear before Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 27 July 2018.

A 20-year-old man from Poole who was arrested on suspicion of wounding with intent remains released under investigation while enquiries continue.
