# Body Worn Video to be launched across Dorset Police and Devon and Cornwall Police

11 October 2018

* * *

A joint project between Dorset Police and Devon and Cornwall Police to equip officers with a body worn video (BWV) launched on the 8 October 2018. BWV is a small camera attached to officers allowing them to record incidents and encounters when necessary.

The motivation for the introduction of BWV has always been for evidential reasons - aiming to provide unbiased accounts that can lead to a quicker and fairer administration of justice.

Project lead, Superintendent Claire Armes, said: “BWV will provide our officers and staff with vital technology. It is there to keep both the public and our officers safe.

“As well as bringing greater transparency to our policing activity, there are a number of operational benefits. The immediate capturing of vital evidence to support swift investigations and increased conviction rates, particularly in the case of domestic abuse.”

Dorset Police & Crime Commissioner, Martyn Underhill said: “I welcome the roll-out of BWV across the Force. It gives officers an increased ability to gather evidence and provide a factual record of what an officer has experienced. BWV is not only an invaluable addition to our officers’ kit, it fulfils one of my commitments to the people of Dorset to improve technology and infrastructure for the Force.’’
