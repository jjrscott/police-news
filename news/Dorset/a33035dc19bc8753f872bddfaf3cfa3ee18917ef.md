# Road incident in Wareham â€“ public appeal

17 August 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following a road incident in Wareham.

At around 9.40am on Monday 14 August 2017 a man was driving his Kia Picanto along Bovington Lane when two teenage boys hiding in a bush threw a metal incinerator bin lid at his car.

The lid hit the car and was dragged underneath the vehicle. The victim, aged in his 50s and from Tunstall in Stoke-on-Trent, said the incident caused him to almost lose control of his car.

A 13-year-old boy who was travelling in the car sustained a minor injury to his neck. The vehicle was extensively damaged.

The offenders are described as aged approximately 14 years old.

Police Constable Tom Renshaw, of Wareham police, said: "The reckless behaviour of these two boys could have led to very serious consequences.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the Bovington Lane area at the relevant time and saw or heard anything suspicious to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who has had a metal bin lid stolen from the Wareham area recently."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170125337. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
