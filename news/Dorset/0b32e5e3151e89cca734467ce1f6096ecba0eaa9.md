# Witness appeal after damage caused to cars in Christchurch

13 October 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for the public's help after damage was caused to two moving cars in Christchurch.

At 8.03pm on Thursday 12 October 2017 Dorset Police received a report that a grey Fiat Scudo had sustained damage to windows while it was travelling along the A35 Christchurch bypass.

A short time later it was reported that a second car, a silver Nissan Micra, had been damaged in the same way.

Officers attended the incident, including firearms officers, and a search of the area was carried out but no individuals were found.

One of the drivers sustained a minor cut to his arm.

Investigations are underway to establish what caused the damage and find who is responsible for the incident. One of the vehicles has been examined and it is believed the damage was caused by a ball bearing from a catapult.

No arrests have been made.

Christchurch Neighbourhood Inspector Cheyne Marley said: "Thankfully neither driver was injured and the damage did not cause them to lose control of their vehicles. Throwing items at moving vehicles is extremely dangerous and reckless.

"I would urge anyone who knows who was responsible for this incident to contact Dorset Police.

"Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team will be carrying out high visibility reassurance patrols in the coming days and can be approached with any concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 12:446. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
