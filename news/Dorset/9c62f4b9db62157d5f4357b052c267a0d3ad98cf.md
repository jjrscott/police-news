Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an alleged assault in Weymouth.

At around 9.22pm on Friday 17 November 2017 Dorset Police received a report from the ambulance service that a man had been located in an alleyway between Newstead Road and Holland Road.

The victim - a 29-year-old local man - had sustained a serious head injury and was taken to Dorset County Hospital for treatment. He was released from hospital the following day.

It is reported that the same man had been robbed of his rucksack and mobile phone shortly before the assault.

A 15-year-old local boy has been arrested on suspicion of robbery and a 16-year-old local girl was arrested on suspicion of assault and robbery. They have both been released under investigation pending further enquiries.
