# Update - CCTV appeal to identify man reportedly carrying a knife in Bournemouth

01 October 2019

* * *

Officers investigating an incident in which someone was reportedly seen to carry a knife into a Bournemouth fast food restaurant say a man has come forward and been interviewed.

At around 9.55pm on Friday 13 September 2019 it was reported a man walked into McDonald's in Christchurch Road, Boscombe, with a kitchen-style knife handle sticking out of his trouser pocket.

It is alleged a member of security staff approached the man, removed the knife from his pocket and asked him to leave. No threats were made with the weapon.

Following a CCTV appeal, a 43-year-old local man has come forward and been interviewed by officers. He has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.
