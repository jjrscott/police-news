# Witness appeal following assault in Poole

05 June 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following an assault in Poole.

At around 2.15pm on Friday 29 May 2020 the victim - a 16-year-old girl - was skateboarding along Poole Quay when a man approached her from behind and made a derogatory comment toward her. He then pushed the victim off her skateboard, causing her to fall to the ground.

The man then walked away in the direction of Baiter Park.

The offender is described as white, aged between 40 to 50 years old, around five feet seven inches tall and with receding hair and facial stubble. He was wearing a red and white polo shirt and was walking a black Staffordshire Bull Terrier-type dog, which is described as having a 'bite mark' injury to its face.

The victim sustained minor injuries to her hands as a result of the incident, but did not require hospital treatment.

Police Constable Cara Bradley, of Dorset Police, said: "This was a particularly distressing and unprovoked assault on a teenage girl and I am keen to hear from anyone who witnessed what happened and would ask anyone with any information that could assist my investigation to please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200076197. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
