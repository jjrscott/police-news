# Witness appeal following fail-to-stop collision in Poole

19 February 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a fail-to-stop collision in Poole.

At approximately 3.30pm on Monday 12 February 2018 a 16-year-old local boy riding a moped was stopped at the junction of Ringwood Road and Rossmore Road waiting to turn right when it was reported that a large white van collided with his moped.

The boy was not injured but the rear bumper of his moped was damaged.

The van reportedly turned in the road and travelled back in the direction of the Upton bypass. The driver is described as having black hair, a dark beard and was wearing headphones which went over his head.

Police Constable James Hazell, of Poole police, said: “I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision, or has any information about the driver of the van, to please get in touch.”

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk, or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180022831. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
