Three people arrested in connection with the reported theft of post and parcels from delivery vans in Bournemouth will face no further police action.

It was reported that two bags of mail were stolen from a Royal Mail delivery van that was parked in Abbott Road at around 1.45pm on Thursday 26 November 2020. The mail was later reportedly found to have been set fire to and destroyed in Harewood Avenue.

At around 7.55pm on Friday 27 November 2020 a number of parcels were also allegedly stolen from an Argos delivery panel van in Heaton Road and at around 12.20pm the following day, Saturday 28 November 2020, parcels were stolen from a DPD delivery van in Broadway Lane.

A 15-year-old boy and two men aged 23 and 24 - all from Bournemouth - were arrested on suspicion of theft and were released under investigation.

Following enquiries by officers, they have all now been released from under investigation and will face no further police action.
