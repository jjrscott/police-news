Officers investigating a serious assault on two men in Poole are issuing a CCTV image of a man they would like to speak to.

At around 4.30am on Monday 21 December 2020 an altercation occurred in the multi-storey car park in Hill Street. A man aged in his 30s sustained a deep laceration to his neck and another man, also aged in his 30s, sustained a stab wound to his back.

Both men were taken to hospital for treatment to serious injuries, but have since been discharged.

"I am now in a position to issue a CCTV image of a man we would like to speak to and would urge anyone with information as to his identity to please contact us."
