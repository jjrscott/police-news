# Update â€“ arrest in connection with reported theft and assault on Portland

26 February 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a reported assault and bicycle theft on Portland have arrested a teenage boy.

It was reported that at around 4pm on Wednesday 19 February 2020 a group of four teenagers approached two teenage boys in Easton Square Gardens and asked to have a go on their bikes. After two members of the group had cycled around for a short time, they allegedly refused to give one of the bikes back and made off with it.

It was reported that the victims followed them in an attempt to get the bike back but one of them was allegedly assaulted.

Following enquiries, a 17-year-old Weymouth boy has been arrested on suspicion of theft and assault and has been released on police bail.
