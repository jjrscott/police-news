# Witness appeal after assault following road rage incident in West Parley

31 July 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses after a man was assaulted following a road rage incident in West Parley.

The incident happened at around 8.40am on Thursday 26 July 2018 at the Parley Cross traffic lights.

The victim - a Bournemouth man aged in his 30s - was travelling on his bicycle along Whitelegg Way when he was closely overtaken by a skip lorry. The lorry sounded its horn as it passed.

The cyclist caught up with the lorry as it was queuing for the Parley Cross traffic lights, where a verbal altercation occurred between him and the lorry driver. The lorry driver then got out of his vehicle and shoved the victim to the ground causing grazes to his legs.

Police Community Support Investigator Kate Hann, of East Dorset police, said: "I am appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

"In particular, I would like to speak with a motorcyclist who is believed to have intervened at the time. I'd also request anyone who may have dashcam footage of the incident to contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180118707. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
