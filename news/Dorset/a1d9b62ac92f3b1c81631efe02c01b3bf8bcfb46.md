# Weymouth to receive enhanced town centre patrols as part of ‘100 days of summer’ policing campaign

22 May 2019

* * *

Weymouth Neighbourhood Policing Team will be providing an improved visible presence in the town centre this summer in a bid to reduce anti-social and criminal behaviour.

The initiative, called '100 days of summer', will see officers on dedicated foot patrols in the town centre at key locations and times from the end of May for 100 days.

In 2018, the local Neighbourhood Team trialled an evidence-based approach, proven to reduce ASB and criminal behaviour, by carrying out patrols in hotspot areas at key times. This was positively received by the public who appreciated the stronger visible presence of uniformed officers.

Police constables and police community support officers (PCSOs) will be visible around the town on a daily basis and will be supported by special constables. Officers will also be carrying out joint patrols with the Dorset Council community safety patrol officers.

Weymouth and Portland Neighbourhood Policing Team Sergeant Sam Goom said: "We are committed to ensuring that residents and visitors to Weymouth feel safe and are able to enjoy their time here.

"We have listened to concerns of the community regarding anti-social behaviour in the town and hope this approach will have an impact in tackling anti-social behaviour and violence.

"Reports of anti-social behaviour and violence in the town were down last year based on previous figures and we are keen to continue this positive trend.

"Weymouth remains a safe place but there is always room to make things better for residents and visitors."

Officers and PCSOs will be able to make use of dispersal powers to direct people away from the town or surrender alcohol if they have been acting in an anti-social manner. Anyone who continues to come to notice will be considered for further action such as community protection notices and criminal behaviour orders.

Melcombe Regis Development Officer, Police Constable Chris Meade, said: "We regularly receive feedback from the community that they want our officers to be out and about on foot patrol rather than on patrol in vehicles.

"We will be continuing our work with partners, including the British Transport Police, Dorset Council, Weymouth Town Council, BID, RNLI, The Lantern Trust, Julian House and REACH, throughout the initiative.

"We're confident our '100 days of summer' initiative will have a significant impact on the town centre and surrounding areas."
