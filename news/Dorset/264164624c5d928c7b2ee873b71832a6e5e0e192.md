# Witness appeal following serious collision near Dorchester

25 March 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information following a serious road traffic collision near Dorchester.

At 4.19pm on Monday 25 March 2019, officers were called to the incident involving a silver Suzuki Jimny car and a red Kawasaki motorcycle on the A35 near Long Bredy.

The motorcycle rider, a man in his 50s and from Beaminster, was taken to Southampton by air ambulance with possible life-threatening head injuries. His passenger, a woman who is also in her 50s and from Beaminster, was taken to Dorset County Hospital. Her injuries are not believed to be life-threatening.

The driver of the car, a woman in her 20s and from the Dorchester area, was uninjured.

Road closures were put in place between Bridport and Dorchester to allow emergency services to deal with the collision.

Police Sergeant Fern Graham, of the traffic unit, said: "This was a serious injury collision and I am appealing for witnesses to the incident, who have not yet spoken to police, to come forward.

"I would also like to hear from anyone with any information about the manner of driving of either vehicle shortly before the collision or who has relevant dashcam footage.

"We are very much aware that the road closures have impacted on a large number of motorists at a busy time and would like to thank everyone for their patience and understanding. These closures were necessary to allow the emergency services personnel to deal with the incident safely."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 25:282. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
