# Witness appeal following sexual assault in Bournemouth

04 February 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a sexual assault in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 8.30pm on Tuesday 28 January 2020 a 22-year-old man was sitting on a bench in the East Cliff area by the Red Arrows memorial. He was approached by a man who called himself Michael. The man then began to tell the victim about his family and said that he used to work as a chef in Boscombe. He then sat next to the victim before touching him inappropriately over his clothing.

The victim immediately got up and left the area.

The offender is described as aged in his 50s, five feet seven inches tall, with large eyes and facial stubble. He was wearing a black Puffa-style jacket, dark tracksuit bottoms with white stripes down the leg and a black cap. He also told the victim he was Russian and Turkish, and the victim described him as speaking with a foreign accent.

Police Constable Alex Browning, of Bournemouth police, said: "The victim was understandably left shaken by this incident and we are carrying out a detailed investigation to identify the man responsible.

"I would appeal to any witnesses or anyone who was in the vicinity around the time of the offence and saw or heard anything suspicious to please contact us.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who may recognise the man from the description given."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200014665. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
