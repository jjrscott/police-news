# Appeal for information following assault in Christchurch

29 March 2021

* * *

Officers are appealing for anyone with information to come forward after a teenage girl was assaulted by a man in Christchurch.

The incident occurred at around 5pm on Thursday 4 March 2021. The 13-year-old victim was cycling along a cut through that runs from Smugglers Lane North to Nea Close with a friend and as she passed a man he kicked the rear wheel of her bike, causing her to fall off.

The man kicked the girl to the stomach and was then distracted by a call on his mobile phone. The girl got back on her bike and went to ride off, but the man kicked her rear wheel again and she fell off once more.

She was then kicked in the stomach again and the man stood over her with a small kitchen knife in his hand and threatened her before moving away.

The victim suffered grazes and soreness to the stomach as a result of the assault. The matter was reported to police on Thursday 11 March 2021.

The offender is described as white, aged in his 50s, around five feet eight inches tall, of medium build and with greying brown hair and a grey beard. He was wearing a black Puffa-style coat, dark blue jogging bottoms and red and black trainers.

Police Constable Aaron Harvey, of East Dorset police, said: "This was a very distressing incident for the young victim. We have been carrying out a number of enquiries into the incident and, after obtaining a full account from the victim, we are now appealing for anyone with information that might assist our investigation to please come forward."

Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
