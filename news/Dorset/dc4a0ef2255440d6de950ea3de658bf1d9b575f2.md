A man has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at court for sexual offences relating to allegations he abused a woman who attended for holistic treatments in Bournemouth.

Hongwei Dong, aged 59 and of Bournemouth, is due to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 21 May 2021 in relation to five counts of assault by penetration and two offences of sexual assault.

The allegations relate to incidents involving a woman aged in her 30s who attended for holistic treatments given by the defendant, known as 'Dr David', at WeCare Remedy in Commercial Road between October and December 2018.

Detective Sergeant Chris Griffin, of Dorset Police, said: "Following a detailed investigation, we have consulted with the Crown Prosecution Service, which has directed Dorset Police to charge Mr Dong with these offences.

"I would urge anyone who may have additional information or wishes to speak to officers to please contact us at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180206923.

"I would also like to remind members of the public that court proceedings are now active and I would urge them not to publish anything on social media or the internet that could prejudice a future court case."
