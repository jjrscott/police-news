Officers investigating an alleged affray in Weymouth are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

At around 12.30pm on Saturday 2 September 2017, Dorset Police was alerted by colleagues from British Transport Police to reports of a disturbance in Ranelagh Road near to Weymouth train station.

Officers attended and a 44-year-old Weymouth man has been arrested on suspicion of affray, being drunk and disorderly in a public place and obstructing or resisting a constable in the execution of their duty. He has now been released under investigation.

Police Sergeant Jane Moore, of Weymouth police, said: "We are continuing to investigate this incident to establish the full details of what took place and I am appealing for any witnesses who have not yet spoken to police to please contact us.

"This incident occurred during the middle of the day in a busy area of town and a number of people will have witnessed it.

"Officers from the Neighbourhood Policing Team will be carrying out increased patrols in the area to offer reassurance to the local community and can be approached with any concerns."
