# Witness appeal following indecent exposure in Weymouth

18 May 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an indecent exposure incident in Weymouth.

At around 7.39am yesterday, Wednesday 17 May 2017, a local teenage girl was walking along Norfolk Road, between the junctions of Sussex Road and Devon Road, when she was approached by a boy who indecently exposed himself and then walked away.

The offender is described as aged between 13 and 14 years old, possibly of Asian decent, was wearing a school uniform and carrying a rucksack. He walked down Radipole Lane toward Chickerell Road.

Police Constable Rory Swinden, of Weymouth police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed this incident, or who saw a boy matching the description to please contact us."

Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team will be carrying out high-visibility patrols in the coming days to offer reassurance to the community.
