# Force successful in its bid to arm more frontline officers with Tasers

05 March 2020

* * *

Dorset Police has welcomed the news that the Force has been successful in its bid to equip more frontline officers with Tasers.

In February the Office of the Police & Crime Commissioner submitted a bid to the Home Office for additional funding and it has been announced that Dorset Police will be able to provide Tasers and training to all frontline officers, from police constables to inspectors. This equates to an additional 315 Tasers.

This means that every applicable officer who voluntarily wishes to carry Taser and is assessed as suitable will be offered the chance to attend a week-long training course.

A training schedule will now be implemented and it is hoped that this will be completed within 18 to 24 months.

Chief Constable James Vaughan said: "I know first-hand the devastating effect assaults on our officers has on the individuals involved, their families and colleagues.

"The safety of our officers is paramount and we are determined to ensure we equip our frontline officers with the necessary equipment to protect themselves and the public from any dangers they may face. I am delighted with the success of this bid."

Police & Crime Commissioner Martyn Underhill said: "The protection and safety of police officers is one of my main priorities and so I have been working closely with the Chief Constable on this bid.

"It is important that the decision of whether or not to carry a Taser is still one to be made by individual officers, but this successful bid means training will be available to any officer who wants it and is assessed as suitable."

Dorset Police Federation Chair Anna Harvey said: "I am delighted that the Force has been successful to this extent. The ability for every frontline officer to have the opportunity to have access to a Taser will no doubt provide better protection against violent offenders and keep officers safe.

"The impact of police assaults cannot be underestimated, and therefore this extra piece of officer safety equipment will give officers more options when faced with non-compliant individuals."
