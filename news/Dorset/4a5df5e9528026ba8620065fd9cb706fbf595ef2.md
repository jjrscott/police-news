# Witness appeal following fatal road traffic collision near Bridport

14 May 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a fatal road traffic collision near Bridport.

At 5.36pm today, Sunday 14 May 2017, emergency services were called to a four vehicle serious injury collision on the A35 Charmouth bypass.

The vehicles involved were a black BMW estate car, a silver Volvo estate car, a blue Peugeot Allure and a blue Honda CR-V.

Sadly the driver of the BMW, a 68-year-old woman from the Sussex area, was pronounced dead at the scene. Her next of kin have been informed and the coroner has been notified.

The driver of the Volvo sustained minor injuries and was taken to Dorset County Hospital.

The driver of the Peugeot was taken to Dorset County Hospital. A female passenger and five teenagers also travelling in the car, all from the Hampshire area, were uninjured.

The driver of the Honda and a passenger - both from the Bournemouth area - were checked over by paramedics at the scene but did not sustain any injuries.

The road has been closed at the Charmouth roundabout and the slip road on the east side of the A35 while emergency services deal with the incident.

Police Constable Fern Graham, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or the manner of driving of any of the vehicles leading up to the collision to please come forward.

"We would like to thank motorists for their patience during the road closures which have been necessary to allow officers to examine the scene and for paramedics to care for those people involved."
