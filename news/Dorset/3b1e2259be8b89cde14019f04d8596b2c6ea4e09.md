# Street robbery in Bournemouth â€“ witness appeal

09 August 2016

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses after a man was robbed in a Bournemouth street.

The incident happened at 9pm yesterday, Monday 8 August 2016, as the victim was walking along Oswald Road in the Ensbury park area of the town.

The victim, a local man aged in his 50s, was approached from behind by two masked men and hit over the head and hand with a piece of wood as one of the men attempted to grab a bag containing a laptop.

The victim fell to the floor and the offenders made off with the bag and laptop toward Wimborne Road.

Paramedics attended to treat the man, who did not require hospital treatment but sustained swelling to the back of his head.

The first offender has been described as black and was wearing a grey hooded top and black trousers. His accomplice is described as black and was wearing a light coloured top with cream and burgundy sleeves, black trousers and was carrying a satchel diagonally across his chest. They were both wearing face masks.

Detective Sergeant Ian Allen, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was an unprovoked attack on a man as he walked home.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or who saw two men matching the descriptions given in the area at the relevant time to please contact Dorset Police."
