# Four Dorset men charged with drug supply offences

10 January 2017

* * *

Four Dorset men have been charged with Class A drug supply offences following an operation led by officers from the South West Organised Crime Unit Zephyr.

Two men, aged 26 and 27 from Bournemouth, and two men, aged 36 and 38 from Shaftesbury, were arrested by Zephyr detectives, assisted by officers from Dorset, in the early hours of Tuesday 20 December 2016.

In addition, two women, aged 31 and 40, were arrested on the same day at their home addresses in Runcorn in Cheshire.

Expensive luxury items and vehicles were seized by police following the arrests.

The arrests were made following a police investigation into the alleged supply of cocaine and heroin in Bournemouth and Shaftesbury.

Five of those arrested have been charged with conspiracy to supply Class A drugs. They are due to appear before Bournemouth Magistrates' Court on Thursday 12 January 2017.

A 31-year-old woman also from Runcorn has been released on police bail pending further enquiries until Tuesday 31 January 2017.
