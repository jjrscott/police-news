# Witness appeal after Bournemouth street robbery

20 July 2016

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward after a street robbery in Bournemouth.

The incident happened at around 11.30pm on Tuesday 19 July 2016 along Holdenhurst Road.

The victim, a 28-year-old Wimborne woman, was sitting in her car that was stationary when a man knocked on her window.

She opened the car door and the man threatened her with a needle and demanded that she handed over her handbag.

The offender then snatched the victim's black leather Fiorellli handbag and made off in the direction of Boscombe.

The victim was not physically injured.

The bag contained a purse with cash and bank cards.

The offender is described as white, aged in his late thirties with light brown hair and pony tail. He was wearing a light blue denim shirt.

Detective Constable Jane Millard, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was a terrifying ordeal for the victim and I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident to come forward.

"It is possible the offender discarded the handbag in the nearby vicinity so I would ask that anyone who spots such an item does not touch it, but reports it to police immediately."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 19:552.
