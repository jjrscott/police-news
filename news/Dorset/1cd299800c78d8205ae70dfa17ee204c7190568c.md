# Witness appeal following alleged assault in Weymouth

21 March 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating an alleged assault on a man in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

Sometime after 2.30pm on Sunday 7 January 2018 it is reported that a serious assault occurred in Carlton Road North when a local man aged in his 30s was allegedly shot in the face with what is believed to be an air weapon.

The pellet penetrated the tear duct of the victim's right eye and lodged itself directly behind the eyeball. He is expected to undergo a series of surgical procedures but has been warned he may never regain his sight.

It is reported that shortly before the incident the victim was involved in an altercation with a group of approximately five men in Carlton Road North and a number of pellets were fired and bounced off nearby cars.

The matter was only reported to Dorset Police on Tuesday 13 March 2018. Yesterday, Tuesday 20 March 2018, officers carried out an arrest warrant at an address in Carlton Road North in Weymouth in connection with the assault.

A local 19-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. A 23-year-old local man has been arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm. They have both been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Detective Constable Gerald Marchant, of Weymouth CID, said: "The victim has sustained life-changing injuries and, while I appreciate that this incident occurred over two months ago, we have an obligation to investigate all lines of enquiry. I would urge anyone who recalls witnessing the incident to please make contact with Dorset Police.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who has any knowledge of the incident. You may have heard someone talking about it or seen some posts on social media - if so please come forward and assist my investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk, or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180038012. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
