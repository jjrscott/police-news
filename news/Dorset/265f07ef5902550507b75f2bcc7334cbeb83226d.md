# Witness appeal following sexual assault in Bournemouth

29 September 2017

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a sexual assault in Bournemouth.

At around 12.30am on Sunday 24 September 2017 the victim, a woman aged in her 30s, was walking across the suspension bridge between Beaulieu Road and West Overcliff Drive at Alum Chine when she was grabbed from behind by an unknown man.

The victim then ran back to a friend's house in Beaulieu Road. She did not sustain any injuries as a result of the incident.

The man is described as light skinned with short dark, possibly brown, hair.

Detective Inspector Neil Wright, of Dorset Police, said: "I am appealing for any witnesses to this incident, or anyone who saw or heard anything out of the ordinary in the area at the time, to please contact police.

"While sexual assaults by strangers are extremely rare in Dorset, we would always urge people to be vigilant when walking home at night, keep to well-lit roads and ensure somebody knows where you are at all times.

"Following this incident local officers from the Neighbourhood Policing Team have been increasing patrols in the area to provide community reassurance and can be approached with any concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170148832. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
