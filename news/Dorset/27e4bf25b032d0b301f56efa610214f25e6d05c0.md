# Update â€“ man due in court in connection with fatal collision near Dorchester

14 August 2018

* * *

A man is due to appear at court in connection with a fatal road traffic collision near Dorchester.

At around 6.25am on Monday 16 October 2017 a road traffic collision occurred on the A352 at Whitcombe.

The collision involved a red Honda Civic and a silver Peugeot 206.

The passenger of the Honda - named by her family as 43-year-old Hannah Richardson from Stratton near Dorchester - was taken to Dorset County Hospital with life-threatening injuries. Very sadly, she died at hospital later that morning.

Her husband Stuart, aged 43 and who was driving the Honda, was also taken to Dorset County Hospital for treatment to serious injuries, as was the driver of the Peugeot.

A 24-year-old man from the Dorchester area has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Monday 20 August 2018 for an offence of causing death by careless driving.
