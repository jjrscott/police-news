# Update – appeal after reported distraction burglary in Dorchester

07 November 2017

* * *

A woman arrested in connection with a distraction burglary in Dorchester has been released without charge.

The victim, aged in her 80s, was at home at her address in The Grove when it was reported that she was visited by a woman she assumed to be the relief warden at around 12.15pm on Thursday 3 August 2017.

The woman allegedly walked past the victim into the front room and left the property when the victim's carer arrived. The victim later discovered £45 had been taken from her purse.

A 52-year-old Dorchester woman was arrested on suspicion of burglary and has now been released without charge.
