# Witness appeal after reported assault in Poole

26 July 2016

* * *

Police are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward after a reported assault in Poole - with one man being arrested.

David Waters, 34 and of Poole, had been socialising in the Red Lion pub on Saturday 11 June 2016 during the England versus Russia football match at Euro 2016. He left the pub at around 12.30am on Sunday 12 June 2016 and was reportedly subjected to an assault by two men.

He was left unconscious in the doctor's surgery car park next door to the pub.

David was taken to Poole Hospital for treatment to a bleed on the brain and fracture to the skull. He spent four days in hospital.

David, who works as a welder, has not been able to work since.

He said: "It has been a very difficult few weeks since the incident. I have had to be signed off work, which is tough for anyone, but what really upset me was not being able to see my son while I was being treated in hospital.

"Luckily, I have a very supportive family who have been helping me to cope following the ordeal.

"I would ask that anyone who did see the incident to please contact police."

Detective Constable Nicky McGhee, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or has any information that could assist with my investigation to contact me."

A 21-year-old man from Poole has been arrested on suspicion of assault and affray and is currently on police bail until the middle of August 2016 pending further enquiries.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55160088745. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
