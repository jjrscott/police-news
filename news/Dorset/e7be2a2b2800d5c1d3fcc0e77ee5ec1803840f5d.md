A man has appeared in court in connection with a collision involving a car and an ambulance in Christchurch.

The collision occurred at around 2.35pm on Wednesday 20 February 2019 on Fairmile Road at the junction of Clarendon Road. The car involved was a Volkswagen Golf.

The driver of the Golf sustained minor injuries and was treated at the scene. Two paramedics from the ambulance were taken to Poole Hospital as a precaution.

A 32-year-old man from Lymington in Hampshire was arrested and issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 14 June 2019 for offences of failing to stop a mechanically propelled vehicle when required by a constable or traffic warden, using a motor vehicle on a road without valid insurance, dangerous driving, driving a motor vehicle with a proportion of a specified controlled drug above the specified limit and driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence.

He is next due to appear at Bournemouth Crown Court on Thursday 18 July 2019.
