# Scam alert as fake police target elderly for cash

08 February 2018

* * *

**Dorset Police is alerting elderly and vulnerable people of a scam in which fraudsters pose as police officers by telephone in an attempt to steal money.**

Since yesterday, seven incidents have been reported to the Force, all within the Sherborne area, in which an ‘officer’ has called to make them aware of a fraudulent use of their bank card. The fake officer has asked for further information about the victim’s bank account and has threatened the victim with arrest if they express reluctance.

Fortunately in all cases, each victim ended the call before any personal information was shared. Inspector Neil Wright, of the Priority and Volume Crime Team, is urging everyone to hang up on any suspicious call: “We won’t ever ask for personal information over the phone and neither will your bank. Some victims have been pressurised with the threat of arrest if they don’t give the caller the information they’re being asked for and that’s certainly not something a police officer would say.

“I’d also urge family, carers and friends of elderly and vulnerable people to make them aware of this scam and make sure they know to hang up the call.”

To report a crime in progress, call 999 or for all non-urgent enquiries, call 101 or use the Do It Online service available on our website at dorset.police.uk/do-it-online
