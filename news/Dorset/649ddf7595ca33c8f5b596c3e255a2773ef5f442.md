# Witness appeal following reported burglaries in North Dorset

25 January 2017

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following reported burglaries in North Dorset.

It is reported that the first incident happened at around 2.55am on Saturday 21 January 2017 at WHSmith on High Street in Shaftesbury when a black Ford Focus estate was driven into the front door of the building forcing the doors to open.

It is alleged that a man then entered the shop and stole in excess of Â£400 from the tills and a charity box.

The second incident was an attempt burglary reported to have taken place sometime between 11.40pm and 11.55pm on Saturday 21 January 2017 at WHSmith on Cheap Street in Sherborne where it is alleged a man tried to force open the doors of the shop using a bent strip of metal. Nothing was stolen.

The offender was reported to have left the scene in a black Ford Focus estate.

Detective Constable Andy Marsh, of Weymouth CID, said: "Both of these incidents would have made a significant amount of noise and I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the time and saw or heard anything suspicious to please get in touch.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who witnessed a black Ford Focus estate vehicle acting suspiciously in either Shaftesbury or Sherborne at the time of the offences.

"I would ask that the public remain vigilant and report anything suspicious to the police."

A 33-year-old man and a 28-year-old woman - both from Weston-super-Mare - have been arrested on suspicion of burglary and are currently on police bail pending further enquiries.
