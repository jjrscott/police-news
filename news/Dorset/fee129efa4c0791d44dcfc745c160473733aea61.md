A man has been arrested in connection with a reported assault in Weymouth.

At 9.20pm on Thursday 20 August 2020 officers were called to reports of a large group of teenagers gathered in the area of Sandsfoot Castle off Old Castle Road.

Officers attended and were speaking to a man at the scene when someone reportedly came up behind and hit him over the head with a bottle, causing a cut to his head, before they made off from the scene. The victim was taken to hospital for treatment.

A 17-year-old local boy was arrested at the scene on suspicion of a public order offence and was released under investigation.

Following further enquiries, an 18-year-old Weymouth man has been arrested on suspicion of assault and has also been released under investigation.
