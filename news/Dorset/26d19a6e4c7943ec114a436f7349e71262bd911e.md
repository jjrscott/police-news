Officers in Dorchester are issuing advice to members of the public after a series of bike thefts in Dorchester.

At least 10 bicycles have been reported stolen in the town in the last three weeks.

Areas where the bikes have been taken from include around the Dorchester Sports Centre in Coburg Road, the Thomas Hardye School and Dorset County Hospital.

Officers are appealing for information from the public in relation to the thefts and are also urging cyclists to make sure their bikes are left secure.

Police Community Support Officer Matt Barton, of Dorchester police, said: "We have seen a number of bike thefts in the town in recent weeks and I would ask that anyone who has any information about these contacts us immediately.

"I would also like to take this opportunity to advise cyclists to make sure they take proper security measures, such as using a good quality bike lock, to ensure their bike is not an easy target for thieves."

Officers hold regular bike marking events in the town, which are advertised on the Dorchester Neighbourhood Policing Team Facebook page.
