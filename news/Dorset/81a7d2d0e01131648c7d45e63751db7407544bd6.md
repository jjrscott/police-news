# Witness appeal following linked aggravated burglaries in Bournemouth

28 February 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for anyone with information to come forward following three linked aggravated burglaries in Bournemouth.

At around 3.55am today, Thursday 28 February 2018, Dorset Police received a report of an aggravated burglary in Richmond Park Road.

A number of men had forced entry to a caravan that was parked outside a property and stole mobile phones from two victims who were sleeping inside, a man aged in his 30s and a woman aged in her 20s. All of the men were said to be carrying some kind of weapon, such as a crowbar or a hammer. Neither of the victims sustained any injuries.

It was reported that around six men then smashed a glass door to gain entry to a nearby flat and carried out a search of the premises while the occupants, a man aged in his 30s and a 19-year-old man, were inside.

They again took the victims' mobile phones and stole a quantity of cash. The 19-year-old man was struck with the metal crowbar to the lower back during the incident but did not require hospital treatment.

It was also reported that the men carried out a search of the flat above and the occupant, a man aged in his 50s, was assaulted but he did not sustain any injuries that required hospital treatment.

Detective Sergeant Andy Haworth, of Bournemouth CID, said: "Our investigation into these incidents is ongoing, we have been carrying out house-to-house enquiries and examining any possible CCTV footage in the area.

"I am now appealing to any witnesses or anyone with any information that can assist out investigation to contact Dorset Police.

"We believe the addresses may have been specifically targeted and I would like to reassure the community that we are making every effort to locate the offenders involved."
