# Witness appeal following fatal collision at Ashley Heath

07 January 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses following a fatal collision at Ashley Heath.

Dorset Police was called at 3.35pm on Saturday 5 January 2019 to reports of a two-vehicle collision on Horton Road involving a white Volvo V60 and a blue Citroen C4.

The driver of the Volvo - a 78-year-old woman from Southampton - was taken to Southampton General Hospital for treatment, but she very sadly died later that evening. Her family have been informed.

The four occupants of the Citroen were taken to the hospital as a precaution but have since been discharged.

Police Sergeant Lee Savage, of the traffic unit, said: "My thoughts are with the woman's family at this difficult time.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or the events leading up to it and have not yet spoken to officers to please come forward. I would also ask anyone with relevant dashcam footage to contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190002439. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
