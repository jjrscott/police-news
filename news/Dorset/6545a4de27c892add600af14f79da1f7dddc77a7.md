# Renewed appeal following alleged assault in Wimborne

27 January 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating an alleged assault in Wimborne are renewing their appeal for witnesses - with one person being arrested.

The incident is reported to have happened sometime between 11.30pm and midnight on Saturday 21 January 2017 after the victim - a local man aged in his 40s - had left the Cricketers Arms on Park Lane. He walked on his own toward Crown Mead when he was approached by a group of people aged in their late teens near to the steps for Wimborne Library.

It is alleged that one of the group pushed the victim from behind and kicked him in the chest, causing him to fall over and hit his head on the ground.

The victim began to feel unwell on Sunday evening, 22 January, and attended hospital where he was found to have a fractured skull and bleed on the brain. The incident was reported to the police on Monday 23 January.

A teenage boy - now aged 16 - arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm has been released on police bail until mid-February 2017 pending further enquiries.

Detective Constable Laura McQueen, of Bournemouth CID, said: "Following a number of enquiries I am now keen to trace two men who may have assisted in helping the victim get home.

"I would also like to speak to a couple who walked through Crown Mead past the group of teenagers and may have had interaction with a boy in a red jacket.

"Anyone else who may have seen what happened or has any other information that could help with the investigation should contact police or Crimestoppers anonymously."
