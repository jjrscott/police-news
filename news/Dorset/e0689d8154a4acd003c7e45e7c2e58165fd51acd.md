Detectives are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following a report of a rape in Dorchester.

At 6.07am on Sunday 18 November 2018 Dorset Police received a report that a woman aged in her 20s had been raped.

The incident was reported to have occurred at around 5.10am in Grey School Passage.

The victim is being supported by specially-trained officers. A cordon was put in place at the scene as part of this investigation, which has since been lifted.

A 22-year-old Weymouth man was arrested on suspicion of rape. He was released under investigation pending further enquiries.

It is understood that the man and woman were known to each other.

Detective Sergeant Rhys Griffiths, of Weymouth CID, said: "We would like to reassure the public that a full investigation is underway to establish the circumstances around the incident. Enquiries are ongoing to see if there is any CCTV in the area that could assist with the investigation.

"If you were in the area of High West Street or Trinity Street around the time of the incident and saw or heard anything that may assist I would ask that you contact Dorset Police.

"Our local officers from the neighbourhood policing team can be approached with any community concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180186103. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
