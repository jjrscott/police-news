# Update â€“ public appeal following death of a man in Shaftesbury

08 March 2018

* * *

Two men arrested in connection with the death of a man in Shaftesbury have been released without charge.

On Tuesday 17 October 2017 the ambulance service was called to an address in Lane Side following reports that a local man had suffered a cardiac arrest.

Sadly the 46-year-old man died on Wednesday 25 October 2017.

Following enquiries by detectives, a 39-year-old Shaftesbury man was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, supplying a controlled class A drug and administering a poison with intent to endanger life/inflict grievous bodily harm.

A 38-year-old man, also from Shaftesbury, was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of a class A drug and perverting the course of justice.

They have both now been released without charge.

Detectives are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.
