Officers investigating a reported criminal damage incident in Bournemouth say a man has come forward.

At 6am on Sunday 2 June 2019 it is alleged a fence and electrical box were damaged at an address in Hankinson Road by an unknown man.

A CCTV appeal was issued earlier this month.

A 43-year-old local man has now contacted officers and is helping with enquiries. No arrests have been made.
