# Update â€“ man released without charge following reported serious assault in Bournemouth

19 July 2018

* * *

A man who had been arrested in connection with an alleged serious assault in Bournemouth has been released without charge.

Dorset Police received a report that at around 1.30pm on Friday 16 March 2018 an altercation involving two men occurred near to the junction of Denmark Road and Castle Road.

During the incident the arm of the alleged victim, 46-year-old local man, was impaled on the spike of a gate.
 The man freed himself and sought help from a nearby doctor's surgery. He was taken to hospital for treatment to an artery injury, which required him to undergo surgery.

A 27-year-old Bournemouth man was arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm but has now been released without charge.

Detectives are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.
