# Update â€“ CCTV witness appeal after death of man in Poole

08 January 2018

* * *

A man has come forward following an appeal for a potential witness in relation to an investigation into a man's death in Poole.

Dorset Police received a call at 2.53pm on Tuesday 26 December 2017 by the ambulance service to reports of a concern for welfare of a man in Ringwood Road in the car park of Tesco Express.

The 73-year-old man was discovered near to a parked vehicle - a white Peugeot van. Sadly, the man was pronounced dead at the scene.

At this stage the death is not being treated as suspicious, however, an investigation into the circumstances is underway.

The coroner has been notified and the man's next of kin has been informed.

An appeal was issued in a bid to trace the original informant who liaised with Tesco staff prior to the arrival of the emergency services.

The man has now come forward and given an account to police. Officers would like to thank him for responding to the appeal.
