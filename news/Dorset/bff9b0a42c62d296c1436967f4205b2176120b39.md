# Witness appeal following burglary in Weymouth

29 January 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a burglary in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Sometime between 3.15pm on Friday 25 January and 8am on Saturday 26 January 2019 a break-in occurred at a commercial yard in Lynch Lane.

Entry was forced to a container, with a ground breaker tool and ground cutter tool stolen from inside.

The ground breaking tool was a Wacker BH55 model and the cutting tool a Stihl TS410 model.

Police Constable Don Duchscherer, of Weymouth police, said: "We are carrying out a number of enquiries into this burglary, which we believe was targeted as the tools taken from the container were the most expensive on site.

"I am appealing for anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the Lynch Lane area on the night of Friday 25 January 2019 or who has come across tools matching the descriptions given to contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190013364. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
