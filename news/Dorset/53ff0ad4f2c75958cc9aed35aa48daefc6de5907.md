# Witness appeal following attempted theft of cash machine in Christchurch

16 October 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating the attempted theft of a cash machine from a shop in Walkford are appealing for the public's help to find the offenders.

At around 2.45am today, Monday 16 October 2017, a number of offenders broke into Walkford Stores on Ringwood Road.

They used a dark-coloured Toyota pick-up truck to pull out a cash machine but this was unsuccessful and they left the scene in the truck heading in the direction of the A35. The truck was found abandoned nearby and subsequent enquiries have revealed that it had been stolen.

A full search of the area was carried out, assisted by the NPAS helicopter, but no suspects were located.

A full investigation is underway.

Detective Constable Andrew Burley, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the Walkford area in the early hours of this morning and either witnessed the incident or saw a pick-up truck being abandoned to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 55170161444\. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
