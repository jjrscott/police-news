Officers investigating a commercial burglary on Portland are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

A break-in occurred at a building on the Atlantic Academy Portland site on Lerret Road between 6pm on Thursday 10 December and 8.45am on Friday 11 December 2020.

The building is currently unoccupied and is due to be redeveloped. A number of fire extinguishers had been let off and keys and other items stolen. The locks are being changed following the break-in.

Officers have attended the scene and are carrying out enquiries to establish who is responsible.

Police Constable Mike Rumsby, of Weymouth police, said: "I would ask anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area on the night of Thursday 10 December 2020 to please contact us.

"I would also urge anyone who was driving in the area and has dashcam fitted to their vehicle, or residents with home CCTV, to check their footage for anything relevant that night."
