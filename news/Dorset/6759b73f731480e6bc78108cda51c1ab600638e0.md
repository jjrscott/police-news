# Witness appeal following robbery in Bournemouth park

19 November 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a robbery in a Bournemouth park are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The victim, a man aged in his 60s, was walking through Kings Park near to the cricket pavilion at around 6.45pm on Thursday 14 November 2019 when he noticed a group of around six people, believed to be aged in their late teens. Moments later he felt a blow to his back and was knocked to the ground before being kicked to the body and head.

The group demanded money and made off with a black A4 sized folder containing documents that the victim had been carrying.

The victim sustained grazes and bruises but did not require hospital treatment.

Police Constable James Magnin, of Dorset Police, said: "This was an unprovoked violent offence and we are determined to identify those responsible.

"We are carrying out a number of enquiries and I would appeal to anyone who witnessed the incident, or who has any information that can assist our investigation, to please contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190180135. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
