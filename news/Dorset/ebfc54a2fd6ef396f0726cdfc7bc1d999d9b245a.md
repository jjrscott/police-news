Officers are appealing for information following the theft of a rare oven in Shaftesbury.

The incident happened sometime between Friday 15 and Saturday 16 February 2019 from a caravan in Compton Abbas.

"I am releasing images of the stove and would ask anyone with information about it or who has seen it for sale somewhere to please contact Dorset Police."
