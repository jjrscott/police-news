# Witness appeal following report of rape on Portland

03 September 2019

* * *

Detectives investigating a report of a rape of an 11-year-old girl on Portland are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

It was reported that the victim was with her 14-year-old friend when she met the male suspect, who was on a bicycle in the area of Easton Square at around 3am on Saturday 31 August 2019.

The three of them then walked onto Park Road, past the Tesco supermarket and down a track to an old stone windmill next to the stone quarries to the south of Easton, where the offence is alleged to have occurred.

A full investigation has been launched by detectives and they are carrying out a number of enquiries into the incident.

An 18-year-old local man has been arrested on suspicion of rape and has been released on police bail pending further enquiries.

Detective Inspector Wayne Seymour, of Dorset Police, said: "As part of our ongoing investigation, I am keen to hear from anyone who saw two girls with a male cyclist in the Easton area in the early hours of Saturday 31 August 2019.

"We understand that this incident will have caused concern from the local community, but I would like to reassure members of the public that we are carrying out an extensive investigation in relation to this report.

"The victim is being supported by specially-trained officers and residents may see increased police activity in the area as this matter is being investigated. Local officers can be approached by members of the public with any concerns.

"Finally, I would urge members of the public to refrain from speculation in relation to this incident, particularly on social media, as it could impact the ongoing investigation."
