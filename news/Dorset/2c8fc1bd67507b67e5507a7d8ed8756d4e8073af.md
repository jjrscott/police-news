# Safety measures introduced at Durdle Door following major incident

05 June 2020

* * *

Representatives from Dorset Council, Dorset Police, Lulworth Estate and South West Ambulance Trust met on Friday 5 June 2020 to agree a joined up approach in managing visitor numbers to Lulworth Cove and Durdle Door beaches ahead of the weekend.

Following the huge numbers of visitors who flocked to this area last weekend, authorities are keen to reassure local people that steps have been taken to avoid a repeat of the scenes we saw.

Some of the measures agreed by partners include a new pre-booking system for the Lulworth Estate car parks. This is due to go live next week so in the meantime the estate will be monitoring arrivals and limiting the overall number of visitors to both Durdle Door and Lulworth Cove.

There will also be other traffic management measures introduced, an increase in marshalling and civil enforcement officers who will be issuing fines to people who park illegally on the roads. Marshalls will be on site to warn people of the dangers of tombstoning and to encourage visitors to take their litter home.

All partners will monitor the situation this weekend and will review if necessary next week. All continue to ask for visitors to respect our communities.
