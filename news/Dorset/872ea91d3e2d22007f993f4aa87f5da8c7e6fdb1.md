Officers investigating a report of a public order incident in Weymouth are issuing an appeal for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police received a report at 8.47pm on Thursday 29 August 2019 of a disturbance in St Mary Street, near to the Black Dog pub, involving a group of teenagers allegedly assaulting an elderly couple.

The couple walked off from the group prior to officers arriving. Officers attended and three people were arrested in connection with the incident as well as reported assaults on officers as they were detained.

A 17-year-old girl from Weymouth has been arrested on suspicion of a public order offence and assaulting an emergency worker. She is assisting officers with their enquiries.

A 16-year-old local girl was arrested on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker and a 17-year-old Portland girl was arrested on suspicion of obstructing or resisting a constable in the execution of their duty and assault of an emergency worker. Both have been released under investigation.

Police Constable Andy Mitchell, of Weymouth police, said: "We are continuing to investigate this incident and are yet to identify the elderly couple who were allegedly assaulted.

"I would urge the couple involved in this incident, or any witnesses, to contact us."
