# One man arrested following CCTV appeal after alleged robbery in Bournemouth

26 September 2016

* * *

One man has been arrested following a CCTV appeal after an alleged knifepoint robbery on a taxi driver in Bournemouth.

The victim - a local man aged in his 50s - picked up two men and a woman in his taxi outside Bournemouth train station at around 12.10am on Tuesday 20 September 2016.

As they travelled along Wimborne Road the woman asked the driver to go down Lawford Road and pull over.

It was reported that all three left the taxi and began to walk off, before the two men returned and demanded money from the taxi driver and threatened him with a knife.

The victim was not physically injured in the incident.

A 32-year-old Bournemouth man has been arrested on suspicion of robbery and is currently assisting officers with enquiries.
