# Witness appeal following injury collision in Wimborne

15 December 2018

* * *

Officers investigating an injury collision in Wimborne in the early hours of this morning are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At 1.53am today, Saturday 15 December 2018, a single-vehicle collision was reported to Dorset Police involving a blue Ford Focus that had left Leigh Road, was in collision with two lamp posts and landed on its roof.

The driver of the car - a local man aged in his 20s - sustained a fractured pelvis and has been taken to hospital for treatment.

The incident was reported by officers who had travelled past the vehicle in the opposite direction to attend an unconnected 999 emergency call. As is mandatory, the matter has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).

Leigh Road was closed between Wimborne Road West and Hayes Lane while collision investigators examined the scene. This has now concluded but the road remains closed while the lamp post is made safe.

Chief Inspector Rob Chalkley, of Dorset Police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in Leigh Road at the relevant time and either witnessed the collision or saw the Focus being driven in the area prior to the incident to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who may have captured the movements of the Focus on dash cam."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 15:50. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
