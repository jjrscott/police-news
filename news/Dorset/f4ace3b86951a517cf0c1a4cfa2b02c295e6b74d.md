# Renewed appeal following fatal collision in Charmouth

25 January 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a reported fail-to-stop collision in Charmouth are renewing their appeal for motorists and pedestrians to come forward.

Officers were called at 7.11pm on Thursday 23 January 2020 by the ambulance service to reports of a collision involving a pedestrian and a car at the junction of The Street and Lower Sea Lane. It was reported that the driver of the car failed to stop at the scene.

Very sadly the pedestrian - a local 90-year-old man -died at the scene.

A local man aged in his 40s was arrested on suspicion of causing death by careless driving, failing to stop at the scene of an accident and failing to report an accident. He has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Police Sergeant Nikki Burt, of the traffic unit, said: "Our investigation into this collision remains ongoing. I am aware that there were a number of vehicles and pedestrians in the area at the time and I would urge them to contact me as they may have important information to assist with our enquiries.

"I am also renewing my appeal for any motorists who were travelling along that road at the relevant time and may have captured the incident on dashcam to please check their footage."
