# Witness appeal following fatal collision in Upton

16 October 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a fatal road traffic collision in Upton are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

At 9.34am on Monday 14 October 2019 Dorset Police received a report of a two vehicle collision on Dorchester Road. The collision involved a silver Vauxhall Astra and an Iveco flatbed scaffolding lorry.

Officers attended, along with the ambulance and fire services.

The driver of the Astra, a man aged in his 70s from the Poole area, was taken to hospital where he very sadly died in the afternoon of Tuesday 15 October 2019. The man's family has been informed and is being supported by specially-trained officers.

The passenger of the Astra, a woman aged in her 80s, and the driver of the lorry, a man aged in his 50s, both from the Poole area, were uninjured.

Road closures were put in place to allow the emergency services to respond to the incident and for a detailed examination of the scene to be carried out.

Police Inspector Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "At this difficult time, our thoughts are with the family of the man who died.

"I would urge any witnesses who have not already spoken to police to please contact us. I am particularly keen to speak to the driver of a dark-coloured Ford Fusion that was in the area at the time and may have witnessed the collision.

"I am also appealing to anyone who was travelling in the area at the time of the collision and may have relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

"Finally, I would like to thank members of the public for their patience and understanding while the road closures were in place."
