# Witness appeal following arson in Boscombe

13 January 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating a suspicious fire in Boscombe are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At 11.53pm last night, Friday 12 January 2018, Dorset Police received a report of a fire at a flat in Roumelia Lane.

Officers and firefighters attended and discovered that an unknown offender had forced their way into the vacant flat and set three separate fires inside.

Enquiries are underway to identify the offender and establish the motive.

Detective Sergeant Andy Haworth, of Bournemouth CID, said: "Enquiries have revealed that there were three seats of fire inside the address. Thankfully the fire service extinguished the blaze quickly and no one was injured.

"This incident is being treated very seriously as had the fire spread to adjoining properties people's lives would have been put in immediate and real danger.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident, or who saw suspicious activity in the area of Roumelia Lane at the relevant time, to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would urge residents to remain vigilant to suspicious activity and report any immediate concerns to us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk, or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180006265. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
