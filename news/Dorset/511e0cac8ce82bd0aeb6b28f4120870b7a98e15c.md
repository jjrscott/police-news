08 December 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a robbery in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

It was reported that at around 10.50pm on Saturday 5 December 2020 a group of four teenagers were approached by another male teenager in the area of Cabot Lane, who followed them as they headed toward Creekmoor.

The offender was reported to be in possession of a knife and stole a phone from one of the teenagers.

Officers attended and carried out a search of the area, but the offender was not located.

He was described as white, aged around 17 years old with blue eyes and a blond moustache. He was wearing a balaclava and dark clothing with a hood worn up.

Detective Constable Jo Regan, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We appreciate this must have been a distressing incident for the victims and we are carrying out a number of enquiries to try and identify the person responsible.

"I am appealing for any witnesses, or anyone who has any information that might assist our investigation, to please contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200183280. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
