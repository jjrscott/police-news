# Update â€“ pair due in court in connection with collision in Bournemouth

06 December 2018

* * *

Two men are due to appear in court in connection with a road traffic collision in Bournemouth.

At around 10.10am on Tuesday 15 May 2018 a collision occurred in West Way involving a silver Citroen Saxo that left the road and collided with a tree.

A local man aged in his 20s was airlifted to Southampton General Hospital for treatment to serious injuries. He has since left hospital.

Following the collision, officers issued a CCTV image of a black Vauxhall Astra that was also believed to have been travelling along West Way at the time of the collision.

A 42-year-old Bournemouth man has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Thursday 13 December 2018 for offences of causing serious injury by dangerous driving, drug driving and failing to stop after an accident.

A 23-year-old Bournemouth man has also been issued with a postal requisition to appear at the same court on the same date for offences of dangerous driving, drug driving and possession of a class B drug.
