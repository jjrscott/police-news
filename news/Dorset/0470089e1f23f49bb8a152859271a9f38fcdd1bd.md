Detectives in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses following a street robbery in Bournemouth.

The incident happened at around 10.25pm on Thursday 28 July 2016 along Meyrick Road near to the Queens Hotel.

Detective Constable Leigh Topol, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I would ask that anyone who witnessed the incident or saw anyone acting suspiciously in the area at the time of the offence to contact me.

"We would like to reassure the public that the local Neighbourhood Policing Team has stepped up patrols in the area and can be contacted with any concerns."
