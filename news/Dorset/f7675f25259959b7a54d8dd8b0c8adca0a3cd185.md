# Witness appeal following robbery at Bournemouth newsagent

11 November 2019

* * *

Detectives investigating a robbery where a cashier at a newsagent was sprayed with what was believed to be a CS spray are appealing for witnesses.

The robbery occurred at the Boscombe Gardens Food Centre in Christchurch Road at around 9.15pm on Saturday 9 November 2019.

The offender, whose face was covered, entered the store and sprayed the cashier in the face with a substance from a canister before grabbing the till drawer and making off in the direction of Drummond Road.

Officers attended and carried out a search of the area. The till drawer and a canister of what is believed to be a CS spray were found in Drummond Road.

The cashier was checked over by the ambulance service, but did not require hospital treatment.

The offender is described as white and was wearing a black North Face jacket with green around the chest and shoulders, a green hooded top, black Adidas tracksuit bottoms and black trainers with yellow soles. He was also wearing camouflage gloves, a dark-coloured beanie hat with a white mark on the left side and a black snood pulled up over his mouth and nose.

Detective Constable Neil Causebrook, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This must have been a very frightening ordeal for the cashier and we are carrying out a number of enquiries to identify the man responsible for this robbery.

"I would urge anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area or who has any information that can assist our investigation to please contact us."
