# Witness appeal following serious injury collision in Weymouth

14 July 2017

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a serious injury collision in Weymouth.

At around 5.40pm yesterday, Thursday 13 July 2017, a serious injury road traffic collision occurred at the junction of Preston Beach Road and Bowleaze Coveway involving a pedestrian and a silver Vauxhall Astra.

The pedestrian - a local 89-year-old man - sustained life-threatening injuries and was taken to Dorset County Hospital for treatment. His family have been informed.

The road was closed while emergency services dealt with the incident. It reopened at 9.40pm.

The driver of the car - a 28-year-old man from Weymouth - and his front seat passenger were uninjured.

Police Constable Jay Griffin, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision and has yet to speak to officers to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would like to thank motorists for their patience during the road closure which was necessary to allow us to investigate the incident."
