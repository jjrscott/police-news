# Appeal after two lambs decapitated near Dorchester

02 February 2017

* * *

Police are appealing for information after two lambs were decapitated on farmland to the east of Dorchester.

A headless two-month old lamb was discovered on the morning of Tuesday 31 January 2017.

A second lamb was found decapitated in a similar location the following morning, Wednesday 1 February.

It is believed the animals were beheaded using a sharp blade.

Police Constable Claire Dinsdale, of Dorset Police's Rural Crime Team, said "The type of injury caused to the lambs is not consistent with them being attacked by predators. We believe someone has purposely decapitated these animals.

"This is a shocking but thankfully rare event.

"I would appeal to anyone who has information about the culprits or has seen anything suspicious that could relate to these incidents to please contact Dorset Police or call Crimestoppers anonymously."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170015569. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
