A man arrested in connection with the alleged theft of a bicycle in Wareham has been released from investigation.

At around 4.10pm on Friday 25 August 2017 a black Corrello mountain bike was reportedly stolen from Greens Barn.

The bike was recovered in September 2017 and returned to its owner. A 41-year-old local man was arrested on suspicion of theft and released under investigation. He has now been released from investigation after the owner of the bike withdrew his complaint.
