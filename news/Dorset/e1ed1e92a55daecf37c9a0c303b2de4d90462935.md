# Appeal for information following criminal damage in Weymouth

11 May 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for anyone with information to come forward following criminal damage to a business in Weymouth.

At around 4.20pm on Sunday 3 May 2020 a witness reported seeing a man pressing against the door of Morgan Brown Hair & Beauty in Abbotsbury Road. They told the man to move on but came back moments later to find him still there and had to ask him to move again. The man then left the scene.

The owners subsequently discovered that damage had been caused to the door. No entry had been gained to the premises.

The man seen pressing on the door is described as white, around five feet ten inches tall and of unkempt appearance and was wearing a black beanie hat, denim jacket, black T-shirt, blue jeans and scruffy white trainers.

Police Constable Don Duchscherer, of Weymouth police, said: "We are making enquiries into this matter and I am appealing for anyone with information that might assist our investigation to please contact us.

"I would urge anyone who witnessed the incident or any suspicious activity in the area to get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200062403. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
