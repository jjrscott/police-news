# Witness appeal after handbag snatch in Christchurch

04 August 2016

* * *

Police in Christchurch are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a man snatched a pensioner's handbag in the town.

At around 6.50pm yesterday, Wednesday 3 August 2016, a woman aged in her late 60s was walking in Druitt Gardens between the High Street and the recreation ground when a man approached her from behind.

The offender wrenched the shopping bag from the victim's shoulder.

He stopped nearby, searched through the bag, took the victim's purse containing cash and bank cards before discarding the bag and running away.

The victim, who lives locally, was not physically injured.

The offender has been described as white, aged between 30 and 40 years old, five feet 10 inches tall and of medium build. He was wearing a pale coloured checked short sleeved shirt and knee length shorts.

Police Constable Charley Dunstan, of Christchurch police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who saw this incident or a man matching the description given to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly keen to hear from a woman who spoke to the victim next to Druitt Hall shortly after the incident as I believe she may have important information to assist my investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55160116890. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
