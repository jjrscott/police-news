# Robbery at shop in Dorchester - witness appeal

12 July 2016

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information after a robbery at a Dorchester shop.

The incident happened at around 7.35pm on Monday 11 July 2016 at Shop on the Green, South Walks Road in Fordington.

A man entered the store around an hour earlier, selected a bottle of wine, but stated he forgot his bank card and left the store without the bottle. He returned at around 7.35pm, took sweets to the counter and when the till was opened he pushed the member of staff in the chest and grabbed cash from the till and left.

He got on a blue and white mountain bike with white diagonal stripes outside the shop and cycled toward the town centre.

The offender is described as white, aged in his 30s and of slim build. He was wearing a light blue waterproof jacket and black trousers.

Detective Sergeant Mark Winning, of Weymouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious in the area around the time of the offence.

"I am particularly interested in speaking to anyone who saw a man matching that description riding a bicycle in the area."

Witnesses and anyone with information should call Dorset Police in confidence on 101 quoting incident number 11:386. Alternatively, call the free and anonymous Crimestoppers line on 0800 555 111 where mobile phone tariffs may apply.
