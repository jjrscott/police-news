A man has come forward in connection with a reported assault and public order incident in Christchurch.

A CCTV appeal was issued in relation to the incident, which occurred at around 3pm on Friday 4 September 2020 at Pets Corner on Somerford Road.

It was alleged that a man was verbally abusive and head butted a member of staff.

Following the appeal, a man has come forward and is assisting officers with their investigation. No arrests have been made.

We would like to thank everyone who shared our appeal.
