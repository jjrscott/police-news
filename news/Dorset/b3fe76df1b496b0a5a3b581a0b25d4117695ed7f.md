# Message regarding yesterdayâ€™s London terrorist attack

23 March 2017

* * *

Chief Superintendent Colin Searle, of Dorset Police, said: "Our thoughts are with anyone affected by yesterday's events in London and our condolences are with the families and friends of those who tragically lost their lives, including a serving police officer.

"Public safety is our priority and we have a variety of established operational tactics that are regularly used to ensure that our local communities and businesses are both well prepared and protected.

"Our aim is to reduce the risk to the public and maximise public awareness. As is normal practice, we are in touch with national anti-terrorism coordinators.

"There has been no change to the threat level in the UK. We regularly review intelligence and information and would like to reassure the public that there is no specific threat to Dorset. The public should be alert but not alarmed.

"The advice remains the same - members of the public should always remain alert to the danger of terrorism and report any suspicious activity to police on 999 or the anti-terrorist hotline 0800 789 321."
