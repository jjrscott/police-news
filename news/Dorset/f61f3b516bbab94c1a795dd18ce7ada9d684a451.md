# Appeal for information following fraud incidents in Poole

01 September 2020

* * *

Officers investigating incidents where a man has impersonated a civil enforcement officer in Poole are appealing for information from the public.

Between 8.30pm and 9pm on Thursday 6 August 2020 it was reported that a man put a blue and white out of service sticker on the pay machine in the Baiter Harbourside One car park. The man proceeded to approach members of the public and take money from them for parking.

It is reported that a similar incident occurred on Saturday 8 August 2020 on Beach Road in Poole. A man approached members of the public and told them that the parking app was broken and requested they pay for parking by giving him cash.

The man is described as aged in his late 50s, approximately six feet tall, tanned and of average build with cropped grey hair.

Police Constable Simon Wilcox, of Dorset Police, said: "We are continuing to carry out a number of enquiries into these incidents to try and identify the man.

"While we are not aware of any further incidents at this time, I am asking anyone who has been approached in a similar way and has not yet reported it to please get in touch.

"I would also urge members of the public to be vigilant and only pay for parking using legitimate methods."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200117024. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
