# Witness appeal after robbery on a prison officer in Shaftesbury

12 July 2017

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses after a robbery on a prison officer in Shaftesbury.

The incident happened just after 9pm on Sunday 9 July 2017. The male victim was driving home along Cole's Lane following his shift at Guys Marsh prison, when he pulled over to get his mobile phone out of his car boot so he could call his wife.

Before he could get out of the car, a silver Y-reg Volkswagen Golf stopped in front of him.

A man got out of the vehicle, opened the driver's door and stabbed him in the shoulder with a small sharp object, believed to have been a small knife or key held between fingers.

A second man opened the victim's car boot and stole his guard uniform and collapsible baton.

Both of the offenders then returned to their vehicle and drove away.

The victim was treated for minor cuts and bruises by paramedics, but did not require hospital treatment.

The first offender who was the driver is described as a short, stocky man with a full sleeve right arm tattoo. He had short blond hair, short at sides and longer on the top that was brushed forward slightly. He was wearing a white or very light-coloured T-shirt and dark tracksuit bottoms with a double white stripe down the sides of the legs. The man also had a piercing in his right eyebrow with a hoop.

The second offender is described as a white man, over six feet tall, of slim build with short dark hair.

It is also believed that a third person remained in the car during the incident. This person had shoulder-length dark hair and was possibly a woman.

Detective Sergeant Nicky Jenkins, of Weymouth CID, said: "This was a deeply traumatic incident, which has left the victim badly shaken.

"I would ask that anyone who knows anything about what happened or who witnessed the incident to contact Dorset Police or call Crimestoppers anonymously.

"I would particularly like to speak to two people who may have driven past the incident at the time in a car with an '02' registration plate. I would also ask anyone who has located a uniform or baton or knows of the whereabouts to get in touch."

Specially-trained officers continue to support the victim and detectives continue to carry out a number of other enquiries, such as house-to-house and forensics.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170104527. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
