# Tribute to man who died in collision in Verwood

30 August 2018

* * *

The family of a man who died in a road traffic collision in Ringwood Road in Verwood has issued a tribute.

Their statement reads: "Our son, brother and friend Thomas Benjamin Lenton was tragically taken away from us on the early morning of Saturday 25 August 2018.

"Thomas was only 23 years old and lived life to the full every single day. He will always be remembered for his own personal style and confidence, for being our ray of sunshine with his presence and his very caring nature.

"He has so many friends who have shown him so much love and given the family so much strength to help them through this very sad and difficult time.

"Thomas loved his sport and the gym. He was an avid West Ham United fan, enjoyed a kick about with friends at the local park, golf with friends and was a fan of MotoGP.

"With his outgoing nature, Thomas knew how to have a good time even to the point where family and friends would say it wasn't a party without him. He also loved the simple things in life, like walking Dizzee the family dog around the forest, listening to music new and old and the occasional TV series binge. He loved spending time with his loving niece Skyebear.

"The love he shared with his best friend and soul mate Melt was second to none with their amazing ability to be silly and stupid while keeping the party going.

"There aren't enough words to describe Thomas, he will be forever in our hearts.

"Thomas leaves his mum and best friend Gina, his dad Mark, stepmum Lynsey, his three beautiful sisters Yasmin, Olivia and Magenta and his adorable niece Skye.

"A JustGiving page has been set up in Thomas' memory - https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/thomaslenton"

Thomas' closest friends have also issued a tribute: "Tom. We could take up an entire newspaper by writing tributes about what you have done for us all, or stories about times you have been there for us. From the moment we all met you, to the moment you tragically left us, you have brought so much happiness and laughter to our lives. We will all miss you so much and love you more than you can ever imagine. Sleep easy Tom, and one day we will meet again and get to experience all the happy times again. No one really leaves you when they live in your heart and mind."
