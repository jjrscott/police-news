# Update â€“ men released without charge following report of shots fired in Bournemouth

27 July 2018

* * *

Five men arrested in connection with reported shots fired in Bournemouth have been released without charge.

At 12.30am on Sunday 20 August 2017 Dorset Police received a report that two men attended a property on Wimborne Road and woke the occupants up by throwing stones at the window. When the occupants got up to look, it was then reported that gun shots were fired at a window.

The men were then reported to have left the scene in a car. No one was injured.

Two men aged 25, two men aged 23 and a 24-year-old man, all from the Liverpool area, were arrested on suspicion of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life. One of the 25-year-old men was further arrested on suspicion of threats to kill.

All five men were released under investigation and, following further enquiries by detectives, have now been released without charge.
