# Man charged in relation to report of rape in Bournemouth

01 July 2020

* * *

A man has been charged in connection with a report of rape in Bournemouth town centre.

Dorset Police received a report at 4.37am on Sunday 1 December 2019 that a woman - aged in her 30s - had been raped. The incident was reported to have occurred in the Norwich Road area at around 4am. It is believed the victim had met the offender earlier that night.

A 32-year-old man from Bournemouth has now been charged with rape and is due to appear before Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 11 September 2020.

Detective Constable Tony O'Connell, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We have kept the victim updated throughout the investigation and she continues to be supported by specially-trained officers.

"It is important to stress - as is typical in such circumstances - that it would be entirely inappropriate for Dorset Police to comment any further ahead of the court proceedings. It is vital that the justice system is allowed to follow its course."
