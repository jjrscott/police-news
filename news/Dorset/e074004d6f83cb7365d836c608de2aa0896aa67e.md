# Appeal following theft of items in Christchurch

23 September 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for anyone with information to come forward following the theft of items in Christchurch - with images of the stolen items being released.

It was reported that between the beginning of September and Thursday 19 September 2019 a horse box containing 200 Mudcontrol INB slabs was stolen from an address in the Parley Green area.

Police Community Support Investigator Kate Hann, of Christchurch police, said: "The slabs, which are used for yard flooring, are estimated to be worth around Â£2000.

"It is believed that a vehicle was used to transport the horse box and I am appealing to anyone who may have seen any suspicious activity in the area during the relevant time period to get in touch.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who may have seen the horse box or its contents for sale in unusual circumstances."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190148854. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
