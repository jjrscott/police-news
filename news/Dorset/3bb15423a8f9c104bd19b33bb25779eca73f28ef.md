# Witness appeal following fatal collision near Dorchester

18 November 2016

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses following a fatal collision near Dorchester.

At around 2.46am today, Friday 18 November 2016, a single-vehicle road traffic collision occurred on the A37, two miles from Dorchester.

A blue Peugeot 306 left the road and collided with a hedge.

Sadly the driver of the Peugeot, a 44-year-old local man, died at the scene. His family have been informed and the coroner notified.

The A37 remains closed between The Weirs roundabout and the Charminster junction while collision investigators examine the scene.

Police Sergeant Nikki Burt, of the Alliance Road Policing Team, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or who saw the manner of driving of the Peugeot immediately before the incident to please call Dorset Police.

"I would like to thank motorists for their patience during the road closure which was necessary to allow emergency services to deal with the incident and collision investigators to examine the scene."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 18:29. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
