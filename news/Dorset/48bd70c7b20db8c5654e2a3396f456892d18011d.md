Officers investigating a fail-to-stop collision in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

At approximately 12.30pm on Thursday 23 July 2020 officers attended a collision involving a silver hatchback Proton vehicle and a woman aged in her 20s on Astrid Way at the junction with The Esplanade.

It is reported that the driver was in collision with the pedestrian and then got out of his car. An altercation occurred, before the male driver got back in his vehicle and drove off.

Police Sergeant Richard Barnett, of Weymouth police, said: "Thankfully the victim in this incident did not sustain any injuries.

"An investigation is underway and I would urge anyone who witnessed the incident and has not already spoken to police to please get in touch.

"I am also appealing to any motorists who were travelling in the area and have a dashcam fitted to check it for any relevant footage."
