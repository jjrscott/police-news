# Witness appeal following collision in Bournemouth

02 December 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a collision involving a car and a van in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

Three men are reported to have made off from the scene of the collision, which occurred in Holdenhurst Road near to the Springbourne Fire Station at around 7.10am on Monday 2 December 2019. Another man sustained serious injuries in the collision.

The vehicles involved were a yellow Mercedes Sprinter van and a silver Vauxhall Corsa. It was reported that the three occupants of the van remained at the scene for a short time after the collision before making off in the direction of Kings Park.

Emergency services attended and road closures were put in place as they dealt with the incident. The driver of the Vauxhall, a Bournemouth man aged in his 30s, was taken to hospital for injuries that were believed to be serious but not life threatening.

The road was reopened at around 9.15am.

The van was subsequently reported as having been stolen from an address in Christchurch.

Police Constable Simon Hatch, of the traffic unit, said: "We are continuing to investigate this collision and we of course wish the driver of the Vauxhall a speedy recovery from his injuries.

"I am appealing for anyone who witnessed the collision or the manner of driving of either vehicle prior to it to please contact us.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time and has captured anything relevant on their dashcam.

"It was reported that the three occupants of the van remained at the scene for a period of time following the collision before leaving in the direction of Kings Park so I would urge motorists to check their footage if they were in this area from around 7am to around 7.30am.

"Finally, I would like to thank members of the public for their patience and understanding while the road closures were in place."
