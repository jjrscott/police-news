# Witness appeal following knifepoint robbery in Shaftesbury

14 May 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward after a teenager was robbed at knifepoint in Shaftesbury.

The victim, who is 15 years old, was walking down an alleyway which runs between Lane-Side and Longmead sometime between 4.30pm and 5pm on Friday 11 May 2018 when he heard voices behind him.

A male suspect then put him in a headlock before a second male suspect pulled out a knife and demanded money.

The victim handed over Â£70 in cash and his wallet and was punched to the face by the man who was holding him, before both offenders left the scene, heading in the direction of Wincombe Lane.

The victim was left with a cut to his lip but did not require hospital treatment.

The first offender was described as being aged around 17 to 20 and about five feet seven inches tall with short blond hair. He was wearing a black hooded top, possibly with white writing on it, and dark blue jeans.

The second offender was said to be of a similar age and around five feet eight inches tall with short black hair. He was wearing a black hooded top, dark blue jeans and grey trainers.

Detective Sergeant Simon Austin, of Weymouth CID, said: "This was clearly a very distressing ordeal for the victim and I want to assure members of the community that a detailed investigation is being carried out in order to identify those responsible.

"We have been conducting house-to-house enquiries in the area and exploring CCTV opportunities and I am now appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or who has any information that can assist our investigation to contact police.

"There has been an increased police presence in the area and members of the public can approach officers from the local neighbourhood policing team with any concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180071362. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
