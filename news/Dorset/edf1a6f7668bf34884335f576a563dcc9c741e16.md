# Murder investigation in Bournemouth - renewed appeal

09 July 2018

* * *

Detectives are renewing their appeal for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward after a woman was found dead with stab wounds in Bournemouth.

At 5am on Sunday 8 July 2018 Dorset Police was called by the ambulance service to the area of Richmond Hill to reports that a man had been found with stab wounds to his leg.

Officers attended the location and following a number of enquiries found the body of a 34-year-old woman in a flat at Richmond Gardens. A knife was also recovered from the scene.

Her next of kin are aware and are being supported by specially-trained officers.

The injured man, who is 20 years old and from Bournemouth, has been arrested on suspicion of murder, but was taken to hospital.

It is understood that they were both known to each other.

A full investigation is now underway led by detectives from Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT).

A post-mortem examination is taking place today and formal ID will take place in due course.

Detective Inspector Richard Dixey, of the MCIT, said: "A full and detailed investigation is now underway to establish the circumstances around the woman's death and our thoughts are with her family at this extremely difficult time.

"Following our initial enquiries, the timings that we are focussing on in particular are between 7.30pm on Saturday evening and 5am on Sunday morning in the area of Richmond Hill, Richmond Gardens and Dalkeith Lane steps. We would like anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious or out of the ordinary to get in touch.

"If you have any information that could assist the investigation, please contact Dorset Police urgently.

"The public can expect to see a continued increased police presence in the area and officers from the Neighbourhood Policing Team can be approached with any concerns."

A cordon remains in place at Richmond Gardens while crime scene investigators examine the scene.

Officers are also carrying out house-to-house visits and making CCTV enquiries.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 8:125. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
