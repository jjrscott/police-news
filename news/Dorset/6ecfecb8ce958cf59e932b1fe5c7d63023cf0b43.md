# Witness appeal following burglary in Weymouth

12 June 2018

* * *

Officers investigating a burglary in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 6.20pm on Sunday 3 June 2018 a burglary occurred at an address in Radipole Lane, with the offenders gaining entry through a back door while the victim was in the property.

Two men were seen leaving the property and a neighbour chased them to a nearby alleyway, where the victim's handbag was discovered.

The victim, a woman aged in her 70s, also found a watch and some cash had been taken from her address.

The first man is described as white, aged in his 40s, of slim build and with a large nose. He was wearing a light-coloured cap, a baggy grey hooded top and dark blue or black short trousers.

The second man is described as white, aged in his 30s and of slim build with fair hair. He was wearing a dark-coloured cap, no top, light grey jogging bottoms and trainers.

Police Constable Del Alexander, of Dorset Police, said: "This incident must have been very upsetting for the victim, being targeted in her own home while she was present.

"We have been carrying out a detailed investigation into this incident and I am appealing for any witnesses or anyone who saw any suspicious activity in the area near to East Wyld Road and Granby Close around the time of the offence to contact police.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who has dashcam fitted to their vehicles and was driving along Radipole Lane toward the Wessex roundabout at the relevant time who may have footage of these men."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180084738. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
