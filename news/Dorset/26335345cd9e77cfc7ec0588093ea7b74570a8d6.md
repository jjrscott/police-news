# Update â€“ man due to appear in court in connection with collision in Weymouth

04 February 2021

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with a road traffic collision in Weymouth.

At 8.06pm on Friday 30 October 2020 Dorset Police received a report of a two vehicle collision involving a blue Nissan Juke and a silver Mercedes C220 on the A354 between the Veasta roundabout and the Jurassic roundabout.

The driver of the Nissan - a man aged in his 20s - sustained minor injuries and was taken to hospital as a precaution.

A 42-year-old Weymouth man was arrested in connection with the incident and has now been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Friday 12 February 2021 for offences of dangerous driving and drink driving.
