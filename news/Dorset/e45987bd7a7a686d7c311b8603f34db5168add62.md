# Update â€“ further arrest in connection with reported fail-to-stop injury collision at Hurn

19 May 2020

* * *

A fourth man has been arrested in connection with an investigation into a reported fail-to-stop collision at Hurn near Christchurch.

At around 5.26pm on Friday 15 May 2020 a BMW car travelling along Parley Lane reportedly failed to stop for police.

The officers lost sight of the vehicle and a short time later it was in collision with a red Volkswagen Fox on the roundabout at the junction of the Avon Causeway.

The driver of the Volkswagen - a 22-year-old local woman - sustained a serious head injury and was taken to Poole Hospital for treatment. She has now left hospital.

On the evening of Friday 15 May 2020 three men from Bournemouth - two aged 24 and one aged 22 - were arrested on suspicion of driving offences. They have all been released under investigation.

Following further enquiries, a 23-year-old Christchurch man was arrested on suspicion of driving offences on Monday 18 May 2020. He has also been released under investigation.

The circumstances of this incident require a mandatory referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) due to the police involvement.

Officers are continuing to appeal for any witnesses to the collision or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to contact police.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200068912.
