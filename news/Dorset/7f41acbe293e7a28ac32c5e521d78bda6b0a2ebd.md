# Witness appeal following criminal damage to grave in Poole

26 April 2019

* * *

The mother of two boys whose grave was damaged in Poole is urging those responsible to come forward, hold their hands up and say sorry.

Officers are also appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information about the incident to come forward.

The incident was reported to Dorset Police at 5.41pm on Thursday 25 April 2019 and is believed to have happened in the previous 24 hours. It is also reported that items were stolen from the graveside.

The grave belongs to brothers Harry and Cody Churchill, who died within days of each other in March 2013 aged just three months and 21 months respectively having suffered from the rare skin condition epidermolysis bullosa.

The boy's mother Steph Green said: "I just want my children to be able to rest in peace and they can't do that, it's disgusting. For someone to come along and do that is just awful.

"They suffered enough when they were alive and they should not have to suffer any more.

"All I want is for someone to come forward and hold their hands up and say sorry, I just want answers."

Inspector Phil Swanton, of Dorset Police, said: "This is clearly a despicable and senseless crime and has caused considerable upset to the boys' family.

"We have launched a full investigation to identify those responsible and are carrying out a number of enquiries.

"I would urge anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity or has information as to who committed this offence to contact us.

"I would also urge those responsible to look into their conscience, do the right thing and come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190062377. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
