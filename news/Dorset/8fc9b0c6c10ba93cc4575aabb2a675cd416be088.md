# Alleged serious assault in Bournemouth â€“ witness appeal

04 September 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating an alleged serious assault in Bournemouth are asking witnesses and anyone with information to come forward.

At 5.38am on Saturday 1 September 2018 officers were called to a report that a 19-year-old man had entered the Golden Supermarket in Charminster Road with injuries to his back consistent with stab wounds.

Subsequent enquiries by officers led to allegations that an altercation between two men had taken place near to the store.

A 28-year-old Bournemouth man was arrested on suspicion of assault and possession of an offensive weapon in a public place. He has been released under investigation.

Detective Constable Steven Davis, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We are trying to establish what exactly happened that caused the victim to sustain his injuries, which are thankfully not life-threatening.

"I am appealing for any witnesses to the alleged assault to come forward.

"If anyone has any dashcam footage or private CCTV of the area in relation to the early hours of Saturday, I would also like to hear from them."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180141380. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
