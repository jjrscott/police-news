# Further update â€“ investigation into death of man near Blandford

19 October 2018

* * *

One of two men arrested in connection with the death of a man at a farm near Blandford has been released from under investigation.

At 8.25pm on Friday 28 September 2018 Dorset Police received a report that a 25-year-old local man had sustained serious injuries following an incident at Hanford Farm.

He was later pronounced dead at the scene.

The man was subsequently named as Marcin Tameczka, a Polish national who was living locally. His family are being supported by specially-trained officers.

Two Shaftesbury men, aged 25 and 27, were arrested on suspicion of murder.

The 27-year-old man has now been released from under investigation and will face no further police action.

The 25-year-old man remains on police bail as detectives from Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT) continue their enquiries.
