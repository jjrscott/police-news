# Witness appeal following serious injury collision in Bournemouth

13 July 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a serious injury collision in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

Dorset Police was called at 11.12pm on Sunday 12 July 2020 to a report of a collision involving a black Seat Toledo and a man on roller skates on Richmond Hill.

The man, aged in his 20s and from Bournemouth, was taken to Southampton General Hospital by air ambulance where he remains in a serious condition. His next of kin has been informed.

The driver of the Seat was uninjured.

The road was closed to allow emergency services to treat the injured man and carry out a thorough investigation of the scene. It has since reopened.

Inspector Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the injured man and his family at this time.

"I am appealing to any witnesses or anyone who was driving in the area at the time and may have relevant dashcam footage to please contact us.

"Finally, I would like to thank members of their public for their patience and understanding while the road closures were in place."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 12:557. Alternatively, or alternatively to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
