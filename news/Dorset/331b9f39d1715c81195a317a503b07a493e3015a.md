# Appeal for information following reported hate crime incident in Bridport

15 September 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for anyone with information to come forward following a reported hate crime incident in Bridport.

At 11.40pm on Saturday 5 September 2020 Dorset Police received a report of a fight at the Neon Bar & Grill on East Street.

It is alleged that a man headbutted one person and then attempted to fight with a security guard who was asking him to leave the building.

As the man left the bar, it is reported that he shouted homophobic abuse to a man who was waiting in the queue outside.

A 30-year-old man from the Dorchester area was arrested on suspicion of assault and using racially or religiously aggravated words with the intent of causing harassment, alarm or distress. He has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Police Constable Dan White, of Bridport police, said: "While I appreciate this incident took place over a week ago, I understand there were a number of people outside the bar who may have witnessed what happened.

"I would urge anyone who has not already spoken to police to please get in touch with information that may assist my investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200133682. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
