# Update - girl given youth caution following assault in Weymouth

12 June 2018

* * *

A girl arrested in connection with an assault in Weymouth has been given a youth caution.

At around 9.20pm on Friday 17 November 2017 Dorset Police received a report from the ambulance service that a man had been located in an alleyway between Newstead Road and Holland Road.

The victim - a 29-year-old man - had sustained a serious head injury and was taken to Dorset County Hospital for treatment. He was released from hospital the following day.

It was reported that the same man had been robbed of his rucksack and mobile phone shortly before the assault.

A 17-year-old girl was arrested and has been given a youth caution for assault, which will require her to attend appointments and engage with the Youth Offending Service.

A 15-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of robbery but has been released without charge.

Four other local teenagers - two boys aged 16 and one aged 15 as well as a 19-year-old girl - also attended voluntary police interviews in relation to the offences but no charges have been brought against any of them.
