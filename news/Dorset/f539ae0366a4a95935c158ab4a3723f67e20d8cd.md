# Witness appeal following assault and theft in Weymouth

06 November 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward after a woman was assaulted and had her purse stolen in a Weymouth street.

The incident occurred at around 7pm on Tuesday 5 November 2019 on the Chapelhay Steps, between the Holy Trinity Church and the Chapelhay Tavern.

The victim, aged in her 50s, was pushed over by a teenage boy and when another teenager who was with him went to help her up, he stole her purse from her handbag.

She suffered pain to her side as a result of the assault, but did not require immediate medical attention.

The teenager who pushed the victim is described as white, aged between 12 and 14 and of slim build with dark brown medium-length hair. He was wearing a black coat, dark blue jeans, black trainers and a dark-coloured woolly hat.

The other boy is described as white, of a similar age, of stocky build and with short mousey hair. He was wearing a grey hooded top, jeans and trainers.

Police Constable Caroline Orchard, of Weymouth police, said: "This was a nasty unprovoked attack by one boy and the other then stole her purse as he appeared to be helping her.

"We are determined to identify those involved in this incident and I would ask any witnesses or anyone with information that can assist our investigation to please contact us."
