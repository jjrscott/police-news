# Witness appeal following distraction burglary in Christchurch

27 July 2018

* * *

Officers investigating a distraction burglary in Christchurch are appealing for the public's help to locate the offenders.

At 3.30pm on Saturday 14 July 2018 the victim, aged in her 60s, was alone at home in the Forest Way area when she saw a man walk past her kitchen window in the direction of her back garden.

The victim went to the front door to find the man but was confronted by a woman.

The female offender said she had been told the address was a B&B and when informed that was incorrect she asked the victim to find a pen and paper and write down the directions for the nearest B&B.

The victim wrote down the directions and asked where the man had gone. The offender replied that he had gone out and she then left.

At 7am the following day, Sunday 15 July 2018, the victim realised her handbag was missing. It contained bank cards, a small amount of cash, purse and other personal items.

The female offender is described as white, of slim build, five feet five inches tall, and with medium length light-coloured hair. She was wearing light-coloured clothing, possibly shorts and a vest top. She carried a pink bag over her shoulder.

The male offender is described as six feet tall, of slight build and with short dark hair. He wore a light-coloured or white shirt and dark trousers.

Police Constable Sam Watt, of Christchurch police, said: "An investigation is underway into this distraction burglary and we have been carrying out house-to-house visits and CCTV enquiries in a bid to identify the two offenders.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the relevant time and saw people matching the description given to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would like to remind residents that if they are in any way worried about the intentions of a visitor to their property to contact a family member or neighbour and inform the police."
