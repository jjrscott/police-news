# Dorset roads policing officer recognised at national awards

30 January 2019

PC David Cotterill of the Alliance roads policing unit has been recognised for his outstanding record arresting drug drivers in Dorset.

He was announced as runner up at the national roads policing conference held by the Police Federation of England and Wales during an awards ceremony last night, Tuesday 29 January.

PC Cotterill was personally responsible for arresting almost 300 drivers last year for testing positive at the roadside for using cocaine or cannabis. This makes him single-handedly responsible for 42 per cent of Dorset Police’s total arrests for drug driving, with Dorset listed among the top three forces in the country for tackling the issue.

Back in 2017, he took part in an ITV documentary with Gordon Ramsay, highlighting the impact drug driving has on our roads.

PC David Cotterill, said: “Sadly we regularly have to witness the devastating consequences when a driver has a collision after taking drugs, which not only impacts themselves, but also often their families and other innocent road users.

“I am passionate about tackling this issue and it is really humbling to be recognised for something that is my job and I do day-to-day.”

Chief Inspector Adrian Leisk, Head of Roads Policing for Dorset and Devon & Cornwall, said: “We’re really proud of PC Cotterill in tackling what is a real issue on our roads. He has personally made a tremendous contribution, over and above expectations and I am very pleased he is part of our team."

Dave Blundell, Roads Policing Lead, Police Federation of England and Wales said: “It is incredibly important that we recognise the work done every day by roads policing officers – these awards go a small way to say thank you. Like the whole of policing, roads officers are under a lot of pressure to do more with less.

“The dedication shown by PC ‘Goose’ Cotterill is beyond expectation – the results he has achieved to date single-handedly is beyond words. He is very deserving of this recognition.”
