# Witness appeal following criminal damage to cars in Poole

16 March 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following criminal damage to a number of vehicles in Poole.

At around 7.50am today, Friday 16 March 2018, Dorset Police received a report that the tyres of at least six vehicles in Sheringham Road had been slashed. The tyres of a number of vehicles were also damaged in Recreation Road.

Officers attended and a number of other vehicles in Sheringham Road were found to be damaged.

Further reports were received of damage to cars in Coy Pond Road and Havelock Road. In total around 50 vehicles have been damaged. It is believed the offences occurred between 9pm yesterday, Thursday 15 March 2018, and the time of the first report.

Officers will be carrying out increased patrols in the area to offer reassurance and to take details of the vehicles involved.

Police Constable Lizzy Renshaw, of Poole police, said: "The offenders have clearly targeted a large number of vehicles and this has resulted in considerable inconvenience to local residents.

"We are carrying out a number of enquiries in the area to try and identify those responsible and I would appeal to anyone with any information that can assist our investigation to contact police.

"We would also like to hear from anyone whose vehicle has been damaged and has not yet reported it to us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180039538. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
