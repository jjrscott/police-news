# Witness appeal following assault in Poole

11 May 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating an assault in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The victim, a Poole man aged in his 20s, was walking along Castle Street at around 10.35pm on Monday 7 May 2018 when another man approached him. The victim raised his arm instinctively and was struck with what was believed to be a glass.

He was left with a deep cut on his forearm, which required medical treatment.

Following the incident, the victim ran toward Poole Quay and did not see the offender again.

The offender is described as white, more than six feet tall and of average build with scruffy hair and stubble. He was wearing a light-coloured short-sleeved shirt and dark trousers.

Detective Constable Tom Alsford, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was clearly a frightening ordeal for the victim and left him with a nasty cut.

"We are carrying out a detailed investigation to establish who is responsible and have carried out a number of enquiries, including exploring CCTV opportunities in the area.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnesses the incident or who saw a man matching the description given in the area at the relevant time to contact police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180068597. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
