A man has come forward following a CCTV appeal in relation to a reported assault on a disabled man in Bournemouth.

Detectives issued the appeal today, Tuesday 12 March 2019, following an alleged assault on Thursday 14 February 2019.

It was reported that a 21-year-old man who has Asperger's entered the Inside London Market convenience store on Old Christchurch Road and was allegedly assaulted by a group of men who are said to have verbally abused him about his disability.

A further allegation of assault happened a short time later on Old Christchurch Road.

The victim was taken to hospital for treatment to a small lump on his head and concussion.

A man has made himself known to officers and will be voluntarily interviewed.

Detectives have also received information as to the identity of the other two men they wanted to speak to.

At this stage, no arrests have been made.
