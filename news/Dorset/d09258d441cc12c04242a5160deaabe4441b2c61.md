# Witness appeal after fail-to-stop collision near Shaftesbury

25 July 2016

* * *

Police are appealing for witnesses following a fail-to-stop collision near Shaftesbury.

The incident happened at around 9.30am on Tuesday 19 July 2016 between a pedestrian and a car on Bittles Green in Motcombe near to Motcombe Garage.

The victim - a Wilshire man aged in his 50s - was walking along Bittles Green toward Shaftesbury when he was struck on his arm by a wing mirror of a passing vehicle.

The vehicle, which was believed to be a yellow people carrier, continued along the road toward Shaftesbury, before slamming on its brakes and then continuing along Motcombe Road. The driver made no attempt to speak to the victim.

The man suffered swelling and bruising to his right elbow and shoulder.

Police Constable Glen Caddy, of North Dorset police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who may have seen a vehicle matching the description in the area at the time to contact me.

"I would particularly ask anyone who is aware of a people carrier with damage to its offside wing mirror to call police or contact Crimestoppers anonymously."
