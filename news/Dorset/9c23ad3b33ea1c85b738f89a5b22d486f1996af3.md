# Renewed witness appeal following fatal collision near Blandford

01 August 2016

* * *

Officers investigating a fatal collision on the A350 near Blandford have issued a renewed appeal for witnesses.

At 10.50am on Sunday 24 July 2016 officers were called to the incident at Spetisbury involving a red and black Suzuki motorcycle and a silver Honda Civic car.

The motorcyclist, 30-year-old Fabio Paixao from Poole, was taken by air ambulance to Southampton with very serious head injuries. He sadly died in hospital the following day.

The driver of the Honda Civic, a woman in her thirties and from the Blandford area, was uninjured.

Police Sergeant Mark Farrow, of Dorset Police's Traffic Unit, said: "As part of my investigation into this incident I am renewing my appeal for witnesses to come forward.

"I am particularly keen to trace the occupants of a small black car and the rider of a motorcycle that were travelling along the A350 through Spetisbury toward Blandford around the time of the collision."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 24:162.
