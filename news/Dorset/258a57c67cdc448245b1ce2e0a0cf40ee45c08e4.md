# Appeal following theft of statue in Verwood

10 May 2017

* * *

Police are appealing for anyone with information to come forward following the theft of a statue in Verwood - with an image of the statue being released.

It was reported that a life-size bronze deer and fawn statue was stolen from an address on Doe's Lane at around 9pm on Sunday 19 March 2017.

Police Constable Fay Sweeting, of Dorset Police, said: "The statue is estimated to be worth around Â£5000 and is one of only two ever made. It has great sentimental value to the owners.

"I have now received information to suggest that the statue may have been transported to Wiltshire.

"It is believed that the vehicle which was used to carry the statue was also used to tow a caravan, which we think was stolen. It is thought to be a 2011 Sterling Celebration four-berth caravan.

"I am appealing to anyone who has seen this statue or the caravan for sale in suspicious circumstances since the time of the incident either in Dorset or Wiltshire, or has purchased the items in good faith, to please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 55170040536. Alternatively, contact the free and anonymous Crimestoppers line on 0800 555 111 where mobile phone tariffs may apply.
