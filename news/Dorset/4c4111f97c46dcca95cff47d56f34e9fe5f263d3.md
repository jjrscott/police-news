# Appeal for information following burglary in West Moors

15 February 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a burglary in West Moors are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 8.35pm on Sunday 10 February 2019 a burglary occurred at a home in Farm Road with the offenders forcing entry and stealing cash and jewellery, including a men's gold and stainless steel Rolex Datejust watch with diamonds on the face.

The offenders were both described as wearing dark clothing and masks. One of them is believed to be a white man, approximately five feet nine inches tall and of average build.

Police Constable Mark Mills, of Ferndown police, said: "We are carrying out a number of enquiries into this incident including house-to-house and exploring any CCTV opportunities locally.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area of Farm Road on the evening of Sunday 10 February 2019 to contact us.

"I am also issuing an image of the Rolex that was stolen and would urge anyone who comes across a similar watch being offered for sale in unusual circumstances to get in touch.

"We would urge anyone with valuable items such as this to make sure they are kept securely.

"Keeping a written record of any valuable jewellery pieces or watches and taking photographs will aid police in returning any stolen property, as well as making it difficult for burglars to sell on items without detection.
