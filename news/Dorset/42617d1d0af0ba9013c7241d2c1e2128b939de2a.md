# Update â€“ witness appeal following alleged assault in Bournemouth

09 April 2018

* * *

A man arrested in connection with an alleged assault in Bournemouth has been released without charge.

At 12.35am on Tuesday 12 December 2017 it was reported that three men had entered an address in Lowther Gardens and assaulted a man.

The alleged offenders then left the property and got back into a black vehicle before leaving the area.

The victim, a man aged in his 50s and from Bournemouth, sustained facial injuries and fractured a bone in his neck.

A 24-year-old man from Glasgow in Scotland was arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent and burglary and has now been released without charge.

Officers are not looking for anyone else in connection with this incident.
