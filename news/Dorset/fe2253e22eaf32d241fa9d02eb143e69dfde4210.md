The emergency services were called to a report of a fire at HMP Guys Marsh in Shaftesbury at around 8pm on Friday 10 March 2017.

Officers attended and discovered a large fire on the roof of a building within the prison, which is believed to have been started deliberately.

All prisoners and staff are accounted for. The South Western Ambulance Service is also at the scene as a precaution.

One prisoner who was reported to be on the roof of the prison building during the incident has been brought back down to safety and is being checked over by paramedics as a precaution.

Superintendent Caroline Naughton, of Dorset Police, said: "This was an isolated incident. An investigation is now underway to establish the exact cause of the fire. These enquiries remain ongoing.

"We would like to reassure members of the community that there is no immediate risk to those living in the surrounding area and that the incident is under control."
