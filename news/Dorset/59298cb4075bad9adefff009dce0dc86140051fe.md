A man is due to appear in court in connection with the reported theft of electric toothbrushes from a Bournemouth store.

At 1.39pm on Wednesday 27 February 2019 it is reported a man entered Boots at Castlepoint and stole two electric toothbrushes to the value of £600 and ran off without paying.

Following a CCTV appeal issued on Tuesday 26 March, a man came forward to assist with the investigation.

A 26-year-old man from Poole has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 21 May 2019 for an offence of theft.
