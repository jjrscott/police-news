# Witness appeal following assault in Poole

06 August 2018

* * *

Officers investigating an assault in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The victim, a woman aged in her 30s, was walking along New Orchard toward West Street at around 6.30pm on Monday 30 July 2018 when she was approached by an unknown woman and punched in the face.

The offender is described as white, aged in her 30s, around five feet four inches tall, of large build and with brown hair tied up. She was wearing a navy blue jumper and tracksuit bottoms. She was carrying a green can in her hand.

Police Constable Hannah Loveridge, of Poole police, said: "Fortunately the victim did not sustain any significant injuries as a result of the assault but it understandably left her very shaken as it was a completely unprovoked assault.

"We have carried out various enquiries into this incident and I understand there were a number of people and vehicles in the area at the time of the offence. I am appealing for anyone who witnessed the assault to please contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180121534. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
