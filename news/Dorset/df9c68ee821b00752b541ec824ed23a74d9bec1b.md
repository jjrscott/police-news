"We are carrying out a number of enquiries and I am appealing to anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area on the night of Monday 17 August 2020, or who has any information that could assist our investigation, to please come forward.

"I would also urge anyone who was driving in the area at the time and has dashcam fitted to their vehicle to check their footage for anything relevant."
