Detectives are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information following reports of a dangerous driving incident in Gillingham.

It was reported that a man driving a silver Volkswagen Golf swerved into the path of a woman who was driving a silver Ford Focus, colliding with the front offside of the car causing minor damage, before driving off.

The incident happened at around 9pm on Tuesday 26 July 2016 at a roundabout on the B3092 near to the Co-Operative supermarket. No one was physically injured. Both drivers were known to each other.

Detective Constable Siobhan Lovering, of Weymouth CID, said: "I wish to appeal for witnesses to the collision and the manner of driving of either vehicle before or after as we need to establish what exactly happened.

"If you have any information that could help with my investigation, please contact me or call Crimestoppers anonymously."

A 26-year-old Bristol man has been arrested in relation to this incident and is currently on police bail until the beginning of September 2016 pending further enquiries.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55160112599\.
