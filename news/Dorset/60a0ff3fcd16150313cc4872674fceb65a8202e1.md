# Witness appeal following fatal road traffic collision in Bournemouth

30 July 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward as they investigate a fatal collision in Bournemouth.

At 6.17pm on Thursday 30 July 2020 Dorset Police received a report of a collision on Wallisdown Road, at the junction with Alton Road, involving a white KTM motorcycle and a red Nissan Pathfinder.

Officers attended, along with the fire and ambulance services. Very sadly the motorcyclist - a man aged in his 20s from Salisbury - was pronounced dead at the scene. His family has been informed.

The occupants of the Nissan sustained minor injuries.

Road closures were put in place to allow the emergency services to respond and for an examination of the scene to be carried out.

Sergeant Sarah Jones, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are of course family of the young motorcyclist at this awful time.

"We are carrying out a full investigation to establish the circumstances of this collision and I would urge any witnesses to the incident, or the manner of driving of the vehicles involved prior to it, to please contact us if you have not already spoken to police.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who may have captured the collision on dashcam.

"Finally, I would like to thank members of the public for their patience and understanding during the road closures, which are necessary to allow the emergency services to deal with the incident and for a detailed examination of the scene to take place to aid our investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 30:366. Alternatively, or alternatively to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
