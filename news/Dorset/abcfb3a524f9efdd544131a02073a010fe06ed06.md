# Witness appeal following assault in Dorchester

28 February 2019

* * *

Officers investigating an assault on a vulnerable victim in Dorchester are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 4.30pm on Tuesday 26 February 2019 the victim, a man who has learning difficulties, was on his bicycle and followed to his home in Louise Road by a white tipper van.

The cyclist was then in his garden when the driver of the van got out and punched him to the throat before making further threats of violence and leaving. He was seen to stop briefly in Marie Road before travelling up Coburg Road.

The offender is described as white, around five feet ten inches tall and of medium build with short brown hair and was wearing some kind of orange clothing.

Police Constable Simon Rogers, of Dorset Police, said: "This was an unprovoked assault on a vulnerable victim that understandably left him shaken.

"We are determined to identify the man responsible and are carrying out a full investigation.

"I would urge any witnesses, or anyone who saw a man matching the description given in a white tipper van in the area at around the relevant time, to contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190030274. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
