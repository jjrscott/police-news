# Public appeal and advice following theft from cars in Wareham

10 August 2016

* * *

Police are appealing for witnesses and reminding the public to be vigilant after thieves broke into three cars in the Wareham area.

Between 7pm and 7.30pm on Monday 8 August 2016, offenders broke into a blue Honda which was parked in Morden Road. A wallet, mobile phone and items of clothing were stolen.

It was reported that offenders smashed the window of a black Toyota RAV4 which was parked in South Middlebere between 5.40pm and 6pm the same evening. A purse and groceries were stolen.

The third incident also occurred on Monday 8 August between 9am and 5.50pm when a window of a Suzuki Swift was smashed while it was parked in East Street. An iPad, make-up and clothing was stolen.

Police Sergeant Paul Upshall, of Wareham police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who saw someone acting suspiciously in the area at the relevant time to please contact Dorset Police.

"Witnesses have described seeing a car with a red and white bonnet and a black Volkswagen Polo acting suspiciously nearby and I would urge anyone who comes across either vehicle in unusual circumstances to call police immediately.

"Finally, I would like to remind motorists in Dorset to ensure they do not leave any valuables in their vehicles and remove all items from view. Do not make it easy for thieves to target your vehicle."
