Four men arrested in connection with an alleged serious assault in Poole have been released without charge.

An investigation was launched following an incident at Sterte Close at around 2.20am on Monday 9 October 2017.

Emergency services attended and two men were found with stab wounds to their backs. A 34-year-old man of no fixed abode sustained injuries that were initially believed to be life-threatening and a 45-year-old man from Poole was seriously injured. Both have since left hospital.

A 20-year-old man and a 22-year-old man, both from London, were arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm with intent and released under investigation.

A 31-year-old Poole man was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and released under investigation. A 43-year-old man, of no fixed abode, was arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender and was also released under investigation.

Following a detailed investigation by detectives, all four men have now been released without charge.
