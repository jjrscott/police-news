# Arrests during day of action on Weymouth roads

27 February 2019

* * *

A number of arrests were made during the latest day of action on roads in the Weymouth area.

Officers from the traffic unit teamed up with dedicated officers targeting suspected county lines drugs networks for the day of intensification on Tuesday 26 February 2019.

The intelligence-based operation saw a total of 18 vehicles stopped, including nine that either had suspected links to county lines networks or that were linked to targets of Dorset Police's Op Dragoon initiative, which targets high risk road users.

Four people were arrested, three for drug driving offences and one for possession of a class A drug with intent to supply.

A total of seven roadside drug wipes were carried out and two vehicles were seized, one for being in a dangerous condition and one for being uninsured.

Inspector Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "We will continue to carry out these proactive days of intensification with the aim of disrupting the activity of suspected county lines networks as well as taking action against those believed to be posing a risk to fellow road users.

"We are also reliant on information from members of the public to help identify individuals suspected of regularly driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol."
