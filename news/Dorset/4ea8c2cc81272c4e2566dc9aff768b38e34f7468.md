# Public appeal as officers search for missing man in Purbeck

10 February 2020

* * *

Officers carrying out searches for a missing man in Purbeck are appealing for help from the public.

Patrick Guinard, aged 66 and from Woking, was reported missing to Surrey Police having last been seen at his home address at around 9am on Wednesday 5 February 2020.

He was last seen wearing his cycling clothing, which was possibly pale blue and grey and black trousers, and travelled on his road bike.

Patrick is described as white, five feet five inches tall and of slim build with dark hair that is starting to grey and has a French accent.

Following enquiries, officers from Dorset Police located Patrick's bike in a public car park at Renscombe in Worth Matravers on Saturday 8 February. His helmet, goggles and gloves were also found.

Further searches on the same day led to a bag belonging to Patrick being located on the beach at Ringstead Bay.

Inspector Greg Tansill, of Dorset Police, said: "Dorset Police is now leading on this missing person investigation and our efforts to locate Patrick continue.

"We have carried out extensive searches and I would like to thank those who have assisted our efforts so far, including DorSAR (Dorset Search and Rescue), Wessex 4x4 Response and the coastguard.

"We are continuing to search and make enquiries in a bid to locate Patrick and I would urge anyone with information as to his whereabouts, or who sees a man matching the description given, to please contact us immediately.

"I would also make a direct plea to Patrick if you see this appeal to please contact us or your family so we can make sure you are alright."

Anyone with information or knowledge as to Patrick's whereabouts is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 8:187.
