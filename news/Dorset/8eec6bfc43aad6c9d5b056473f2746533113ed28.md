Police are appealing for witnesses after a single vehicle fatal collision in Bournemouth.

Officers were called at around 12.55am on Sunday 29 January 2017 to reports that a black Renault Clio had collided with a wall at Alum Chine car park on Alumhurst Road.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or the manner of driving of the Clio prior to the incident to contact police."
