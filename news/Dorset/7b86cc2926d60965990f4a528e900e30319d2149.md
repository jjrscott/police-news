* * *

A man has been charged in connection with an assault on a Police Community Support Officer.

The 42-year-old of Bournemouth is due to appear before Bournemouth Magistrates' Court today, Friday 30 September 2016.

He has been charged with assaulting one PCSO, racially-aggravated assault on a second PCSO, assaulting a Town Centre Ranger and theft.

The charges relate to reports of a theft of a charity box from the Natwest Bank in The Square at around midday yesterday, Thursday 29 September.

A female PCSO followed the male suspect and it is alleged the man turned around and head-butted her, causing her to fall to the floor.

The injured PCSO was taken to hospital for treatment. She was released later that day.
