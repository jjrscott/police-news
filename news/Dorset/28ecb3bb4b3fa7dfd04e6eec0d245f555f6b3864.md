* * *

Officers investigating reports of a burglary in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 12.20am on Wednesday 1 November 2017 Dorset Police received a report of a burglary at a property in Rossmore Road.

It was reported that the burglary had occurred while the residents were on holiday between Thursday 12 October 2017 and Tuesday 31 October 2017.

It is believed access to the property was gained by forcing a rear ground floor window and a number of items of jewellery were taken including a gold long chain necklace and a gold men's wedding band.

Police Constable Connor Lombardo, of Poole police, said: "We have made a number of enquiries into this incident and I am appealing to anyone with information that might assist our investigation to contact police.

"I would like to hear from anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area in the time frame given or who has come across jewellery in unusual circumstances recently."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170170341. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
