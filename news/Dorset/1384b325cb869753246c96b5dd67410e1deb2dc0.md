# Witness appeal following dog attack in Bournemouth

12 April 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a dog attack in Bournemouth.

At around 12.45pm on Monday 10 April 2017 a man was walking his Yorkshire Terrier dog on the beach at Hengistbury Head when it was attacked by a tanned-coloured Mastiff-type dog, which was with a man and a woman.

The man is described as white, aged in his late 30s, five feet seven inches tall and of stocky build. He had a shaved head and was described as wearing a turquoise-coloured T-shirt and had tattoos on his arms.

The woman is described as white, aged in her late 20s, five feet seven inches tall and of slim build. She had brown hair worn in a short pony-tail and was also described as wearing a turquoise-coloured T-shirt.

The offending dog had a football in its mouth which it dropped, before biting the victim's dog. The Yorkshire Terrier sadly died as a result of the injuries it sustained.

Nobody else was physically injured during the incident.

Neighbourhood Inspector Billy Bulloch, of Bournemouth police, said: "Although dog on dog attacks are usually led by the local authority and the dog warden, we are particularly concerned as there were a number of young children in the area at the time of this attack.

"I would like to reassure the public we are working with Bournemouth Borough Council to trace the dog's owners.

"The owners of the offending dog left the area in a blue people carrier vehicle - possibly a Vauxhall Zafira. I am appealing to anyone who is able to identify the owners of the dog to come forward.

"I believe there were a large number of people who would have witnessed the incident and I would urge anyone who saw what happened, or captured any of it on their mobile phone, to please contact Dorset Police."

Nananka Randle, Team Manager, Bournemouth Council, said "We take all dog attacks seriously. We are aware of the incident but unfortunately we do not have enough information about the dog owner.

"We would encourage the owner of the dog to come forward or if anyone has any information about this matter to contact the police. We will continue to work with the police to investigate this matter."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 10:199. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
