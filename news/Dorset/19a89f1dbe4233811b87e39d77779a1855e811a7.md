# Public appeal to identify owner of found statue

14 September 2018

* * *

Officers are hoping to trace the owner of a statue that was found in Bournemouth.

The statue was discovered on a doorstep of an address in St Mary's Road in the town on the morning of Sunday 26 August 2018. The occupant recalls hearing a noise at around 1am that day but did not see anything.

The stone statue is described as being around two feet high and is weathered green.

Police Community Support Officer Julia Finlayson, of Bournemouth police, said: "It is possible that this statue was moved as part of a prank and the woman who discovered it is keen to return it to the rightful owner. Enquiries have been carried out locally but no owner has been identified.

"We are issuing a photo of the statue and I would ask anyone who recognises it to please contact us."
