# Appeal for witnesses following reported assault in Christchurch

13 July 2020

* * *

Detectives investigating a reported assault in Christchurch are appealing for witnesses or anyone with video footage of the incident to come forward.

At around 6.40pm on Saturday 11 July 2020 officers were called to an alleged fight involving two men at The Boathouse on Quay Road. It was reported that the men had left the area.

Around five minutes later a further report was received of an altercation involving the two men from the previous incident and a woman on Quay Road at the junction with Princess Avenue. It is alleged that one of the men was hit in the face with a large pebble.

A local man aged in his 20s was taken to hospital for treatment to a fractured foot, a cut to his lip and injuries to his head.

A 26-year-old man from Hampshire was arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm, affray and assaulting an emergency worker. He has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Detective Constable Sam Knight, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident and has not already spoken to police to please get in touch.

"I understand some people in the area filmed the reported assault on their mobile phones and I would urge them to please send this footage to us to assist with our investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200101024. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
