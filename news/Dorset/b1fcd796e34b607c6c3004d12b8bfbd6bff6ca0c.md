# Witness appeal following attempted robbery in Bournemouth

19 November 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating an attempted robbery in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 8pm yesterday, Sunday 18 November 2018, a woman aged in her 60s and a man aged in his 70s were walking along the promenade near to Bournemouth Pier in the direction of Durley Chine when two men approach them from behind.

One of the men tried to grab the woman's handbag from her but she managed to hold onto it. The offenders then ran off along the promenade, making off up the West Cliff zig zags.

The first offender is described as white, aged in his early teens to early 20s and of medium build. He was wearing a heavy green coat with black hooded top underneath and the hood up over his head as well as dark trousers and black shoes. He was carrying a small shoulder bag on his right shoulder.

The second man is described as white, aged in his late teens to early 20s and of slim build. He was wearing a light grey hooded top, grey skinny jeans and dark shoes. He had a black rucksack on his back.

Detective Constable Rebecca Joyce, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We are carrying out a number of enquiries into this incident, including a review of CCTV footage in the area.

"I am also appealing to anyone who witnessed the attempted robbery or who saw two men matching the descriptions given in the area at the time of the incident to please contact us."
