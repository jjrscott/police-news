The coroner for Dorset is seeking the assistance of the public to find the next of kin of a woman who died in Weymouth.

Michele Pupius, who was 62 years old, died at her home address in Rockhampton Close on Monday 27 February 2017.

The coroner is making enquiries into the death.

Coroner's Officer Andy Lord said: "The death is not being treated as suspicious, but as yet I have been unable to locate any next of kin for her.

"I would be grateful if any relative, or any friend who has any knowledge of her family members could contact me as soon as possible on 01202 454910."
