Detectives investigating reports of an alleged rape in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

It was reported that the victim, a Bournemouth woman aged in her 30s, was walking through Kings Park at around 9.30am on Saturday 9 September 2017 when she was approached by a man in his late 30s or early 40s.

He was described as white, with ginger hair in a ponytail and was wearing a black leather jacket and black jeans.

It was reported that the man raped the woman before she was able to get away and left the park via Ashley Road in the direction of Holdenhurst Road.

A 41-year-old Bournemouth man has been arrested on suspicion of rape and has been released under investigation.

Detective Constable Will Burnett, of the Serious Sexual Offences Unit, said: "We are aware that there were a number of other people walking through Kings Park or playing football in the area around the time of the incident.

"We would urge anyone who witnessed the incident or any suspicious activity in the area around the time of the offence to please contact us."

Officers from the local Neighbourhood Policing Team can be contacted with any community concerns.
