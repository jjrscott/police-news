# CCTV appeal following reported burglary in Bournemouth

19 February 2021

* * *

Officers investigating an alleged burglary in Bournemouth are issuing a CCTV image of a suspect.

The incident occurred between Friday 17 July and Monday 20 July 2020 at The Helm on Holdenhurst Road.

It was reported that over multiple days a group of people entered the property and caused repeated criminal damage. It is also alleged that a number of items were stolen, including Sonos speakers.

A 20-year-old man from Poole was arrested on suspicion of burglary and released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Police Constable William Warren, of Bournemouth police, said: "The reported damage caused and property stolen had a significant financial impact on the premises.

"We have been continuing to carry out extensive enquiries into this incident, but unfortunately previous identification of suspects has now proven incorrect.

"Therefore, I am now in a position to release a CCTV image of another suspect in the hope that somebody may be able to identify him.

"Also, I would like to hear from anyone who could have any further details to assist my investigation into the circumstances of this alleged burglary."
