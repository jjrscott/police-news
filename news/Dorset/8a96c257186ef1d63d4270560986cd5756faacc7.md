# Appeal after drug incident in Bournemouth

25 October 2017

* * *

Detectives are appealing for information after a 14-year-old girl was taken to hospital following a suspected drug incident in Bournemouth.

Officers were called by the ambulance service at 10.44pm yesterday, Tuesday 24 October 2017, after reports the girl had fallen ill on Fir Vale Road after taking a substance reported to have been ecstasy.

She was taken to hospital for treatment and was discharged this morning and is being cared for by her family.

A 15-year-old boy from Poole has been arrested on suspicion of supplying class A drugs and is assisting officers with enquiries.

Detective Sergeant Ian Allen, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We are treating this incident extremely seriously and would like to reassure the public that a full and detailed investigation is underway.

"It is understood that the girl attended a private under 18s party at Cameo nightclub earlier that evening. Although there is nothing to link the drug incident to the party at this time, I would ask anyone who attended and is concerned they may have taken drugs or any parents worried about their child's health following last night's event to please seek urgent medical advice and report the matter to police.

"I am also appealing for anyone who has any information regarding the suspected supply of drugs relating to this incident yesterday evening to contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 24:533. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
