15 October 2016

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward after a robbery in Bournemouth.

The victim, a 67-year-old local man, and offender boarded the M1 bus at the Bath Road and Lansdown roundabout stop at around 1.15pm on Friday 14 October 2016. The victim believes the offender followed him along Old Christchurch Road as he saw him there before they took different routes to the bus stop.

The victim got off the bus on Lansdown Road just before Cemetery junction and so did the offender.
As the victim then crossed Wimborne Road, the offender grabbed his bag and pushed him to the floor before taking the bag and dumping it nearby. The bag has been recovered.

As a result of the incident the victim sustained a cut to his right eyebrow requiring six stitches, grazes to his right cheek and grazes to his hands.

The offender is described as a black man, aged in his late 20s with short black hair and a large nose. He was wearing a black or navy coloured hooded top, black jogging bottoms and black trainers.

Detective Constable Angela Singleton, of Bournemouth CID, said: "There were lots of people in the area at the time and the victim also spoke to a woman at the bus stop telling her that he thought he was being followed.

"I am appealing for any witnesses to the robbery and anyone who has further information about the incident to contact police."
