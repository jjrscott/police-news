# Renewed appeal for witnesses after Bournemouth burglary

29 December 2016

* * *

Detectives are renewing their appeal for witnesses after a woman was burgled in Bournemouth - with an image of a stolen ring being released.

The incident happened at around 10pm on Thursday 22 December 2016 at a property on Richmond Park Crescent when the woman heard a knock at her door.

She opened the door and two men forced their way in. One of the men pinned the victim down while the other stole jewellery, cash and a handbag before they both left.

The victim suffered a bang to her head from hitting the floor during the incident, but did not require medical treatment.

The first offender is described as white, six feet tall and around 30 years old. He has short dark hair and a pale complexion. He was wearing a black peaked cap and black clothing.

The second offender is described as white, slightly shorter than the first offender and of broad build. He has short hair greying at the sides and a very deep gruff voice. He was wearing a grey mask over the bottom half of his face and a dark-coloured bomber jacket.

Detective Constable Aston Starkie, of Bournemouth CID, said: "The victim was given one of the stolen items, a high-value Kaczynksi ring, by someone with great personal significance to her over 30 years ago.

"She has been left devastated by the loss of the jewellery which has extreme sentimental value and therefore is irreplaceable.

"Understandably, she is extremely anxious to have the taken items returned to her.

"This was a very cowardly and nasty attack on the victim in her own home which has left her badly shaken.

"I would like to hear from anyone who has information about those responsible or the whereabouts of the jewellery. As the items are distinctive, I would also like to speak to anyone who has seen them for sale or has been offered them in unusual circumstances."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55160191457. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
