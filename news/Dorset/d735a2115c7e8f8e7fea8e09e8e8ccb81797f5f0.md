# Witness appeal following fatal road traffic collision near Dorchester

16 October 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to a fatal road traffic collision near Dorchester to come forward.

At around 6.25am today, Monday 16 October 2017, a road traffic collision occurred on the A352 at Whitcombe.

The collision involved a red Honda Civic and a silver Peugeot 206.

The driver of the Honda, a man aged in his 40s from Dorchester, received serious injuries. The passenger - a 43-year-old woman from Dorchester - was taken to Dorset County Hospital with life-threatening injuries where she sadly passed away this morning. Her family has been informed and the coroner has been notified.

The male driver of the Peugeot, who is from the Dorchester area, sustained chest, leg and arm injuries and was taken to Dorset County Hospital.

The A352 was closed in both directions between the roundabout at the junction with the West Stafford bypass and Whitcombe to allow emergency services to deal with the incident and for collision investigators to examine the scene.

Police Sergeant Fern Graham, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision, or saw the manner of driving of either vehicle prior to the collision, to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who has a dash cam fitted in their vehicle that may hold vital evidence.

"I would like to thank motorists for their patience while the road closure was in place, which was essential to allow the emergency services to carry out an effective examination of the scene."
