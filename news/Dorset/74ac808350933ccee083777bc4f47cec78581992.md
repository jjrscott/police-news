# Man charged in connection with reported rape in Dorchester

12 February 2020

* * *

A man has been charged in connection with the reported rape of a 15-year-old girl in Dorchester.

A 32-year-old Dorchester man is due to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 12 February 2020 charged with rape in connection with the incident that was reported to have occurred at around 9.20pm on Thursday 5 December 2019 in a field at St Osmund's School in Barnes Way.

It was reported that the victim was walking along the field when she was approached by a man and forced onto the ground before being sexually assaulted.

Detective Inspector Wayne Seymour, of Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team, said: "This incident has been the subject of a detailed investigation and we have continued to support the girl and her family and keep them updated.

"I can confirm we have now consulted with the Crown Prosecution Service, which has authorised a charge of rape against the man we arrested on Tuesday 11 February 2020.

"This matter is now subject to a court process and it is important to stress that - as is typical in such circumstances - it would be entirely inappropriate for Dorset Police to comment further during the proceedings. It is vital that the judicial system is allowed to follow its course.

"We would like to remind the public that criminal proceedings are active and the individuals charged in connection with this investigation have a right to a fair trial. It is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings."
