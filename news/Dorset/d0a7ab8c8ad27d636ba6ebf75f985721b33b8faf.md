# Witness appeal following reported assault in Poole

22 July 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a man was reportedly assaulted in the Canford Cliffs area of Poole.

At around 8.45pm on Saturday 18 July 2020 a security guard was completing his regular patrol of Canford Cliffs seafront in his work vehicle when he came across a large group of teenagers. It is reported one of the group dropped something in front of his vehicle, causing the victim to stop, and another leant into his vehicle and ruffled his hair.

The victim got out of his vehicle and challenged the group. During the altercation it is reported the victim was hit with a bottle, punched and kicked by three members of the group.

A 16-year-old boy from Bournemouth and an 18-year-old man from Christchurch were arrested on suspicion of assault and have been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Police Constable Steve Hawke, of Dorset Police, said: "From my CCTV enquiries I am aware that there were a number of people in the area at the time of this reported incident. I am appealing to anyone who saw what happened and has not yet spoken to officers to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200105521. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
