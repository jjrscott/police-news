# Witness appeal after vehicle stolen from a charity in Poole

06 February 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for the public's help to find a vehicle stolen from a charity that supports disabled people in Poole.

The incident happened overnight between Sunday 4 February and Monday 5 February 2018 at Livability Holton Lee at Holton Heath.

A green-coloured Kawasaki Mule was taken from a yard where it was parked. The offenders had gained entry after breaking the lock on a gate before taking the vehicle.

Neil Stevens, Centre Manager at Livability Holton Lee, said: "This vehicle was in daily use supporting the woodland and horticulture therapy activities that happen on site.

"There will clearly be a financial and a practical impact, but knowing that someone has come to site prepared in advance to steal from the charity is particularly demoralising for the team when they put so much in on a daily basis to caring for the people we support."

Police Constable Paul Diffey, of Poole police, said: "The theft of this vehicle has deprived a charity of a much-needed resource. I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed anything suspicious in the area at the relevant time, or who has information that could assist with my investigation, to please come forward.

"If you know where this vehicle is, please contact Dorset Police urgently."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180018604. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestopppers-uk.org.
