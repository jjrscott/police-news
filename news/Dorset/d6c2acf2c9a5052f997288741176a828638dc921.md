# Witness appeal following collision in Bournemouth

25 October 2017

* * *

Officers investigating a road traffic collision in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At 10.29pm on Sunday 22 October 2017 a collision occurred outside the Travelodge on Christchurch Road involving a black Kia Sedona and a pedestrian.

The pedestrian - a local man aged in his 40s - sustained serious injuries to his leg, broken ribs and cuts to his head and face and remains in hospital undergoing treatment. His condition is not believed to be life-threatening.

The driver of the car, a woman from Bournemouth aged in her 40s, was uninjured.

No arrests have been made.

Police Sergeant Mark Scammell, of the traffic unit, said: "As part of our enquiries we have identified that a couple of vehicles were travelling in the area around the time of the collision and a number of occupants may have witnessed what happened. I would ask these people to please make contact with Dorset police.

"I am particularly keen to trace the driver of a small silver hatchback car which approached the scene and slowed down for the pedestrian. I believe the driver of this car witnessed the collision and stopped a short distance away."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170165337. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
