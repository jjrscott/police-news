# Witness appeal following fatal collision in Weymouth

06 June 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a fatal collision involving a teenage boy in Weymouth.

At 3.30pm today, Wednesday 6 June 2018, Dorset Police was called to reports of a serious injury collision in Portland Road involving a 14-year-old local boy who was riding a bicycle and a white Mercedes articulated lorry.

The boy sustained very serious injuries in the collision and was sadly pronounced dead at the scene a short time later. His family have been informed and are being supported by specially-trained officers.

The driver of the lorry was uninjured.

The road remains closed to allow collision investigators to examine the scene. Motorists are being advised to seek alternative routes.

Police Sergeant Mark Scammell, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the boy's family and friends at this very traumatic time.

"I am aware that there were a number of people in the area at the time of the collision and I would ask them, or anyone else with information, to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who was travelling along the road at the time and may have captured the incident on a dash cam.

"I would like to thank motorists for their patience during the road closures, which are necessary to ensure we can fully investigate the circumstances of this collision."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 6:284. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
