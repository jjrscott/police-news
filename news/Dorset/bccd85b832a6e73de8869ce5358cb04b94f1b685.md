# Witness appeal following fatal road traffic collision in Swanage

15 October 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a fatal road traffic collision in Swanage.

The incident, which happened in High Street, was reported to police at 11.20am on Thursday 15 October 2020. It involved a Skoda Yeti and two parked vehicles - a Ford Transit van and a BMW 520.

Sadly the Skoda driver, an 83-year-old man from Swanage, died at the scene. His next of kin have been informed.

A road closure has been put in place to allow emergency services to attend the scene.

Police Sergeant Sarah Jones, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the family and loved ones of the man who sadly died.

"We are carrying out a thorough investigation into the circumstances of the collision and I would like to hear from any witnesses who have not spoken with police yet or anyone with relevant dashcam footage.

"I am grateful for the patience of anyone affected by the road closure, which is necessary to allow the emergency services to respond to this incident and for an examination of the scene to be carried out safely."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 15:133. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
