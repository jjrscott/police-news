# Reported dog stolen from West Parley â€“ investigation update

26 November 2020

* * *

Officers investigating reports a dog was stolen from West Parley say no further police action will be taken against two men arrested as part of the investigation.

On the morning of Friday 18 September 2020 the dog's owner was cutting the grass at an address on Longfield Drive while Cookie the Cockapoo was in an unlocked Volkswagen Transporter van, which was parked on the corner of New Road and Longfield Drive. At around midday they discovered Cookie was missing.

Following enquiries, a 32-year-old man from Poole and a 36-year-old man from Wimborne were arrested on suspicion of theft and had been released under investigation while enquiries continued. They have now been released from the investigation and will face no further police action.

Cookie was returned to her owners on Monday 21 September 2020.
