Officers are appealing for witnesses after five people were injured in a collision near Poole.

At around 11.46pm yesterday, Thursday 17 November 2016, a serious injury collision occurred on the A350 Blandford Road North, south of the Lytchett Matravers junction, involving a blue Vauxhall Insignia and a blue Vauxhall Tigra.

The driver of the Tigra - a 29-year-old Blandford woman - sustained serious injuries and was taken to Southampton General Hospital for treatment.

The driver of the Insignia, a 23-year-old man, and three passengers - two women aged 26 and a 28-year-old man - were taken to Poole Hospital for treatment. All occupants are from Poole and their injuries are described as serious but not life-threatening.

The A350 was closed between the Roundhouse roundabout on the A31 and Limberloss on the A350. It was reopened at 7.45am.

Police Sergeant Phil Lee, of the Alliance Road Policing Team, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or who saw the manner of driving of either vehicle immediately prior to the incident to please call Dorset Police.

"I would like to thank motorists for their patience during the road closure which was necessary to allow emergency services to deal with the incident and collision investigators to examine the scene."
