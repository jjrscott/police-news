Officers responding to three separate reports of burglaries in Bournemouth in one night have made a number of arrests.

It is alleged the burglaries occurred between 11.15pm yesterday, Wednesday 7 November 2018, and 4am this morning, Thursday 8 November 2018.

The first incident related to a report of a break-in at an address in Hawkwood Road. It was alleged that a man who was known to the victim had forced entry to the property.

Following a search of the area, a 27-year-old Poole man was arrested on suspicion of burglary and is assisting officers with their enquiries.

At around 12.45am today Dorset Police received a report of a commercial burglary in process at the Flirt Cafe Bar in The Triangle.

Again, a search of the area was carried out and a 21-year-old man of no fixed abode was arrested on suspicion of burglary. He is assisting officers with their enquiries.

Shortly after 4am a report was received of a dwelling burglary in Grants Avenue. The victim reported that a man had forced entry to the home and was searching the premises.

Officers attended and following a search a 39-year-old Bournemouth man was arrested on suspicion of burglary. He is also assisting officers with their enquiries.

Inspector Stew Gates, of Bournemouth police, said: "We are committed to protecting homeowners and businesses from suspected burglars and these cases demonstrate our 24/7 response to reports that we receive.
