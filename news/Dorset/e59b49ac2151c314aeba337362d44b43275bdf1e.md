# New campaign launched to promote road users making better choices

28 March 2019

* * *

The Dorset Road Safety Partnership has launched a major new campaign titled ‘Choices for Humanity’, which encourages road users to make better choices.

The campaign aims to continue to reduce the number of people killed and seriously injured on Dorset roads, whether they’re in vehicles, or on motorbikes, bicycles, horses or foot.

Drivers and other road users often make decisions that they later regret; whether it is when to pull out of a T-junction, dangerously overtaking the vehicle in front, crossing the road in an unsafe place, overtaking a cyclist or horse rider too close or driving under the influence of drink or drugs. Making the wrong choice can all too often lead to tragedy.

The campaign is based loosely around the popular ‘Cards Against Humanity’ game, with messaging delivered in a thought provoking and innovative way that will resonate with road users. It has been designed to push the boundaries to generate attention to our road safety messages and to get people to stop and think.

The road safety partnership is made up of Dorset Police, the Police and Crime Commissioner, Bournemouth Christchurch and Poole Council, Dorset Council, Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service, Highways England, Public Health Dorset and the Safewise charity.

Chair of the Dorset Road Safety Partnership, Assistant Chief Constable Julie Fielding, said: “We’re now seeing 30 per cent less people killed and seriously injured on our roads each year versus 2012 and this is a positive step. However, we cannot be complacent. It is vital that we continue to find new and innovative ways to prevent casualties on our roads.

“Everyone would like to think they are a considerate driver, but sometimes life gets in the way and one error of judgement can sometimes have catastrophic consequences.

“This unique and innovative campaign will hopefully remind us that we are all human and have the ability to make the right choices and show humanity towards each other.

Campaign messages will be shared on social media, billboards throughout Dorset, roadside signs, advertising trailers on roundabouts and other local authority highways as well as other advertising channels.

Dorset Road Safe was supported by Bournemouth-based marketing agency, Fireworx on developing the concept of the campaign. Managing Director, Dan Smith said: "As an agency that specialises in using different thinking to help clients create more engagement, we were delighted when Dorset Police challenged Fireworx to help them create a new road safety campaign.

"The idea behind 'Choices for Humanity’ was to remind people around the choices we all make every day when using the road and do this a a totally different, human and creative way. As a Bournemouth agency, it’s a true privilege to support such a worthwhile campaign to improve road safety in Dorset."
