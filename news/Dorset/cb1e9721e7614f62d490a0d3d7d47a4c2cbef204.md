Detectives in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following an assault in the Boscombe part of the town.

Officers were called at 4.07pm on Sunday 12 June 2016 to reports of a stabbing in Boscombe Gardens.

Two men sustained serious injuries. A 34-year-old sustained injuries to his neck and face and a 44-year-old was also injured at the neck.

The offender is described as a white man and aged in his thirties. He has brown hair and was wearing a polo shirt, dark blue track suite type three quarter length trousers and a cream hooded top.

Officers, assisted by armed response colleagues and the NPAS helicopter, are searching the area.

No arrests have been made.

Detective Inspector Steve Symms, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who saw the incident and has not yet spoken to police, or has seen a man matching the description, to contact us."

Witnesses and anyone with information should call Dorset Police in confidence on 101 quoting incident number 12:308. Alternatively, call the free and anonymous Crimestoppers line on 0800 555 111 where mobile phone tariffs may apply.
