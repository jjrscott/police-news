A man has been charged and has appeared in court in connection with two shoplifting incidents in Bournemouth.

It was reported that at around 3pm on Sunday 16 February 2020 a man stole a 30g packet of tobacco from the post office on Bradpole Road. A further theft was reported at TK Maxx at the Ringwood Road Retail Park at around 6pm on Saturday 15 February 2020, with items valued at £60 allegedly stolen.

Following enquiries by officers and a CCTV appeal, a 33-year-old Christchurch man was arrested and charged with theft. He appeared at Poole Magistrates Court on Thursday 5 March 2020.

The defendant entered guilty pleas and was sentenced to 18 weeks in prison, suspended for 18 months, with a prohibition not to go to any TK Maxx store in England and Wales or any post office.
