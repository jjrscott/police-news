# Public appeal following fail-to-stop collision involving child in Weymouth

09 July 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a fail-to-stop collision in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At around 3.30pm on Thursday 27 June 2019 a nine-year-old local girl was cycling along Bryants Lane when she was struck by a white car, causing her to fall from her bicycle. The matter was reported to Dorset Police at 8.15pm.

The girl was tended to by members of the public who were in the area at the time. She sustained an injury to her right arm and wrist.

The driver of the car did initially stop at the scene but left before officers arrived and failed to leave his details.

He is described as white, aged around 20 years old, with blond to brown hair flipped to the side.

Police Constable Katherine Rupp, of Weymouth police, said: "I have already carried out a number of enquiries to identify the driver involved in this collision but these have so far been unsuccessful. I would urge the driver to please contact Dorset Police so we can establish exactly what happened.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who witnessed this collision and has not yet spoken to officers. If you have information that may assist my investigation, please contact me."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190097816. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
