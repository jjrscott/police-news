# Appeal following burglary in Poole

31 July 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a burglary at an address in Poole.

At 11.41pm on Sunday 26 July 2020 officers were called to reports of a break in at an address in Redwood Road and people with torches. At the time nothing was reported stolen.

It was subsequently discovered that a set of keys to the victim's car had been taken and at around 11pm on Tuesday 28 July a group of people were seen trying to get the car started. The attempt failed as the victim had disconnected the battery when he realised the keys had gone missing.

Officers have carried out house-to-house enquiries and CCTV checks.

Police Constable Kristian Budden, of Dorset Police, said: "We have spoken to witnesses who say they saw a large group of teenagers wearing hooded tops and dark clothing in the area.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the time and witnessed a group of people running away to please contact me. I would also ask residents who have not yet been approached to check their home CCTV systems for any footage that may be relevant to my investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200110178. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
