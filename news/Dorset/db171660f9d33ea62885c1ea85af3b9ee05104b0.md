# Appeal for information after man bitten by dog in North Dorset

28 September 2020

* * *

Officers investigating an incident where a man was bitten by a dog in North Dorset are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 6.45pm on Thursday 10 September 2020 a man aged in his 40s was walking his elderly Golden Retriever near the airfield at Compton Abbas when his dog was attacked by a larger Golden Retriever.

The victim attempted to intervene and was bitten on the hand, causing a deep laceration that required an operation.

The dog walker with the larger Retriever is described as white, aged in his late 70s or early 80s and of slim build with short grey hair. He was wearing a blue jacket and it is believed he may be local as the victim had seen him in the area previously.

Police Constable Jennie Sykes-Martin, of Dorset Police, said: "We have been carrying out enquiries into this incident, which left the victim with a nasty injury to his hand.

"I would urge anyone who can help identify the owner of the dog involved, or who has any other information that might assist our investigation, to please contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200136517. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
