# Witness appeal after fatal collision in Chideock

30 August 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a fatal road traffic collision in Chideock.

The incident occurred at around 2.30pm today, Wednesday 30 August 2017, on North Road. A green Ford Focus was in collision with a pedestrian.

The pedestrian - a 68-year-old local man - sadly died at the scene. His next of kin have been informed and the coroner has been notified.

The driver of the Ford - a 48-year-old Bridport man - was arrested on suspicion of driving offences and is currently assisting police with enquiries.

The road is closed to allow the emergency services to carry out their work and for a detailed investigation of the scene to take place.

Police Inspector Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "I would urge that anyone who witnessed the collision or saw the vehicle or pedestrian prior to the collision, who hasn't already spoken to officers, to please contact Dorset Police. I would also ask for people to review any dash-cam or digital devices for any relevant footage.

"We have specially-trained officers supporting the man's family at this difficult time and our thoughts are with them."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 30:281. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
