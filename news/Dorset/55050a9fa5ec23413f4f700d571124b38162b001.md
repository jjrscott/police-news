A man has been arrested in connection with a reported assault at a pub in Weymouth.

It was reported that at around 8.25pm on Thursday 20 June 2019 an altercation took place at the Duke of Edinburgh pub in St Thomas Street after a man was asked to leave by a member of staff.

One female staff member was allegedly pushed and a second woman, who is aged in her 20s, was reportedly punched twice in the face as she attempted to intervene.

Following a CCTV appeal, a 31-year-old Weymouth man has been arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and has been released under investigation as officers continue to make enquiries.
