# Appeal after alleged theft of delivery van in Bournemouth

28 April 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for information after it was reported that a delivery van was stolen in Bournemouth.

The driver of the Asda vehicle reported that the van had been taken whilst he was making deliveries in Wellington Road at around 6.35pm on Wednesday 26 April 2017.

He had left his keys in the vehicle when making a delivery and returned to find the vehicle was gone.

The driver was informed by a member of the public that the van had been seen heading in the direction of Holdenhurst Road.

A tracker device in the van later identified that it had stopped at Brick Lane in Thorney Hill near Bransgore.

The NPAS helicopter assisted with the search for the vehicle, which was tracked via Ringwood to the Totton area, where it was recovered.

A 50-year-old man of no fixed abode was arrested on suspicion of theft and driving offences and has been released under investigation.

Investigations Officer Lucy Wickham of Dorset Police, said: "I am keen to speak to anybody who may have witnessed the Asda delivery vehicle in Wellington Road at the time of this incident and seen someone acting suspiciously in the area.

"I would also like to hear from the woman who spoke to the delivery driver shortly after the incident occurred."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 26:340. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
