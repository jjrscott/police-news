# Witness appeal after car tyres slashed in Shaftesbury

30 June 2016

* * *

Police in Shaftesbury are appealing for witnesses to come forward after car tyres were slashed in the town.

Sometime between 6pm on Thursday 23 June and 10am on Friday 24 June 2016 the tyres of three vehicles parked in a residential car park off Coles Crescent were damaged.

A Vauxhall Vectra had two tyres damaged, a Fiat Punto had three punctured and all four tyres were slashed on a Ford Focus.

A sharp implement was used to cause the damage.

Police Constable Charli Goddard, of North Dorset police, said: "Not only has this mindless act caused great inconvenience to the victims, but it was also extremely reckless and could have led to a very serious accident.

"I would urge anyone who knows who was responsible to please contact me."
