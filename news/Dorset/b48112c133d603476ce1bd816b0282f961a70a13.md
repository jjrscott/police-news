Officers are appealing for anyone with information to come forward following criminal damage to road signs at a village in North Dorset.

Dorset Police received a report at around 11.15am on Monday 30 November 2020 relating to damage to road signs at the entrance to Fontmell Magna in Mill Street.

It was reported that the damage appeared to have been caused by a firearm.

Inspector Simon Perry, of North Dorset police, said: "I understand there might be concern in the community in relation to this matter but I would like to reassure residents that a full investigation is underway.

"I would urge anyone who has seen any suspicious activity in the area recently or has any other information that might assist our enquiries to please contact us.

"Local officers will be increasing their patrols and can be approached by members of the public with any concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200180048. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
