# Witness appeal following attempted burglary in Poole

12 January 2017

* * *

Officers in Poole are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following an attempted burglary in the Upton area of the town.

At approximately 10.20pm on Tuesday 10 January 2017 offenders attempted to gain access to a construction site on Policeman's Lane.

Damage was caused to a padlock but nothing was stolen.

One of the offenders was described as a man wearing a light-coloured jacket. The second offender is described as a man wearing knee-high wellington boots and a light-coloured jacket.

Police Constable Mike Read, of Purbeck police, said: "I would like to hear from any members of the public who saw someone acting suspiciously in the Policeman's Lane area at the time of the incident.

"This is not the first time that this construction site has been targeted.

"On Monday 17 October 2016 offenders stole equipment worth approximately Â£10,000 from two containers on the site.

"I would also like to speak to anyone who has any information about either incident which may help me in my investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170004854. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
