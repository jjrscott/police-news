# Photo appeal after burglary in Gillingham

16 June 2017

* * *

Police are appealing for information after a unique motorcycle frame was stolen during a garage burglary in Gillingham.

The incident happened overnight between Monday 12 and Tuesday 13 June 2017 at an address on Bay Road.

A number of items were stolen including motorcycle parts, tools, a model aircraft, drones and other technical equipment. In particular, a bespoke motorbike racing frame of high value was taken.

Police Sergeant James Francis, of North Dorset police, said: "The images I am releasing are of the first prototype of the motorcycle frame that the victim has provided, but they look very similar to the frame that was taken. I would ask anyone who knows the whereabouts of the frame, or has been offered such items for sale, to please let us know.

"We believe the offenders may have used a 4x4 or a van to transport the stolen objects and that it would have taken at least two people to carry some of those items.

"I would appeal to anyone who witnessed any suspicious behaviour during the relevant times to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170088062. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
