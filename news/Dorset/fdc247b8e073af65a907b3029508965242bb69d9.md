# Appeal for information following incident involving dog in Christchurch

26 January 2021

* * *

Officers are appealing for anyone with information to come forward following an incident involving a dog in Christchurch.

On Wednesday 6 January 2021 the victim - a local woman aged in her 50s - parked on the slip road in Mudeford woods and began to get her dogs out of her car to go for a walk. The victim noticed a man and a boy nearby who had a Staffordshire Bull Terrier and an American Bull Dog that was tied to the fence on an extendable lead.

The American Bull Dog broke free from its lead and ran straight toward the victim and her two dogs.

The lead became wrapped around the victim's legs and she fell to the ground and hit her head. The victim sustained bruising to several parts of her body and a cut to her hand.

The man is described as white, around 40 years old, approximately five feet five inches tall and of large build with dark coloured receding hair. He was wearing dark jogging bottoms and a jacket.

The American Bull Dog is described as mainly white with tan-coloured patches and was pink underneath. The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is described as having black fur that was going grey and is believed to be called Lola.

The incident was reported to Dorset Police on Tuesday 19 January 2021.

Police Constable Jennie Sykes-Martin, of Dorset Police, said: "I appreciate this incident took place at the beginning of January, but I am appealing to anyone who recognises the man or his dogs from the descriptions given to please get in touch.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who may have any information to assist my enquiries."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210012968. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
