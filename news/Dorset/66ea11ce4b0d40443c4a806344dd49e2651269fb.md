20 September 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a reported assault in Christchurch are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The incident occurred at the We Buy Any Car garage at the Bailey Bridge Retail Park at around 2.50pm on Thursday 12 September 2019.

It was reported that a male customer was angry at the valuation of a car and allegedly shut a member of staff's hand in the car door, which resulted in a broken finger.

A 49-year-old man from New Milton has been arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent and has been released under investigation.

Police Constable Rob Cook, of Christchurch police, said: "We are continuing to make enquiries into this incident and I would urge any witnesses to contact us.

"I understand there were a number of people in the area at the time and I would like to hear from anyone with information that may assist our investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190143833. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
