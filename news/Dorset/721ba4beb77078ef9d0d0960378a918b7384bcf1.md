# Appeal for information following robbery in Sherborne

11 March 2021

* * *

Officers investigating a knifepoint robbery in Sherborne are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 6.45pm on Tuesday 9 March 2021 a local man aged in his 20s was walking through Pageant Gardens when he was approached by a male offender from behind. He produced a Swiss Army knife and demanded that the victim hand over his wallet.

The offender made off with the victim's wallet, containing Â£35 in cash. He is described as being around six feet tall, of slim build and was wearing a hooded top with Adidas stripes on the shoulder, a dark-coloured snood with a white skull on it pulled up over his face and white Nike trainers.

Police Sergeant Lee Turner, of Weymouth CID, said: "This must have been a distressing incident for the victim. We are continuing to support him and are carrying out a full investigation to identify the person responsible.

"I would urge anyone who was in the area of Pageant Gardens on the evening of Tuesday 9 March 2021 and witnessed any suspicious activity to please contact us.

"I would also ask anyone who lives in the area and has home CCTV systems, or any motorists who were in the vicinity and have dashcam fitted, to please check their footage for that evening for anything of relevance.

"Fortunately, incidents of this nature are rare for this area and local officers will be carrying out reassurance patrols over the coming days. They can be approached by members of the community with any concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210038416. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
