# Witness appeal following aggravated burglary in Bournemouth

04 June 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating an aggravated burglary in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At around 12.30am today, Sunday 4 June 2017, police received a report of an incident at an address in Salisbury Road in Boscombe.

The victim, a man aged in his 40s, heard a knock on his door and answered it to find three men, two black men and one white man.

One of the black men appeared to be carrying a firearm, which may have been a BB type gun.

The men entered the address, threatened the victim and demanded money from him.

A struggle ensued during which time the victim's girlfriend arrived at the address and witnessed what was happening.

The victim was pushed to the floor before the three men then left empty handed.

He sustained cuts and scratches during the incident but did not require hospital treatment.

Detective Constable John Hicken, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was a very frightening ordeal for the victim and his girlfriend and we are making every effort to find those responsible.

"I am appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident, or who has any information, to please contact us as soon as possible.

"Officers from the Neighbourhood Policing Team will be carrying out high-visibility patrols over the coming days to reassure the community and offer support and advice."
