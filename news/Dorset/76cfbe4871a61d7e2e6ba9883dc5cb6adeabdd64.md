# Officers and staff have been honoured at an awards ceremony for their service to Dorset

21 June 2018

Dorset Police held an awards event at Cobham Sports and Social Club in Wimborne, on Tuesday 19 June 2018. The event gathered family and friends to recognise the success of 28 officers and staff, as they were presented with their awards.

After nominations from both colleagues and members of the public, the awards were presented by the Chief Constable of Dorset Police, James Vaughan and Jacqueline Swift, the High Sheriff of Dorset.

Several officers were awarded with the Police Long Service and Good Conduct Medal by the High Sheriff.

This included Detective Sergeant Lynette Gibbs, who joined Dorset Police in October 1997. At 18 years of age she fulfilled her ambition to join the Force and quickly established herself as an able and competent officer. In June 2017 she joined the safeguarding referral team and continues to be a role model for others.

Police staff Karen Steer received her award for the Police Staff Long Service Medal. Karen joined Dorset Police in 1993, beginning her career as one of Dorset's first tape summarisers.

In 2003, the same year as she graduated from Bournemouth University, Karen was promoted to the role of Criminal Investigation Department (CID) admin manager.

Karen has always taken on challenging roles in her career and has also helped to raise over Â£26,000 for various charities during her time working for Dorset Police.

A number of other police officers and staff members received Chief Constable's Commendations. This included Detective Sergeant Sarah Gedge who was involved in a three year modern slavery investigation. The personal commitment shown by her went above and beyond what anyone could expect and helped to safeguard the lives of all four of the victims.

Six officers including Police Constable Susan Hillier and 'BE' her Police Dog, were presented with Crown Court Commendations by the High Sheriff. First on the scene PC Hillier challenged a large male exiting the block of flats where a disturbance had been reported. When further officers arrived to assist with a search of the area, a male was found lying on the floor with multiple stab wounds. The officers gave immediate medical attention until paramedics arrived.

Following the court trial in August 2017 His Honour, Judge Cutler CBE, commended all officers for their immense bravery, skill and great sense of public duty.

Chief Constable, James Vaughan, said: "These awards are a wonderful opportunity to honour the outstanding work and selflessness of our officers.

"All individuals are to be commended for their contribution to keeping Dorset safe, more often than not, in highly demanding or traumatic situations."
