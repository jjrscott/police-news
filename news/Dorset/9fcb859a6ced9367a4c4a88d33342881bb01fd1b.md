Detectives investigating an alleged robbery in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police was called at 2.18pm on Thursday 27 August 2020 to a report of a robbery at Barclays bank on Old Christchurch Road.

It is reported that a staff member was threatened with a knife by two men who demanded money and a quantity of cash was stolen. The staff member did not sustain any injuries.

Officers attended and carried out a search of the area. Following enquiries, a 27-year-old woman and two men, aged 39 and 37, were located and have been arrested on suspicion of robbery. All three - who are from the Bournemouth area - are currently assisting detectives with their enquiries.

Detective Sergeant Matt Cooke, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the area and saw any people or vehicles acting suspiciously to please get in touch.

"I would also urge anyone who may have captured any relevant footage on either a dashcam or their mobile phone to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200128776. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
