# Update â€“ further arrest in connection with fatal collision near Bere Regis

09 August 2018

* * *

A second man has been arrested in connection with a fatal collision near Bere Regis.

At 4.40pm on Saturday 14 July 2018 Dorset Police was called to reports of a three-vehicle collision on the westbound lane of the A35 Dorchester bypass near Bere Regis, just before the single carriageway becomes a dual carriageway.

The collision involved a white BMW, a white Land Rover Freelander and a silver Mercedes.

Very sadly the driver of the Freelander - who has been named by his family as 49-year-old David Grant-Jones - sustained serious injuries and died at the scene.

His wife, 59-year-old Heather, who was a front seat passenger in the vehicle, sustained serious injuries and was flown by air ambulance to Southampton General Hospital for treatment.

Three male occupants of the BMW, aged 26, 27 and 39, also sustained serious injuries and were taken to hospital for treatment.

No one from the Mercedes was injured.

A 38-year-old Ferndown man was previously arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and causing serious injury by dangerous driving and was released under investigation.

A 27-year-old Surrey man has also now been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and causing serious injury by dangerous driving and has been released under investigation.
