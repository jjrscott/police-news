Officers investigating a series of burglaries in a North Dorset village are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

A previous appeal was issued by Dorset Police in relation to a burglary in the Chapel Lane area of Yetminster between 5pm and 7.30pm on Wednesday 5 June 2019.

Since then the Force has received five further reports of residential burglaries in the village, which were reported between Thursday 6 June and Monday 10 June 2019.

The majority of the incidents are believed to have occurred during the daytime and have involved offenders forcing entry and stealing valuable items such as jewellery.

The further properties targeted were in Brister End, Queen Street, Church Street, Ryme Road and another in Chapel Lane.

Police Constable Simon Rogers, of Dorset Police, said: "I am appealing for anyone who has any information about these burglaries or who witnessed any suspicious activity in the Yetminster area, particularly between Wednesday 5 June and Monday 10 June 2019, to contact me.

"I would also like to take this opportunity to urge residents to remain vigilant and make sure their properties are left secure at all times.
