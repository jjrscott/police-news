# Family tribute following fatal collision in East Dorset

04 May 2019

* * *

The family of a man who died following a collision in East Dorset has issued a tribute.

Dorset Police was called at 8.46am on Tuesday 30 April 2019 to a report of a collision, involving a motorcycle, a van and a dropside lorry, outside Henbury Stud Farm near Sturminster Marshall.

Emergency services attended and very sadly the motorcyclist, 40-year-old Andrew Mann from Poole, was pronounced dead at the scene. The occupants of the other vehicles involved did not sustain any serious injuries.

Andrew's family has now issued the following statement: "Andrew, the beloved son of Tom and the late Mandy Mann, died tragically in a motorcycle collision.

"He leaves behind four devastated children and two loving and heartbroken sisters. Also hurting today are his grandmother, his nephews and nieces and other family members, friends and work colleagues.

"He will be missed so much by so many.

"The children and family need time to process and grieve and would ask that their privacy at this time be respected."
