# Witness appeal after collision in Weymouth

26 September 2016

* * *

Police are appealing for witnesses following a road traffic collision in Weymouth - with one man being arrested.

At around 12.50pm today, Monday 26 September 2016, officers spotted a suspicious vehicle on Portland Beach Road. The vehicle did not stop for officers when requested.

The vehicle - a blue Vauxhall Astra - was followed by officers. The car was seen to travel through the town along Buxton Road, Lanehouse Rocks Road, Abbotsbury Road, Radipole Park Drive and Dorchester Road before colliding with another vehicle - a green Mini Cooper - in Weymouth Way near to Chafey's roundabout.
Two police cars were also damaged in the incident.

The vehicle was abandoned and a 22-year-old Liverpool man was arrested on suspicion of driving offences a short time later and is currently assisting police with enquiries. Two police officers received minor injuries during the arrest.

The ambulance service attended as a precaution and the female driver of the Mini Cooper was treated for shock.

Weymouth Deputy Inspector Tony Burden said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or manner of driving of the Vauxhall Astra to contact police."
