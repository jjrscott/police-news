# Witness appeal following serious injury collision in Purbeck

30 October 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a serious injury road traffic collision in Purbeck are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

At around 8.45am on Wednesday 30 October 2019 Dorset Police received a report of a collision on Corfe Road in Stoborough near Wareham involving a street cleaning vehicle and a pedal cycle.

The cyclist, a local woman aged in her 70s, sustained life-threatening injuries and was taken by air ambulance to Southampton General Hospital. Her family has been informed and are being supported by officers.

The driver of the street cleaning vehicle was uninjured.

Road closures have been put in place to allow emergency services to deal with the incident.

Police Sergeant Nikki Burt, of the Serious Collision Investigation Team (SCIT), said: "Specialist officers remain at the scene carrying out a detailed investigation into the circumstances of this collision. I am appealing to any witnesses who may have seen either the vehicle or cyclist prior to the collision or the incident itself to come forward if they have not already spoken to us.

"I would also urge any motorists who were travelling in the area at the time and have dashcam fitted to their vehicle to please check their footage for anything relevant.

"Finally, I would like to thank members of the public for their patience and understanding as the road closures are in place. These are absolutely necessary to allow the emergency services to respond and for us to carry out an examination of the collision scene."
