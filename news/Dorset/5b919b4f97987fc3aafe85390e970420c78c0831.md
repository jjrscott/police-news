# Witness appeal following malicious fires on Portland

24 July 2016

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following five incidents of arson on Portland during one night.

The incidents happened between 4.56pm on Saturday 23 July 2016 and 1.03am on Sunday 24 July 2016.

Just before 5pm on Saturday a fire was reported at a disused show house near The Customs House, Castletown, which has been unoccupied for some years. One small fire was started inside the property and two small fires were started on the grass outside of the premises.

Just after 10pm during the same evening a vehicle fire was reported near to Atlantic House, Ayton Drive. A VW Polo was severely damaged by fire along with less serious damage to numerous vehicles parked near to it.

Between 0.41am and 1.03am on Sunday three further fires were reported. A Ford Transit van, parked along Castle Road, was severely damaged by fire. The other fires were reported to a hedge in Victoria Square and to some rubbish in Coronation Road. It is believed accelerant was used in the vehicle fires.

Detective Sergeant Jacqui Gravenor, of Weymouth CID, said: "These incidents have all occurred within a small area of Underhill on Portland.

"We believe the incidents are connected and are appealing for any witnesses to contact police and report any information that may lead to the identification of those responsible.

"While these incidents are unusual for this area and no one specific was targeted, considerable damage was caused to numerous vehicles.

"Officers from the Neighbourhood Policing Team will be in the area to reassure local residents."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55160111062.
