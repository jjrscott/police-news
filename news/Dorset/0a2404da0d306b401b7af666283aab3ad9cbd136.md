Detectives investigating an alleged serious assault in Bournemouth have charged a man.

Officers were called at 6.32am on Friday 18 August 2017 to reports of a serious assault on a 19-year-old man in Old Christchurch Road in the town centre.

The victim was reportedly approached from behind by an unknown man and slashed to the neck with a sharp bladed item.

He sustained a serious cut to his neck and was taken to hospital for treatment. He has since been released.

On Friday 18 August 2017 two men, aged 56 and 59 both from Bournemouth, were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.

Also, at around 6.15am on Sunday 20 August 2017, a 32-year-old man was arrested at an address in Bournemouth on suspicion of attempted murder.

The 59-year-old Bournemouth man has been charged with attempted murder and is due to appear before Poole Magistrates' Court today, Tuesday 22 August 2017.

The 56-year-old and 32-year-old men have both been released under investigation.

Detective Constable Matt Cooke, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the time of the incident and may have dashcam footage to please contact police.

"We are still keen to hear from any witnesses to the incident who have not already contacted us."
