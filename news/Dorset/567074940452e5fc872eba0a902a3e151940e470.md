# Further update - CCTV appeal following reported assault in Bournemouth

10 October 2018

* * *

A man arrested in connection with an assault at a shopping centre in Bournemouth has been released without charge.

At around 12.30pm on Sunday 24 June 2018 a member of the public reported that she witnessed an assault while shopping in Asda in Castlepoint.

Detailed enquiries have been carried out and a CCTV image of a man officers wished to speak with was issued by Dorset Police on Thursday 4 October 2018.

Yesterday, Tuesday 9 October 2018, a 33-year-old man from Bournemouth was arrested on suspicion of assault and using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause fear of or provoke unlawful violence.

He has since been released without charge and the investigation has now closed.
