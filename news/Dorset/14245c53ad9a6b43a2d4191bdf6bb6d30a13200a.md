# Witness appeal after suspicious fires in Weymouth

03 July 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for the public's help after arsonists set two large fires in Weymouth.

At around 2am today, Tuesday 3 July 2018, two areas of grassland were set alight near to Upwey railway station, by the footpath at the end of The Finches and Kestrel View.

Due to the dry ground and strong winds, the fires spread quickly and least one property was evacuated while Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service tackled the blaze.

Detective Constable Sarah Desmond, of Weymouth CID, said: "These fires were started deliberately and were extremely reckless as they could they have endangered the lives of local residents had they not been extinguished so quickly.

"I am appealing to anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious to please contact Dorset Police.

"From our early enquiries we have been informed that there was the sound of scrambler motorbikes shortly before the fires were first seen and I would urge anyone who may know who was riding these bikes to please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180103169. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
