# Witness appeal following attempted robbery in Ferndown

12 December 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an attempted robbery in Ferndown.

At around 8pm on Saturday 9 December 2017 two women walked along Ringwood Road near to the White Heather pub and passed two men. One appeared drunk and demanded a handbag from one of the women. He made threats to harm the victim with a knife, although no weapon was seen.

The victim refused to give the offender her bag and she and her friend - both aged in their 20s - continued and then called the police. Neither were physically injured during the incident.

The offender is described as white, of medium build, five feet nine inches tall and approximately 25 years old. He had a scruffy beard and wore a grey tracksuit, short dark-coloured hooded top and trainers.

The second man is described as white, aged in his 20s and five feet six inches tall. He had a short beard and wore a grey tracksuit and a black coat.

Police Constable James Perks, of Ferndown police, said: "An investigation is underway to identify the two men involved, including CCTV enquiries. I would ask anyone who was in the area at the relevant time and saw these two men to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170191316. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
