# Identity of man found dead sought

15 October 2016

* * *

Officers are asking for the public's help in identifying a man who was found dead in Sherborne.

The man was discovered in the area of West Mill Lane in the early hours of Friday 14 October 2016. Despite various enquiries, officers have not been able to establish who he is.

He is described as white, in his 40s and of very thin build. He has dark receding hair and a small ponytail. He also has a beard and moustache that was trimmed.

The man was wearing a blue jacket with a blue woollen jumper underneath, beige trousers and black trainers. A pair of spectacles and a small bunch of keys were located but nothing else that would help to identify him.

Detective Sergeant Jacqui Gravenor, of Western CID, said: "There are no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death and the coroner has been notified.

"We are appealing for anyone with information about the man or his identity to contact police as soon as possible."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 14:26.
