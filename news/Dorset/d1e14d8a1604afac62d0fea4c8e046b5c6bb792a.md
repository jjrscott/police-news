# Appeal after street robbery in Bournemouth

11 October 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following a street robbery in the centre of Bournemouth.

The incident happened at around 11.55pm on Wednesday 10 October 2018 at the bottom of Richmond Hill near to NatWest bank.

The victim - a local man aged in his 30s - was walking in the direction of Richmond Gardens when he was approached by another man from the direction of Old Christchurch Road, who engaged him in conversation.

Moments later the victim was punched once in the face. His Apple iPhone and bank cards were stolen.

The offender then ran up the hill and turned off onto Post Office Road. He was described by the victim as being of Middle-Eastern appearance, aged in his mid 20s, around five feet nine inches tall and of slim build. He was wearing a bright orange top, dark-coloured jacket, black baseball cap and cargo-style trousers. He also had dark facial hair around one centimetre thick.

The victim was taken to hospital for treatment to a suspected broken nose and bruising to his eye.

Detective Sergeant Karen Penn, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the time and witnessed the incident, or saw anyone acting suspiciously, to please contact Dorset Police."
