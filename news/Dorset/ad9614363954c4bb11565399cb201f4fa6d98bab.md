Detectives are appealing for witnesses following an alleged assault in Poole.

Officers were called to Ringwood Road at around 12.30am yesterday, Monday 24 April 2017, to reports that a cyclist had been assaulted near to Tesco Express.

The victim - a Bournemouth man aged in his 30s - sustained cuts to his head and body and was taken to Poole Hospital for treatment. His injuries are not life-threatening or life-changing.

A 29-year-old man from Poole was arrested on suspicion of assault and has been released under investigation.

The victim and arrested man are known to each other.

Detective Constable Mark Holmes, of Bournemouth CID, said: "From our early investigations we have established that this was not a road rage incident. "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or saw a cyclist and another man in Ringwood Road at the relevant time to please contact Dorset Police."
