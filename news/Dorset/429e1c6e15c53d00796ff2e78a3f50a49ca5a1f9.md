# Witness appeal following assault in Poole

06 July 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating an assault in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 10pm on Friday 29 June 2018 the victim, a man aged in his 40s, had been at The Cabin on Poole Quay when he left the premises and walked up Old Orchard to an off licence.

As he left the off licence and walked back toward the quay, he became aware of two men behind him. When he was near to the junction with Prosperous Street he was punched or pushed from behind, causing him to fall to the ground and hit his face.

The man, who is Romanian and speaks limited English, suffered a facial fracture below his eye as a result. He was wearing a red AFC Bournemouth football shirt and dark shorts at the time of the assault.

Detective Constable Andy Hale, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This appears to have been an unprovoked assault and we are making a number of enquiries to identify the men responsible, including investigating CCTV opportunities in the area.

"I am also appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or who has any information that can assist our investigation to contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk, via 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180101335.
