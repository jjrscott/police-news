# Witness appeal after reports of shots being fired in Weymouth

23 May 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for anyone with information to come forward after reports of shots being fired in Weymouth.

Dorset Police received a report at 5.53pm yesterday, Tuesday 22 May 2018, of shots being fired - possibly from an air weapon - in Marsh Road near to the Asda supermarket in Weymouth.

There were also reports of a number of men seen running from the scene.

Officers, including armed officers, attended and a thorough search of the area was conducted.

There have been no injuries reported to police.

At this stage no arrests have been made and a detailed investigation is being carried out.

A cartridge was recovered at the scene but the firearm involved has yet to be confirmed and a cordon is currently in place in Marsh Road to allow crime scene investigators to examine the area.

Detective Sergeant Dave Horn, of Weymouth CID, said: "We have been making a number of enquiries into this incident including examining CCTV footage and inspection of the scene.

"We have also spoken to a number of witnesses, but I am appealing for anyone with information about this incident or who was involved and has not already spoken to police to contact us.

"There will be a heavy police presence in the area as officers carry out their investigations but at this stage we believe those involved were known to each other and there is not any wider threat to members of the public."

Inspector Steve Yeoman, of Weymouth police, said: "We understand that this incident will have caused some concern for the local community, but I would like to reassure members of the public that an extensive investigation is being carried out to identify those involved.

"As well as officers investigating the incident, members of the local neighbourhood policing team will be increasing their presence in the area for community reassurance and can be approached with any concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180077879. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
