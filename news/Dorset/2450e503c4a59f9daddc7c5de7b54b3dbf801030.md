# Witness appeal following burglary in Bournemouth

29 March 2019

* * *

Detectives investigating a burglary at an address in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses and offering crime prevention advice.

At around 1am today, Friday 29 March 2019, a woman was asleep in her home in Hankinson Road in the Winton area when she was woken by the sound of someone entering her bedroom.

She looked up and saw an unknown man searching through a chest of drawers before walking across to the other side of the room.

The victim challenged the man and he immediately ran out of the room and property.

Nothing was taken from the address. Officers attended and carried out a search of the area but no offender was located.

Detective Sergeant Adam Gill, of Dorset Police's Priority Crime Team, said: "This incident has left the victim shaken and will understandably cause concern among other residents in the area. I would like to reassure them that a thorough investigation is underway in a bid to identify this man and I would urge anyone who may have seen anything suspicious to please contact Dorset Police.

"Our enquiries have established that the offender gained access to the address by walking through the unlocked front door. I would like to remind all householders to ensure they lock their doors and windows during the day and at night.

"Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team can be approached with any community concerns."
