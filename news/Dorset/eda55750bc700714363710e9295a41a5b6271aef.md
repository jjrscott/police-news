# Urgent public warning following break to vet practice in Weymouth

19 July 2019

* * *

Officers are issuing an urgent warning to the public after offenders gained access to a veterinary practice in Weymouth and stole a quantity of dangerous drugs.

At 8.27am today, Friday 19 July 2019, Dorset Police was called to reports of a burglary at Moorcroft Veterinary Practice in Dorchester Road.

A cabinet that securely housed the practice's dangerous drugs was forced open and the entire contents stolen, including ketamine and euthanasia drugs.

Chief Inspector Lance Cliff, of Dorset Police, said: "We are sending out an urgent warning to the public about these drugs now being in public circulation. These drugs are only normally administered under clinical supervision. Anyone taking them is putting their health at serious at risk. Taken in excess these drugs could lead to serious injury or death.

"It is imperative that we locate these drugs to ensure no one comes to harm.

"Anyone who thinks they've taken any of these drugs should go straight to A&E and take the packaging with them. You don't know how you will react to a particular drug or medicine. Everyone is different and drugs can affect people in different ways.

"I would like to get a message out to anyone involved in the misuse of drugs in the Dorset area to be aware that use of such substances can prove fatal to the user.

"Finally, I would also appeal to anyone with information about the whereabouts of these drugs, illicit drug supply or availability of non-prescribed medicines to make police aware immediately."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190111113. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
