07 March 2019

* * *

Detectives investigating an incident that resulted in the arrests of two people in Dorchester town centre are appealing for any witnesses to come forward.

Dorset Police was called at 10.26am on Wednesday 6 March 2019 to reports of a male who was believed to be intoxicated walking in the road in High West Street.

Officers attended and a male suspect made off from them, heading up High West Street to the Top O'Town roundabout before turning left into Cornwall Road and then into Princes Street, where he was detained.

A 16-year-old boy from Bournemouth was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply a class C drug, assaulting a police officer and possessing a stun device. He was taken to Dorset County Hospital as a precaution.

A 19-year-old man from Dorchester, who tried to intervene, was arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly in a public place, obstructing or resisting an officer in the execution of their duty, possession of cannabis and assault.

Both of the arrested males are assisting officers with enquiries.

During the course of the arrests officers deployed a Taser. An officer sustained a wrist injury during the incident and was taken to Dorset County Hospital for treatment.

Detective Sergeant Simon Austin, of Weymouth CID, said: "We are carrying out an investigation into this matter and I am appealing to any witnesses to it or behaviour of those involved prior to the incident to contact us."
