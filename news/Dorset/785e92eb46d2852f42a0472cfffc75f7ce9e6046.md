# Witness appeal following burglary in Bournemouth

03 December 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating a burglary in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 7.50pm on Friday 30 November 2018 one of the occupants was asleep in their bedroom at the property in Setley Gardens when they were woken by an unknown man entering and shining a torch in their face.

After being disturbed the man ran down the stairs, where he was joined by another man as they left through the rear of the property.

A quantity of cash is believed to have been taken from a wallet in the house.

Detective Constable Jo Regan, of Dorset Police's Priority Crime Team, said: "This must have been a distressing experience for the victim who disturbed the burglars and we are carrying out a full investigation to identify the offenders involved.

"I am appealing for anyone who witnessed and suspicious activity in the area on the evening of Friday 30 November 2018 or who has any information about this incident to please contact police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180192923. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
