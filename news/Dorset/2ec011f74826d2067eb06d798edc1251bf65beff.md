# Update â€“ appeal for good Samaritan to come forward following alleged assault in Weymouth

02 November 2018

* * *

A woman who came to the aid of the victim of an alleged assault on a vulnerable man in Weymouth has come forward following an appeal.

Dorset Police was called to the Weymouth & Portland Borough Council building on Commercial Road at around 3.15pm on Monday 29 October 2018.

The vulnerable 46-year-old victim was brought in to the reception area by a woman reporting that he had been assaulted and was very upset.

It was alleged the victim was hit across the face in the area of the Commercial Road car park. He did not require medical treatment.

The woman who assisted the victim left the scene prior the arrival of police but following a public appeal has now made contact with police to assist officers with their investigation.

A 15-year-old boy from Weymouth has been arrested on suspicion of assault in connection with the incident and has been released under investigation as officers continue their enquiries.

Police Constable Ryan Lloyd, of Weymouth police, said: "We would like to thank everyone who shared our appeal for this good Samaritan to come forward and I am grateful to the woman for making contact with us.

"We are continuing to appeal for any witnesses who have not already spoken to police, or anyone with information that might assist our investigation, to get in touch."
