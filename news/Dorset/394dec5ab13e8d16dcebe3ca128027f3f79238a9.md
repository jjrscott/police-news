# Witness appeal following criminal damage to telephone kiosk near Bridport

26 February 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating an incident of criminal damage to a telephone kiosk near Bridport are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward.

At around 3.15am on Saturday 24 February 2018 a resident living near to the B3066 at Melplash was woken by the sound of an explosion.

In the morning it was established that a BT kiosk had been damaged. Part of the roof had been lifted, the door had blown off and the glass had blown across the road.

Detective Sergeant Simon Austin, of Weymouth CID, said: “The explosion caused considerable damage to the telephone kiosk and was a reckless act of mindless vandalism.”

The Melplash incident is being linked to a second incident.

At 7.48am on Thursday 22 February 2018 we received a report that an explosion had been heard overnight and a wheelie bin in the Trinity Way and Drew Close area had been severely damaged.

Detective Sergeant Austin added: “These incidents have understandably caused concern for local residents. Enquiries are underway to establish who is responsible for these offences, including CCTV.

“I would urge anyone who knows who was responsible for these incidents to please contact Dorset Police.

“Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team are available and can be approached by members of the community with any concerns.”

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk, or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180029299. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
