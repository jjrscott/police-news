# Police urge people to be respectful and protect our beautiful county

05 August 2020

* * *

Visitors and local residents alike are reminded to take their rubbish home with them, respect social distancing rules and not to use disposable barbecues, in an effort to protect Dorset for everyone.
During the summer months some of the area's beauty spots and beaches become extremely busy. Local residents and tourists are encouraged to act responsibly and respectfully when out and about this summer to help protect the county and its communities.

Neighbourhood Policing Chief Inspector Jim Beashel of Dorset Police, said: "The recent hot weather has brought crowds of visitors and residents to our beaches and beauty spots, the majority of whom behave in a considerate and respectful way.
"As it was widely publicised during the last heatwave, a lot of litter was left behind on our beaches and there has already been a lot of devastation caused to local areas as a result of BBQs not being disposed of safely.
"Everyone is welcome to Dorset, we just ask that people be responsible by disposing of litter correctly and act respectfully so everyone can enjoy the beauty that Dorset has to offer."
Dorset Police and Crime Commissioner Martyn Underhill, added: "We want to welcome visitors back to Dorset, but it's important everyone continues to respect our communities.
"So please, enjoy the many things our county has to offer, but act responsibly, practice social distancing and remember to take your litter home with you."
This advice is being given to help everyone enjoy the county as safely and respectfully as possible. So please stay safe, respect what Dorset has to offer, protect our county and its communities and enjoy this beautiful part of England.
For advice on safety guidelines when in public and information on how to protect and respect our county, please go to our website, www.dorset.police.uk/safersummer
