# Witness appeal following assault in Bournemouth

27 August 2016

* * *

Detectives in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following an assault in the town.

The incident happened at around 8pm on Friday 26 August 2016 in Kings Park. It was reported that a 46-year-old Bournemouth man was near the skate park when he had an unknown liquid thrown in his face. He sustained serious eye injuries.

The offender is described as a man of mixed race and slim build, with a thin face, thin nose and a natural African hair style - two to three inches in length. He was wearing a long sleeved red jumper and blue jeans.

Detective Constable Jane Millard, of Bournemouth CID, said: "At this time it is not known what kind of liquid was thrown at the victim.

"I believe two male witnesses assisted the victim with first aid at the scene and I am very keen to talk to them as they may be able to assist me with my investigation.

"I am also appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident, has seen a man matching the description in the area at the time or has any information about the offender to come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 27:12. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
