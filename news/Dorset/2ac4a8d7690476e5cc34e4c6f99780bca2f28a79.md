# Witness appeal following sexual assault in Poole

13 March 2017

* * *

Officers investigating a sexual assault at Poole bus station are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At around 5pm on Monday 6 March 2017 a 16-year-old girl was at the station waiting to catch the number 17 bus when she was approached by an unknown man.

He put his hands around her back as if to give her a hug and spoke to her. His arms then dropped to her bottom.

As the victim tried to move away, the offender attempted to kiss her. The victim managed to free herself from the man and walk away.

The offender is described as white, aged in his 20s, of thin build and around five feet four inches tall. He was clean shaven and was wearing a white shirt with a dark-coloured suit jacket and jeans. He smelt of alcohol.

Police Constable Cherry Thomas, of Poole police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident, or saw a smartly-dressed man matching the description given, to please contact Dorset Police."
