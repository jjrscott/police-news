A woman is due to appear in court charged in connection with a fatal collision in Bournemouth.

At around 5pm on Wednesday 23 November 2016 a road traffic collision occurred in New Road close to the Northbourne roundabout involving a pedestrian and a brown Honda Jazz.

The pedestrian - a local 84-year-old-woman - was taken to Poole Hospital but sadly died on the evening of Friday 25 November 2016 as a result of her injuries.

A 79-year-old woman from Ferndown has been issued with a postal requisition to appear before Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 28 April 2017 charged with causing death by careless driving.
