# Update to investigation following reported assault in Christchurch

21 May 2018

* * *

Three men arrested in connection with a reported serious assault in the Christchurch area have been released from investigation without charge.

Shortly before 10.15pm on Thursday 1 March 2018 Dorset Police received a report of an altercation involving four men in Barrack Road, near to the junction with Elizabeth Avenue.

A man aged in his 20s and from Bournemouth sustained slash wounds - believed to have been caused by a knife - to his face, arm and finger. He was taken to hospital for treatment to his injuries, which were not life-threatening.

Three men aged 20, 24 and 27 - all from Bournemouth - were arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm with intent and released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Following a thorough investigation and a lack of support from the victim, all three men have now been informed there will be no further police action in relation to this incident.
