# Witness appeal after arson in Bournemouth

27 January 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses after an arson in Bournemouth.

The incident happened at around 2.30am on Friday 13 January 2017 on Barnes Crescent.

A large trailer was set on fire and completely destroyed. Petrol was also poured through the window of a neighbouring van and an attempt was made to set it alight.

Nobody was injured in the incident.

Police Constable Simon Giles, of Bournemouth police, said: "It is very fortunate that the fire did not spread to the van as it could have had catastrophic consequences given the fuel and flammable liquids on board.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or saw anyone acting suspiciously in the area at the relevant time to contact me."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170006063. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
