# Witness appeal following robbery in Bournemouth

16 June 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating a robbery in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward.

The incident happened at around 6.35pm on Friday 15 June 2018 on the cycle path that runs between the A338 and Queens Park near Cooper Dean roundabout.

The victim, a 14-year-old local boy, was cycling on his black mountain bike - a Cube Stereo 160, with white forks, Fox suspension and black saddle - when two male teenagers purposely stood in his way preventing from carrying on.

One of the offenders pushed the victim in the chest and grabbed him by the neck before threatening to stab him, but no knife was seen. They then pushed him off the bike and one of them cycled off with it while the other one ran next to it.

Both offenders have been described as white, between 16 and 19 years old, about five feet 10 inches tall and of medium build. One of them had gapped teeth and was wearing a black baseball cap and a dark and light grey hooded top.

Detective Constable Honor Mcadam, of Bournemouth CID, said: "Thankfully the victim was not injured. However, it deeply upset him and he was visibly shaking.

"I want to ensure we find the offenders and we are making a number of enquiries.

"Hoping that the public is able to assist me in my investigation, I am appealing for any witnesses to the incident, anyone with information about those responsible or where the stolen bike might be to contact police as soon as possible."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180092389. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
