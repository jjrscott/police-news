15 November 2017

* * *

The family of a man who sadly died following a collision in Bridport is paying tribute to him.

At 11.15pm on Monday 13 November 2017 a two vehicle collision occurred on the A35 Sea Road South close to the Crown roundabout involving a silver Mercedes convertible and a black Mitsubishi L200 pick-up truck.

Sadly, the driver of the Mitsubishi, 64-year-old Steve Spear from Bridport, died at the scene.

Steve's family has issued the following statement: "Family and friends are devastated by the loss of Steve Spear who was tragically killed in the crash on the A35 in Bridport on Monday night.

"Steve was a well known and loved member of the Bridport community. He was a loving husband, father, stepfather, grandfather, brother and friend to many. A big personality who will be hugely missed by many people in the town and beyond.

"We ask for privacy at this time while we come to terms with our loss."
