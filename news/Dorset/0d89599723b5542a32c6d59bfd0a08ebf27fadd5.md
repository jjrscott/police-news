Two men have been arrested in connection with a reported theft in Christchurch.

At around 2.15pm on Monday 4 November 2019 it was reported that two men entered the driveway of Volsen LTD on Barrack Road and allegedly stole a roll of white roofing fleece that had just been delivered.

The roofing fleece was reportedly found abandoned a short distance away.

Following enquiries by officers, two men - both aged 25 and from Bournemouth - have been arrested on suspicion of theft and have been released under investigation.
