Officers are appealing for two members of the public who helped during a reported attempted robbery in Bournemouth to come forward.

At around 11.45pm on Thursday 18 February 2021 the victim - a woman aged in her 30s - was walking on Grants Close when she was approached by a man. It is reported that he tried to take her mobile phone, before punching her in the face.

It Is alleged that the man then pushed the victim over and tried to take her bank card.

The victim sustained reddening to her face that did not require hospital treatment.

Following enquiries, a 40-year-old man of no fixed abode was arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and attempted robbery. He has been released on police bail pending further enquiries.

The victim and arrested man are known to each other.

Police Constable Dan Byrne, of Bournemouth police, said: "We have been carrying out a number of enquiries into this incident, including house-to-house visits and CCTV trawls of the area.

"I am aware that two male members of the public intervened in the incident and reportedly pulled the man away from the victim. I am appealing directly to these people to come forward as they may have important information to assist my investigation.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who may have any information to assist my enquiries."
