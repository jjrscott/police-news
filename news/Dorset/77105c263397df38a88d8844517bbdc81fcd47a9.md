# Update â€“ CCTV appeal following report of theft by finding in Bridport

03 July 2019

* * *

A man has come forward following a CCTV appeal issued in relation to a report of theft by finding in Bridport.

The incident occurred at around 10am on Friday 24 May 2019 at the RSPCA charity shop in West Street.

It was reported that a woman aged in her 40s dropped her purse on the floor but did not notice and a man was then seen on CCTV to pick it up and place it in a bag before leaving the shop.

Following a CCTV appeal, a man has now come forward and is assisting officers with enquiries. The purse and its contents have also been returned. No arrests have been made.
