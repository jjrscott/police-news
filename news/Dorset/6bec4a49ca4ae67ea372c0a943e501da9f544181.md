# Charges following alleged robbery at shop in Poole

11 November 2018

* * *

Detectives have charged two men in connection with an alleged robbery at a shop in Poole.

The incident happened at around 11.20am on Tuesday 6 November 2018 at St Mary's News on St Mary's Road.

It was reported that two men wearing scarfs around their faces entered the store and threatened members of staff with a weapon. The men then reportedly took a quantity of cigarettes, cash and a phone before making off.

No one sustained any physical injuries.

A 28-year-old Poole man and a 27-year-old Bournemouth man have now been charged with robbery and possession of an imitation firearm. They are both due to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Monday 12 November 2018.

A 25-year-old Poole woman arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit robbery was released without charge.

Despite the charges officers would like to renew their appeal for any witnesses in the area of Fernside Road, St Mary's Road, Bird's Hill Road and Parkstone Road between around 10.45am and 11.30am on Tuesday 6 November 2018. They are especially interested in anyone who has dashcam footage in those specific areas that shows a black Vauxhall Corsa with a 08 number plate.
