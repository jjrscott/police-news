# Witness appeal after reported fail-to-stop fatal collision in Dorchester

27 December 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses after a reported fail-to-stop fatal collision in Dorchester.

Police were called at 7.46pm today, Wednesday 27 December 2017, to reports of a collision between a pedestrian and a car on The Grove.

The 39-year-old female pedestrian was taken to Dorset County Hospital, but she sadly died from the injuries sustained. Her next of kin have been informed and the coroner notified.

The road is likely to be closed for some time to allow investigators to examine the scene.

A man has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and is assisting police with enquiries. An Audi car has also been seized to assist with the investigation.

Inspector Joe Pardey, of Dorset Police's traffic unit, said: "We have specially-trained officers supporting the woman's family at this time.

"A full investigation into the exact circumstances of the collision is underway and I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 27:349. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
