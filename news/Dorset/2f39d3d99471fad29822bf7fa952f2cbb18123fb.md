# Witness appeal following serious injury collision in Verwood

05 July 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam to come forward as they investigate a serious injury collision in Verwood.

Dorset Police received a report at 7.49am on Sunday 5 July 2020 of a collision on Black Hill, at the junction with Crescent Road, involving a black Aprilia motorcycle and a black Volkswagen Golf.

Officers attended, along with the ambulance service, and the motorcyclist - a local man aged in his 50s - was taken to Poole Hospital for treatment to injuries that were believed to be serious. It was subsequently reported that he was being transferred to Southampton General Hospital and his condition is believed to be life-threatening. His family has been informed.

A 33-year-old Bournemouth man has been arrested on suspicion of driving offences and is assisting officers with their enquiries.

Road closures were put in place to allow the emergency services to respond to the incident and were lifted shortly after 11am.

Sergeant Mark Scammell, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are of course with the injured motorcyclist and his family at this time and we hope he makes a full recovery.

"We are continuing to investigate the circumstances of this collision and I would urge any witnesses or anyone who was driving in the area at the time and may have relevant dashcam footage to please contact us.

"Finally, I would like to thank members of their public for their patience and understanding while the road closures were in place."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 5:122. Alternatively, or alternatively to stay 100% anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
