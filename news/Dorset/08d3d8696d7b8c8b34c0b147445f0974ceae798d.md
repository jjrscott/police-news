Detectives investigating the death of a man in Shaftesbury have made two arrests.

On Tuesday 17 October 2017 the ambulance service was called to an address in Lane Side following reports that a local man had suffered a cardiac arrest.

Sadly the 46-year-old man died on Wednesday 25 October 2017. His next of kin have been informed and the coroner notified.

Detective Sergeant Simon Austin, of Weymouth CID, said: "We are treating this as a suspected drug-related death.

"I am keen to hear from anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area on the relevant date or who has any information, no matter how small, to please contact Dorset Police."

A 39-year-old man from Shaftesbury has been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, supplying a controlled class A drug and administering a poison with intent to endanger life/inflict grievous bodily harm.

A 38-year-old man, also from Shaftesbury, has been arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of a class A drug and perverting the course of justice.

They have both been released under investigation.
