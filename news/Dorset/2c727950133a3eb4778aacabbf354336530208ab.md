# Appeal after assault involving dog walkers in Bournemouth

05 March 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses after a man was assaulted following an altercation between two dog walkers in Bournemouth.

The incident happened at around 1.45pm on Thursday 22 February 2018 on Southbourne Coast Road.

The victim - a man aged in his 80s - took his friend's Jack Russell out for a walk near to a large open grass area next to Solent Beach car park.

He let the dog off the lead, when a large German Shepherd-type dog came bounding toward the Jack Russell, grabbed it in its jaws and pinned it to the ground.

The victim went over to the dogs as fast as he could. Before he got there, a man - believed to be the owner of the German Shepherd - appeared and tried to break the dogs apart.

A verbal altercation took place between both men, before the victim was headbutted and fell to the ground, causing a nose bleed.

By the time he got himself back to his feet, the man had walked off in the direction of the beach. The victim did not require medical treatment.

The offender is described as white, around five feet eleven inches tall and of slim build. He had a ginger-coloured beard and was wearing a black beanie hat, brown jacket and dark-coloured jeans or trousers.

Police Constable Dan Byrne, of Bournemouth police, said: "A number of enquiries have been made since the incident. No CCTV has so far been identified and we spoke to potential witnesses shortly after the incident who were unable to identify the offender.

"I am now making a public appeal to ask anyone who witnessed the incident or is able to identify the offender by the description given to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180028306. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
