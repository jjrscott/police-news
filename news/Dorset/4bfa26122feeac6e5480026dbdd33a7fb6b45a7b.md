# Witness appeal following reported assaults in Weymouth

10 September 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following reported assaults in Weymouth.

At around 4.15am on Saturday 8 September 2018 a man was reportedly assaulted on The Esplanade. The victim, aged in his 20s and from Bridgwater in Somerset, sustained a suspected broken jaw.

A short time later at about 5.05am officers were called by the ambulance service to reports of an assault in Maiden Street in which a local man aged in his 20s sustained serious head injuries. He was taken to hospital for treatment. His condition is not believed to be life-threatening.

A 40-year-old local man was arrested nearby on suspicion of two counts of inflicting grievous bodily harm and has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

At 6.30pm on Saturday 8 September 2018 Dorset Police was called by staff at Southampton General Hospital who reported that a 27-year-old man had been brought into hospital with serious head injuries. It is not known whether he sustained the injuries as a result of a fall or an assault. Subsequent enquiries have revealed that the man was in Maiden Street in the early hours of that day.

Detective Constable George Graham, of Weymouth CID, said: "Investigations are now underway into all three incidents and I would urge anyone who was in the Maiden Street area between 3am and 7am on Saturday 8 September 2018 and witnessed an assault or discovered a man with injuries to please contact Dorset Police."
