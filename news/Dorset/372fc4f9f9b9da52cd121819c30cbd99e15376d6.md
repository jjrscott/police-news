# Update - woman charged following alleged assault in Weymouth

30 October 2018

* * *

A woman has been charged in relation to an alleged serious assault in Weymouth.

Dorset Police was called at 6.58pm on Sunday 28 October 2018 to reports of an assault on Ranelagh Road.

It is alleged that a woman was assaulted by another woman causing a cut to her face.

The victim - a 19-year-old local woman - was taken to hospital with injuries that are not thought to be life-threatening.

The weapon allegedly involved remains outstanding and detectives are appealing to anyone who comes across a bladed weapon in the area not to touch it, but report it immediately to police.

A 22-year-old woman from Weymouth has been charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent, threatening a person with a blade or sharply pointed object in a public place and harassment. She is due to appear before Poole Magistrates' Courts today, Tuesday 30 October 2018.

It is believed both women are known to each other.
