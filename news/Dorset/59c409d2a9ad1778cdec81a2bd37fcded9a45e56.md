A man is due to appear in court in connection with a serious injury collision in North Dorset.

Dorset Police received a report at 5.49pm on Thursday 8 October 2020 of a collision involving a black Nissan Micra and a black Yamaha motorcycle on Landshire Lane near to the Gibbs Marsh Trading Estate in Stalbridge.

The rider of the motorcycle - a man aged in his 20s from Somerset - sustained serious injuries and was taken to Southampton General Hospital by air ambulance. He has since left hospital.

Following enquiries, a 43-year-old man from Templecombe in Somerset has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 13 April 2021 for an offence of driving without due care and attention.
