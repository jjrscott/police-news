# Witness appeal after criminal damage in Weymouth

10 August 2016

* * *

Police in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following criminal damage to a stone wall.

The wall, which is located on the trail off Louviers Road at the top of Lorton Meadow in the town, had initially been damaged sometime in June 2016.

It had been repaired by the Dorset Wildlife Trust, who maintain the wall, but a second incident of criminal damage was reported to police on Friday 5 August 2016.

DWT Communications Officer Sally Welbourn, said: "This unique stone way-point not only marks the start of the legacy trail from the 2012 Olympics, but is also a place for the local community and visitors to enjoy views across the Lorton Valley Nature Park.

"We are shocked at the destruction which has occurred here and hope that anyone who can shed light on the perpetrators will come forward to ensure that this doesn't happen again.

"The time and money it takes to repair it could compromise the valuable work Dorset Wildlife Trust do to protect wildlife."

Police Constable Chris Bevins, of Weymouth police, said: "It is believed the stones of the wall have been dislodged by force by either someone kicking them or smashing them with other rocks.

"I am appealing to anyone who has information, or has witnessed this occurring, to contact police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 5:282. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
