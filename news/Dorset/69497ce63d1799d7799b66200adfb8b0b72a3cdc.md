A woman is due to appear in court in connection with a reported assault in Weymouth.

At 3.30am on Tuesday 30 January 2018 Dorset Police was called to Actors Bar in Maiden Street following reports that two women had been punched in the face.

Officers attended and as one police constable went to detain a woman at the scene he was reportedly assaulted. He was taken to hospital for treatment to injuries to his hand and jaw.

The woman also reportedly spat at a detention officer when she was taken to the Weymouth custody suite.

An 18-year-old Weymouth woman was arrested and has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Friday 6 April 2018 for two offences of assault, assaulting a police constable in the execution of their duty and assaulting a designated or accredited person.
