Detectives are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following an attempted robbery in Poole.

The incident happened at around 8pm on Friday 18 November 2016 when the victim, a 50-year-old Poole man, was exiting the newsagent on the junction of Poole Road and Bourne Valley Road.

He was approached by a man demanding money.

The offender grabbed the victim by his fleece and pulled it over his head before hitting him. He then threw the victim into the road where he was hit by oncoming cars.

The victim managed to escape after the offender attempted to drag him onto Princess Road.

As a result of the incident, the victim sustained a broken leg and broken arm. Nothing was stolen.

The offender is described as white, six feet tall and aged in his early 30s. He was clean shaven with short dark brown hair.

Detective Constable Matt Bradley, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the incident or has any information about who was responsible to contact Dorset Police.

"I would particularly like to hear from the drivers or passengers in the vehicles that struck the victim during the incident."

No arrests have been made.
