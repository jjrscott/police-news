Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a fatal collision on Portland.

At around 4.55pm today, Tuesday 14 March 2017, a serious collision occurred in New Road involving a single-decker First Bus, a white Citroen Relay Luton van registered to a company from Dorchester and a blue Alfa Romeo registered to a man from Portland.

The driver of the bus - a 59-year-old local man - was pronounced dead at the scene. His family have been informed and the coroner notified.

There were four passengers on board the bus at the time of the collision. One sustained a minor injury.

The van driver sustained minor injuries and the Alfa Romeo driver was uninjured.

The air ambulance landed nearby to assist.

Officers closed the road at the junction with High Street and Yeates Roundabout while the emergency services dealt with the incident. It reopened just after 8.15pm.

Police Constable Jason Green, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision to please contact Dorset Police.

"The road was completely blocked following the incident and I would like to thank motorists for their patience and understanding while emergency services dealt with the scene."
