# Man released without charge following reported assault in Weymouth

27 July 2017

* * *

A man arrested in connection with a reported assault in Weymouth has been released without charge.

An investigation was launched after a man was found with a head injury in the alleyway that runs between King Street and Jubilee Close at around 2.30pm on Tuesday 25 July 2017.

The man, aged in his 40s, was taken to hospital and treated for his injury. It was later confirmed that it was not a new injury, but a previous wound that had re-opened.

A 37-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm has now been released without charge.

Detectives are not looking for anyone else in connection with this incident.
