# Appeal for information after theft of sheep in North Dorset

20 April 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward after around 50 sheep were stolen from a farm near Blandford.

At around 7am on Wednesday 18 April 2018 it was discovered that the sheep had been taken from a field in the area of Hayward's Lane near Child Okeford overnight.

The sheep were last seen at around 6pm on the evening of Tuesday 17 April 2018.

There were a total of 150 sheep in the field and the 50 ewes that were taken were all heavily pregnant. The sheep were tagged and the breeds involved were white-faced Lleyn and black-faced North of England Mule.

Police Constable Rob Hammond, of North Dorset police, said: "This incident involved the theft of a large number of animals and has clearly caused considerable distress and inconvenience for the famer involved as these sheep need expert care in their condition.

"We are carrying out a number or enquiries to identify those responsible. We have also carried out extra patrols in the area.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the theft or any suspicious vehicle activity in the area overnight from Tuesday 17 April 2018 into Wednesday 18 April 2018 to contact police.

"I would also urge farmers to check their fields and flocks as sheep may have been put into a field nearby."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180057715. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
