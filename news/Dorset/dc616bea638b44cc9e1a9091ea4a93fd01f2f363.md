# Man charged after reported second hand car scam in East Dorset

12 June 2017

* * *

A man has been charged in connection with an alleged second hand car scam in East Dorset.

Police received a call at 8.29pm on Sunday 12 February 2017 reporting criminal damage to a car at an address in St Ives near Ringwood.

It is alleged that three men attended the address in order to buy a second hand car that was advertised for sale on Gumtree.

The men are reported to have distracted the seller, while one of them poured oil into the coolant system. They are then alleged to have pointed out a fault to the seller and offered to buy the car for a reduced amount despite there being nothing wrong with the car.

A 19-year-old man from the London area who was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and possessing an article for use in fraud has been charged with causing criminal damage to property valued under Â£5,000 and is due to appear before Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 7 July 2017.

Two men aged 23 and 24, both from the London area, arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and possessing an article for use in fraud have been released without charge.
