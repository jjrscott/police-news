16 July 2019

* * *

Detectives investigating an alleged serious assault in Bournemouth have arrested a further four people.

At 1.02pm on Monday 15 July 2019 we received a report that two boys aged 16 and 17 had suffered stab wounds in Boscombe Spa Road.

It was reported that they had been assaulted by male offenders who had made off from the scene.

The victims were treated by the ambulance service and taken to hospital. Their condition is not described as life-threatening.

Officers, including armed officers, attended and carried out searches to identify the suspects.

A 17-year-old boy from London, a 25-year-old man also from London and a 26-year-old man of no fixed abode were arrested on Monday 15 July 2019 on suspicion of attempted murder and have been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

This evening, Tuesday 16 July 2019, firearms officers arrested two men and two women at an address in Windham Road in Bournemouth on suspicion of attempted murder and assisting an offender. They are helping officers with enquiries.

Detective Sergeant Mark White, of Bournemouth CID, said: "As a result of ongoing enquiries officers arrested a further four individuals at an address in Windham Road in Bournemouth. A cordon has been put in place to allow investigations to take place.

"I would again appeal to any witnesses who were in the area of Boscombe Spa Road at the relevant time, and have not yet spoken to police, to please come forward.

"Residents can expect there to be an increased police presence in the Boscombe Spa Road and Windham Road areas while enquiries into this incident remain ongoing and officers from the local neighbourhood policing team can be approached with any community concerns."
