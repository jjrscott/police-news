A second person has been arrested in connection with a series of reported robberies being investigated by detectives in Bournemouth.

It was reported that at around 9.55pm on Thursday 4 February 2021 an 18-year-old man was approached by two male teenagers on bicycles in an alleyway off Thistlebarrow Road and was allegedly assaulted before his phone was stolen.

He subsequently realised he has sustained stab wounds to his legs and was taken to hospital for treatment to injuries that were not life-threatening.

Two further robberies were reported earlier on Thursday 4 February.

At around 3.30pm a 13-year-old boy was approached by two male teenagers on bicycles in the area of Kings Park Road. He was reportedly assaulted and his coat was stolen.

It was also reported that at around 1.45pm a 16-year-old boy was assaulted by two male suspects in the area of Boscombe Chine Gardens and his Apple AirPods headphones were stolen.

A 17-year-old boy from London was previously arrested on suspicion of robbery and was released on police bail.

Following further enquiries, an 18-year-old London man has also been arrested on suspicion of robbery and has been released on police bail as the investigation continues.
