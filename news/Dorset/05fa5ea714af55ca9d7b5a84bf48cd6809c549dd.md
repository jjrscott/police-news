# Update â€“ witness appeal following reported fail-to-stop injury collision in Poole

29 May 2018

* * *

Three people have been arrested in connection with an alleged fail-to-stop collision in Poole.

At 2.49pm on Wednesday 18 April 2018 Dorset Police was called to reports of a road traffic collision at traffic lights on the Hunger Hill roundabout involving a red Ducati Panigale motorcycle and a car.

It was reported that the car - believed to be a silver Mercedes - failed to stop at the scene.

The motorcyclist - a 37-year-old man from the Wareham area - sustained serious injuries and was taken to Poole Hospital for treatment. He has since been released from hospital.

Following the incident, CCTV was released showing a Mercedes car travelling along Dear Hay Lane after the collision.

Two men, aged 49 and 35 and both from Poole, have been arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving, failing to stop after a road accident, failing to report a road accident, driving whilst disqualified, driving without valid insurance and conspiring to pervert the course of justice. They have both been released under investigation.

A 35-year-old Poole woman has been arrested on suspicion of conspiring to pervert the course of justice and has also been released under investigation.
