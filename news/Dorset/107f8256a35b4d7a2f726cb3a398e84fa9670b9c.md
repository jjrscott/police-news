# Appeal after dog attack in Bournemouth

23 February 2021

* * *

Officers investigating a dog attack in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Between around 6.30am and 6.45am on Friday 19 February 2021 the victim, a local woman in her 40s, was walking her dog on Turbary Common. Just after she had entered the common, she saw a reddish Pomeranian type dog coming from under a bush. This dog ran over to the victim and started attacking her by jumping up and biting her hand.

She was shouting at the dog to stop and her own dog then came and stood by her as if to protect her. She put her dog between her legs, when the offending dog then turned on her dog and started biting its ears and nose.

The owner of the Pomeranian type dog was walking toward her, but did not call off his dog, when her own dog jumped up at the male owner, but did not bite him.

The man is described as white, in his 50s and having broad shoulders. His hair is white and thinning and he was wearing a blue anorak and dark trousers.

The victim suffered bites to both hands and attended hospital for treatment. Her dog sustained puncture wounds.

Police Constable Jennie Skykes-Martin, of Dorset Police, said: "I would ask the owner of the offending dog to come forward so that I can establish the full circumstances of what happened.

"I am also appealing for anyone who recognises the man by the description given or the dog to please get in touch to help me with my enquiries.

"Finally, I would like to hear from anyone who might have witnessed the incident."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210028687. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
