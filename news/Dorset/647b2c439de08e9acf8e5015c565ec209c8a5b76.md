# CCTV appeal following fraud and theft of parcel in Corfe Mullen

04 January 2021

* * *

Officers investigating fraudulent activity and theft of a parcel in Corfe Mullen are issuing CCTV images of a man they would like to speak to.

The victim - a woman from Blandford aged in her 30s - ordered a Smeg blender to be collected from the Co-op in Wareham Road. When she went to collect it on Saturday 19 December 2020 she was advised that it had already been picked up.

Enquiries revealed that a man went into the Co-op at around 9.50am on Friday 18 December 2020 and gave the surname of the victim and showed a collection e-mail. When questioned why the name on the parcel was for a woman, the man stated that it was his wife who was pregnant and was in the car.

Police Community Support Investigator Steve Willis, of East Dorset police, said: "I have been carrying out a number of enquiries to try and identify the man who collected the parcel, but these have so far proved unsuccessful.

"I am now in a position to release CCTV images of the man and would ask anyone who recognises him to please get in touch."
