# Update â€“ man charged in connection with reported rape on Portland

04 March 2020

* * *

A man has been charged in connection with the reported rape of an 11-year-old girl on Portland.

It was reported that the offence occurred in the area of the old stone windmill south of Easton shortly after 3am on Saturday 31 August 2019.

On Saturday 7 September 2019 detectives arrested a 22-year-old local man on suspicion of rape and he was released on police bail.

Following further enquiries, he has now been charged with rape and assault by penetration. He is due to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Monday 6 April 2020.

Detective Inspector Wayne Seymour, of Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team, said: "We have kept the victim and her family updated throughout the investigation and they are being supported by specially-trained officers.

"This matter is now subject to a court process and it is important to stress that - as is typical in such circumstances - it would be entirely inappropriate for Dorset Police to comment further during the proceedings. It is vital that the judicial system is allowed to follow its course.

"We would like to remind the public that criminal proceedings are active and the individual charged in connection with this investigation has a right to a fair trial. It is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings."
