Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after it was reported that a vehicle failed to stop for police in Poole.

The incident happened at around 3pm on Thursday 23 November 2017, involving a green Peugeot 206.

The vehicle was followed by a marked police car along Palmer Road, Mellstock Road and Shottsford Road, before the blue lights were activated. The vehicle reportedly continued onto Vicarage Road, Wimborne Road, Dorchester Road and Darbys Lane where it stopped.

A 33-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of driving offences. He has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Police Constable Jon Rowland, of Poole police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the manner of driving of the vehicle prior to it stopping to please contact police.

"I am particularly interested in hearing from anyone who may have been driving in the area at the time and may have captured the vehicle on dashcam."
