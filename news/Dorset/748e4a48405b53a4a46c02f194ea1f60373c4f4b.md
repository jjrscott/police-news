# Appeal for information following aggravated burglary in Poole

26 March 2021

* * *

Detectives investigating an aggravated burglary in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 11pm on Thursday 25 March 2021 two men forced their way into the home of a man in Hamworthy. One of the men grabbed hold of the victim while the other searched the property.

Items stolen included jewellery, a watch, mobile phone, bank card and keys.

The victim was able to raise the alarm with a group of workmen who were in the street nearby.

The offenders were reported to be wearing clothing resembling police officer costumes.

Both were described as white, around five feet eight inches tall and of medium build. They were dressed in black, one had 'Police' written on the back of his jacket and the other had a black cap with 'Police' on it.

Detective Sergeant Dave Lyons, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This must have been a very frightening ordeal for the victim involved and we are carrying out a full investigation to identify the men responsible.

"I would urge any witnesses or anyone with information that might assist our enquiries to please contact us.

"I would also ask that any residents in the area with home CCTV systems, or anyone driving in the vicinity who has dashcam fitted, please checks their footage for the relevant time period for anything that might assist us.

"There will be an increased police presence in the area as we carry out enquiries and officers can be approached by members of the public with any concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210047746. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
