# Appeal after woman injured in Wimborne

06 July 2017

* * *

Officers investigating an incident in which a woman was injured in Wimborne are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

The local woman, aged in her 50s, was walking along East Borough near to the junction of Priors Walk at around 11.30pm on Sunday 2 July 2017.

The next thing she recalled is being on the ground at the side of the road, resting on her hands. She does not remember how she came to be on the ground.

The woman suffered injuries to her face and bruising to her body but was able to walk home. She was in pain the next morning and went to hospital.

Medical staff believe that the injuries are not consistent with a fall and represent trauma-type injuries concentrated down one side of her body.

Police Constable Simon Fricker, of East Dorset Police, said: "We have made a number of enquiries into this incident but at this stage it is not clear how the woman has come to be injured.

"I cannot rule out the possibility that the victim was either assaulted or involved in a collision with a vehicle.

"I am appealing for any witnesses that can help us establish what happened to contact me."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170101338. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously in 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
