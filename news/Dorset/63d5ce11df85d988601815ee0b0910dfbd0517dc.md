# CCTV appeal following theft by finding and fraud in Bournemouth

14 December 2020

* * *

Officers investigating the theft by finding and subsequent fraudulent use of a bank card in Bournemouth are issuing a CCTV image of a woman they would like to speak to.

The victim believes their bank card fell out of their pocket as they were walking from Richmond Hill toward Bournemouth Pier at around 11.15am on Sunday 6 December 2020.

They noticed a short time later and froze the card. They then contacted their bank and were informed that the card had been used for two transactions totalling Â£39 at Square Newsagents and Tesco Metro in Bourne Avenue between 11.50am and 12pm that day.

Several further attempts were made to use the card between Monday 7 December and Saturday 12 December 2020.

Police Community Support Investigator Chris Wilson, of Bournemouth police, said: "We are carrying out enquiries into this matter and we have obtained a CCTV image of a woman we would like to speak to.

"I appreciate the image is not the best quality but I would urge anyone who recognises her to please contact us."
