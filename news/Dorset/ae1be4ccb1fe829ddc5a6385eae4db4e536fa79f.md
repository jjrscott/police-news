# Appeal for information following collision in Bournemouth

14 January 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a collision involving a car and a pedestrian in Bournemouth are appealing for the driver involved to come forward.

At around 5.45pm on Wednesday 18 December 2019 a silver Vauxhall Corsa was in collision with a 54-year-old woman near to the pedestrian crossing by Pizza Hut on Alma Road. She was knocked backwards onto the pavement.

The driver stopped and got out to check she was all right. The woman reported that she felt fine, so the driver carried on.

However, when the woman got home she realised she was in some pain and so attended hospital, where X-rays revealed she had two broken ribs and a partially-collapsed lung.

The injured woman spent one week in hospital, arriving home on Thursday 26 December 2019, and was signed off work for a further three weeks.

Police Constable Phillip Stevens, of Bournemouth Police, said: "We are not treating this as a fail-to-stop collision. We would just like to speak to the driver to establish what happened.

"If you were the driver of the Vauxhall, or if anyone has any information, please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190203666. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
