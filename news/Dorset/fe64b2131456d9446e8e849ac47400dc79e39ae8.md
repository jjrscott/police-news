# E-fit appeal after indecent exposure in Christchurch

09 September 2016

* * *

Officers in Christchurch investigating an indecent exposure toward a 13-year-old girl have released an e-fit of the suspect.

At around 2.30pm on Wednesday 31 August 2016 the victim was walking her dog in the Priory View Road area of Burton when a man approached her in his van.

The man initially asked the girl for directions before indecently exposing himself. The victim walked away.

The offender is described as white, aged in his late 20s or early 30s and of average build. He had blond messy hair, blue eyes, chubby cheeks, clean shaven and bad teeth. He was wearing black rectangular-framed glasses, had a deep voice and spoke with a lisp. He was wearing grey trousers and a grey polo shirt.

He was driving a silver pick-up truck with a logo on the car door. The logo is described as that of a white house with trees either side and a name and telephone number at the bottom, which the victim was unable to remember.

Police Constable Jo Davis, of Christchurch police, said: "This was obviously a very distressing incident for the young victim and following enquiries I am now in a position to issue an e-fit of the suspect.

"I would urge anyone who recognises this man to please call me.

"Officers have stepped up patrols in the area to offer reassurances."
