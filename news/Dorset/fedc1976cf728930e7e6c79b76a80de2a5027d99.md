# Witness appeal following suspected arson in Weymouth

26 October 2017

* * *

Officers investigating a suspected arson in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 5pm yesterday, Wednesday 25 October 2017, Dorset Police received a report of a fire at a derelict wooden shed at Castle Cove Beach, off Old Castle Road.

The fire service was already aware of the incident and the blaze was extinguished. It is believed the fire was started deliberately.

Police Constable Roger Clark, of Weymouth police, said: "Those responsible for this offence put themselves in great danger as the fire caused the whole structure to collapse and it is fortunate nobody was seriously injured.

"We have made a number of enquiries into this incident and I am appealing for any witnesses to contact us.

"It is believed there was a group of young people in the area around the time of the incident and I would be keen to speak to anyone with information that can assist our investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 25:329. Alternatively, Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
