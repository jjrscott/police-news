# Witness appeal following reported altercation and assault in Bournemouth

18 December 2017

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an alleged altercation and assault in Bournemouth.

At around 2.15am on Saturday 16 December 2017 it was reported that two groups of people were pushing and shoving each other outside Truth nightclub on Exeter Road.

Officers attended and a 25-year-old man from Christchurch was arrested on suspicion of assault and possession of an offensive weapon in a public place and has been released under investigation. A knuckle duster was seized.

A 17-year-old boy from York sustained a head injury and lost several teeth and was taken to Poole Hospital for treatment. He was released later that day.

Detective Constable Mark Richardson, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the area of the nightclub in the early hours of Saturday morning and witnessed the incident to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly keen to identify two men from one of the groups as I believe they may have important information that could assist my investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170194540. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
