* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses after two teenage boys were assaulted in Bournemouth.

The incident happened at around 8.10pm on Monday 3 April 2017 on South Kinson Drive near to the junction with Montgomery Avenue.

The boys, aged 14 and 15, walked from Smiths News on Kinson Road and were followed by a group of around 15 teenagers, aged between 15 and 17, before being assaulted.

Both victims suffered cuts and bruises and were taken to hospital to be checked over.

One of the male offenders was described as being of large build, around five feet seven inches tall and wearing a silver or grey tracksuit. A second boy was described as of a similar build, around five feet ten inches tall, with dark hair and wearing a camouflage-coloured top and trousers. There were also two girls in the group, one with red hair and the other with black hair.

Detective Constable Mark Richardson, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was an unprovoked assault on two teenage boys who were left shaken by the incident.

"I am appealing to anyone who saw a large group of teenagers in the area at the time of the incident, or knows who was responsible for the assault, to please contact police or report it to Crimestoppers anonymously.

"There will be an increased police presence in the area to assist with the investigation and our Neighbourhood Policing Team will be available to address any community concerns."
