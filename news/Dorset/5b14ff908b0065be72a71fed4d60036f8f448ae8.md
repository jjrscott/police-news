# Witness appeal following indecent exposure incident in Poole

09 August 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for any witnesses to come forward following an indecent exposure incident in Poole.

Sometime between 2.55pm and 3.10pm on Saturday 8 August 2020 the victim - a local woman aged in her 20s - was walking along a secluded section of The Avenue toward the beach when a man walked past her.

She turned around to see he was performing a lewd act in front of her.

The suspect is described as white, aged in his early 50s, six feet two inches tall, of stocky build and with short hair that was longer on top with a fringe covering his forehead. He wore a red faded T-shirt and khaki-coloured shorts.

Police Constable Ryan Jackson, of Poole police, said: "This was an unpleasant and frightening incident for the victim.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the area and either witnessed the incident or saw a man matching the description given to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would also ask any motorists who were travelling near to The Avenue between 2.55pm and 3.10pm to please check their dashcam footage and contact me if they find anything that may be relevant to my investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200117547. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
