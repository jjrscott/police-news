# Winterborne Kingston community speed watch makes a real difference

22 July 2016

* * *

On 21 July 2016, Deputy Chief Constable James Vaughan thanked the community speed watch team operating in Winterborne Kingston for their valuable role in keeping Dorset roads safe.

In 2013, speed monitoring equipment set up in the village found that the average speed of vehicles passing through was 38 miles per hour, well above the 30 mile per hour speed limit.

Over the last year, Dorset Police's safety camera van team has visited the area 11 times and the community speed watch has deployed on a regular and consistent basis. Dorset Police's proactive 'No Excuse' team, dedicated to tackling the 'fatal five' factors that contribute to road traffic collisions, had also deployed to the area six times.

As a result of this combined effort, 1,062 drivers received warning letters and 270 drivers have been prosecuted or have undergone an educational Driver Awareness Scheme course in an effort to improve driver behaviour.

During July 2016, speed monitoring equipment was again deployed and found average speeds in the village have now fallen dramatically to 28 miles per hour. In the last 12 months, there have been no fatalities or serious injury collisions in the village.

Deputy Chief Constable James Vaughan said: "I'd like to express my gratitude for the consistent and dedicated work that the Winterborne Kingston community speed watch team have been doing over the last year.

"Their efforts have been extremely worthwhile and each volunteer should be commended for their role in reducing excessive and inappropriate speed in the area. We welcome dedicated volunteers as our colleagues, assisting us in a shared goal."

Dorset Police's Road Safety Operations Manager, Brian Austin, said: "Speed is a major factor in a third of all traffic collisions. Community speed watch teams not only help in making our roads safer, but improve quality of life for residents."
