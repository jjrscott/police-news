# Witness appeal following sexual assault on a woman in Bournemouth

28 November 2016

* * *

Detectives investigating a sexual assault in Bournemouth are appealing for a member of the public who was in the area at the time to come forward.

At around 6.50pm on Friday 25 November 2016 a woman was picking up litter in Shelbourne Road when she was approached by a man.

The offender made a sexually inappropriate comment to the victim - a local woman aged in her 60s - before he pushed her into a nearby alleyway and sexually assaulted her. He ran away from the scene toward Bennett Road.

He is described as white, aged in his 20s or 30s, around five feet ten inches tall, of slim build and was wearing a dark-coloured duffle coat which was around thigh length with the hood up.

The incident was reported to Dorset Police at 2.36pm yesterday, Sunday 27 November 2016.

Detective Constable Stefanie Belton, of Bournemouth CID, said: "From our investigations we understand that the victim shouted to a woman who was walking past at the time. I would really like to speak to this woman as I believe she may have seen the offender and have important information that could assist my investigation.

"I would also appeal to anyone else who witnessed the incident, or saw a man matching the description given in the area at the relevant time, to please contact Dorset Police.

"Although at this time there is no direct link to the three reported sexual assaults that have occurred in the Ensbury Park area of Bournemouth, we are keeping an open mind as our investigations continue."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 27:235. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
