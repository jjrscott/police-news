Detectives investigating four reported street robberies in Bournemouth have arrested two people.

The most recent incident was reported to have occurred at 1.45pm yesterday, Thursday 3 January 2019, in Tuckton Road when a young man was said to have stolen a handbag from an elderly woman.

At approximately 12.10pm on Sunday 30 December 2018 in Stourwood Avenue a local woman aged in her 70s was reportedly approached from behind by a man and pushed into a vehicle before her brown handbag - which contained cash and a mobile phone - was stolen. During the incident the victim sustained a head injury.

A further reported robbery took place at 10.10pm on Sunday 30 December 2018 in Belle Vue Road. A woman aged in her 70s was walking down the road when two people cycled past her and reportedly stole her handbag.

At around 4pm on Friday 28 December 2018 it was reported that a local woman in her 70s was walking along Southbourne Road when a young man came running up behind her and pulled her handbag from her, causing her to fall to the side. The bag contained a mobile phone, a purse and house keys.

Yesterday, Thursday 3 January 2019, a CCTV appeal was issued by officers.

Detective Sergeant Karen Penn, of Bournemouth CID, said: "As a result of enquiries, a 13-year-old boy from Watford has been arrested on suspicion of robbery and a 27-year-old Bournemouth woman has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit robbery. They are both assisting officers with enquiries.
