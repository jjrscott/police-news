Officers investigating a serious road traffic collision in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage of the incident to come forward.

Shortly before 2am today, Wednesday 26 September 2018, a collision occurred on Holdenhurst Road involving a silver Volkswagen Golf and a pedestrian.

The pedestrian, a 20-year-old man from Surrey, sustained a serious head injury and was taken to Southampton Hospital for treatment.

A 23-year-old Bournemouth man has been arrested on suspicion of driving offences and is assisting officers with their enquiries.

Police Constable Duncan Roberts, of the traffic unit, said: "We are investigating the full circumstances of this collision and have already spoken to a number of witnesses. I am appealing for anyone who saw the incident and has not already spoken to us to please get in touch.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who may have any relevant dashcam footage.

"The road was closed to allow the emergency services to deal with the incident and for a thorough examination of the scene to be carried out. We would like to thank motorists for their patience and understanding during the closure."
