Detectives investigating an alleged stabbing in Boscombe have arrested a man.

Dorset Police was called by the ambulance service just before 8pm on Wednesday to Windsor Road following reports that a man had sustained stab wounds to his upper body. The alleged stabbing is reported to have occurred in nearby Cecil Road.
