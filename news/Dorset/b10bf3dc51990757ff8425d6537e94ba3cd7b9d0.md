02 July 2020

* * *

Detectives investigating the death of a man in Bournemouth have issued a further update and are renewing their appeal for anyone with information to come forward.

The Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT) is investigating the death of a man who was found with stab wounds in Boscombe Chine Gardens at 5.49pm on Tuesday 30 June 2020. The victim has been named by detectives as 31-year-old James Cutting from Bournemouth.

A 33-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of murder in connection with the incident and taken to hospital for treatment to an injury to his neck has now been discharged from hospital and is in police custody.

A 25-year-old Bournemouth man arrested on suspicion of murder on Wednesday 1 July 2020 has been released without charge.

A 28-year-old Bournemouth woman arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender has been released under investigation.

Detective Inspector Wayne Seymour, of MCIT, said: “We continue to carry out extensive enquiries into this death and are keeping James’ family updated throughout.

“We are keen for anyone who may have any camera footage or photos taken in the gardens around the relevant time or any other information that could be relevant to please submit it via the Major Incident Public Portal.

“As our investigation continues, the scenes are likely to remain in place at Boscombe Chine Gardens into the weekend and we will continue to have an increased police presence in the area. Officers can be approached by members of the public with any concerns.”

Anyone with information who is unable to submit it via the Major Incident Public Portal is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200094596.
