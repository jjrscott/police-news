Detectives investigating two reported knifepoint robberies at shops in Weymouth have made an arrest.

Dorset Police was called at 6.53am on Sunday 8 November 2020 to reports of a break to the Hidden Gem Kebab takeaway shop in Littlemoor Shopping Centre.

It is alleged a man smashed a window to gain entry. He was confronted by a member of staff before reportedly brandishing a knife and leaving on a bicycle into the Littlemoor estate via Canberra Crescent.

The member of staff sustained an injury to his hand, which is not said to be serious and did not require hospital treatment. Nothing was stolen.

At 9.20am officers were called to reports of a knifepoint robbery at the Co-op store in Preston Road. A quantity of cash and cigarettes were allegedly stolen. No injuries were sustained.

A 21-year-old local man has been arrested on suspicion of robbery and attempted robbery and is assisting officers with their enquiries.

Detective Inspector Scott Johnson, of Weymouth CID, said: "I would like to reassure the public that a full investigation is underway into these incidents.

"Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team can be approached with any concerns.

"I am appealing for the public's help and would urge anyone who witnessed these reported incidents or saw any suspicious activity at either location to please contact Dorset Police immediately.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who was travelling in the area and may have captured anything of relevance on dashcam to please contact us."
