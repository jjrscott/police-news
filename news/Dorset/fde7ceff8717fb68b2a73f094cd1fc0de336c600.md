# Witness appeal after serious collision between Weymouth and Dorchester

24 January 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses after a serious road traffic collision on the A354 Weymouth relief road.

The incident happened at around 9.08am today, Wednesday 24 January 2018, at the top of the Ridgeway involving a white Ford Transit van and a blue Vauxhall Zafira.

The driver of the Zafira - a 36-year-old woman from Weymouth - suffered minor injuries. She was taken to hospital as a precaution and was later discharged. A 54-year-old Weymouth woman - who was the front seat passenger - suffered serious injuries and is in a critical condition at Dorset County Hospital. The rear seat passenger - a 55-year-old man from Weymouth - is in a critical condition and is due to be transferred to Southampton General Hospital.

The driver of the Transit van - a 29-year-old man from Bournemouth - was taken to Dorset County Hospital as a precaution and has since been discharged.

Road closures were put in place between the Jurassic roundabout and football stadium roundabout to allow emergency services to deal with the incident. A large oil spill also required the local authority to attend to make the road safe.

Police Sergeant Fern Graham, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or the manner of driving of either vehicle prior to the incident to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly interested to hear from anyone who may have been driving along the A354 around the time of the collision who may have dashcam footage, which could assist with my investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 24:84. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
