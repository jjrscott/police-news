# Further arrest in connection with man found seriously injured in Boscombe

25 December 2020

* * *

Detectives have made a third arrest as they continue to investigate an incident where a man was found with serious injuries in Boscombe.

Just before 9.30am on Saturday 19 December 2020 officers were called to Southcote Road to reports that a man had been found unresponsive outside a block of flats.

The man - who is aged in his 40s - was taken to hospital for treatment to a head injury and he remains in a life-threatening condition.

An investigation is underway, led by detectives from Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT), to establish how the man sustained his injuries.

On Wednesday 23 December 2020 a 40-year-old woman from Bournemouth was arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent and she was subsequently released on police bail.

On Thursday 24 December 2020 a 35-year-old local man was arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent and he was released under investigation.

A second man, aged 44 and from Bournemouth, has also now been arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm and he has been released under investigation.

Detective Inspector Wayne Seymour, of MCIT, said: "We are continuing to make enquiries into this matter. Officers are also supporting the injured man's family and keeping them updated with our investigation."
