# Man found seriously injured in Boscombe â€“ second arrest made

24 December 2020

* * *

Detectives investigating an incident where a man was found with serious injuries in Boscombe have arrested a second person.

Just before 9.30am on Saturday 19 December 2020 officers were called to Southcote Road to reports that a man had been found unresponsive outside a block of flats.

The man - who is aged in his 40s - was taken to hospital for treatment to a head injury and is said to be in a life-threatening condition.

An investigation is underway, led by detectives from Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT), to establish how the man sustained his injuries.

On Wednesday 23 December 2020 a 40-year-old woman from Bournemouth was arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent. Officers also issued a CCTV image of a man they wish to identify as part of their investigation. This man has still not been identified.

On Thursday 24 December 2020 a 35-year-old local man was arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent.

The woman has been released on police bail and the man has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Detective Inspector Wayne Seymour, of MCIT, said: "We are continuing to carry out enquiries into how the man came to be injured and I would ask anyone who saw anything of significance in Southcote Road on the morning of Saturday 19 December 2020 to please contact us."
