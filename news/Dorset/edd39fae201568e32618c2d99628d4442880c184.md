# Appeal for information following report of rape

25 January 2019

* * *

Detectives investigating reported offences of rape and stalking are issuing an appeal for information.

Dorset Police is investigating a report of stalking offences allegedly committed by a 30-year-old Bournemouth man between Wednesday 16 January 2019 and Monday 21 January 2019.

It is also alleged that during this period the man raped the same victim, a woman aged in her 40s.

It was reported that at between 10am and 12pm on Thursday 17 January 2019 the man and women were in a red Peugeot 207 travelling from Ferndown to Southampton when he pulled the vehicle into a wooded area down a side road off the A31 between junction 1 of the M27 and the Burley Services and he is alleged to have raped her.

The vehicle travelled back toward Dorset shortly afterward.

Although the reported incident occurred in Hampshire, it is being investigated by Dorset Police as part of its ongoing enquiries into allegations involving the man and woman, who are known to each other.

The 30-year-old Bournemouth man has been charged with rape and stalking and is next due to appear at Bournemouth Crown Court on Thursday 21 February 2019.

Detective Constable Will Burnett, of Dorset Police's Serious Sexual Offences team, said: "We are continuing to make enquiries into this incident and I am appealing for any witnesses to the manner of driving of a red Peugeot 207 on the A31 between Burley and junction 1 of the M27 at Cadnam between 10am and 12pm on Thursday 17 January 2019 to contact us.

"The exact location of this alleged offence remains unclear and I am appealing to anyone who may have seen this vehicle parked up on this day between these times.

"It was reported that a red delivery van may have passed the Peugeot after it had pulled off the A31 and stopped and I would be keen to speak to the driver of that vehicle."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190010884. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
