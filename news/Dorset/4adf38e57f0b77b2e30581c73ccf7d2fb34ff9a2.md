# Warning to residents following burglaries in Shaftesbury

16 December 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for information and urging residents to remain vigilant following a spate of burglaries in Shaftesbury.

Three of the offences have occurred during the night at residential properties and local officers are warning homeowners to make sure their dwellings are properly secured.

During the early hours of Saturday 14 December 2019 car keys and two laptops were stolen from a home in Wincombe Lane. The victim's bank card was also taken and subsequently used to withdraw Â£250 in cash.

At 3.50pm the following day a burglary occurred at the Spar store in Mampitts Lane, with keys stolen from a storage area.

A further report was received that at 9.55pm on Sunday 15 December 2019 an intruder had entered a property in Ivy Crofts Road but was chased out of the premises when challenged by the occupants. It is not believed anything was stolen.

Just after 7am on Monday 16 December 2019 Dorset Police received a report of a burglary at an address in Gower Road. It was reported that during the previous night entry had been gained to the property and Christmas presents were taken from under the tree.

Officers have also received reports of a man seen trying car and house doors in the area.

Inspector Simon Perry, of North Dorset police, said: "I am appealing for anyone with information about any of these offences to please contact us. In particular I would urge people with home CCTV systems to check their footage around the relevant times and locations of the offences reported to us.

"I would also like to take this opportunity to remind residents in the area to make sure all their doors are properly secured at night so they do not make their homes easy targets for thieves."
