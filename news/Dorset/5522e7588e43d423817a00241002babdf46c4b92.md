Two men are due to appear in court this morning charged in connection with two reported robberies in Bournemouth and Poole.

The men, aged 35 and 40 and both from Hemel Hempstead, have been charged with two counts of robbery and a separate shoplifting offence and are due to appear before Bournemouth Magistrates' Court today, Wednesday 19 October 2016.

The first incident happened at around 9.20pm on Wednesday 12 October 2016 at the Co-op on Oakdale Road in Poole.

A second reported robbery occurred at the Spar in Wimborne Road in Winton on the evening of Friday 14 October 2016.

In both incidents two men entered the store, selected items and approached the till. It was reported that as one of the suspects attempted to pay, the other sprayed the shop assistant in the face with an unknown substance from a can, a quantity of cash was then taken from the open till and both men made off.

Nobody was physically injured in either incident.
