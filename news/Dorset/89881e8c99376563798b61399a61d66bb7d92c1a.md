# Witness appeal following attempted robbery in Weymouth

26 November 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after the attempted robbery of a woman in an underpass in Weymouth.

At around 3pm on Saturday 24 November 2018 a 55-year-old woman was walking through the subway underpass between the Westham footbridge and Corscombe Close when a man casually approached her on a mountain bike.

He attempted to snatch her handbag from her. As the bag was across her body on the opposite shoulder, the movement caused her body to twist 90 degrees but stayed secure to her.

The offender cycled off empty handed and turned left out of the underpass toward the junction of Swannery Bridge and Abbotsbury Road.

A second man who was walking nearby chased after the suspect but did not return to leave his details.

The offender is described as white, of average height and slim build. He wore a black baseball cap, a green-coloured Parka, which was longer at the back with a split in the middle, and black woollen gloves.

The victim was not physically injured.

Police Constable Don Duchscherer, of Weymouth police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or saw a man matching the description given to please contact me.

"I am also keen to trace the man who ran after the offender as he may have important information that may assist my investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180189549. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
