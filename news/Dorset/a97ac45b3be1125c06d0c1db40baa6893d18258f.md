# Witness appeal following serious collision in Hamworthy

19 October 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following a serious collision in Hamworthy.

Dorset Police received a report at around 10.45pm on Monday 19 October 2020 in relation to a collision involving a teenage boy on a pit bike in the area of Blandford Road.

It was reported the pit bike was involved in a collision with a pole.

Officers attended, along with the ambulance service. The 16-year-old boy was taken by air ambulance to hospital. His condition is believed to be serious but we do not have any further update at this time. His family has been informed.

Officers are remaining in the area to carry out enquiries to establish the full circumstances of the incident.

Sergeant Sarah Jones, of the traffic unit, said: "The pit bike was removed from scene prior to police arrival and we would appeal to anyone who knows the whereabouts of the bike involved to please contact us. It is described as a small black pit bike with silver rims and no lights.

"We would also like to hear from any witnesses or anyone who may have captured the incident on dashcam."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 19:53. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
