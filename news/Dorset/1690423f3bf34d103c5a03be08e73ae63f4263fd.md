# Fail-to-stop collision near Dorchester â€“ appeal

10 July 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a fail-to-stop collision near Dorchester are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At around 10.45pm on Wednesday 3 July 2019 a local woman aged in her 20s was driving her Honda Jazz in the outside lane along the westbound carriageway of the A35 Puddletown bypass near to Troy Town when a vehicle towing a caravan undertook her in the nearside lane.

After performing the manoeuvre the vehicle attempted to move into the outside lane, however it collided with the side of the victim's car causing her vehicle to spin and hit the central reservation.

The driver of the vehicle reportedly stopped a few hundred yards up the road, placed their hazard lights on but did not get out and drove away. No details of the vehicle or caravan are known.

The victim was taken to hospital but thankfully only sustained minor injuries.

Police Constable Shane Hewitt, of Dorchester police, said: "I would urge the driver involved in this incident to please come forward so we can establish exactly what happened.

"From witnesses at the scene, I believe there were a number of other vehicles travelling along that stretch of road at the time of the collision who may have also witnessed the incident and I would ask them to please contact me.

"Finally, I am also keen to hear from anyone who may have captured the collision on dashcam."
