# Update â€“ CCTV appeal following racially aggravated public order incident in Bournemouth

14 February 2018

* * *

A community resolution has been agreed following a report of a racially aggravated public order incident in Bournemouth.

At around 7am on Sunday 24 December 2017 it was reported that a man, who was believed to be intoxicated, was verbally abusive toward a member of staff at the Bath Road service station and made racist comments.

Following a CCTV appeal, a 30-year-old Hampshire man contacted officers to say that he was the man involved.

A community resolution has now been agreed, with support from the victim, which involves the man writing a letter of apology.
