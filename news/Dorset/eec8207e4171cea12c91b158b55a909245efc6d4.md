# Witness appeal following serious injury collision in Bournemouth

12 December 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a serious injury road traffic collision in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

Dorset Police was called at 10.36pm on Wednesday 11 December 2019 to reports of a collision on Christchurch Road, at the junction with Derby Road, involving a silver Honda motorcycle and a black Vauxhuall Zafira.

Three male teenagers, at least two of whom were believed to have been on the motorcycle at the time of the collision, were taken to hospital. A 17-year-old boy is believed to have sustained life-threatening injuries and a 16-year-old boy and 18-year-old man sustained serious injuries.

Their families have all been informed and are being supported by officers.

The two occupants of the Vauxhall were taken to hospital and treated for injuries that were not believed to be serious.

Road closures were put in place as emergency services dealt with the incident and for an examination of the scene to be conducted. The road was reopened at 4.40am on Thursday 12 December 2019.

Sergeant Mark Scammell, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with those who were injured and their families. We are carrying out a full investigation to establish the exact circumstances of the collision.

"I would urge anyone who witnesses the incident, or the manner of driving of the vehicles involved prior to it, to please contact us. I am also keen to hear from anyone who was driving in the area and may have relevant dashcam footage.

"Finally, I would like to thank members of the public for their patients and understanding while the road closures were in place. As ever, these were completely necessary to allow the emergency services to respond and for a detailed examination of the scene to take place."
