# Witness appeal following reported assault at an address in Christchurch

04 February 2021

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a reported assault at an address in Christchurch.

Dorset Police was called at 12.04pm on Wednesday 3 February 2021 to reports of a disturbance at an address in Somerford Road.

It is alleged that a group of men armed with weapons arrived in vehicles at the address and a man aged in his 20s was assaulted. He was taken to hospital with injuries, which are not life-threatening.

A 42-year-old woman from Bournemouth has been arrested on suspicion of conspiring to cause grievous bodily harm with intent. Two Bournemouth men aged 49 and 70 have been arrested for committing violent disorder. They are assisting officers with their enquiries.

Detective Inspector Mark Jenkins, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We would like to reassure the local community that a full investigation is underway and enquiries are being carried out, involving house-to-house visits and CCTV searches.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the time and either witnessed what happened or saw vehicles or a group of men in Somerford Road to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am aware that members of the public may have filmed part of the incident on their mobile phones and I would ask these individuals, or any motorists or residents who may have captured anything relevant on dashcam or home CCTV, to please get in touch.

"Finally, officers from the local neighbourhood policing team can be approached with any community concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210020524. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
