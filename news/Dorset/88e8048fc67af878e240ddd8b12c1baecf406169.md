# A big thank you from Dorset Police for supporting this yearâ€™s 101 campaign

07 September 2016

* * *

As this year's 101 campaign comes to an end, Dorset Police wants to thank the public for their support.

All of the examples of the inappropriate use of the 101 service used throughout the campaign were genuine calls receive by Dorset Police in 2016.

This campaign was designed to raise awareness of the appropriate use of the 101 service and the alternative online contact methods available.

The new Dorset Police website has a "Do it Online" function that allows users to make general enquiries, report non-urgent crime and incidents online. It is a quicker and easier alternative to calling 101, and offers the flexibility to make a report at your own convenience. The "Do it Online" function can be found on the front page of the website www.dorset.police.uk.

Inappropriate calls received by 101 operators tie up police non-emergency phone lines and cause delays for those callers who genuinely need help.

Callers can waste valuable police time by calling them incorrectly and potentially waiting in a queue only to be redirected to another agency when you speak to one of their operators.

Superintendent Caroline Naughton, Contact Management at Dorset Police, said: "We are working hard to ensure we offer the very best service to our public, but the only way we will achieve this is with your help.

"Please make sure your enquiry is a Police matter and use the Dorset Police website to help signpost you, as this is likely to save you time. In addition you can make enquiries online.

"Once again thank you for your support with this campaign. Please remember to think before you call. If we work together we can offer you a better service."

Dorset Police and Crime Commissioner, Martyn Underhill, said: "It is vital members of the public contact the correct agency for their query.

"The 101 team regularly receive calls that are nothing to do with the police. 'My takeaway is cold', 'there's a dead fox in my garden' and 'how do I cancel my bank card' are typical examples of unnecessary calls the team receive every day.

"We have introduced a range of services online, available through the Dorset Police website to help reduce demand on the system and I continue to monitor the Force on call handling performance."

Remember, Dorset Police are always there to help in an emergency. If a crime is in progress or life in danger, always dial 999. For genuine enquiries please go to our website www.dorset.police.uk and use the Do It Online service, or dial 101.
