# Appeal for information after collision in Bournemouth

16 January 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a collision between a car and a pedestrian in Bournemouth are appealing for the driver involved to come forward.

At around 5pm on Wednesday 18 December 2019 a collision occurred on the zebra crossing on Christchurch Road, near to Drummond Road, involving a car and a pedestrian.

The victim - a 33-year-old woman - sustained muscle damage and two cracked ribs as a result of the collision.

It is reported that the female driver was very shaken by the incident and got out of her car to check that the victim was all right. She is described as aged in her 40s with light brown, shoulder-length hair.

The car is thought to be white, and possibly a Kia.

Police Constable Olivia Galliver, of Bournemouth police, said: "We've continued to liaise with the victim and carried out a number of enquiries to try to identify the driver involved, but this has been unsuccessful.

"We are now appealing directly to the driver of the car to please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190198590. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
