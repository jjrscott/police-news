# Appeal for information following dangerous driving incident in Poole

19 June 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for anyone with information to come forward after a vehicle made off from police and was seen driving dangerously in Poole.

At around 2pm on Thursday 18 June 2020 officers from Dorset Police's No Excuse team attempted to stop a silver Vauxhall Insignia with the registration FG60 YPF on Ringwood Road, near to the Turbary Retail Park as it was believed to be travelling at excess speed.

The vehicle made off from officers and was seen travelling the wrong way down Ringwood Road in the direction of the Bear Cross roundabout.

The occupants of the vehicle are described as two white men aged in their 30s who were wearing baseball caps.

Sergeant Robbie Jephcott, of the No Excuse team, said: "We are making enquiries to identify the occupants of the vehicle. We have made efforts to trace the registration number but it appears the vehicle may have had cloned plates on.

"I would urge anyone who was in the area and witnessed the incident or who may have captured it on dashcam to please contact us. I am also keen to hear from anyone with any information about the whereabouts of the vehicle and who the occupants were."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 18:252. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
