# Appeal for information following theft in Bournemouth

30 September 2019

* * *

Officers investigating the theft of Â£12,000-worth of plumbing valves from outside a property in Bournemouth are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

The valves were in a wooden box on a pallet that was at the rear of a property where building work was taking place in Talbot Avenue. They were taken between 1pm on Friday 30 August 2019 and 10.30am on Saturday 7 September 2019.

The stolen valves included Reliance lever valves with red and blue handles, copper non return valves and copper pressure reducing valves with black plastic stems as well as circular pressure gauges.

Police Community Support Investigator Roslyn Curtis, of Dorset Police, said: "These items were of high value and the theft has caused considerable inconvenience to the victim.

"We are continuing to make enquiries to identify who is responsible and I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed any suspicious activity in the area to please contact us. I am also now in a position to issue an image of the box of valves on the pallet in the hope it may jog someone's memory.

"Finally, I would also like to hear from anyone who may have come across plumbing valves being offered for sale in unusual circumstances."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190141040. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
