# Public appeal following assault in Wareham

14 July 2017

* * *

Officers investigating an assault on a man in Wareham are appealing for anyone with dash cam footage to come forward.

Sometime between 8.50pm and 9pm on Monday 3 July 2017 an incident occurred on Sandford Road.

A dark blue Ford Focus was seen parked up in Keysworth Road. A man got out of the vehicle, walked to an address in Sandford Road and attempted to gain access to a car which was parked in a driveway.

The owner confronted the offender and was struck over the head with a drill. The victim - a local man aged in his 40s - sustained a cut to his head which required hospital treatment.

Police Constable Paul Diffey, of Wareham police, said: "We have carried out a number of enquiries following this incident including house-to-house visits and interviews with witnesses. I am appealing to anyone who was in the Sandford Road area, witnessed the incident and has not yet spoken to officers to please make contact.

"I am particularly keen to hear from any motorists who were travelling along Sandford Road at the relevant time and may have captured the incident on dash cam."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170100766. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
