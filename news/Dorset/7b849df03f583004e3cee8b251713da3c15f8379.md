# Appeal for information after scam in Bournemouth

11 February 2021

* * *

Officers are appealing for anyone with information to come forward after a man was scammed and subsequently received threats and racially abusive messages in Bournemouth.

On Monday 8 February 2021 the victim, a man aged in his 20s, purchased a phone through Facebook Marketplace, which was advertised as an iPhone.

When he opened the sealed box for the phone, he discovered it was a fake and contacted the seller. He arranged to meet them at an address in Christchurch Road the following day to get a refund.

The seller never showed up and the victim and his partner subsequently received threats to damage their property and racially abusive messages on the number they had given to arrange the refund.

Police Constable Ryan Greenwell, of Bournemouth police, said: "This incident left the victim several hundred pounds out of pocket and he and his partner also received some very abusive messages from those involved.

"We are carrying out a full investigation to identify those responsible and I would appeal to anyone with information that might assist our enquiries to please contact us.

"I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who may have been the victim of a similar scam when purchasing phones or other items locally via social media."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210023920. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
