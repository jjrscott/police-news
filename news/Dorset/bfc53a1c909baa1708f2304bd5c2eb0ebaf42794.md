# Update in relation to report of man with hammer in Poole

03 March 2021

* * *

A man arrested in connection with a report of possessing an offensive weapon in Poole will face no further police action.

At around 2.20pm on Thursday 28 January 2021 it was reported that a man was on the High Street in possession of a claw hammer. It was alleged that he was waving it about but following enquiries officers have found no evidence that the hammer was used as an offensive weapon in any way.

No one was injured during the incident. A 37-year-old man who was arrested in connection with the matter has now been released from the investigation and will face no further police action.

Officers are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.
