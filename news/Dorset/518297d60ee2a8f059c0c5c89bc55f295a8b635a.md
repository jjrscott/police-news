# UPDATE - Investigation into death of woman at Bestival

12 September 2017

* * *

Detectives continue to investigate the circumstances of the death of a woman at Bestival.

Officers at the event were alerted just before 1am on Monday 11 September 2017 to reports of a concern for welfare of a woman who had attended the festival at Lulworth Castle.

Very sadly, following a search of the area the body of the woman was located in a wooded area on the edge of the festival site.

She has been named by her family as 25-year-old Louella Eve Fletcher-Michie from London.

An initial post mortem examination took place yesterday evening, Monday 11 September 2017, which showed no clear signs of an assault. However, further examinations will need to take place over the coming weeks, including toxicology, in order to establish if there are any substances in her system or other suspicious circumstances.

Detective Chief Inspector Sarah Derbyshire, of Dorset Police, said: "Detectives are working tirelessly to investigate the full circumstances surrounding this tragic death.

"A post mortem examination took place that was inconclusive and therefore we need to undertake a number of other examinations before we can establish why she died.

"The 28-year-old man arrested is in addition being interviewed on suspicion of supply of a controlled drug. He remains in custody today under caution in order to assist officers with the investigation. He was known to Louella.

"We continue to work with the festival organisers and our thoughts are with Louella's family at this extremely difficult time. We would ask that their privacy is respected."
