# Witness appeal following fatal collision in Blandford

26 June 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for any witnesses to come forward following a fatal collision in Blandford.

Dorset Police was called at 4.05pm today, Wednesday 26 June 2019, by the fire service to reports of a single vehicle collision involving a silver Ford Focus on the B3082 Wimborne Road, outside Ashley Wood Golf Club.

Very sadly the driver of the Focus, 68-year-old local man, was pronounced dead at the scene. No other vehicles were involved and no one else was injured. His family has been informed and the coroner notified.

The road remains closed between the A354 roundabout and Tarrant Keyneston.

Police Sergeant Craig Tatton, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the man's family at this very difficult time.

"We are carrying out an investigation into the circumstances of the collision and I am appealing to anyone who was travelling along the B3082 at the relevant time and either witnessed the collision, saw the Focus immediately prior to the incident or has any relevant dashcam footage to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would like to thank motorists for their patience during the road closures, which have been entirely necessary to allow collision investigators to examine the scene."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 26:345. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
