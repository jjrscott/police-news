# Further update following reported arson and burglaries in Southbourne

07 February 2021

* * *

Detectives have made a second arrest following reports of arson and burglaries at beach huts in the Southbourne area.

Dorset Police was called by the fire service at 2.40am on Saturday 6 February 2021 to a report that three beach huts were on fire at Mudeford sandbank near Hengistbury Head.

Officers attended and established that a further 31 beach huts had allegedly been broken into or damaged. There were no reports of any injuries during the incident.

A full investigation was launched and a cordon was put in place to allow for a thorough examination of the scene to take place.

Following enquiries, a 19-year-old man from Christchurch has been arrested on suspicion of arson and burglary. He is currently assisting detectives with their enquiries.

A 15-year-old Bournemouth boy who was previously arrested on suspicion of arson and burglary has been released on police bail pending further enquiries.

Detective Inspector Andrew Kennard, of Bournemouth CID, said: "Our investigation into this incident remains ongoing and I am still keen to hear from anyone who was in the area and witnessed what happened.

"If you have any information that may assist my investigation and have not yet spoken to police, please get in touch.

"We are continuing to work with BCP Council to identify the owners of all the beach huts involved in this incident. I would like to renew my appeal to anyone who owns a beach hut that has been affected and has not yet been contacted by either BCP Council or Dorset Police, please contact Dorset Police quoting the incident number below."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 6:48.
