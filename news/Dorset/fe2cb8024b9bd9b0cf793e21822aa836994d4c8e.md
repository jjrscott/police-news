Officers investigating a suspected vehicle crime series in Purbeck have arrested four people.

Between Thursday 12 November and Tuesday 24 November 2020 at least 12 offences - including theft from vehicles, theft of vehicles and attempted theft - were reported to have occurred in Purbeck, including in the Wareham and Wool area.

On a number of occasions it was reported tools were taken from the vehicles. A bank card was also reportedly stolen on one occasion and is alleged to have then been used fraudulently.

Following investigations by local officers, arrest enquiries were carried out on Friday 4 December 2020.

A 19-year-old woman from Wool and a 31-year-old man from Poole were arrested on suspicion of theft and fraud by false representation. A 22-year-old man from Poole and a 24-year-old woman from Wool have also been arrested on suspicion of theft.

All four have been released under investigation while officers continue to make enquiries.

Neighbourhood Inspector James Offer, of Purbeck police, said: "We take reports of this nature seriously as we recognise the impact these matters can have on victims.

"We have been making a number of enquiries and took proactive action to arrest four individuals in connection with these reported incidents.

"I would urge vehicle owners to ensure their cars are left secure at all times and that tools are removed from vehicles overnight."
