# Appeal following sudden death of teenage boy in Poole

23 April 2019

* * *

Detectives investigating the circumstances surrounding the death of a teenage boy in Poole are issuing an appeal to find a man who found him and raised the alarm.

At 1.15pm on Monday 22 April 2019 the ambulance service was called to the car park at Tesco Extra at Fleetsbridge following reports a 16-year-old local boy had collapsed.

Very sadly and despite the best efforts of members of the public, paramedics and hospital staff the boy was pronounced dead at Poole Hospital a short time later.

His family has been informed and the coroner notified. A post-mortem examination will be held in due course.

Detective Inspector Steve May, of Dorset Police, said: "Our thoughts remain with this boy's family and friends at this very distressing time.

"While we are not treating his death as suspicious, we are carrying out enquiries on behalf of the coroner.

"As part of these enquiries we are keen to speak to a man who saw the boy collapse and raised the alarm with a member of staff. It is believed this man had been waiting in his car outside Tesco for someone else while they shopped inside when he responded to the incident.

"Unfortunately we did not get to speak to him and I am today directly appealing to him to please contact Dorset Police as I believe you may have important information that could assist my enquiries on behalf of the coroner.

"I would also ask anyone else who was in the car park at the relevant time and may have witnessed what happened to please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190060373. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
