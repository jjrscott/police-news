# Witness appeal following report of sexual assault in Poole

04 January 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating a sexual assault in Poole are issuing an appeal for witnesses or anyone with information.

It was reported that two men entered the home of the victim, a woman aged in her 80s, in the Rossmore area some time after 10pm on Saturday 30 December 2017.

The victim was reportedly pushed to the chest, causing her to fall back on her bed and it is believed she was then sexually assaulted.

Detective Constable Jon Sainsbury, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We have now been able to obtain a full account from the victim but she is vulnerable and due to her health her recollection of events is limited.

"We are making every effort to establish exactly what happened and I am appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information that can assist our investigation to contact me.

"Did you see two men acting suspiciously in this area at the relevant time? If so I would like to hear from you.

"We appreciate this must have been a very distressing incident for the victim and specially-trained officers are continuing to support her."

The victim did not recognise the two men and is unable to provide a detailed description of them. It is also not known at this time how the men got into the property.

Inspector Andy Edwards, of Poole police, said: "We appreciate that this report will have caused members of the public and local community understandable concern and we would like to reassure them that a full and detailed investigation is underway.

"Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team will be carrying out high visibility patrols over the coming days and can be spoken to if anyone has any information about this incident or community concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170201104. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
