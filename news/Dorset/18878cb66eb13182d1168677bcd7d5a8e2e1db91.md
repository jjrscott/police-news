# UPDATE â€“ Two men due in court charged with attempted robbery

19 August 2016

* * *

Two men are due to appear in court next month charged with attempted robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery.

The charges relate to an incident which occurred in the Middle Chine area of West Overcliff Drive in Bournemouth at around 4.15pm on Sunday 24 April 2016.

It was reported that a 44-year-old man was sitting with a woman when he was approached by two men. The victim ran away from the two men before they caught up with him and allegedly assaulted him, before he managed to escape. Nothing was stolen.

The man sustained facial injuries and was taken to the Royal Bournemouth Hospital for treatment.

A 35-year-old man of no fixed abode and a 37-year-old man of Poole have been charged with attempted robbery and conspiring to commit robbery and are due to appear before Bournemouth Magistrates' Court on 23 September and 30 September respectively.

A 35-year-old woman from Poole arrested on suspicion of conspiring to commit robbery remains on police bail pending further enquiries.
