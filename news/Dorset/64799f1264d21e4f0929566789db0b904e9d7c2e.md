A man is due to appear in court charged in connection with an alleged robbery in Bournemouth.

It was reported that a man had attended an address asking for a specific person in Talbot Road in the Winton area of town between 11pm and midnight on Sunday 15 October 2017.

The victim, a 19-year-old local man, was allegedly hit with a baseball bat and the offender reportedly attempted to tie him up with cable ties before stealing a number of items including a laptop and watches.

The victim sustained a head injury, which was not believed to be serious, and was taken to hospital as a precaution.

A 26-year-old Bournemouth man has been charged with robbery and is due to appear at Bournemouth Crown Court today, Monday 6 November 2017.
