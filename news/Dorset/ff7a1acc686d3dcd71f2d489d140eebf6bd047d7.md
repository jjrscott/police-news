# Appeal following racially aggravated public order incident in Weymouth

07 July 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a racially aggravated public order incident in Weymouth are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

At around 8.25pm on Tuesday 23 June 2020 a man approached the till in the Spar shop on St Edmund Street and attempted to purchase some alcohol and tobacco. The offender pretended to have a bank card and touched the payment machine, while covering his actions with his other hand.

The staff member explained to the man that no payment had been made, before the offender started shouting racially aggravated abuse at him.

The offender is described as white, aged between 25 and 28 years old with ginger hair and beard. He was wearing shorts and did not have a top on.

Police Constable Andrea Watson, of Weymouth police, said: "While I appreciate the incident took place a while ago, I understand there were taxi drivers waiting outside the shop who may have witnessed the incident and I would urge them to please get in touch.

"I am also appealing to any motorists who may have been travelling in the area and noticed the man leaving the shop to check their dashcam for any relevant footage.

"If you have any information to assist my investigation, please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200090299. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
