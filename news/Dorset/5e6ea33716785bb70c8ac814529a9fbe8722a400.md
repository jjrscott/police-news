# Witness appeal following reported stabbing in Bournemouth

09 January 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating a reported stabbing in Bournemouth are appealing for a jogger who was in the area at the time to come forward.

Officers were called at 6.12pm on Saturday 7 January 2017 to reports that a man had been stabbed on Ashley Road at the junction with South Road in Bournemouth.

The victim - a local man aged in his 50s - suffered injuries to his head and was taken to hospital for treatment. His condition is not believed to be life-threatening.

A 17-year-old boy from Bournemouth was charged with attempted murder and possession of a bladed article and appeared before Bournemouth Magistrates' Court today, Monday 9 January 2017. He will next appear at Winchester Crown Court tomorrow, Tuesday 10 January.

Detective Constable Scott Brimicombe, of Bournemouth CID, said: "Following enquiries we understand a male jogger wearing florescent clothing was in the area and I believe they may have witnessed all or part of the incident.

"I would appeal to this person to please make contact with Dorset Police as you could have important information that may assist my investigation."
