# Appeal after reported assault in Swanage

04 March 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses following a reported assault in Swanage.

The incident happened at around 4.50pm on Saturday 2 March 2019 at the bus station.

The victim - a local man aged in his 50s who was standing on the pavement with his seven-year-old son - heard a disturbance on the number 50 bus which was parked.

A woman got off the bus and approached the man and his son. He outstretched his arms and asked the woman to go away, but she walked into him before she fell to the ground. When she got up she is alleged to have punched the man on the arm a couple of times while verbally making threats. She then walked off.

A 49-year-old woman from Swanage was arrested on suspicion of assault and has been released under investigation.

Police Constable Paul Diffey, of Purbeck police, said: "The incident occurred at a busy time of the day and I am appealing to anyone who witnessed what happened and has not spoken to officers to please get in touch with us."
