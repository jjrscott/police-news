# Witness appeal following fatal collision in Bournemouth

19 February 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a fatal collision in Bournemouth.

At around 3.45pm on Saturday 18 February 2017 it was reported that a collision occurred between a bicycle and a white Mitsubishi L200 that was parked in the Cranmer Road car park in Winton.

The cyclist - a 79-year-old local man - suffered a serious head injury and was taken to Southampton General Hospital by air ambulance. He sadly died from his injuries later that evening.

His next of kin have been informed and the coroner notified.

Police Constable Shaun Ferguson, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or saw the cyclist prior to the incident to please contact police."
