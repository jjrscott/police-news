# Update - witness appeal following reported rape in Bournemouth

15 January 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating a reported rape in Bournemouth on New Year's Eve have arrested a man.

The victim, a Bournemouth woman aged in her 30s, met a man in Southcote Road at around 11.30pm on Sunday 31 December 2017.

They walked together to a bowling green nearby, where sexual activity took place that was initially consensual. However, it is reported the man then became physically violent toward her and further sexual activity took place that the victim did not consent to.

The incident was reported to police in the early hours of Thursday 4 January 2018.

A 21-year-old Bournemouth man has been arrested on suspicion of rape and released on police bail until the end of January 2018 pending further enquiries.
