Officers investigating a burglary in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The victim, a man aged in his 60s, returned to his home in Melcombe Avenue at around 7.20pm on Friday 19 January 2018, having been away since approximately 4pm the previous day.

He found that the back door had apparently been forced open and a number of items had been taken from upstairs in the house including two laptops, a number of watches, items of jewellery, a camcorder and a camera.

The victim also discovered that his car, a Jaguar XF R-Sport saloon, had been stolen from the driveway.

Police Constable Chloe Chapman, of Weymouth police, said: "We are continuing to investigate this incident and have carried out a number of enquiries, including visiting houses in the area and attempting to trace the stolen vehicle.

"I am appealing to any witnesses to the burglary, or anyone who has any information that can assist our investigation, to contact police immediately.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who saw a car matching the description given in the area around the time of the burglary."
