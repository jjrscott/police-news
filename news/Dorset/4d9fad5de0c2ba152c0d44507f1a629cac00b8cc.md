# Update â€“ man released without charge following reported firearms incident in Bournemouth

06 November 2017

* * *

A man arrested in connection with a reported firearms incident in Bournemouth has been released without charge.

At 10.09am on Friday 3 November 2017 Dorset Police received a report that a man was believed to be in possession of a firearm in Bournemouth town centre. No threats were made to members of the public and nobody was injured.

Searches were carried out and a 55-year-old man from Bournemouth was later arrested at an address near Fordingbridge in Hampshire on suspicion of possessing a firearm in a public place without lawful authority or reasonable excuse. Two air weapons were recovered.

Following further investigations, it was established that the firearms he was in possession of were not illegal to own and he was released without charge.

Detective Chief Superintendent Mark Callaghan, of Dorset Police, said: "At no point during this incident was a weapon seen by any member of the public or any threats made. However, we will always take reports of this nature seriously and use all our available resources to establish whether there is a genuine threat."
