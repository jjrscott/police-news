# Dorset Police volunteers recognised for their dedication at regional awards

19 October 2017

A regional awards ceremony, held to highlight the dedication and hard work of special constables and police support volunteers, has recognised the work of Dorset Police volunteers at an event in Gloucester.

The Dorset Victims' Bureau walked away with the coveted award for ‘Police Support Volunteer Team of the Year 2017’.

The team was established in 2013, with Dorset being one of the first forces in the country to approach supporting victims of crime in a more joined up way. The bureau provides update to victims of crime on the progress of their investigation and support for individuals affected by their experience.

Seven volunteers have given over 1,000 hours of their time to supporting victims since the beginning of the year.

The bureau handles over 3,500 new crimes every month, giving valuable support to victims in Dorset.

Victims Bureau Manager, Karen Bader, said: "Winning this award is great recognition for the outstanding work the whole team performs at the bureau. We are passionate about the work we are doing to support victims of crime in our community and knowing members of the team give up their own time to support this is truly humbling. Their contribution is invaluable and should not be underestimated.''

Martyn Underhill, Dorset Police and Crime Commissioner, said: “The Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner is delighted to co-fund the work of the Dorset Victims’ Bureau and I wholeheartedly congratulate the team on winning this award, as it recognises their hard work, dedication and professionalism in supporting victims through the crime investigation process.”
