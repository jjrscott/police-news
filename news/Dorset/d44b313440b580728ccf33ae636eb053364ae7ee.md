# Witness appeal following fail-to-stop serious injury collision near Wool

21 December 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage to come forward following a fail-to-stop serious injury collision near Wool.

Sometime between 9.45am and 10.15am on Sunday 20 December 2020 a collision occurred in Bindon Lane involving an Isuzu pick-up truck towing an agricultural trailer and a cyclist.

The cyclist - a man aged in his 60s and from Poole - was knocked from his bike by the towing trailer and sustained a suspected broken leg and remains in hospital.

It is reported the driver of the vehicle failed to stop at the scene and instead continued to travel along Bindon Lane toward Wool.

Police Constable Clare Gillard, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was travelling along Bindon Lane at the relevant time and either witnessed the incident or may have captured it on dashcam to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would also ask the motorist involved to please get in touch so we can take an account for our investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200191306. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
