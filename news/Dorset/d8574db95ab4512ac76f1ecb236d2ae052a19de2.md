# Man charged following alleged assault in Bournemouth

16 December 2016

* * *

Officers investigating an alleged assault on a woman in Bournemouth have charged a man.

The 58-year-old local man has been charged with wounding with intent and is due to appear before Bournemouth Magistrates' Court today, Friday 16 December 2016.

The incident was reported to police at 10.28pm on Tuesday 13 December 2016 by the ambulance service after a local woman was found with serious injuries outside Charminster Supermarket in Charminster Road.

The woman, aged in her 20s, was taken to hospital with serious head injuries. Her condition remains life-threatening.

The incident was subsequently linked to an alleged assault at an address in nearby Shelborne Road and it is believed that the injured woman had made her way from that address to the supermarket where calls were made to emergency services.

The victim and charged man are known to each other.

A 44-year-old local man, who had been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, has been released with no further action.

Detective Inspector Neil Wright, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am still appealing to anyone who witnessed or heard the incident in Shelborne Road to please contact Dorset Police.

"I also believe people spoke to the injured woman outside the supermarket on Charminster Road. I would ask them to come forward as they may have important information that could help with our investigation."
