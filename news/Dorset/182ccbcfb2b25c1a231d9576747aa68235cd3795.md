A man is due to appear in court in connection with an alleged shoplifting in Poole.

It was reported that at around 2pm on Wednesday 22 July 2020 a man entered the Marks and Spencer store in Lower Blandford Road in Broadstone and made off without paying for around £80 worth of goods.

Following enquiries and a CCTV appeal, a 47-year-old Poole man has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 17 November 2020 for an offence of theft.
