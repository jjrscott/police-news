# Update â€“ further arrest following reported robbery in Bournemouth

19 January 2021

* * *

A third person has been arrested in connection with a reported robbery in Bournemouth.

The incident occurred at around 1.10pm on Friday 15 January 2021 on a footpath that leads from Harewood Avenue to the Littledown Estate.

It was reported that a 17-year-old boy was approached by three people, threatened with a knife and his bicycle stolen. The three suspects allegedly made off in the direction of Sevenoaks Drive.

Officers attended and carried out searches of the area. A 15-year-old boy and an 18-year-old man, both from Bournemouth, were arrested on suspicion of robbery and were released on police bail.

Following further enquiries, a 17-year-old boy from New Milton in Hampshire has also been arrested on suspicion of robbery and is assisting police with their enquiries.

Officers are continuing to investigate the matter and are keen for anyone with information to come forward. They are particularly keen to hear from two women - a woman with a black dog who was walking her dog in the area and a blonde woman - who spoke to the victim after the incident and may have information to assist the investigation.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210010929.
