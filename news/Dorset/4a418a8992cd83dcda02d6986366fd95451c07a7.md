Officers investigating an incident of indecent exposure in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 4am on Tuesday 15 September 2020 a man arrived on a bicycle at the Shell garage on Waterloo Road wearing a face covering, a black rucksack and no clothes.

It is reported that the man asked the shop worker several times to perform a lewd act on him, before cycling off.

Police Constable Jack Morrison, of Poole police, said: "This must have been a distressing incident for the female shop worker and enquiries are underway to identify the man.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have been in the area at the time and witnessed any suspicious activity to please get in touch.

"I would also ask any motorists who were travelling along Waterloo Road around the time of the incident and may have captured anything on relevant on dashcam footage to contact Dorset Police."
