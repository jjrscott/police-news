# Assault in Bournemouth - witness appeal

06 August 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information to come forward after a woman was assaulted in Bournemouth.

The incident occurred at around 4.30am on Sunday 5 August 2018. The victim, a woman aged in her 30s, was walking along Poole Road in Westbourne, in the direction of the LV roundabout.

As she passed Iceland, an unknown man approached her from behind, lifted the hood of her coat over her head and face and grabbed her neck.

He made threats toward her and pushed her along the pavement toward Seamoor Road.

As they entered Seamoor Road an elderly man came walking toward them, upon seeing him the offender let go of the woman and ran off.

He is described as white, tall and of slim build with brown hair that is balding on top and was wearing all dark clothing.

The woman suffered minor injuries to her nose and lip but did not require any hospital treatment.

Detective Sergeant Jess Pearcey, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was an extremely frightening ordeal for the victim and I would like to reassure members of the public that a detailed investigation is underway to identify the man responsible.

"We are carrying out a number of enquiries, including exploring CCTV opportunities in the area and trying to identify any potential witnesses.

"I am keen to speak to anyone with information about this incident, particularly a taxi driver who may have driven past around the time of the offence and the elderly man whose presence scared off the suspect."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180125052. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
