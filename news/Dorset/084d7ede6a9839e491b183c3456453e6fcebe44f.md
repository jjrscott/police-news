# Appeal for information following reported assault and public order incident in Dorchester

27 August 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following a reported assault and public order incident in Dorchester.

The incident occurred at around 9.50pm on Thursday 20 August 2020 in Kings Road. It was reported that four people - two men and two teenage girls - were approached by a group of around 10 people.

The group was reportedly being aggressive toward the four victims and one of the men is reported to have punched out in self-defence at one of them before attempting to run away, at which point he was allegedly tripped and assaulted.

One of the group reportedly pulled out a knife and threatened them.

The victims were able to make off from the scene. The man who was assaulted sustained swelling to his head and cuts and grazes to his leg.

Following enquiries, a 15-year-old local boy was arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and a public order offence. He has been released on police bail.

Police Constable James Curtis-Burchett, of Dorchester police, said: "We are continuing to make enquiries into this incident and I would urge any witnesses who have not already spoken to police to please contact us.

"I would also urge anyone who was driving in the area of Kings Road around the relevant time and has dashcam fitted to their vehicle to please check their footage for anything relevant."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200125495. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
