# UPDATE: Controlled detonation of unexploded ordnance

24 November 2016

* * *

A controlled detonation of an unexploded World War II ordnance found in Corfe Mullen successfully took place today, Thursday 24 November 2016.

The device was found at Henbury Quarry in Old Market Road on Tuesday 22 November and the Military Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) attended and carried out procedures to make the area safe.

The controlled explosion took place shortly before 10.30am today and, at the request of the EOD, Dorset Police implemented a 1,000 metre cordon which involved the evacuation of 32 properties and six businesses and the closure of local roads.

Residents and businesses within a 2,000 metre radius of the quarry were also made aware.

Superintendent Caroline Naughton, of Dorset Police, said: "I would like to thank all those residents, businesses and motorists who were affected by the evacuation and road closures for their understanding and patience.

"Following the controlled explosion, the EOD examined the device and that it was a 5,000 kg ordnance prototype and not a viable explosive.

"Today's planned controlled explosion involved a large number of agencies and I would like to thank them for their assistance and support."
