# Public appeal following burglary in Bournemouth

19 August 2017

* * *

Detectives have issued a warning to the public following a burglary in Bournemouth.
 At around 4am today, Saturday 19 August 2017, a woman woke to find an unknown man in the bedroom of her ground floor flat in Christchurch Road near to the Iford roundabout. The offender, who was wearing a balaclava, was seen reaching for the woman's mobile phone before he was startled and ran out of the house onto Christchurch Road. The victim - who is aged in her 50s - discovered that the offender had searched most of the rooms in her flat. She found that her bank cards had been removed from her purse. An investigation is underway and officers have established that the offender gained access to the address through an open ground floor window. Detective Sergeant Andy Haworth, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who saw a man acting suspiciously in the Christchurch Road area in the early hours of this morning to please contact Dorset Police. "As the offender was disturbed during this incident, it is possible that he may have disposed of the victim's bank cards and the balaclava he was wearing in the nearby area. I would ask anyone who discovers such items near their property, in their gardens or bins to contact us. "Finally, this is one of a number of burglaries we are investigating where offenders have gained access to properties via open windows. I am urging residents to ensure they shut their windows at night, particularly those on the ground floor. Do not make life easy for burglars." Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170128423. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
