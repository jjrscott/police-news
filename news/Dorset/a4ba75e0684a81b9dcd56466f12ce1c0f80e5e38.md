# Witness appeal following reported assault in Poole

24 August 2020

* * *

Detectives investigating a reported assault in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police was called at 10.20pm on Sunday 23 August 2020 to a report of a fight involving a group of people on Lower Blandford Road in the Broadstone area.

Officers attended and carried out a search of the area.

The victim - a man aged in his 20s - sustained a laceration to his head and was taken to hospital for treatment. His injuries are not life-threatening.

Following enquiries, two boys - aged 14 and 17 - were arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. A 41-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender.

All three arrested people, who are from the Poole area, are assisting detectives with their enquiries.

Detective Constable Steve Davis, of Bournemouth CID, said: "A full investigation is underway into the incident and I am appealing to any witnesses who have not already spoken to police to please get in touch.

"I am also keen to hear from any motorists who may have driven past and captured any relevant footage on dashcam to assist my enquiries."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200126656. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
