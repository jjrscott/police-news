* * *

A man has come forward in connection with a reported assault on an elderly man in Christchurch following a CCTV appeal.

At 9.20am on Monday 7 October 2019 the victim - a local man aged in his 70s - got onto the 1A bus on Barrack Road. The driver told the victim that he could not use his bus pass for another 10 minutes, however the victim continued to get on the bus and sit down.

It was reported that a male passenger on the bus picked up the victim's walking aid and hat and threw them off the bus onto the pavement.

The victim got off the bus to retrieve his items. As he attempted to step back on the bus, the man allegedly kicked the victim in the stomach causing him to fall back onto the pavement and bang his head on the ground.

Following a CCTV appeal, a man aged in his 40s and from Christchurch has come forward and is assisting officers with their enquiries. No arrests have been made.
