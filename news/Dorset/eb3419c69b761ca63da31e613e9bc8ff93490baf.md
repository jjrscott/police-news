# Witness appeal following robbery in Bournemouth

10 April 2019

* * *

Detectives investigating a robbery in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward.

The incident happened at around 10.30pm on Monday 8 April 2019 in the Lower Gardens.

The victim, a 27-year-old man from Saudi Arabia, was sitting on a bench with a female friend when they were approached by two unknown men. One of the men grabbed a bottle from the victim, which led to a struggle between the two. The victim was then punched by that man and fell to the ground. He sustained a serious head injury and a broken jaw.

The two men left in the direction of Gervis Place. One of them is described as white, between five feet nine inches and six feet tall and of skinny build. He was wearing a white jacket. The other man is between five feet eleven inches and six feet three inches tall, of larger build and was dressed in a red jumper. It is believed that both men are in their 20s.

Detective Inspector Neil Wright, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was a vicious and unprovoked attack, which left the victim hospitalised with serious injuries.

"We have already made a number of enquiries, including looking at CCTV. I am appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident or saw these men in the area at the relevant time to contact us urgently."
