# Appeal for information following reported aggravated burglary in Blandford

13 July 2020

* * *

Detectives investigating a reported aggravated burglary in Blandford are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police received a report that at around 2.30am on Sunday 12 July 2020 a group of three or four men had forced their way into an address in Victoria Road.

One of the occupants of the property fled the address and a second man, aged 18, was allegedly assaulted with what was believed to be a machete, causing a serious injury to his leg.

The men reportedly stole a quantity of cash before making off in a black vehicle.

Following enquiries, two men - a 22-year-old from Liverpool and a 28-year-old from Derbyshire - have been arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary and are assisting officers with their enquiries.

The injured man was taken to hospital, where he continues to receive treatment.

Detective Sergeant Matt Bradley, of Weymouth CID, said: "We have been carrying out a number of enquiries into this incident and I am appealing for anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area of Victoria Road on the night of Saturday 11 July into the early hours of Sunday 12 July 2020 - or who has any information that might assist our investigation - to please come forward."

Neighbourhood Inspector Simon Perry, of Blandford police, said: "Reports of violent incidents of this nature are, thankfully, rare for this area and I would like to reassure residents that detectives are carrying out a full investigation into this matter.

"There will be an increased police presence in the area as enquiries are carried out and local officers can be approached by members of the public with any concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200101227. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
