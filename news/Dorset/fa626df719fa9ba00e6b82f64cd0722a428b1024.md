# Appeal for information following theft of electric bicycle in Bournemouth

28 October 2020

* * *

Officers investigating the theft of an electric bicycle in Bournemouth are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

On Saturday 17 October 2020 a 14-year-old boy double locked his electric bicycle to the railings outside of The Real Greek on Exeter Crescent. He also removed the battery from the bike, before leaving the area.

When he returned at around 3.50pm the victim saw a man getting on to his bicycle, having previously cut both of the locks.

The victim asked the man to stop, but he rode off into the gardens in the direction of Pier Approach.

The bike is a blue electric Decathlon Rockrider bicycle with pink detailing on it.

The man is described as white, aged in his 20s, with short dark hair and facial stubble. He was wearing a black Puffa-style jacket with black jeans.

Police Constable Kristy Heron, of Dorset Police, said: "We have now obtained a full account from the victim and an investigation is underway to identify the man who stole the bike.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the area on the day and saw what happened to please get in touch.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who may have seen a bike matching the description given for sale locally in unusual circumstances."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200156508. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
