* * *

Officers investigating a fatal road traffic collision in West Moors are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At 10.02am on Friday 6 October 2017, Dorset Police was notified of a serious road traffic collision that occurred just off Sarum Avenue, West Moors involving a car and pedestrian.

The pedestrian, an 84-year-old local woman, sadly died later that night at Poole hospital. Her family is being supported at this difficult time by specialist officers from the Roads Policing Team.

The driver of the vehicle involved was spoken to by police and an investigation as to the circumstances of the collision is underway.

Police Sergeant Craig Tatton, of the traffic unit, said: "This is a fairly quiet residential area and we have made a number of house-to-house enquiries to find out what exactly happened. However, if anyone, who has not spoken with officers yet, has witnessed the collision, please contact us as soon as possible."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at scit@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 6:127. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
