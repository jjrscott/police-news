# Serious injury collision by Beaminster Tunnel â€“ witness appeal

18 May 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a serious injury collision near Beaminster Tunnel.

At 8.54am today, Thursday 18 May 2017, a collision occurred on the A3066 half a mile from the tunnel toward Mosterton involving a red Peugeot 106 and a blue single-decker Volvo bus registered to a company from Somerset.

The driver of the Peugeot - a local woman - sustained serious injuries and was airlifted to Southmead Hospital Bristol. Her condition is described as life-threatening.

The bus driver was not physically injured, but was treated for shock. There were no passengers on the bus at the time.

The road was closed between Whetley Cross and Bridport while officers, paramedics and firefighters dealt with the incident. The road re-opened after 5pm.

Police Sergeant Jon Wren, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or saw either vehicle immediately before the incident to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would like to thank motorists and residents for their patience during the road closures which were necessary to allow us to establish what happened today."
