Officers in Weymouth are appealing for information after a bus shelter was damaged in Littlemoor.

The incident happened at around 11.40pm on Thursday 18 January 2018 on Littlemoor Road outside the shopping centre.

One of the boys had short brown hair and was wearing a black tracksuit and dark footwear. The second boy was wearing a black hooded top and dark-coloured trousers.

Police Constable Holly Spillman, of Weymouth police, said: "This incident caused considerable damage to the bus shelter and I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or knows who the culprits are to please contact Dorset Police.

"We will not tolerate anti-social behaviour in our community and will deal with anyone engaging in such behaviour robustly."
