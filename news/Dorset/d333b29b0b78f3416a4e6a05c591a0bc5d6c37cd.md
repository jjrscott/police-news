# Public appeal after teenage boy robbed in Bournemouth town centre

06 September 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for the public's help to find a group of male offenders who robbed a teenage boy of his clothing in Bournemouth town centre.

Just after midnight on Sunday 2 September 2018 a 14-year-old boy from London was walking through the Lower Gardens when he was jumped on by four to five people.

He was punched several times in the face before his blue jeans, black T-shirt, black Trapstar hat and black Nike man bag, which contained a small amount of cash, were stolen.

The victim, who was visiting Bournemouth for the air festival, sustained a black eye and a small cut below and above his eye.

Detective Constable Nicky Sharpe, of Bournemouth CID, said: "The offenders are described as white and they wore hooded tops pulled tight around their faces and dark clothing. They left the area toward The Square. We have carried out CCTV enquiries in the area but have not been able to locate footage of the suspects.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the gardens at the time of the incident and may have information that could help me identify those responsible to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180141317. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
