12 November 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for anyone with information to come forward after a number of suspected stolen tools were recovered from an address in Poole.

The tools, mainly landscaping tools such as hedge trimmers, chainsaws and interchangeable engines for multi-tools, were recovered by police on Friday 9 October 2020. A number of the items recovered are Stihl tools and are orange in colour.

A 41-year-old Poole man was interviewed in connection with the alleged theft of the tools and has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Police Constable Phil Prentice, of Poole police, said: "We are continuing to investigate this matter and are keen to identify any potential victims.

"If you suspect any of the recovered items may be yours, please contact us with and provide a description including the make, model, serial number and any distinguishing feature of any stolen items. If the description matches any of those items we have recovered, we will be in touch.

"I would also like to take this opportunity to remind members of the public to make sure any valuable tools are marked appropriately and their serial numbers are recorded to make it easier for them to be identified.

"I would further urge people to make sure their tools are kept securely and not left in vehicles overnight where possible."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200130550. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
