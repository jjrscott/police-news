Detectives investigating a series of reports of commercial burglaries in Dorchester are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Shortly after 12am on Friday 28 September 2018 Dorset Police received a report of a break-in at Malvern Tyres at Poundbury West Industrial Estate. It was reported that a till had been taken.

At 2.55am a further report was received of a burglary in progress at Dorset Cyclelife Electric on Bridport Road in Poundbury with a large quantity of electric bikes loaded into a vehicle.

Reports were also received of a burglary at Dorchester Strength and Conditioning as well as attempted break-ins at the Domestic Appliance Centre and Dorset Vehicle Rentals, all on the Railway Triangle Industrial Estate, which had occurred on the night of Thursday 27 September 2018. Police also received a report of an attempt to steal a Volkswagen Caravelle campervan at Middle Farm Way in Poundbury.

A 47-year-old man from Liverpool was arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary in connection with the Dorset CycleLife Electric incident and has been released under investigation as detectives continue their enquiries.

Detective Constable Lynda Soutine, of Weymouth CID, said: "We are carrying out a full investigation into all of these reported burglaries and I am appealing for any witnesses to these incidents or anyone with information to contact police.
