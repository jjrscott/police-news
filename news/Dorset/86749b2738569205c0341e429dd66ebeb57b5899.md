# A unique chance to share your views on policing in Dorset

14 October 2019

* * *

**Dorset Police has launched ‘Your Dorset. Your Police. Your View.’ – a new way to make your views heard to help shape the county’s policing in the future.**

On 14 October 2019, Dorset Police launched an online priority setter to give the public the opportunity to put themselves in the Chief Constable’s shoes and decide what is most important to them.

Through a simple slider tool people will be able to make decisions about the resourcing of police priorities in Dorset. The aim is to increase people’s knowledge of the complexity of the work carried out by Dorset Police. The slider will show the potential impact that increasing (or decreasing) resources in any one area could have on the service provided across Dorset.

This information will help to inform the Chief Constable in shaping how the Force allocates its resources in the future.

‘Your Dorset. Your Police. Your View’ will be separated into two stages over the next four months. Each stage will allow Dorset residents to consider on two separate themes that are key to how the county is policed.

Activities during each stage will provide in-depth information about key themes. This will give the public a better understanding to accurately share their views about what is most important to them, and how the police should be approaching challenges in that area.

Chief Constable James Vaughan said: “The last few years have seen an unprecedented scale of change in policing. Every police force has needed to make large financial savings, while modernising and continuing to deliver essential policing services.

“Four years ago we asked the public for their views on our priorities. The findings from that piece of work have helped to shape the Force we are today.

“Through ‘Your Dorset. Your Police. Your View’ we are once again giving you the opportunity to learn more about the challenges and complexities of modern policing. We also want to know what is most important to you - so you can tell us how Dorset Police can continue to best meet your needs, and keep you safe in the future.

“I would urge everyone who lives, works or visits Dorset to take a look at the website and to take part."
