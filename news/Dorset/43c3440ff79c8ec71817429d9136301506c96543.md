Detectives investigating an alleged assault on a member of staff at a Bournemouth supermarket are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Officers were called at 3.43pm on Monday 5 February 2018 to reports of an assault on a member of staff at Asda in St Pauls Road.

The ambulance service also attended and a man aged in his 20s was treated for injuries to his mouth and ears. He was taken to hospital but released later that same day.

A 28-year-old man from Poole was arrested on suspicion of assault as well as possession of a class A and a class B drug. He has been released under investigation as police enquiries continue.

Investigations Officer Ady Gage, of Bournemouth CID, said: “We have carried out a number of enquiries into this incident including a review of CCTV footage.

“This incident occurred at a busy time of day for the store and I am appealing for any witnesses who have not already contacted police to get in touch.”
