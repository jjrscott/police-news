# Dorset Police partners with local BID to enhance policing in Ferndown

11 May 2018

* * *

Dorset Police has joined forces with the Ferndown and Uddens Business Improvement District (BID) working together to build community safety on the industrial estates and in the wider Ferndown area.

The BID has funded an electric vehicle for use by the local neighbourhood policing team (NPT) to provide additional high-visibility patrols in the community.

Office space within the estate has also been provided as a remote working base for the NPT, as well as a contribution to support the Force's drone team.

The base on the industrial estate will be used by Dorset Police to train officers in using new drone technology and equipment, while also providing additional aerial patrols of the area to ensure it continues to be a safe place for businesses to operate.

A launch event was recently held to officially hand over the electric vehicle and office space to the NPT.

Cheyne Marley, Regeneration and Business Liaison Inspector, said: "This is a unique approach and Ferndown and Uddens BID has given us the opportunity to maximise the deployment of high-visibility patrols in the area with the new vehicle and office space.

"As we expand the number of officers trained to search using innovative drone technology, it is great that the BID has also been able to support us to achieve new ways of working.
"It is hoped this approach could be mirrored in other areas of Dorset as a way of working more closely with our local businesses while providing community reassurance."

Local businessman and Chairman of the Ferndown and Uddens BID, Russell Bowyer, said: "The business community has adapted its view of how an effective partnership can develop with policing. This includes examining the practical assistance businesses can provide rather than expecting a one sided relationship. Increased understanding and appreciation of both our organisations has been mutually beneficial."

The partnership has been actively supported by the county's Police and Crime Commissioner, Martyn Underhill. "Local businesses provide valuable information and intelligence, when it comes to keeping our communities safe and this initiative highlights what good partnership working can achieve''

"This is a huge step in embedding our partnership approach with Dorset businesses and I would like to thank everyone for their drive and energy in achieving this nationally-recognised sponsorship BID."
