# Fatal collision in Bournemouth - witness appeal

05 March 2017

* * *

Police are appealing for witnesses after a single vehicle fatal collision in Bournemouth.

Officers were called at around 3.05am on Sunday 5 March 2017 to reports that a grey Vauxhall Astra had collided with a lamp post before hitting a tree along Harewood Avenue near to the junction with Harewood Place.

The driver - a 28-year-old Bournemouth man - suffered serious injuries and was extracted from the vehicle by the fire service but sadly died at the scene.

His next of kin have been informed and the coroner notified.

Two male passengers of the Astra were taken to hospital for treatment to non-life threatening injuries.

The road is currently closed to allow collision investigators to examine the scene.

Chief Inspector Steve White, of Dorset Police, said: "We have specially trained officers supporting the man's family at this difficult time.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or the manner of driving of the Astra prior to the incident to contact police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 5:58. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
