# UPDATE - Witness appeal following reported driving offences in Poole

01 March 2017

* * *

A man has been released on police bail following reports that a vehicle failed to stop for police in Poole.

At around 10.30am yesterday, Tuesday 28 February 2017, a green Volkswagen Sharan was reported to have travelled from Holes Bay Road to Sterte Road Railway Bridge along Broadstone Way, Willis Way and Fleets Lane and reportedly failed to stop for officers when requested.

A 19-year-old London man who was arrested on suspicion of traffic offences and possession of a controlled class A drug has been released on police bail until the end of March 2017 pending further enquiries.

Police Constable Sean Ford, of Poole police, said: "I believe that the Volkswagan Sharan almost collided with other vehicles on the road at the junction of Wessex Gate Retail Park and Willis Way and also at the junction of Willis Way and Fleets Lane.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the manner of driving of the vehicle prior to the incident to please contact police."
