# Witness appeal following alleged assault on Portland

22 July 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating an alleged assault on Portland are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward.

At 4.40am on Saturday 22 July 2017 Dorset Police received a report that several people entered an address on Fortuneswell which contained a number of men and threatened some of them with a knife. A fight ensued during which it appears someone was injured. The people then left the address, however it is unclear at this time if anything was taken from the property.

Officers, including armed officers and a dog unit, attended and searched the area.

A 43-year-old man, a 36-year-old man and a 29-year-old woman, all from the Weymouth area, and a 17-year-old boy of no fixed abode, have been arrested on suspicion of assault and are helping officers with their enquiries.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 22:67. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
