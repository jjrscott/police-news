# Pair jailed for drug supply offences in Bournemouth

15 March 2021

* * *

Two men have been jailed after they were found in possession of class A drugs at a hotel in Bournemouth.

Thomas Michael Joseph Peers, aged 29 and of Childwall Lane, Liverpool, appeared at Bournemouth Crown Court on Friday 12 March 2021 and was sentenced to three years in prison after admitting two offences of possessing class A drugs with intent to supply.

His co-defendant Joseph Mercer, aged 25, and of Daisy Lane, Liverpool, had pleaded guilty to the same charges at an earlier hearing at the same court and was sentenced on Wednesday 21 October 2020 to 30 months in prison.

At around 11.20am on Thursday 19 January 2017 Dorset Police received a report that a suspicious white powder had been seen in a room at a hotel in Grove Road and that the smell of cannabis had been detected from the same room.

An officer attended shortly after the report was received, but Peers - who had been staying in the room - had already packed up and left.

Following enquiries by officers, his car was located in the car park of another hotel nearby later that same day.

Officers were given access to his room. Peers and Mercer were inside and nearly 100 wraps of suspected class A drugs were seized. Officers also found around Â£1,000 in cash, several mobile phones and weighing scales in the room.

The wraps were analysed and found to contain heroin and crack cocaine.

Both defendants were subsequently charged and first appeared in court in May 2018.

Police Constable Stuart Grant, of the Bournemouth South Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "These defendants came down to Bournemouth for the purpose of supplying class A drugs and we want to send a clear message that we will take action against those who attempt to deal illegal drugs in our communities.

"Thanks to the information we received and our subsequent enquiries, we were able to catch these men in possession of a significant amount of class A drugs and bring them before the court to face justice.

"I would urge anyone with information about suspected drug-related activity to contact us at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101."
