# UPDATE: Witness appeal after attempted street robbery in Weymouth

25 January 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating an attempted street robbery in Weymouth have arrested a man.

Officers were called to reports that sometime between 8.30pm and 9.30pm on Wednesday 11 January 2017 a man was riding his bicycle outside The Cutter pub in East Street when he was pulled off the bike by a group of men who verbally abused him.

It is alleged the men demanded the victim's running shoes, coat and his bicycle before throwing empty cans of drink at him and then stamping on him.

The victim, a local man aged in his 40s, reported that he wrapped himself around his bike on the road to prevent it being taken. He suffered minor injuries in the incident. Nothing was stolen.

An 18-year-old man from Weymouth has been arrested on suspicion of two counts of assault and has been released on police bail pending further enquiries until the beginning of March 2017.
