# Man arrested following two alleged robberies on taxi drivers in Bournemouth

11 December 2018

* * *

Detectives have arrested a man on suspicion of two robberies on taxi drivers in Bournemouth.

The 28-year-old was arrested on suspicion of robbery, aggravated vehicle taking and arson.

The first incident is alleged to have occurred just before 1am on Sunday 9 December 2018. It was reported that a taxi driver - a local man aged in his 40s - picked up a man in Meyrick Road and drove him to St Clement's Road near to the church. Upon arrival, it was alleged that he was threatened with a knife and was told to hand over money. The suspect reportedly made off with a quantity of cash. The taxi driver did not sustain any physical injuries.

The second incident is reported to have happened at around 3.30am the same day. It is alleged that a second taxi driver - a man aged in his 50s - was approached by two men on Southcote Road who asked him if he could take them to Southbourne.

The men then reportedly threatened the taxi driver at knifepoint and demanded he hand over money.

The taxi driver managed to escape the taxi and run off. He then reportedly saw one of the men get into the driver seat and drive off. A short time later the fire service was called to Aylesbury Road, where the taxi was located on fire and was extinguished. The taxi driver was not physically injured.

Detectives are still appealing for anyone with information about either incident to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180197326. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
