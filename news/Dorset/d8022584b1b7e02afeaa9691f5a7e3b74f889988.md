A man is due to appear in court in connection with a serious injury collision in Gillingham.

At 11.46am on Thursday 23 April 2020 Dorset Police received a report of a collision in Le Neubourg Way, opposite the Waitrose supermarket, involving a red Seat Leon and a pedestrian.

Emergency services attended and the pedestrian, a three-year-old girl, was taken by air ambulance to Southampton General Hospital for treatment to injuries that were believed to be potentially life-changing.

The driver of the Seat, a 43-year-old man from Gillingham, has been issued with a postal requisition for an offence of driving a motor vehicle with a proportion of a specified controlled drug above the specified legal limit. He is due to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 25 November 2020.
