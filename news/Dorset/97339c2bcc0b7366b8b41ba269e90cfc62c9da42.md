A man has come forward following a CCTV appeal in connection with a number of alleged assaults in Bournemouth town centre.

At 2.42am on Saturday 31 August 2019 it was reported that an assault occurred on Old Christchurch Road near to Chkn Station and a man was hit over the head with a bottle. He sustained an injury to his ear that required hospital treatment.

Around 15 minutes later, a report of an assault was received outside TK Maxx on Old Christchurch Road. It is alleged that a man was pushed to the ground. A second man - aged in his 30s - intervened and was reportedly kicked and punched, causing injuries to his nose and lip.

A further assault was reported to have occurred in The Square, where a man was punched and kicked.

Two men, both aged 21 and from Bournemouth, were arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm, assault and affray. They have been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Following a CCTV appeal, a 19-year-old man has come forward and is assisting officers with their enquiries.
