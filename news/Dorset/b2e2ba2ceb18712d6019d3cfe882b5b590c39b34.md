# Thank you to residents after incident in Ferndown

10 June 2019

* * *

Officers would like to thank residents for their support and patience during an incident in Ferndown in which a man and a woman have been arrested.

At around 4.15pm on Sunday 9 June 2019 officers attended an address in Coppins Close off Christchurch Road to carry out arrest enquiries in relation to an ongoing aggravated burglary investigation.

One man and a woman reportedly refused to come out of the address and a cordon was put in place to allow specialist officers to deal with the situation and to make enquiries while keeping the public safe.

It was reported a man was armed with a knife.

At around 11.20pm a 30-year-old local man was arrested on suspicion of burglary and a serious assault.

A 31-year-old local woman was arrested on suspicion of burglary.

They are both assisting officers with enquiries.

Inspector Julie Howe, of Dorset Police, said: "The incident has concluded and I would like to thank the residents of Coppins Close for their patience and understanding while officers worked at the scene.

"We had to cordon off the area in order to deal with the situation while keeping the public safe. I am aware that this took quite a few hours and I would like to thank those residents directly affected by the closure.

"I am also grateful to the ambulance service for their assistance.

"An investigation is now underway, which will be led by detectives from Bournemouth CID."
