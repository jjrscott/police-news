25 September 2020

* * *

Officers investigating two reported assaults in Bournemouth are appealing for any witnesses to come forward.

At around 2pm on Saturday 19 September 2020 it was reported a man aged in his 40s was assaulted outside Iceland in Wimborne Road in Winton by a male teenager with a glass bottle. The victim sustained a cut to his arm.

Around an hour later officers found another man, also aged in his 40s, with injuries approximately 100 metres away from the earlier incident near to the Conto Lounge. He alleged that he had been assaulted by a teenager who was still at the scene and sustained cuts to his face.

A 17-year-old Bournemouth boy was arrested and subsequently charged with wounding with intent, attempted wounding with intent and possessing an offensive weapon in a public place. He appeared at Poole Magistrates' Court on Monday 21 September 2020 and is next due to appear at the same court on Monday 28 September 2020.

Detective Constable Fran Howard, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We are continuing to make enquiries into this matter and I would urge any witnesses or anyone with information that might assist our investigation to please contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200141455. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
