# Update in relation to reported theft by finding in Poole

05 May 2020

* * *

A woman has come forward following an appeal in relation to a reported theft by finding incident in Poole.

The incident occurred at around 7.30pm on Wednesday 8 April 2020. It was reported that the victim had paid for their shopping at the self-service tills at the Asda store in Canford Heath and accidentally left their bank card in the machine. The next customer then came along and allegedly took the victim's card before using it to pay for their own shopping, which totalled Â£20.16.

Following a CCTV appeal to identify a person officers wanted to speak to as part of their investigation, a woman has come forward and is assisting officers with their enquiries. No arrest have been made.
