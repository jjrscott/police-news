# Appeal following serious injury collision at Lytchett Minster

14 September 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a serious injury collision at Lytchett Minster.

Dorset Police was called at 5.23am on Monday 14 September 2020 to reports of a collision on the A35 near the Axim Centre involving a white Mitsubishi Outlander and a white Keeway Logik motorcycle.

The rider of the motorcycle - a 28-year-old man from Weymouth - sustained very serious injuries and has been taken to Southampton General Hospital for treatment.

The driver of the Mitsubishi, a man aged in his 40s and from Poole, was uninjured.

The A35 was closed between the Bakers Arms roundabout and Morden Park Corner. It was reopened at around 11.20am.

Police Sergeant Mark Scammel, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was travelling along that stretch of the A35 at the relevant time and either witnessed the collision, saw either vehicle immediately prior or has captured any relevant footage on dashcam to please contact Dorset Police.

"I appreciate the road closures caused some level of inconvenience, but they were entirely necessary to allow emergency services to treat the injured rider, investigators to examine the scene and for the vehicles to be recovered in a safe manner."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 10:40. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
