# Update - image appeal following reported assault in Poole

08 November 2020

* * *

Officers investigating an alleged assault in Poole say a man has come forward following an image appeal.

At around 4.20pm on Wednesday 4 November 2020 it is reported the victim - a 15-year-old boy - was walking along Ashley Road with his friends when one of them became involved in a verbal altercation at the junction with Pearson Avenue with two men who were in a Mercedes.

The victim also subsequently got involved in the altercation. It is alleged that the men got out of the Mercedes and the driver reportedly assaulted the victim.

An image appeal was issued and as a result a 32-year-old local man has come forward and is assisting officers with their enquiries. No arrests have been made.
