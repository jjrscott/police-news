Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a number of shopfronts were damaged in Dorchester town centre.

Officers were alerted to a shop alarm sounding in South Street shortly before 5am this morning, Saturday 29 July 2017.

It was discovered that around ten other shops and businesses in the street also had damage to their windows.

A 27-year-old Dorchester man has been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and is assisting officers with their enquiries.

"This incident has obviously had an impact on a number of businesses in the town and we would welcome any information that can assist with our enquiries."
