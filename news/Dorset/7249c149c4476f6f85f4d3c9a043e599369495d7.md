# Sudden death of man in Poole â€“ witness appeal

11 April 2018

* * *

Officers investigating the sudden death of a man on behalf of the coroner are appealing for a potential witness to come forward.

At around 10pm on Wednesday 21 February 2018 Dorset Police received a call from Poole Hospital reporting that a man had been found seriously ill near to The Angel pub in Market Street.

The man - aged 72 and from Poole - sadly died in hospital on Saturday 3 March 2018. At this time his death is not being treated as suspicious and the coroner has been notified.

Police Constable Scott Thorne, of Poole police, said: "As part of my enquiries into this man's death on behalf of the coroner, it has now come to light that a member of the public may have spoken to the man just before he began to suffer a medical episode in the street.

"This member of public is described as a white man, aged in his 70s, approximately five feet two inches tall and of medium build. He is a frequent visitor to The Angel pub and was seen to walk along Market Street and into St Aubyns Court.

"I would like to emphasise that this man is only being treated as a witness and I would ask him or anyone who has information about who he may be to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180028090. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
