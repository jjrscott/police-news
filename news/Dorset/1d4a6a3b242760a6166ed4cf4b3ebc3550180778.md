# Appeal for information following reported sexual threats in Bournemouth

21 January 2020

* * *

Detectives investigating an incident where a woman was reportedly threatened with a sexual attack in Bournemouth are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

A man has been arrested and charged in connection with the incident, which occurred at around 6pm on Friday 20 December 2019 on a footpath adjacent to the Wessex Way, near to the Springbourne roundabout. The woman was reportedly walking on her own when she was approached by a man who showed her pornographic images on his mobile phone, kicked out at her and threatened her with a sexual attack.

The man is reported to have left the scene after a member of public approached.

Following enquiries by detectives, a 32-year-old Bournemouth man was arrested and has subsequently been charged with committing an offence, namely assault by beating, with the intention of committing a sexual offence.

He has also been charged with two offences of displaying any writing, sign or visible representation with intent to cause harassment, alarm or distress in relation to two other incidents.

These incidents occurred on Monday 11 November 2019 in Wimborne Road and Columbia Road in Bournemouth. It is alleged that the man approached two women and showed them pornographic images on his mobile phone.

The charged man has appeared at Poole Magistrates' Court and is next due to appear at Bournemouth Crown Court on Thursday 13 February 2020.

Detective Sergeant Leo Glendon, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We are continuing to carry out an investigation into these incidents and are urging anyone with information about them, or who has been approached in similar circumstances, to please contact us.

"We are unable to release an image or description of the alleged offender at this stage as the matter is subject to court proceedings, which could include identification evidence that may be compromised if these details were to be publicised."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200009795. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
