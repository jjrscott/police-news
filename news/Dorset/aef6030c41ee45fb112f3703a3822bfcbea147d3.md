# Witness appeal after vehicle failed to stop for officers in Lytchett Matravers

28 March 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a vehicle failed to stop for officers in Lytchett Matravers.

At around 5.45pm yesterday, Tuesday 27 March 2018, officers requested that a black and silver Nissan 4x4 stop on High Street. The vehicle failed to stop and continued along Colehill Road and right onto Dullar Lane toward the A31.

No arrests have been made and enquiries continue.

Police Constable Roan Doyle, of Purbeck police, said: "I am keen to speak to any motorists who witnessed the manner of driving of the Nissan, in particular the driver of a Bedford van who was travelling near to the recreation ground and a silver people carrier that moved onto the verge on Dullar Lane.

"I would also ask anyone who was in the area at the relevant time and has dashcam fitted in their vehicles to please come forward.

"Officers from the Purbeck Neighbourhood Policing Team, in collaboration with the Rural Crime Team and No Excuse officers, will deal proactively with people who choose to make off from police and those who cause a danger to other road users."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk, or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180043124. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
