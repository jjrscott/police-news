# Witness appeal following fail-to-stop collision in Poole

21 November 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses after a teenage cyclist was involved in a collision with a car and the driver failed to stop at the scene.

The collision occurred at around 8am today, Wednesday 21 November 2018, on Rossmore Road at the junction with Trinidad Crescent, opposite the boxing club.

A small black Citroen car was in collision with a 14-year-old local boy who was crossing the junction on his bicycle. It is reported the driver of the Citroen failed to stop at the scene.

The boy was taken to hospital for treatment to minor injuries.

Police Sergeant Fern Graham, of the traffic unit, said: "Evidence from witnesses at the scene suggests that the motorist drove around the boy on the ground before turning into Rossmore Road and left the area, making no attempt to check on his welfare.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the relevant time and either witnessed the collision or has information about who was involved to please contact me.

"I would also urge the driver involved to please come forward so we can establish from you exactly what happened today."
