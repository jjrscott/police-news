A number of arrests have been made this morning, Thursday 11 April 2019, in relation to a reported armed robbery in Bournemouth following a joint operation involving Dorset Police and the Met.

At around 12pm on Thursday 14 March 2019 Dorset Police received a report of a robbery at Franses Jewellers in Westover Road involving a number of men on two mopeds and a motorcycle. It was reported that one of the men was seen in possession of a Samurai sword.

Nobody was injured during the incident. A quantity of jewellery items were reportedly stolen.

A detailed investigation was launched involving detectives from Dorset Police with support from the Met's Operation Venice team, which tackles moped enabled crime.

Following warrants executed at addresses in London and Dorset this morning, five suspects were arrested at addresses in south London for robbery of commercial premises using weapons and two were arrested in Dorset for conspiracy to commit armed robbery.
