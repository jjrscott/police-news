# Warning over potentially fatal drugs in Dorset

07 April 2017

* * *

Detectives are advising the public of the potentially fatal consequences of using illicit and non-prescribed drugs in Dorset.

A number of drug-related deaths have been reported in the county in recent weeks.

Since Tuesday 14 March 2017 there have been three reported drug-related deaths in Weymouth, three in Bournemouth and one in the Poole area.

Inquests will be held at a later date.

While detectives are unable to definitively link the deaths, they are satisfied at this time that they are drug-related.

As with all illicit drugs and non-prescribed medicines, the effects of taking these substances, which cannot be identified by the user, can prove fatal.

Investigations are underway to establish exactly what the drugs involved are.

As a result of police investigations, officers executed a warrant today, Friday 7 April 2017, under the Misuse of Drugs Act in Bournemouth.

A 45-year-old man from Bournemouth has been arrested on suspicion of possessing class A drugs and a 17-year-old man from Surrey has been arrested on suspicion of possessing a class B drug.

Both are assisting police with their enquiries.

Detective Inspector Andy Roberts, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I would like to get a message out to anyone involved in the misuse of drugs in Bournemouth and the wider Dorset area to be aware that use of such substances can prove fatal to the user.

"I would also appeal to anyone with information about the illicit drug supply or availability of non-prescribed medicines, to make police aware immediately."
