# Witness appeal after fatal collision in Bournemouth

03 October 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses after a fatal collision in Bournemouth.

The incident happened at around 10.39pm on Tuesday 3 October 2017 on the A338 Spur Road southbound around one mile from the Ashley Heath roundabout.

It was reported that a white Mercedes panel van was suspected to be in collision with a cyclist.

Sadly, the cyclist - a 30-year-old man from Poole - was pronounced dead at the scene. His next of kin have been informed and the coroner notified.

A road closure was put in place between the Ashley Heath roundabout and the Blackwater junction to allow emergency services to deal with the incident.

A search of the area was carried out and a white van suspected to be involved was located in Southampton. Enquiries are ongoing to locate the driver.

Chief Inspector Heather Dixey, of Dorset Police, said: "We have specially-trained officers supporting the cyclist's family at this difficult time.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the incident or either the vehicle or cyclist immediately before the incident and who has not yet spoken to officers, to please contact Dorset Please."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 3:518. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
