21 August 2020

* * *

Officers in Dorchester are appealing for anyone with information to come forward following a spate of criminal damage.

Three incidents occurred on the night of Wednesday 19 August into the morning of Thursday 20 August 2020.

Three vehicles were damaged on the forecourt of Westerly BMW in Prince of Wales Road. Damage was caused to a windscreen, a bonnet and a door.

A vehicle parked under the railway bridge at the bottom of Barnes Way also had its windscreen smashed.

A further incident of criminal damage occurred at the Bakers Arms pub on Monmouth Road, with a window damaged.

Sergeant Andy Napper, of Dorchester police, said: "Due to the proximity of these incidents and the fact they all occurred on the same night, we are treating them as linked.

"We appreciate the inconvenience they will have caused to the businesses and vehicle owner involved and we are determined to do all we can to identify who is responsible.

"I would urge anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity on the night of Wednesday 19 August, or who has any information that can assist our investigation, to please contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200124556. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
