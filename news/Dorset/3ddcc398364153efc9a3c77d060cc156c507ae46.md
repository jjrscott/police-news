# Appeal to find Good Samaritan following robbery in Bournemouth

06 January 2020

* * *

Detectives investigating a robbery in Bournemouth are appealing for a Good Samaritan to come forward.

At around 6.20pm on Monday 23 December 2019 a woman, who was with her nine-year-old daughter, withdrew money from a cashpoint on Christchurch Road. A woman was standing nearby and grabbed the victim around the neck and stole some of the cash from the machine before running away in the direction of Heathcote Road.

A male member of the public tried to grab the female as she was running off, but the offender became violent and managed to escape.

The offender is described as white and around five feet two inches tall with long dark brown hair that was slightly curly. She is described as wearing a thick grey Puffa-style jacket with a fur hood.

Detective Constable Steve Allen, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am keen to try and locate the Good Samaritan who was involved as they may have vital information to assist my investigation.

"I would also urge anyone who may know who was responsible for the robbery to please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190201131. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
