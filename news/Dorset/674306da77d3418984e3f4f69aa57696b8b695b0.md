# Appeal for good Samaritan to come forward after Bournemouth street robbery

19 January 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating a street robbery in Bournemouth are appealing for a good Samaritan who came to the victim's aid to come forward.

The incident happened at around 9pm on Wednesday 17 January 2018 on Christchurch Road near the junction with Wharncliffe Road.

The victim - a local man aged in his 40s - was approached from behind by two men who started pushing him. They then stole his wallet. A woman then came up to the victim, searched his pockets and took his mobile phone.

A witness in a nearby shop heard the commotion and assisted in getting the mobile from the woman before she ran off.

A second witness gave chase to the two men and later returned with the victim's wallet, however a quantity of cash and bank cards had been taken.

The two male offenders were described as white and wearing dark clothes with hoods up. The female offender is white, approximately five feet six inches tall and of slim to medium build. She was wearing a green Puffa-style jacket.

Detective Inspector Wayne Seymour, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We have spoken with the first witness who came to the victim's aid, but we would now also like to speak to the second witness - described as a young black man of approximately 19 years of age \- who returned the victim's wallet as he may have vital information that could assist with the investigation.

"We continue to make CCTV and house-to-house enquiries and I am appealing to anyone else who may have seen what happened or who has any other information that could assist with the investigation to please come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk, or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180009175. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
