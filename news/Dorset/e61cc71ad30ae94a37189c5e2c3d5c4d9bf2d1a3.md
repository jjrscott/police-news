# Appeal for information following reports of assaults in Bournemouth

01 September 2020

* * *

Detectives investigating reports of two assaults involving the same victim in Bournemouth are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The victim, a man aged in his 20s, reported that he was walking near to the junction of Mortimer Road and Charminster Road between 9.50pm and 10.05pm on Tuesday 25 August 2020 when he was approached from behind by an unknown man and assaulted. He did not sustain any serious injuries.

The victim also reported that he had been involved in an altercation at the same location the previous night - Monday 24 August 2020 at around 10.30pm - and was assaulted. Again, he did not sustain any serious injuries.

Detective Constable Tony O'Connell, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We are making enquiries into these incidents and I would urge anyone who witnessed any altercations taking place in the area on the relevant nights to please contact us.

"I would also ask anyone who was driving in the area of Mortimer Road or Charminster Road around the times in question and has dashcam fitted to their vehicle to please check their footage for anything relevant."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200127824. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
