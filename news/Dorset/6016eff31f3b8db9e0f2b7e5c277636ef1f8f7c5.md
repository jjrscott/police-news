# Still time to surrender firearms to Dorset Police

22 November 2017

* * *

Dorset Police is urging anyone in possession of illegal or unregistered firearms and ammunition to continue to make use of its firearms surrender, which runs until midnight on Sunday 26 November.

More than 100 firearms ranging from BB guns, pistols and revolvers have been handed in to designated police stations across Dorset since the surrender began last Monday.

Led by the National Ballistics Intelligence Service (NABIS), the surrender offers safe disposal of unlawful firearms or ammunition, with no risk of arrest at point of handing in.

Results from the first week of the surrender are as follows:

47 air weapons
21 shotguns
8 revolvers
2 rifles
9 pistols
15 imitation firearms
4 deactivated firearms
Almost 50 ammunition surrenders

For clarification, a deactivated firearm is no longer a viable firearm as part of its mechanism has been removed. An imitation firearm looks like a firearm but has never had a firing mechanism.

Members of the public may surrender firearms and ammunition to Bournemouth, Poole and Weymouth police stations during opening hours. No firearms or ammunition should be left outside of any police station.

Opening times for police stations participating in the surrender are as follows:

Madeira Road, Bournemouth, BH1 1QL
Open Monday to Friday 9am to 6pm, Saturday and Sunday 9am to 5.30pm

Wimborne Road, Poole, BH15 2BP
Open Monday to Friday 8am to 5.30pm. Closed Saturday and Sunday

Radipole Lane, Weymouth, DT4 9WW
Open Monday to Friday 8am to 5.30pm, Saturday 9am to 1pm and 2pm to 4.30pm. Closed Sunday.
