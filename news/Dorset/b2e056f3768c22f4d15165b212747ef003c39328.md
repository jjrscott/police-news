# Appeal following fail-to-stop collision in Poole

04 March 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a fail-to-stop collision in Poole are appealing for the driver of the vehicle and anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

Around 1pm on Tuesday 18 February 2020 a black Kia Picanto was stationary at the traffic lights on Gravel Hill at the junction with Queen Anne Drive when a dark-coloured car collided with the back of the Picanto and drove off toward Poole town centre.

The driver of the Kia - a man aged in his 70s - sustained minor injuries to his neck and back.

Police Constable Matthew Batter, of Poole police, said: "An investigation continues to establish who was driving the car that failed to stop at the scene.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have been travelling along Gravel Hill at the time of the collision and has any relevant dashcam footage to please get in touch.

"I would also urge the driver of the vehicle involved to do the right thing and come forward."
