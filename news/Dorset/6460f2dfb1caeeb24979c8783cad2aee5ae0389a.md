# Witness appeal following burglary in north Dorset

22 November 2016

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a burglary in north Dorset.

Sometime between 7pm and 10.30pm on Saturday 19 November 2016 offenders broke into a property in the Gold Hill area of Child Okeford, north of Blandford.

A quantity of cash was stolen.

Police Constable Stuart Beasley, of Blandford police, said: "We understand the offenders tried to gain access to the property via a number of points before they were eventually successful.

"It is possible that a passing motorist may have seen something that may assist my investigation but may not have realised its significance. I would urge anyone who was driving along Gold Hill on Saturday evening and who saw something suspicious or out of the ordinary to please contact Dorset Police.

"Finally, I would like to remind residents to ensure they keep their windows and doors locked and secure when they go out and remain vigilant. If you see anything suspicious in your community, call Dorset Police immediately."
