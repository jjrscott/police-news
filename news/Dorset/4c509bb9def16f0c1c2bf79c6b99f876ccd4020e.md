# Family tribute following murder of Guy Hedger in East Dorset

02 May 2017

* * *

The family of murder victim Guy Hedger has paid tribute to a "caring and compassionate man" who "lived life to its full".

Guy was killed in the early hours of the morning on Sunday 30 April 2017 after at least two intruders entered his home in Castlewood in Ringwood.

Police received a call at 3.03am reporting that Guy had been shot with a shotgun. Despite the best efforts of medical staff he was sadly pronounced dead shortly after arriving at hospital.

It is believed jewellery, including designer watches, was stolen from the address.

A second occupant in the house at the time - who was the victim's partner - has been deeply affected by the incident and is being supported by specially-trained officers.

A murder investigation is now underway led by Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team.

Detectives are working tirelessly to arrest those responsible for Guy's murder and establish why his address was targeted.

It is believed there may have been an element of pre-planning involved and officers would urgently like to hear from anyone who may have seen people or vehicles acting suspiciously in the area directly before or during the days or hours leading up to the incident.

Currently it is not thought that the offenders were known to the victim however, detectives continue to investigate all lines of enquiry.

Guy's family have today issued the following statement: "Guy was a caring and compassionate partner, son, brother and uncle who lived life to its full and enriched the lives of all those who knew him.

"We are devastated that Guy's life has been cut short in this way. Guy will be sorely missed by family, friends and colleagues, but he will live in our hearts forever.

"We ask for time to grieve in private."

Detective Chief Inspector Sarah Derbyshire, of the MCIT, said: "This was a truly horrific crime and our deepest sympathies go out to Guy's family and friends. Our thoughts remain with you all.

"I want to reassure the public that we have the best detectives, officers and staff working day and night on this case.

"The violent offenders responsible for this crime are still at large and we are doing everything in our power to bring these individuals to justice.

"I would ask the public to please get in touch with us if you have any information you think may be relevant to this investigation no matter how small you believe it to be. That information could be the key to solving this murder."

Guy's family are being supported by specially-trained officers and they have requested privacy at this deeply traumatic time.
