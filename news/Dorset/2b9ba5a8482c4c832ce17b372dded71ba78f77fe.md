17 June 2016

* * *

Officers have issued a warning to the public after a quantity of drugs was stolen during a burglary at a veterinary clinic in Ferndown.

Between 6.30pm on Thursday 9 June and 8am on Friday 10 June 2016 offenders gained access to St Mary's Veterinary Clinic in Ringwood Road.

Six packets of around 600 Tramadol capsules - a drug mainly used for dogs as pain relief for arthritis - were stolen. A quantity of Diazepam and other drugs was also taken together with a small quantity of cash.

Police Constable Dave Hassell, of East Dorset police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area of the vets at the relevant time to please contact Dorset Police.

"A quantity of drugs was stolen during the burglary and I would urge anyone who finds these items or is offered them, not to take them but call Dorset Police immediately."

Witnesses and anyone with information should call Dorset Police in confidence on 101, quoting incident number 10:77. Alternatively, call the free and anonymous Crimestoppers line on 0800 555 111, where mobile phone tariffs may apply.
