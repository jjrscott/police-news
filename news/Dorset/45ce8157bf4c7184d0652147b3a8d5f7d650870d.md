Detectives investigating a report of an aggravated burglary in Bournemouth have arrested five people.

Dorset Police was called at 10.07pm on Thursday 19 March 2020 to a report of a group of men wearing balaclavas entering an address on St Peter's Road.

It was reported that a man had a knife held to his throat and a set of keys and mobile phone were allegedly stolen.
