# Update in relation to reported altercation and dangerous driving incident in Bournemouth

22 January 2021

* * *

Three men arrested as part of an investigation into an alleged altercation and dangerous driving incident in Bournemouth have been released from police bail without charge.

It was reported that at around 9.10am on Thursday 24 December 2020 an altercation involving three men occurred in the car park of the Co-op store in Christchurch Road, near to the St Swithun's roundabout.

The three men then allegedly left the scene in two vehicles - a black Jeep and a silver BMW X6.

Reports were subsequently received of a collision involving the two vehicles in the area of Hengist Road and Knole Road. Two parked vehicles were also allegedly damaged in the incident.

It was reported that a man who had been a passenger in the BMW exited the vehicle and was then involved in a collision with the Jeep.

The man was taken to hospital for treatment but was subsequently discharged.

Following enquiries, two men - both aged 21 and from Bournemouth - were arrested on suspicion of affray and possessing an offensive weapon and were released on police bail.

A 28-year-old man from Christchurch was also subsequently arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent and affray and was also released on police bail.

All three men have now been released from bail without charge at this time.

Detectives are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.
