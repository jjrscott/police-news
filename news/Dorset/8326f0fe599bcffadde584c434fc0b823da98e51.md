# Update â€“ appeal following reported assault in East Dorset

13 May 2020

* * *

A man has come forward following a CCTV appeal after a reported assault and criminal damage incident in East Dorset.

At 7.25pm on Wednesday 6 May 2020 it was reported that a man entered the One Stop store on Horton Road and selected three bottles of cider, but staff explained that they could not sell him the alcohol as per store policy.

The man allegedly became aggressive and accused a member of staff of stealing his bank card, before placing his hands behind the till screens and attempting to enter the area behind the tills.

The man then reportedly picked up the three bottles of cider and left the store without paying for them. He allegedly placed them on the ground in the car park outside and returned to the store, at which point the victim - a male staff member - went to close the door. However, the man reportedly ran toward it, causing the glass to break and the door to hit the victim in the face.

The man allegedly grabbed the victim by the hair before losing his grip.

Following a CCTV appeal, a man aged in his 30s has come forward and is assisting officers with their enquiries. No arrests have been made.
