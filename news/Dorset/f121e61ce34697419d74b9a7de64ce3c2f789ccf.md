Officers investigating a reported disturbance in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police received a report at 4.47am on Friday 28 August 2020 of a disturbance in the area of Warren Road.

Officers attended and it was reported that a number of men had been involved in an altercation and one was believed to have sustained injuries, but they had all left the scene.

Searches of the area were carried out and a 26-year-old local man was arrested on suspicion of assault and affray. He is assisting officers with their enquiries.

Detective Constable Nicky Sharpe, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We are carrying out an investigation into this incident and we are particularly keen to locate anyone who may have sustained injuries to make sure they are safe and well.

"I would also urge anyone who witnessed an altercation or any suspicious activity in the area of Warren Road in the early hours of Friday 28 August to please contact us if you have not already spoken to police."
