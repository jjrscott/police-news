# Renewed appeal following alleged fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth

04 October 2016

* * *

Officer investigating an alleged fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth in which a woman was seriously injured are renewing their appeal for witnesses.

The serious road traffic collision occurred on Pine Road at around 5.15pm on Tuesday 27 September 2016. A blue Ford Focus collided with a parked unattended Volkswagen Polo and a parked Mini Cooper. It was reported that the driver of the Focus failed to stop at the scene.

A 35-year-old woman from Blandford, who was collecting items from the back of her car at the time of the collision, sustained life-changing injuries and was taken to Southampton General Hospital by the air ambulance.

Police Sergeant Mark Scammell, of Dorset Police's Road Traffic Unit, said: "This collision had very tragic consequences as a young woman was very seriously injured. She had to have part of her leg amputated and will remain in hospital for some time.

"I am renewing my appeal for witnesses to the collision as I believe that quite a few people, who have not yet spoken to us, were in the area at the time. I would urge those to come forward and contact us as soon as possible.

"In addition, I would like to hear from anyone who saw the Ford Focus being driven immediately before the incident to get in touch to assist our investigation."

A 22-year-old local man was arrested on suspicion of driving offences and released on police bail pending further enquiries until the middle of November 2016.
