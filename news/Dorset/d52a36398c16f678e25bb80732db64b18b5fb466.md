Detectives are appealing for witnesses to an alleged street robbery in Dorchester - with one man arrested and one woman being charged with an offence.

The incident happened at around 10pm on Friday 3 June 2016 outside the Natwest Bank on South Street.

It is alleged that a 23-year-old local man was punched in the face and had his mobile phone stolen by a man and a woman.

The victim suffered facial injuries, but did not require hospital treatment.

Detective Inspector Andrea Power, of Weymouth CID, said: "Following a number of enquiries it has been established there may have been members of the public in the area at the time of the incident.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have seen the incident or anyone acting suspiciously in the area to contact me."

An 18-year-old woman from Dorchester has been charged with robbery and is next due to appear at Dorchester Crown Court on Friday 8 July 2016.

A 21-year-old man from Dorchester was arrested on suspicion of robbery and is currently on police bail until the beginning of July 2016 pending further enquiries.

Witnesses and anyone with information should call Dorset Police on 101 quoting incident number 3:458. Alternatively, call the free and anonymous Crimestoppers line on 0800 555 111 where mobile phone tariffs may apply.
