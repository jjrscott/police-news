# Update in relation to report of girl bitten by dog in Weymouth

23 November 2020

* * *

A woman has come forward following an appeal in relation to an incident where a teenage girl was reportedly bitten by a dog in Weymouth.

It was reported that at approximately 2.30pm on Saturday 7 November 2020 a 14-year-old girl was pushing her scooter along High Street, Wyke Regis, when she walked past a woman with two dogs. One of the dogs reportedly bit the girl's leg, making a hole in her leggings and puncturing the skin.

Following an image appeal, a woman has come forward and is assisting officers with their investigation. No arrests have been made.

We would like to thank everyone who shared the appeal.
