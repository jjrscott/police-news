# Witness appeal following fatal road traffic collision in Lyme Regis

02 June 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a fatal road traffic collision in Lyme Regis.

Dorset Police received a report at 10.19am today, Saturday 2 June 2018, of a collision involving a black Honda motorcycle and a silver Honda CR-V at Dragons Hill, near to the entrance to the Timber Vale Caravan Park.

Officers attended, along with the ambulance service. Sadly the motorcyclist, a 44-year-old man from Exeter, was pronounced dead at the scene. His next of kin have been informed and the coroner has been notified.

The driver of the car was uninjured.

Road closures were put in place to allow emergency services to deal with the incident and for a detailed examination of the scene to take place.

Police Sergeant Lee Savage, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the family of the motorcyclist who sadly died and they are being supported by specially-trained officers.

"As we continue to investigate the collision, I am appealing for any witnesses who have not already spoken to police to contact us.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who was driving in the area at the time and has dashcam fitted to their vehicle that may have captured the incident.

"Finally, I would like to thank motorists and members of the public for their patience while the road closures were in place. These road closures were absolutely necessary to allow the emergency services to carry out their work and to allow for a thorough examination of the scene."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 2:147. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
