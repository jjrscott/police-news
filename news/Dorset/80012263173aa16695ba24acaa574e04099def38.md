# Appeal following serious injury collision in Weymouth

11 May 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses following a serious injury collision in Weymouth.

Dorset Police was called at 1.48am today, Saturday 11 May 2019, by the ambulance service to reports of a serious road traffic collision on the A353 between Preston and Osmington, close to the White Horse Garage.

A white Vauxhall Corsa had left the road and gone into a hedge.

The driver of the Corsa, a 19-year-old man from Runcorn in Cheshire, sustained serious injuries and was taken to hospital for treatment. His condition is described as potentially life-changing. No one else was in the vehicle.

The A353 was closed while emergency services dealt with the incident and the local authority attended to clear debris from the road.

Inspector Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "I would ask anyone who was travelling along the road at the time of the collision and either witnessed the incident or saw the manner of driving of the Corsa to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who may have captured all or part of the incident on their dashcam.

"I would like to thank residents and motorists for their patience during the road closures while we dealt with this incident and ensured the road was cleared of debris."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 11:52. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
