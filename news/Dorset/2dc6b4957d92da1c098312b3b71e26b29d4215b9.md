# Witness appeal following robbery in Wareham

06 June 2019

* * *

Detectives investigating a robbery in Wareham are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The victim, a local man aged in his 20s, was sitting on a bench with two friends in North Street - near to the Saxon roundabout - at around 9.10pm yesterday, Wednesday 5 June 2019.

They were approached by a group of around seven men, aged in their late teens or early 20s. Without saying a word, one of the men kicked the victim to the side of his head.

The victim was subjected to further punches and kicks from the group and during the assault they went through his pockets and stole his wallet, which contained Â£10, his bank card and a Navy medal that belonged to his father.

The men then left in the direction of the train station.

The victim did not sustain any injuries that required hospital treatment.

Officers attended and carried out a search of the area but the men were not located.

The main offender is described as black, aged around 18 years old and of tall, slim build with short black hair. He was wearing a light blue Puffa-style jacket, grey tracksuit bottoms and black trainers.

The other members of the group were all wearing grey tracksuits with dark hooded tops that they used to cover their faces.

Detective Constable George Graham, of Western CID, said: "This must have been a frightening ordeal for the victim and we are carrying out a full investigation to identify the offenders.

"I am appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information that could assist our investigation to please contact police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk, or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190085143. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
