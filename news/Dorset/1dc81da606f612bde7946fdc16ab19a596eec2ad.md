17 November 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating a collision involving a car and a pedestrian in Poole are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward.

The collision involving a silver Mercedes A-Class and a pedestrian occurred at around 12.30am today, Friday 17 November 2017 on Lindsay Road, near the entrance to The Oasis. The Mercedes initially left the scene but returned around ten minutes later.

The pedestrian, a Poole man aged in his 30s, was taken to hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries.

It is believed the driver and the pedestrian were known to each other.

A 50-year-old local man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and is assisting police with their enquiries.

Detective Sergeant Andy Haworth, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We are continuing to investigate this incident to try and establish exactly what happened.

"I would urge anyone who witnessed the collision or who has any further information that can assist our investigation to contact police immediately. I would also like to hear from anyone who might have CCTV footage covering the area."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170179067. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
