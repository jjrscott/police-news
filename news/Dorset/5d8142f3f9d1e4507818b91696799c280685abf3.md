# Update in relation to serious collision in Christchurch

10 August 2019

* * *

A woman involved in a serious road traffic collision in Christchurch has sadly died from her injuries.

Dorset Police was called at 10.29am on Friday 9 August 2019 to a report of a collision on Barrack Road, outside the Premier Inn hotel.

The collision involved a white Volvo lorry and a grey Mazda 6, which subsequently collided with a wall of the hotel as well as a number of parked vehicles in the car park.

Officers attended, along with the ambulance and fire services, and the driver of the Mazda - a woman aged in her 80s and from Christchurch - was freed from the vehicle before being airlifted to Southampton General Hospital.

Very sadly she was pronounced dead at the hospital last night, Friday 9 August 2019. The woman's family has been informed and are being supported by specially-trained officers.

Police Sergeant Fern Graham, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the family at this difficult time.

"We are continuing to investigate this collision to establish the full circumstances and I would urge any witnesses who have not already spoken to police or anyone with dashcam footage to contact us."
