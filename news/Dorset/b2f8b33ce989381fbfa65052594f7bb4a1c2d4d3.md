Police are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward after a serious injury road traffic collision in Weymouth.

The incident happened at around 8.30pm on Sunday 4 September 2016 when a black BMW 320 was in collision with a black Volkswagen Golf along Preston Beach Road.

A 17-year-old girl, believed to be the front seat passenger in the BMW, was cut out of the vehicle by the fire service and air lifted to Southampton Hospital for treatment with serious life threatening injuries.

The 19-year-old male driver and 17-year-old male rear seat passenger of the BMW suffered minor injuries and were taken to Dorset County Hospital for treatment.

The 59-year-old female driver of the Golf also suffered a serious, non-life threatening neck injury and was taken to Dorset County Hospital.

The road is currently closed in both directions while collision investigators examine the scene.

Police Sergeant Joe Pardey, of Dorset Police's Road Policing Team, said: "I am appealing to anyone who saw the collision or manner of driving of either vehicle prior to the incident to contact me."
