# Witness appeal after report of sexual assault in Bournemouth

31 May 2017

* * *

Detectives are appealing for information after reports that a woman was sexually assaulted in Bournemouth.

A 19-year-old local woman was walking in Coach House Place under the A338 flyover when she was reportedly grabbed by an unknown man, pulled to the ground and sexually and physically assaulted.

The incident happened at around 5.15pm on Friday 26 May 2017.

She screamed and shouted, prompting a passer-by to intervene before the woman got away and reported the incident to police.

The woman did not require treatment for any injuries but was left shaken by the incident.

Detective Constable Chris Panther, of Dorset Police, said: "This is an area that would have been busy with people and buses at this time of day.

"I am keen to hear from the man who intervened and helped the woman and from anyone else who may have seen the incident or a man matching the description given around the time of the offence.

"This was understandably a very distressing incident for the woman and she is being supported by specially-trained officers.

"Local officers from the Neighbourhood Policing Team will be carrying out increased patrols in the area and I would urge anyone with information to come forward."

A 31-year-old man, of no fixed abode, has been arrested on suspicion of sexual assault in connection with the incident and is assisting officers with their enquiries.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170078127. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
