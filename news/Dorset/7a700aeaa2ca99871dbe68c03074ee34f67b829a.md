# Witness appeal following sexual assault in Sherborne

18 November 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a sexual assault in Sherborne are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The victim, a 15-year-old girl, was walking along the footpath that runs behind Richmond Green toward Acreman Street at around 3pm on Sunday 10 November 2019 when a man walked through some metal barriers at the bottom of the alleyway and grabbed hold of her thigh over her clothing.

The victim, who was on the phone at the time, kicked backwards and the man let go. She then ran off toward Acreman Street.

The offender is described as white, aged over 50 and with grey, shoulder-length hair. He was wearing jeans.

Police Constable Chris Meade, of Dorchester police, said: "The victim was understandably left shaken by this incident and we are carrying out a detailed investigation to identify the man responsible.

"I would appeal to any witnesses or anyone who was in the vicinity around the time of the offence and saw or heard anything suspicious to please contact us.

"I appreciate this offence may cause some concern for the local community but would like to reassure members of the public that local officers will be increasing patrols in the area and can be approached by anyone with concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190177783. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
