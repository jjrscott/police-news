# Witness appeal to find owners of two bicycles recovered

24 August 2016

* * *

Police are appealing for witnesses to find the owners of two bicycles recovered in connection with an incident in Poole - with pictures of the bikes being released.

On Sunday 19 June 2016 at around 6pm a 16-year-old Poole boy arranged to meet two other boys at Whitecliff Park in Poole following a conversation on a selling site, Depop.

The two boys arrived on bicycles in order to exchange clothes for money.

As the two boys left the scene, the victim realised that he had been given an envelope containing foreign currency which is no longer in circulation.

The victim chased the boys before they ran away leaving their bikes at the scene.

The first boy is described as having tanned skin, around 16 years old, approximately five feet six inches tall with short, dark brown hair. He was wearing a grey jumper with a small Palace logo on the front with black shorts.

The second boy is described as white, around 16 years old, approximately five feet seven inches tall and of average build with short, brown, greasy hair. He was wearing dark navy tracksuit bottoms, a dark tracksuit top and white trainers.

Police Constable John Upsher, of Bournemouth police, said: "I am keen to identify the owners of the bikes to establish exactly what happened in the incident.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who knows someone who has recently lost a bike matching those pictured."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55160098102. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
