# Witness appeal following reported serious assault in Bournemouth

27 August 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following a reported serious assault in Bournemouth.

At around 9.30pm on Saturday 25 August 2018 Dorset Police received reports that an altercation had occurred at an address in Portland Road, where a large group of around 40 to 50 teenagers had gathered.

It was reported that a 16-year-old boy had been assaulted by three other teenage boys. One had allegedly struck him with a bottle and another had reportedly waved a knife toward him.

The boy suffered cuts to his neck and other facial injuries and was taken to hospital for treatment. His injuries were not believed to be life-threatening.

Three teenage boys, two aged 14 and a 17-year-old, all from Bournemouth, have been arrested on suspicion of affray and inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent and have been released under investigation as detectives continue their enquiries.

Detective Constable Dave Pearce, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We are carrying out a detailed investigation into this incident in order to establish exactly what happened.

"I am appealing for anyone who was at the address who witnessed the reported assault or who has any information that can assist our investigation to contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180137865. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
