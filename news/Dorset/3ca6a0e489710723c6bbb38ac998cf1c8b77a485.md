# Appeal following collision between car and ambulance in Christchurch

20 February 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses following a collision between a car and an ambulance in Christchurch.

The incident happened at around 2.35pm today, Wednesday 20 February 2019, along Fairmile Road at the junction of Clarendon Road. The car involved was a Volkswagen Golf.

The driver of the Golf sustained a minor injury and was treated at the scene.

Two paramedics from the ambulance were taken to Poole hospital as a precaution. It is understood the ambulance was responding to an emergency call at the time of the collision, however no patients were on board.

Prior to the incident, an unmarked police car had illuminated its lights and requested for the Golf to stop.

A road closure was put in place to allow emergency services to deal with the incident.

A 31-year-old man from Dorchester was arrested on suspicion of failing to stop when requested by police, driving without insurance, dangerous driving, drug driving and driving a motor vehicle otherwise than in accordance with a licence. He is assisting officers with enquiries.

Police Inspector Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "An investigation into the circumstances of the collision is now underway.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or the manner of driving of either vehicle prior to the collision to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 20:239. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
