Three burglaries were reported to have happened between Sunday 15 December and Tuesday 17 December 2019 in the Shaftesbury area.

Just after 7am on Monday 16 December 2019 Dorset Police received a report of a burglary at an address in Gower Road. It was reported that during the previous night entry had been gained to the property and Christmas presents were taken from under the tree. Other items were also reported stolen from the address.
