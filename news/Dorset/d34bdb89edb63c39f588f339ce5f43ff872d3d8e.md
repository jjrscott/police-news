# Statement in relation to report of suspicious incident in East Dorset

08 August 2019

* * *

Detectives who have been investigating a report of a suspicious incident in East Dorset say they have spoken to all parties involved and no offences have been committed.

The investigation was launched following a report that a female had approached a three-and-a-half-year-old boy at Avon Heath Country Park off Birch Road in St Ives at around 2.20pm on Wednesday 7 August 2019 and walked away from the play area with him.

When challenged, she left the boy and he was safely reunited with his family. They informed staff at the park and then contacted Dorset Police.

Following detailed enquiries carried out by detectives at Bournemouth CID, officers have located the teenage girl involved and she has given an account to them.

Detective Inspector Gavin House, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We are satisfied that these were innocent actions of children playing in the park and there was no intention to cause distress to the family involved.

"I understand there has been concern over this incident on social media but I want to assure members of the public that we have carried out a thorough investigation and are satisfied no offences have been committed.

"We have been in regular contact with the family of the boy involved and have kept them updated with the full details of our enquiries.

"I would urge members of the public to avoid any further speculation on social media in relation to this incident."
