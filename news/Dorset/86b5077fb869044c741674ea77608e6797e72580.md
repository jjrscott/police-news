# Witness appeal after serious road traffic collision in Poole

03 December 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a serious road traffic collision in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The incident, which happened on Willis Way at the Fleets Industrial Estate, was reported at 4.50am on Thursday 3 December 2020 and involved two lorries.

A DAF HGV, driven by a man aged in his 50s and from Basingstoke, collided with a stationary DAF HGV, which was occupied by a man aged in his 30s and from Watford.

The driver from Basingstoke sustained life-changing injuries and was taken to Southampton General Hospital. The other man was uninjured.

A road closure was put in place at Holes Bay to enable police, ambulance and fire services to attend the scene to deal with the incident. The road reopened at 11.55am.

Police Sergeant Sarah Jones, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing for any witnesses to the collision, who have not spoken with police yet, to please come forward.

"In addition, I am keen to hear from anyone who may have relevant dashcam footage.

"We are fully aware that the location of the incident had a major impact on the morning traffic in the area and I would like to thank everyone affected for their patience. The road closure that we had to put in place was absolutely necessary to enable all emergency services to deal with the incident."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 3:059.
