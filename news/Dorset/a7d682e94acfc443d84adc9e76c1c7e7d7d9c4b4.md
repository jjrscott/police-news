# Witness appeal following alleged robberies in Bournemouth

29 June 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating reports of two robberies in Bournemouth are appealing for any witnesses to come forward.

Police received reports of two robberies that occurred in the Slades Farm area on the path between the pavilion building and a nearby wooded area between 3.30pm and 4pm on Tuesday 27 June 2017.

On the first occasion it is alleged two teenage boys on bicycles approached three 13-year-old boys, threatened them with a knife and then went through their bags and stole Â£5 in cash.

Shortly afterwards a 13-year-old boy was in the same area with his girlfriend, aged 14, on their bicycles when they were approached by two teenage boys. It was reported that the 13-year-old boy was threatened and an iPhone 6 was stolen.

Nobody was physically injured in either incident.

A 14-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of robbery and has been released under investigation.

Detective Sergeant Simon Walters, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing for any witnesses to either of these incidents, or anyone who has any information, to contact me immediately.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who was using the park around the time of the offences and who saw any suspicious activity."

Officers from the local Neighbourhood Policing Team have been offering community reassurance in the area and are aiming to provide an increased visible presence.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170097099. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
