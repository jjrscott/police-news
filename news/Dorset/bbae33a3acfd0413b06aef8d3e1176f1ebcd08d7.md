# Update - CCTV appeal following reported attempted shoplifting in Poole

06 October 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating reports of an attempted theft from a store in Poole have identified the person following a CCTV appeal.

At around 4.15pm on Thursday 21 September 2017 it was reported a man entered the Tesco store at Fleetsbridge and was seen by security staff to remove the security tags off a number of items. He was asked to go with staff to the tills to pay for the items but it was established he had no money and he was asked to leave the store.

We have identified the person in the CCTV image and an investigation remains ongoing. No arrests have been made.
