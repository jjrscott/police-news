* * *

Detectives investigating two serious assaults in Boscombe Gardens say high-visibility reassurance patrols will be carried out as enquiries continue.

Officers were called at 4.07pm yesterday, Sunday 12 June 2016, to reports of a stabbing in the gardens.

Two men sustained serious injuries. A 34-year-old sustained injuries to his neck and face and a 44-year-old was also injured at the neck. Their condition is not described as life-threatening.

Officers, assisted by armed response colleagues and the NPAS helicopter, attended the scene and carried out a search of the area.

No arrests have been made.

The offender is described as a white man and aged in his thirties. He has brown hair and was wearing a polo shirt, dark blue track suite type three quarter length trousers and a cream hooded top.

Detective Sergeant Greg Tansill, of Bournemouth CID, said: "As part of our early investigations the indications are that the victims and offender are known to each other.

"Officers from the local Neighbourhood Policing Team will be carrying out high-visibility patrols in the gardens to reassure the public.

"I would like to thank those witnesses who have already come forward and would urge anyone who saw the incident and has not yet spoken to police, or has seen a man matching the description, to please contact us."

Witnesses and anyone with information should call Dorset Police in confidence on 101 quoting incident number 12:308. Alternatively, call the free and anonymous Crimestoppers line on 0800 555 111 where mobile phone tariffs may apply.
