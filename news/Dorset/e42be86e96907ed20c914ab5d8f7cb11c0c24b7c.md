# Burglary in Weymouth â€“ witness appeal

11 October 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a burglary at an address in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward - with an image of some of the stolen items being released.

Between 10am and 4pm on Saturday 5 October 2019 a burglary occurred at an address on Abbotsbury Road.

The back door of the property was forced open and a search of the address was carried out.

Three rings, three necklaces, and a pair of earrings were stolen, as well as a quantity of cash.

Police Constable Dan Campbell-Bell, of Weymouth police, said: "The stolen items of jewellery had great sentimental value to the victims and an investigation is underway to identify those responsible.

"I would like to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time and saw or heard any suspicious activity or has any information to assist my enquiries.

"I am issuing an image of some of the stolen rings and would urge anyone who comes across similar items of jewellery for sale in unusual circumstances to get in touch."
