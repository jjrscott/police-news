# Witness appeal after boy threatened in Bournemouth

28 July 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating an incident where a 12-year-old boy was reportedly threatened by two teenagers in Bournemouth are appealing for a potential witness to come forward.

Dorset Police received an initial report at 3.41pm on Thursday 20 July 2017 that a boy had been threatened on Harewood Avenue. It was reported that one of the teenagers who made the threats was in possession of a knife.

Officers attended and a search of the area was carried out, with assistance from the NPAS helicopter.

Two 14-year-old boys, both from Bournemouth, were arrested on suspicion of assault and possessing a bladed article and have since been released under investigation.

Detective Constable Sarah Close, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We have been making a number of enquiries since the incident and we have established that the victim may have flagged down a passing motorist prior to the arrival of police. We are now trying to trace this person as they may hold key information that could assist with the investigation.

"I would ask this person or anyone with any information about the incident to please get in touch with Dorset Police urgently."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 20:296. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
