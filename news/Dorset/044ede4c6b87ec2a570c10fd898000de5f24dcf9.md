Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a fatal road traffic collision near Beaminster.

At around 2.30pm today, Monday 28 August 2017, Dorset Police was informed by the ambulance service of the collision near the Mosterton crossroads on the A3066.

It involved an orange Ford Focus, an orange KTM motorcycle and a pedal cyclist.

The motorcyclist, a man aged in his 40s from Crewkerne, suffered serious injuries and was sadly pronounced dead at the scene. His next of kin have been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers. The coroner has also been notified.

The rider of the bicycle, a Yeovil man aged in his 60s, was taken to hospital. His injuries are not believed to be serious.

The road was closed while emergency services attended the incident and remained shut for collision scene investigation work to be carried out.

Police Sergeant Fern Graham, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing for any witnesses to this collision, or to the manner of driving of any of the vehicles involved immediately prior to the incident, to please contact me.

"I would also like to thank motorists for their patience during the road closures, which were necessary to enable the emergency services to do their work and to allow for a proper investigation of the collision scene."
