# Appeal for information following reported public order incident in Wimborne

10 April 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a reported public order incident in Wimborne are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The incident occurred at around 4pm on Monday 1 April 2019. It was reported that three male teenagers had attended the McColl's store in the High Street and made threats of violence toward a member of staff.

Two of the teenagers are then alleged to have climbed on a police community support officer's vehicle in The Square and been abusive toward members of the public.

The teenagers made off from the scene and following searches by officers a 16-year-old local boy was arrested on suspicion of a public order offence and criminal damage and has been released under investigation.

Following further enquiries, a 15-year-old boy from the Blandford area attended for a police interview and has also been released under investigation.

Local Neighbourhood Inspector Simon Perry said: "Our investigation remains ongoing and following enquiries it has been established that there were a number of people in The Square at the time of this incident, some of whom may have filmed it on their mobile phones.

"I would urge any witnesses who have not already spoken to police or anyone with footage to contact us."
