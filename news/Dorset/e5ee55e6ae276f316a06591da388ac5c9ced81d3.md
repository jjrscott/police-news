# Witness appeal following fatal collision in North Dorset

01 April 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a fatal collision in North Dorset.

At 8.57am today, Monday 1 April 2019, officers were called to reports of a two vehicle collision on Ram's Hill near Sturminster Newton involving a silver Peugeot Boxer panel van and a grey Nissan.

Very sadly and despite the best efforts of officers and paramedics, the driver of the Nissan, a 23-year-old local man, died at the scene. His family has been informed and the coroner notified.

The driver of the panel van sustained very minor injuries.

The road was closed while emergency services dealt with the incident.

Police Sergeant Mark Scammell, of the traffic unit said: "I am appealing to anyone who was travelling along this road or the B3091 at around 9am today and either witnessed the collision or saw the manner of driving of either vehicle immediately prior to the incident to please contact Dorset Police. I am also keen to hear from anyone who may have relevant dashcam.

"I would like to thank motorists and local residents for their patience and understanding during the road closures while we treated the casualties and investigated the collision."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 1:62. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
