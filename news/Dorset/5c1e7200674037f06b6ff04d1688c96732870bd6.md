05 July 2018

* * *

Officers investigating the theft of a pedal bike in Wareham are appealing for anyone with information to come forward - with an image of the bike being released.

The bright yellow Voodoo Bizango bicycle, which belongs to a 13-year-old boy, was taken from behind KW Chinese in South Street sometime between 8pm and 9.30pm on Sunday 1 July 2018.

Police Constable Clare Gillard, of Wareham police, said: "The victim is devastated about this theft as he had saved up to buy the bike.

"We are making enquiries into the theft and I would appeal for any witnesses or anyone with information to contact police.

"The bike is quite distinctive, so I would urge anyone who sees a bike matching the description or who comes across one for sale in suspicious circumstances to get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180102478. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
