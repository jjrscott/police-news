# Appeal for information following reported robbery in Poole

09 February 2021

* * *

Officers investigating a reported knifepoint robbery in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The victim, a 14-year-old local boy, had just withdrawn a quantity of cash from the ATM outside Co-op in Blandford Road, Hamworthy, at around 10pm on Monday 8 February 2021 when he was approached by a man he recognised.

It was reported that the man was holding a Stanley knife and demanded money from the victim before stealing his phone, cash and bank card. The victim made off on a scooter along Hamilton Road.

Following enquiries, an 18-year-old Bournemouth man was arrested on suspicion of robbery. He is assisting officers with their enquiries.

Police Constable Sarah Hodgson, of Dorset Police's Priority Crime Team, said: "We are continuing to investigate this incident and I would appeal to any witnesses or anyone with information that might assist our enquiries to please get in touch.

"I am particularly keen to speak to two women who the victim approached in Hamilton Road shortly after the reported robbery to ask if he could use their phone."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210023452. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
