# Witness appeal following fatal collision on the A31 near Merley

06 October 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses following a fatal collision on the A31 near Merley.

At 12.49pm today, Friday 6 October 2017, emergency services were called to reports of a serious injury road traffic collision on the A31 involving a red and black Hyosung motorcycle and a white Ford Transit panel van.

Sadly, the rider of the motorcycle - a 17-year-old boy from Bournemouth - was pronounced dead at the scene. His family has been informed and the coroner notified.

The driver of the van, a 48-year-old man from Southampton, was uninjured.

Both lanes of the A31 were closed between the Merley roundabout and the Canford Bottom roundabout while collision investigators examined the scene. Motorists were advised to avoid the area and seek alternative routes.

Police Sergeant Fern Graham, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was travelling along the A31 and witnessed the collision to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who saw the manner of driving or riding of either vehicle before the collision or has a dash cam fitted in their vehicle.

"While I appreciate the road closures have inconvenienced motorists, I would like to reassure them that they were entirely necessary to allow officers to establish the exact causes of this collision."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at scit@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 6:213. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
