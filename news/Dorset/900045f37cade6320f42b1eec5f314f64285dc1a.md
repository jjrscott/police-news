# Witness appeal following stabbing in Bournemouth

05 May 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward after a man was stabbed in Bournemouth.

Officers were called at 1.33am today, Saturday 5 May 2018, to Lowther Road in the Charminster area of the town following reports that a man had been stabbed in the leg.

The victim, a 25-year-old local man, was walking along Charminster Road and into Lowther Road with some friends when a minor disagreement broke out among the group.

An unknown man appeared from a nearby garden, said something to the group and then stabbed the victim in the thigh.

The victim was taken to hospital for treatment to his injury, which is not described as life-threatening.

The offender ran away down Lowther Road and toward the Wessex Way. He wore grey jogging bottoms and a grey hooded top with the hood up. He spoke with a foreign accent.

The area was cordoned off while crimes scene investigators carried out their examinations. The scene has now been lifted and further enquiries are underway, including locating potential witnesses and CCTV searches.

Detective Sergeant Andy Haworth, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was a serious assault on a man and a full investigation is underway to locate the offender.

"I would urge anyone who witnessed the incident, or who saw a man matching the description given in the area at the relevant time, to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would also ask residents in the area to check their gardens and bins for a discarded knife. If you locate one, please do not touch it but call us immediately.

"Officers from the neighbourhood policing team will be carrying out high-visibility patrols in the area over the coming days and can be approached with any concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 5:39. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
