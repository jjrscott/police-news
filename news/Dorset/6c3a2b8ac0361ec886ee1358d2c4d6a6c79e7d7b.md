# Witness appeal after Bournemouth burglary

23 December 2016

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses after an elderly woman was burgled in Bournemouth.

The incident happened at around 10pm on Thursday 22 December 2016 at a property on Richmond Park Crescent when the woman heard a knock at her door.

She opened the door and two men forced their way in. One of the men pinned the victim down while the other stole jewellery, cash and a handbag, before they both left.

The victim suffered a bang to her head from hitting the floor during the incident, but did not require medical treatment.

The first offender is described as white, six feet tall and around 30 years old. He has short dark hair and a pale complexion. He was wearing a black peaked cap and black clothing.

The second offender is described as white, slightly shorter than the first offender and of broad build. He has short hair greying at the sides and a very deep gruff voice. He was wearing a grey mask over the bottom half of his face and a dark-coloured bomber jacket.

Detective Constable Aston Starkie, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was a frightening incident for the victim and I am appealing to anyone who may have seen two men acting suspiciously in the area at the time or the hours leading up to the incident to come forward.

"The local neighbourhood policing team has stepped up patrols in the area to offer community reassurances."
