# Witness appeal following reported assault in Bournemouth

06 July 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward after three men were reportedly assaulted in Bournemouth.

The three men, two aged in their 20s and one in his 50s, were walking along the seafront near to Bournemouth Pier at around 2.50am on Sunday 1 July 2018 when the incident occurred.

It was reported that as they walked past Harry Ramsdens, they heard voices coming from the beach huts nearby and almost tripped over a bicycle that was in the middle of the promenade.

One of the alleged victims went to pick up the bike to move it but was challenged by a group of men who came out of one of the beach huts.

He was knocked to the floor and the other two alleged victims were also reportedly assaulted. All three were taken to hospital and, while two of the men suffered only minor injuries, it was discovered that the older man had sustained a broken jaw that required surgery.

Following enquiries, four men - all aged in their 20s and from Southampton - have been arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and have been released under investigation.

Police Constable David Sweeting, of Dorset Police, said: "We have been carrying out a detailed investigation into this incident and I am appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information to contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk, via 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180101939.
