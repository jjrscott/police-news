Detectives investigating a knifepoint robbery in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police received a report at 5.37pm on Tuesday 17 November 2020 of a robbery at the Shell garage in Bournemouth Road.

It was reported that a man had entered the store and threatened a staff member with a knife.

The staff member was able to sound a panic alarm and the offender forced his way out of the premises by smashing a glass door.

A bottle of drink was stolen from the premises. The victim sustained a small cut to his finger during the incident.

The offender was wearing a dark top with the hood pulled up and a face mask. His was also wearing dark trousers and black shoes.

Detective Sergeant Karen Penn, of Dorset Police's Priority Crime Team, said: "This must have been a very distressing incident for the victim and we have launched a full investigation to identify the man responsible.

"From our enquiries, we believe the offender was hanging around outside the petrol station for some time before the incident and I would urge anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity, or who saw a man matching the description given, around the time of the robbery to please contact us.

"I would also urge anyone who was driving in the area and has dashcam fitted to their vehicle to check their footage for anything relevant."
