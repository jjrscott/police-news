# Witness appeal following sexual assault in Poole

27 January 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a sexual assault on a woman in Poole.

At around 4.20pm on Wednesday 25 January 2017 a woman was jogging along Haven Road toward Poole Harbour when she noticed a man walking at the junction of Canford Crescent. He smiled and winked at her.

The victim ignored the man but looked over her shoulder to check for traffic as she crossed the junction.

As she passed the offender she felt a hard slap on her bottom. She carried on running along Haven Road before stopping and turning around but the man had left the area.

The victim - a local woman aged in her 20s - was not physically injured.

The offender is described as white, aged in his 50s, of medium build and with grey scruffy hair. He had light stubble and was described as being of scruffy appearance and was wearing dirty clothes. His clothing is described as a dark grey baggy fleece which was waist length but ballooned out at the bottom and dark-coloured jeans.

Police Constable Andy Hale, of Poole police, said: "This was an unpleasant incident for the victim and I am keen to trace the offender.

"I would appeal to anyone who saw the man described by the victim in the area at the relevant time to please contact Dorset Police."

No arrests have been made.
