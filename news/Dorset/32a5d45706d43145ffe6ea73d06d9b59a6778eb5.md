# Witness appeal following burglary in Poole

08 June 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for the public's help for information following a burglary at a pub in Poole.

At around 2.45pm on Monday 5 June 2017 an offender gained access to a staff area at the Pottery Arms pub on Ringwood Road and stole two boxes containing a quantity of cash and a black wallet. A PIN number for a debit card was also taken.

A debit card was then used at the Post Office cashpoint on Wimborne Road in Poole to withdraw Â£300.

Police Sergeant Keith Clothier, of Poole police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed someone acting suspiciously in the area at the relevant time to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who has found a metal box discarded in the area.

"We would like to remind people to ensure they do not keep credit or debit cards and PIN numbers together and not have them written down in their wallet."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170083739. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via crimestoppers-uk.org.
