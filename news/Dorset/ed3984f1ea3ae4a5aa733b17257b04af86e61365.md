A man and woman have made contact with officers in connection with a reported assault in Christchurch.

It was reported that at approximately 5.05pm on Thursday 6 June 2019 a group of teenagers were eating in McDonalds on Somerford Road when one of the boys, aged 15, took some food from one of his friends and left the restaurant.

When the boy returned he was reportedly approached by a man who made comments about taking someone else's food and pushed him against the wall.

Following a CCTV appeal, a man and a woman have made contact with police. No arrests have been made.
