Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a serious injury collision on the B3081 between Verwood and Ringwood.

At 1.55am on Sunday 18 August 2019 Dorset Police was called by the fire service to reports of a serious collision that had occurred on the Verwood Road, near to the Bakers Hanging junction to Alderholt.

A silver Volkswagen Polo had left the road and landed on its roof.

A 21-year-old woman from Verwood sustained serious face and head injuries and was taken to Southampton General Hospital for treatment. Her condition is described as very serious but stable. Her family has been informed and are with her.

An 18-year-old woman from Verwood, 26-year-old man from West Moors and a 44-year-old man from Verwood have been arrested on suspicion of driving offences and are assisting officers with their enquiries.

The road was closed between the Ebblake Industrial Estate and the A31 junction while emergency services treated the injured woman and for an examination of the scene to take place. It reopened at 6.50am.

Police Sergeant Craig Tatton, of the traffic unit, said: "An investigation is underway to establish the circumstances of this collision and I am appealing to any motorists who were travelling in this area at the relevant time and either saw the Polo being driving immediately prior to the incident or witnessed the collision to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly keen to hear from any motorists who captured anything of relevance on dashcam."
