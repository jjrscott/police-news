# Witness appeal following serious collision in Lyme Regis

03 August 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses following a serious road traffic collision in Lyme Regis.

Dorset Police was called at 3.33pm on Thursday 2 August 2018 to reports of a collision on the A3052 near to the junction with Timber Hill.

The collision involved an open top double-decker bus and a blue and white Suzuki motorcycle.

As a result of the collision, the motorcyclist - a 25-year-old man from the Devon area - sustained serious, potentially life-changing injuries and was taken by air ambulance to Southmead Hospital in Bristol where he remains in a stable condition.

The bus driver and a small number of passengers were uninjured.

Police Constable Stu Smith, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or the manner of driving of either of the vehicles prior to the incident to please contact Dorset Police. I'd also ask anyone with dashcam footage to get in touch.

"I'd like to thank the public for their patience while the closures were in place, which were necessary to allow the casualty to be treated, for the scene to be thoroughly examined and for the involved vehicles to be recovered."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at scit@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 2:324. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
