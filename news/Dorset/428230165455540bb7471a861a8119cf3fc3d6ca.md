Officers investigating an altercation in Christchurch are appealing for witnesses to come forward - with one man being arrested.

At 6.37pm on Thursday 21 July 2016 Dorset Police received a report of an altercation along Dorset Road in Christchurch.

It is alleged that during the incident a male taxi driver was threatened with a firearm by a male customer.

The taxi driver was uninjured.

Armed officers attended the scene and a 49-year-old Christchurch man was arrested on suspicion of possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence. He is helping officers with their enquiries.

Chief Inspector Stewart Dipple, of Dorset Police, said: "Even though a man has been arrested we would like anyone who witnessed the incident to contact Dorset Police as soon as possible."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 21:400.
