# Family tribute to man who died in collision on A35 Puddletown bypass

30 October 2018

* * *

The family of a man who died in a fatal road traffic collision on the A35 Puddletown bypass have issued a tribute.

At around 7.30pm on Tuesday 16 October 2018 a collision occurred on the eastbound carriageway between the Northbrook Interchange at the A354 Blandford turning and the Tolpuddle Ball junction. It involved a green Skoda Fabia and a black Ford Galaxy.

Very sadly, the driver of the Skoda - named by his family as 45-year-old Stephen Faley from Weymouth - was pronounced dead at the scene.

The driver of the Ford, a 61-year-old Weymouth man and his 60-year-old passenger also from Weymouth were both taken to hospital for treatment to injuries but have both since left hospital.

Stephen's family have today, Tuesday 30 October 2018, issued the following tribute.

"During his life Steve Faley was a fun yet caring soul that lived to experience many memories.

"Steve was a devoted father to his son and daughter, and a loving husband to Gillian. He was very proud of both children, his son for his windsurfing achievements and his daughter for her love of horse riding and competitions.

"Steve worked as a plumber, trade name OnDemand Plumbing, with many customers in south Dorset.

"He was born and raised in Huddersfield, where many of his close family still live. Christmas trips to see his family were a particular highlight for Steve.

"Steve had a love for travelling, which is where he met his wife Gillian in Thailand 21 years ago."
