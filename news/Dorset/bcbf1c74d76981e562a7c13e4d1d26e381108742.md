# Update in relation to reported suspicious incident in Poole

22 September 2020

* * *

Following a detailed investigation, officers investigating reports of a suspicious incident at a play park in Poole say they are satisfied no offences have been committed.

It was reported that at around 11.45am on Friday 14 August 2020 a woman was pushing her young nephew on the swings at the Cygnet play area in Poole Park and her three-year-old daughter was standing next to her.

She then realised her daughter had left her side and saw her near to the exit to the park with a woman who was holding her hand. When the mother challenged the woman, she claimed she thought the girl was lost and then immediately left the park.

Detective Inspector Garry Knight, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We have taken this report very seriously and carried out a number of enquiries into this matter, including speaking to several witnesses who were at the scene.

"As a result of our investigations, we can confirm we are satisfied that no offences have been committed and there was no malicious intent. We have updated the mother of the girl involved of the outcome of our enquiries."
