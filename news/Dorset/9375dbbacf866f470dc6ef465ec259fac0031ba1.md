Officers investigating a serious injury collision in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

At 7.48am on Wednesday 30 October 2019 it was reported that a two vehicle collision occurred on Wallisdown Road, near to the junction with Lyon Road.

The collision involved a blue Suzuki motorcycle and a black BMW.

The rider of the motorcycle, a Bournemouth man aged in his 30s, was taken to Southampton General Hospital by air ambulance for treatment to a serious injury to his foot.

The BMW driver was uninjured.

Road closures were put in place to allow emergency services to deal with the incident. The road reopened at approximately 10.30am.

Police Sergeant Sarah Jones, of the traffic unit, said: "A detailed investigation is underway into the circumstances of this collision and I am appealing to any witnesses who have not already spoken to us to come forward.

"I would urge any motorists who were travelling in the area at the time and have dashcam fitted to their vehicle to please check their footage for anything relevant.

"Finally, I would like to thank the public for their patience while the road closures were in place as these are absolutely necessary to allow the emergency services to respond to the incident and carry out an examination of the collision scene."
