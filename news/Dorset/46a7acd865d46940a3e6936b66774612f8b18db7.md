Officers investigating a burglary at a shop in Christchurch are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police was called at 11.33pm on Tuesday 29 October 2019 to a report of a burglary at Co-op on Lymington Road.

It is reported that a Land Rover Discovery collided with the shop a number of times, breaking the glass door and shutter before rolling onto its roof.

The offenders ran off from the scene toward Wortley Road.

It is not clear at this stage if anything was stolen.

Detective Inspector Gavin House, of Bournemouth CID, said: "An investigation is underway to identify the offenders involved.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have seen a Land Rover Discovery, or any other vehicles acting suspiciously, in the nearby area at the relevant time to get in touch.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident or has any information to assist my investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190171017. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
