# Public appeal to find stolen bicycle

04 May 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for the public's help to find a teenage boy's bicycle which was stolen from Dorchester.

Sometime between 11am and 1pm on Friday 28 April 2017 a bright orange coloured Orbea bicycle was stolen from the bike sheds at Thomas Hardye School on Queens Avenue.

The bicycle had been secured with a heavy duty combination lock which was also taken by the offender.

Police Community Support Officer Matt Barton, of Dorchester police, said: "The bike is of great sentimental value to the victim.

"I would urge anyone who knows who was responsible for this theft or knows the whereabouts of the bike to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who has seen an orange Orbea bike for sale locally in unusual circumstances.

"Officers from the local Neighbourhood Policing Team are currently arranging a time to visit the school to offer free security marking on bikes."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170062175. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
