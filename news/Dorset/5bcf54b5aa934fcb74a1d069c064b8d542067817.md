* * *

Police are warning the public of the dangers of taking a drug called 'Golden Monkey' after two young women have fallen seriously ill.

At 8.23am on Sunday 24 July 2016 it was reported to Dorset Police that a 19-year-old woman and a 20-year-old woman, both from Weymouth, had been taken to hospital after using the substance.

Both women are seriously ill at Dorset County Hospital.

Chief Inspector Jim Beashel, of Dorset Police, said: "Officers are investigating the circumstances of the incident.

"We want to warn members of the public of the dangers of taking such drugs as anyone consuming them could be putting their health and even their life in serious danger.

"I would strongly advise those thinking of taking such substances to think again. You can't be sure what you're taking and the side-effects are unpredictable and potentially life-threatening."

"If anyone has any information with regard to the sale of illegal drugs please do not hesitate to report it."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 24:130.
