The most recent incident happened sometime between 11pm on Monday 18 February and 7am on Tuesday 19 February 2019 when an offender gained access via an insecure door to a property in Herringston Road. Two laptops, two cameras and a wallet were stolen.

A second burglary was reported to have occurred between 1am and 7am in Dagmar Road on Friday 15 February 2019. The occupants woke to discover the front door open. A purse containing cash and bank cards was stolen.

A third burglary occurred sometime between 11pm on Tuesday 12 February and 7am on Wednesday 13 February 2019 in Dagmar Road. Entry was gained through an insecure door. Two mobile phones were stolen from a handbag.

A forth was reported to have occurred between 10.20pm on Monday 11 February and 7.30am on Tuesday 12 February 2019 in Peverell Avenue East in Poundbury while the occupants were asleep upstairs. One of the victims, a man aged in his 70s, came down in the morning to find the front door unlocked and a number of items missing including an iPad Mini, an iPhone 5S, a blue canvas bag, an Apple MacBook Pro, an older Apple laptop and three Berghaus jackets.

Dorchester Neighbourhood Police Inspector Darren Stanton said: "We believe these offences may have been committed by the same person and a thorough and detailed investigation is underway to identify the offender.

"I would like to remind residents to remember to lock their doors and windows at night to ensure they do not become the victim of an opportunist crime. There are a number of simple steps you can take to protect your home and anyone wishing advice can either contact their local neighbourhood policing team or visit www.dorset.police.uk/help-advice-crime-prevention/home-property-belongings/protect-your-home/.

"I would urge anyone who sees suspicious activity in the early hours of the morning in the Dorchester area to please call Dorset Police on 999.

 "Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team will be carrying out additional patrols and can be approached with any community concerns."
