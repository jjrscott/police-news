# Special constables unite to target rural crime

08 December 2017

* * *

Special constables from across Dorset Police, Devon & Cornwall Police and Hampshire Constabulary joined forces to target rural crime in a weekend of proactive patrols. The cross-border operation saw officers proactively patrol rural areas surrounding Ringwood, Verwood, Wimborne, Blandford, Shaftesbury, Sherborne, Bridport, Lyme Regis, Axminster, Honiton, Weymouth and Dorchester.

The results of the operation are as follows:

 * A man was arrested on suspicion of driving while over the prescribed alcohol limit in East Dorset, and another driver was reported for driving In excess of 100mph on the A338
 * Officers were called to a report of an attempted burglary in Weymouth which turned out to be a false alarm, and to a report of a suspicious vehicle in a rural area.
 * Special constables in Dorchester attended a report of a suspicious man and woman looking into parked vehicles.
 * A driver with no insurance was dealt with in Hampshire
 * More than 220 people and vehicle checks across the three Force areas.

 The operation was led by Special Inspector Ben Muspratt of Dorset Police at the end of November. He said: "This operation was a fantastic way for the Special Constabulary to come together to conduct high visibility patrols and deal proactively with rural crime."
