# Witness appeal after suspicious house fire in Bournemouth

03 July 2017

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses after a suspicious house fire in Bournemouth.

The fire occurred at around 3pm on Sunday 2 July 2017 at an address on Milford Drive. It is believed the fire was started deliberately via the cat flap in the front door of the house.

The fire destroyed the front door and caused heavy smoke damage throughout the property. The occupants were not in the house at the time, however two neighbours went into the address to save some cats. They both had to be rescued by the fire service and taken to hospital for treatment for smoke inhalation. It is not thought the cats were injured.

Officers have carried out a number of local enquiries including house to house and to see if any residents or businesses have CCTV available.

Detective Constable Luke Davis, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who saw suspicious activity near to the property during that afternoon, particularly anyone seen in the garden or the front drive of the property just before 3pm, to please contact me.

"If you have any information about the cause or motive of the fire, please contact Dorset Police or call Crimestoppers anonymously."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police,uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170100040. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
