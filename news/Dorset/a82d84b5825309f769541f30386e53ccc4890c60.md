# Appeal for Good Samaritan to come forward after robbery in Bournemouth

06 October 2017

* * *

Detectives are appealing for a Good Samaritan who went to the aid of a robbery victim in Bournemouth to contact them.

At around 9am on Sunday 24 September 2017 a man aged in his 80s parked his car in the car park at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital when he was approached by a man who asked for money.

The victim stated he did not have any and the offender became aggressive, pushed the victim back against his car and wrestled his car keys from him.

As the victim got out his wallet and started counting money, a woman went to his aid. She took the keys back off the offender and told him to leave. He walked off toward the bus stop.

The woman told the victim that she had also been approached for money by the offender. She walked the victim to A&E and explained to staff what had happened before she left.

The victim sustained a minor injury to his index finger.

The offender is described as white, five feet ten inches tall, around 40 years old and with dark medium-length hair. He was wearing a T-shirt and trousers.

The woman who helped the victim is described as white, aged in her 40s, well-spoken, around five feet two inches tall, of average build and with short grey hair.

Detective Constable Matt Cooke, of Bournemouth CID, said: "As part of my enquiries I have established that a kind woman went to the aid of the victim during this incident. I am particularly keen to trace this Good Samaritan as I believe she may have important information that could assist me with my investigation.

"I would also urge anyone else who may have been approached by this man to contact Dorset Police."

No arrests have been made.
