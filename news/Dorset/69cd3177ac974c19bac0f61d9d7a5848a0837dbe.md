# Appeal for information following alleged firearms incident in Poole

07 August 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for information following an alleged firearms incident in Poole.

Dorset Police was called to an address in Belben Road at 9.17pm yesterday, Monday 6 August 2018, to reports of a man with a gun.

It is alleged the man made threats toward a woman aged in her 20s.

Officers attended and a man was detained a short time later at an address in Hastings Road.

The 24-year-old man from Poole was arrested on suspicion of possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence and he is currently assisting police with enquiries.

The man and woman were both known to each other. No one was injured during the incident.

The firearm allegedly involved remains outstanding and it is not known at this stage if it was real, imitation or an air weapon.

Detective Inspector Andy Bell, of Bournemouth CID, said: "A detailed investigation has been launched into the incident and the public can expect an increased police presence in the area while searches for the suspected weapon and house-to-house enquiries are carried out.

"I would ask anyone who comes across anything that resembles a firearm in the Canford Heath and Broadstone areas not to touch it, but to report it immediately to Dorset Police.

"I would like to thank residents for their patience and understanding while these active enquiries are carried out.

"Anyone with information about the incident or who may have seen or heard anything suspicious in the area yesterday evening to please contact us or call Crimestoppers to report it anonymously."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180126105. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
