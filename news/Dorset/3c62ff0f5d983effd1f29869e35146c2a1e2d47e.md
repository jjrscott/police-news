Police in Poole are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following an alleged assault in the Parkstone area of town.

Officers were called at 2.33am on Saturday 20 August 2016 to a report of a fight outside The Golden Kebab on Bournemouth Road.

The disturbance involved a large group of men and women.

A number of people sustained minor injuries during the incident.

Investigations Officer Adrian Facey, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am keen to speak to a number of people who are believed to have sustained facial injuries as a result of the incident as they may be able to help me with my investigation.

"I would also urge anybody who was in the area at the time and witnessed the alleged assault to come forward."

A 21-year-old man and 22-year-old man, both from Poole, were arrested on suspicion of affray and are currently on police bail until late September 2016.
