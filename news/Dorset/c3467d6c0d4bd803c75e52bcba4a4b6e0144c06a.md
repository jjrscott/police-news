# Witness appeal following suspicious fire in Bournemouth

04 August 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a suspicious fire in Boscombe are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police was called by the fire service at 8.02pm on Saturday 3 August 2019 reporting a property fire at a block of flats in Wolverton Road.

Officers attended and assisted with evacuating the premises and putting road closures in place to ensure the safety of members of the public. The local authority also assisted with providing temporary accommodation for displaced residents.

There were no reports of any casualties.

Detective Constable Sara Freestone, of Bournemouth CID, said: "Following a number of enquiries and in close consultation with Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service, we are now treating this fire as suspected arson and it is believed to have originated in a vehicle in the car parking area beneath the property.

"This fire caused significant disruption to residents and I would like to thank everyone involved in the effort to ensure those affected were evacuated safely and had somewhere to stay while the incident was dealt with.

"We have launched a full investigation into the circumstances of the fire and I am appealing to anyone with information or who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area yesterday evening to please contact police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting 55190120761. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
