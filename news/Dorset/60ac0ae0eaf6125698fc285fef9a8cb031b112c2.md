# Witness appeal following indecent exposure incident in Bournemouth

26 May 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following an indecent exposure incident in Bournemouth.

At around 12.15pm on Tuesday 19 May 2020 the victim, a woman aged in her fifties, was walking through King's Park car park with her dog when she heard a whistle from the direction of the trees. When she looked around she saw a man who was unclothed from the waist down and performing a lewd act.

The victim immediately got into her car and drove away.

The man is described as very tanned or dark-skinned and aged in his teens to 20s. He was wearing blue tracksuit bottoms and a top with red on it.

Police Constable Robert Cleary, of Dorset Police, said: "The victim was left shaken by this incident and we are continuing to make enquiries to identify the man responsible.

"I would ask anyone who saw this man or has any information that may assist my investigation to please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200070660. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111
