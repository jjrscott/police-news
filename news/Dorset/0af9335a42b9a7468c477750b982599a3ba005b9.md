# Witness appeal following reported disturbance on Portland

25 November 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for a man to come forward after he was flagged down during a reported disturbance on Portland.

Dorset Police was called at around 8.30pm on Saturday 21 November 2020 to reports of a disturbance in the area of St Georges Estate Road, in which a local man was allegedly being threatened by another man. No injuries were sustained.

Police Constable Amanda Hannam, of Weymouth police, said: "During the incident I believe the victim flagged down a male motorist, possibly a delivery driver, to ask for help. I would appeal for this motorist to please contact me as they may have information that could help my investigation.

"Finally, I would ask for anyone who was in the area and witnessed the incident to please contact me."

A 52-year-old local man was arrested on suspicion of affray, threats to kill and possession of a knife blade or sharp pointed article in a public place. He has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200175669.
