A man is due to appear at court in connection with an incident where a man allegedly threatened a member of the public in Weymouth.

At 4.48pm on Friday 18 May 2018 Dorset Police was called to reports of a man with a Swiss Army pen knife in Lodmoor Country Park. It was reported that a man also threatened a member of the public and threw golf balls at him. The victim, a local man aged in his 50s, was not physically injured.

A 63-year-old local man has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Monday 17 September 2018 for offences of assault and using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause fear of or provoke unlawful violence.
