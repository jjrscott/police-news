# Witness appeal after teenage girl allegedly threatened in Christchurch

07 June 2017

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a teenage girl was reportedly threatened by a man carrying a gun in Christchurch.

Officers were called at 6.19pm yesterday, Tuesday 6 June 2017, to reports that a girl had been threatened by a man as she walked her dog along a bridleway off Bronte Avenue. The incident is reported to have happened an hour earlier.

It is alleged the man approached the girl, pulled out a black handgun and pointed it at her. The girl screamed and ran to a nearby house for help.

The man was said to be wearing black trousers, a black hooded top with the hood up and black trainers.

A 24-year-old man of Christchurch was arrested a short time later on suspicion of possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence and possession of a knife or bladed article in a public place and is currently assisting officers with enquiries.

No firearm has been located.

Detective Constable Ben Griffin, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the Bronte Avenue area at the relevant time and saw a man matching the description given to please contact Dorset Police.

"Specially-trained officers are providing support to the teenage girl and her family.

"Officers from the Neighbourhood Policing Team will be carrying out high visibility patrols in the coming days to offer reassurance to the community and can be approached with any concerns.

"There has been some discussion on social media that this incident is terrorism related. I would like to make it very clear that there is nothing to suggest this is the case."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170084407. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via crimestoppers-uk.org.
