Detectives investigating the report of a rape of a woman in Bournemouth town centre have arrested two men.

Dorset Police received a report at 6.12am on Wednesday 13 November 2019 that a woman had been found with injuries in Lower Gardens in Bournemouth.

Officers attended, along with the ambulance service, and the woman - aged in her 40s - was taken to hospital for treatment. Her condition is described as stable.

While at hospital, the woman reported that she had been walking through the gardens at around 5.40am when she was approached from behind by a man, who assaulted and raped her.

An investigation was launched by detectives from Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team.

A cordon remains in place in the gardens to allow officers to examine the scene.

Following enquiries, a 28-year-old Bournemouth man has been arrested on suspicion of rape and causing grievous bodily harm with intent. A 43-year-old man, also from Bournemouth, has been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. They are both currently assisting detectives with their enquiries.
