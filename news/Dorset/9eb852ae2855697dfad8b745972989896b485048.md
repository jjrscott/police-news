Two men have been charged in connection with an alleged aggravated burglary in Bournemouth.

At around 3.55am on Monday 9 October 2017 Dorset Police received a report that two men had entered a flat in Meyrick Park Crescent through an unlocked door.

It was reported that the victim, a man aged in his 30s, was struck on the head with a wooden item and the men stole £1,000 in cash before leaving the property.

The victim suffered a head injury, which was not believed to be serious, but he was taken to hospital as a precaution.
