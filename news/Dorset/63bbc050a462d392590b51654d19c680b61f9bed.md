# Appeal following racially aggravated incident near Wareham

08 June 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for anyone with information to come forward following a racially aggravated incident near Wareham.

At around 3.10pm on Tuesday 26 May 2020 the victim, a man aged in his 40s, was walking through Stoborough pushing another man in a wheelchair when a cyclist rode past and stopped to speak to them. Following a short interaction, the cyclist racially abused the victim.

The offender then grabbed a jacket from the wheelchair and threw it on the ground before cycling off toward Wareham.

Officers attended and carried out a search of the area for the cyclist, but he was not located.

The offender is described as white, aged in his 40s, six feet tall and of medium build with possibly brown hair. He was wearing a light-coloured T-shirt, blue jeans, a cap and had a red or maroon-coloured scarf over his mouth. He also had a tattoo on his right arm of the word 'psalm' and was riding a blue mountain bike.

Police Constable Clifford Ryan, of Purbeck police, said: "Racial abuse and hate crime has no place in our community and Dorset Police takes all reports extremely seriously.

"The victim was understandably left feeling very upset following this unprovoked incident and a full investigation is underway to identify the offender.

"I am appealing to anyone who recognises the man from the description given to please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200074299. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
