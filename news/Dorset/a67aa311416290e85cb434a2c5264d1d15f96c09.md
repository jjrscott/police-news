# Witness appeal following criminal damage in Poole

31 October 2019

* * *

Officers investigating criminal damage to vehicles in the Broadstone area of Poole are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At around 8pm on Tuesday 29 October 2019 it was reported that damage was caused to a number of vehicles that were parked on Upper and Lower Golf Links Road.

Some of the vehicles had their tyres punctured and damage was caused to windscreens and wing mirrors.

Police Constable Ellie Meteau, of Poole Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "I am saddened that the mindless actions of the individuals involved has caused unnecessary cost and inconvenience to local residents.

"Enquiries are underway and we are securing all available evidence to try and identify those responsible.

"I am appealing to the residents of Broadstone to check their home CCTV systems and contact me with anything that may be relevant to my investigation.

"I am also keen to hear from any motorists who were driving in the area between 7.30pm and 10pm and may have captured the incident on dashcam."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190170966. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
