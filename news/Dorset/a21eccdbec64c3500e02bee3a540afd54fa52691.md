# Witness appeal following indecent exposure in Bournemouth

16 January 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an indecent exposure incident in Bournemouth.

Sometime between 6pm and 7pm on Thursday 11 January 2018 a woman walked along Queens Park Avenue in the town close to the junction with Queens Park West Drive when she became aware of a man standing in a hedge on the golf course.

The victim continued walking but as she reached the junction of Broad Avenue she checked behind her and saw the man performing a lewd act while shining a torch on himself.

As the victim approached Linkside Avenue, the man appeared via a cut through in the hedge. He was no longer exposing himself but made a sexual comment to the victim.

The victim - a local woman aged in her 60s - hurried home.

The offender is described as white but with an olive complexion, over six feet tall, of slim build and aged in his late 20s or early 30s. He was wearing a dark-coloured jacket and trousers. He spoke with a European accent.

Police Constable Calum Maton, of Dorset Police, said: "Enquiries are underway to identify the offender including CCTV, house-to-house visits and high-visibility patrols. I would urge anyone who was in the area at the relevant time and saw a man acting suspiciously to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180005876. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
