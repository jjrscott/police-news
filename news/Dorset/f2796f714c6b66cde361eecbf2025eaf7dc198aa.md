# Update â€“ witness appeal following fatal road traffic collision in Bridport

15 November 2017

* * *

Two people arrested in connection with a fatal collision in Bridport have been released without charge.

At 11.15pm on Monday 13 November 2017 a two vehicle collision occurred on the A35 Sea Road South close to the Crown roundabout involving a silver Mercedes convertible and a black Mitsubishi L200 pick-up truck.

Sadly, the driver of the Mitsubishi, a 64-year-old man from Bridport, died at the scene. His family has been informed and the coroner notified.

Three men aged 30, 32 and 35 from the Bridport area, all occupants of the Mercedes, suffered serious but not life threatening injuries and were taken to hospital for treatment.

A 33-year-old man and a 27-year-old woman, both from Bridport, were arrested on suspicion of driving offences and have now been released without charge.

A 30-year-old local man, who was also arrested on suspicion of driving offences, is still assisting officers with their enquiries.

Officers are continuing to appeal for any witnesses, or anyone with dashcam footage or CCTV covering East Street or Sea Road South in Bridport between 11pm and 11.15pm on Monday 13 November 2017, to come forward.
