# Appeal for information following break-in at Purbeck community project

08 November 2018

* * *

Officers investigating a burglary at the home of a community project in Purbeck are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 1.30pm on Wednesday 7 November 2018 Dorset Police received a report that a burglary had occurred at The Veterans' Forge Community Interest Company, a project designed for veterans and students to learn blacksmith skills at Oakwood Farm near Corfe Castle.

The burglary is believed to have occurred between 8pm on Tuesday 6 November and 12pm on Wednesday 7 November 2018. The offenders forced entry to a gate and barn door before stealing a number of items including machines and tools.

Police Constable Tom Renshaw, of Purbeck police, said: "This has caused a great deal of upset and inconvenience to a project that is trying to support veterans and the local community and we are determined to identify those responsible.

"I am appealing for anyone who may have witnessed suspicious activity in the area on the night of Tuesday 6 November to contact police. I would also like to hear from anyone who comes across specialist blacksmith tools or equipment being offered for sale in unusual circumstances."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180180224. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
