# Witness appeal following potential suspicious incident in Blandford

23 December 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a report that a motorist was seen acting suspiciously in Blandford.

At approximately 3.30pm on Thursday 19 December 2019 an 11-year-old boy was walking home from school through Milldown Road car park when he noticed a pick-up style van following him. The boy reported that the van tried to block his path, but another vehicle came along and the van had to move. The boy was able to run away.

The pick-up style van is described as black, with an open back and blacked out rear windows.

The male driver did not approach the boy or speak to him at any point during the incident.

He is described as white and a bit scruffy with a ginger beard. He was wearing an orange T-shirt and a white American trucker-style baseball cap with black mesh at the back.

Police Sergeant Celia Birkinshaw, of North Dorset police, said: "We are making enquiries to establish who the driver of the van and the second passing vehicle are.

"While the man's intentions are not clear at this stage, I am keen to identify him and find out what he was doing in the area.

"I would also like to hear from the driver of the passing vehicle as they may have information to assist my investigation.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed a black van acting suspiciously, or captured it on dashcam, at the relevant time to get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190199122. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
