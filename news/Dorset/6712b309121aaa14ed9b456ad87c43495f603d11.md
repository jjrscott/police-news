# Appeal for witnesses after theft from shop in Poole

19 December 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses after offenders stole mobile phones and caused damage to a shop in Poole.

The incident happened at around 5.55pm yesterday, Monday 18 December 2017, at Carphone Warehouse on Wessex Gate Retail Park.

Three men entered the store wearing gloves and balaclavas, ripped phones from security stands around the store and made off in a vehicle described as a black 4x4 or similar.

No one was injured during the incident and no threats were made toward any staff or customers.

The total value of the goods were thought to be around Â£9,000.

A search of the area was carried out with support from the NPAS helicopter, however the suspects were not located.

Police Constable Charlotte Harvey, of Poole police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in or near the store at the time and are yet to speak to police to please come forward.

"In particular, if anyone witnessed three men or a black 4x4 or similar acting suspiciously in the area immediately before or after the incident, I would ask them to contact Dorset Police urgently.

"We are currently reviewing CCTV to see if there is any relevant footage and enquiries are ongoing."
