# Witness appeal after fatal collision in Wareham

10 August 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a fatal collision in Wareham.

The incident happened at around 12.55pm today, Thursday 10 August 2017, between a Volvo lorry and a pedestrian on Bere Road near to Wareham Forest Tourist Park.

The pedestrian - a 78-year-old local man - was sadly pronounced dead at the scene despite the best efforts of the emergency services and members of the public. His next of kin have been informed and the coroner notified.

The lorry driver was not injured.

The road was closed and re-opened just before 5pm.

Police Sergeant Mark Scammell, of the traffic unit, said: "The man's family is being supported by specially-trained officers and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the incident or who has any information that could assist with the investigation to please come forward.

"I appreciate the road closures may have had an impact on residents and visitors, however the closures were necessary to allow collision investigators to examine the scene and for the emergency services to deal with the incident. I would like to thank motorists for their patience."
