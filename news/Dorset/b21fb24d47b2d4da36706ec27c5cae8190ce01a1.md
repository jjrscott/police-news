# Statement about the death of a serving Dorset Police officer

30 March 2020

* * *

Dorset Police's Chief Constable James Vaughan has announced the very sad death of a serving police officer.

He said: "I can confirm one of our serving officers sadly died at his home in Bournemouth just before 10am today, Monday 30 March 2020.

"He was 56-years-old and had been unwell since Christmas with a chest infection. He had been off sick since Thursday 19 March and went into self-isolation following COVID-19 guidance from the NHS after displaying symptoms.

"It is not yet confirmed if the death is COVID-19-related and I would strongly emphasise that it is too early to speculate on the circumstances surrounding his death.

"We are all deeply saddened by the death. This is a huge loss to the police family and my thoughts and prayers are with the officer's family, friends and close friends, many of whom are Dorset Police colleagues. I have relayed to them my deepest condolences.

"I would ask you to please respect their privacy at this very sad time."
