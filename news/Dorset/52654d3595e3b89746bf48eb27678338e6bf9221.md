# Appeal for information following fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth

29 June 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

The incident occurred at around 11.55pm on Tuesday 16 June 2020. A woman aged in her 30s was in her parked car - a silver Mercedes - on East Overcliff Drive when a white Audi collided with the side of her vehicle before mounting the pavement and driving off.

A wing mirror from the Audi was found at the scene.

The woman was checked over by the ambulance service but did not require hospital treatment.

Police Constable Ryan Greenwell, of Bournemouth police, said: "We have been making enquiries to try and trace the Audi involved in this collision, but these have so far proved unsuccessful.

"I am appealing for anyone with information about this incident, or who is aware of a white Audi that has sustained a damaged wing mirror in unexplained circumstances in recent days, to please contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200086513. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
