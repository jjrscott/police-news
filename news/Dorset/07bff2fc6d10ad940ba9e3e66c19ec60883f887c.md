17 July 2018

* * *

The family of a man who died in a fatal collision near Bere Regis has issued a tribute.

At 4.40pm on Saturday 14 July 2018 Dorset Police was called to reports of a three vehicle collision on the westbound lane of the A35 Dorchester bypass near Bere Regis, just before the single carriageway becomes a dual carriageway.

The collision involved a white BMW, a white Land Rover Freelander and a silver Mercedes.

Very sadly the driver of the Freelander - named by his family as 49-year-old David Grant-Jones - sustained serious injuries and died at the scene.

His wife, 59-year-old Heather who was travelling in the front passenger seat of the Freelander, sustained serious injuries and was flown by air ambulance to Southampton General Hospital for treatment.

The driver of the BMW - a 27-year-old man from Bournemouth - sustained serious injuries and was taken to Southampton General Hospital for treatment. A 39-year-old Bournemouth man who was travelling in the BMW sustained a life-threatening head injury and was flown by air ambulance to Southmead Hospital in Bristol. A second passenger - a 26-year-old man - sustained serious injuries and was taken to Poole Hospital for treatment.

No one from the silver Mercedes was injured.

Dave Grant-Jones' family has today, Tuesday 17 July 2018, issued the following tribute.

"It is with complete heartbreak and sadness that our family have to announce the very sudden and tragic loss of Dave Grant-Jones.

"He was a husband, father, grandfather, brother and uncle and was loved by all that knew him.

"We would like to ask at this time that people respect the privacy of our family while we try to come to terms with this shocking news."

A 38-year-old man arrested for causing death by dangerous driving and causing serious injury by dangerous driving has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Police Sergeant Fern Graham, of the traffic unit, said: "Our investigation into this collision remains ongoing and I would ask anyone who witnessed the collision and has yet to speak to officers to please come forward."
