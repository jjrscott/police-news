# Witness appeal following fatal collision in Poole

30 August 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a fatal collision in Poole.

The collision occurred at around 9.15pm yesterday, Tuesday 29 August 2017 on Parkstone Road, close to the junction with Bird's Hill Road.

It involved a white Audi A1 and an orange Kawasaki motorcycle.

The rider of the motorcycle, a 35-year-old Poole man, suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospital where he sadly died. His next of kin have been informed and the coroner has been notified.

The driver of the Audi, a man aged in his 20s, and the front seat passenger, a woman aged in her 20s, were treated for minor injuries.

The road was closed to allow the emergency services to carry out their work and for a detailed investigation of the scene to take place. It was reopened at around 3.30am.

Police Inspector Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "The man's family is being supported by specially-trained officers at this difficult time.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision, or the manner of driving of the vehicles involved immediately prior to the incident, to please contact police.

"I would also like to thank motorists for their patience while the road closures were in place. They were necessary to allow for emergency services to deal with the incident and for collision investigators to examine the scene."
