# Witness appeal following serious collision in North Dorset

18 May 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward following a serious injury road traffic collision in North Dorset.

Dorset Police was called at 8.04am on Monday 18 May 2020 to a report of a collision involving a grey Peugeot van and a white Ducati motorcycle on the C13 at Spread Eagle Hill near Melbury Abbas.

Officers attended the scene along with the ambulance service.

The motorcyclist, a man aged in his 50s from Westbury in Wiltshire, was taken to hospital for treatment to injuries that are believed to be potentially life threatening. His family has been informed.

A 22-year-old man from the Blandford area was arrested on suspicion of driving offences and has been released under investigation as officers continue enquiries into the collision.

Road closures were put in place to allow the emergency services to respond and for an examination of the scene to take place. They were lifted at around 11.30am.

Sergeant Sarah Jones, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the injured motorcyclist and his family and we are carrying out a detailed investigation to establish the full circumstances of this collision.

"I am appealing for anyone who witnessed the collision, or the manner of driving of the vehicles involved prior to it, to please contact us. I would also like to hear from anyone who might have any relevant dashcam footage.

"Finally, I would like to thank members of the public for their patience and understanding while the road closures were in place. These were necessary to allow the emergency services to respond to the incident and safely carry out an examination of the collision scene."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 18:48. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
