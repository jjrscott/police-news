# Renewed witness appeal following fail-to-stop collision in North Dorset

05 January 2018

* * *

Officers investigating a fail-to-stop collision in North Dorset are renewing their appeal for information from the public.

Police are particularly keen to speak to the driver of a vehicle that was seen in the area around the time of the collision and are releasing a CCTV image of the car.

At around 10.45am on Wednesday 29 November 2017 a collision occurred on Sackmore Lane in Marnhull involving a pedestrian, a woman aged in her 70s, and a car that reportedly failed to stop at the scene.

The woman was initially able to make her way home but was later taken to hospital with injuries to her wrist and shoulder.

Officers have now obtained CCTV footage from a nearby property showing a light silver Nissan Qashqai on Sackmore Lane around the time of the collision. The vehicle has a distinctive panoramic roof and five-spoke alloys.

Police Constable Kate Schofield, of North Dorset Police, said: "We are continuing to investigate this incident and I would urge the driver of the vehicle pictured, or anybody who knows their identity, to please come forward and speak to police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170185958. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
