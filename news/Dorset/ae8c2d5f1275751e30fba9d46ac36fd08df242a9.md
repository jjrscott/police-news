Dorset Police is appealing for witnesses following an incident of racially-aggravated criminal damage in Bournemouth.

Officers discovered that offensive graffiti targeted at the Polish community had been sprayed across the Riviera Pub on Christchurch Road today, Wednesday 28 June 2017.

Graffiti was also sprayed onto the police box in Boscombe precinct.

It is believed the incident happened overnight between Tuesday 27 June and Wednesday 28 June.

"I would ask any witnesses to the incident or anyone with information to please contact Dorset Police.

"The Neighbourhood Policing Team has stepped up patrols around the area and are happy to be approached with any concerns."
