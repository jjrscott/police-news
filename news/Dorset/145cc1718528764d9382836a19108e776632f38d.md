# Witness appeal following serious injury collision in Blandford

24 August 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a young child sustained very serious injuries following a collision in Blandford.

At 7.52am today, Thursday 24 August 2017, Dorset Police was informed by the ambulance service of a serious road traffic collision between a white Ford Transit van and a silver Vauxhall Astra on the A354 at Thickthorn Cross.

The driver of the Astra - a 34-year-old woman from Shaftesbury - sustained a serious head injury and her three-year-old daughter sustained a life-threatening head injury. They were flown by air ambulance to Southampton General Hospital.

The driver of the van - a 44-year-old woman from Salisbury - also sustained serious injuries and was taken to Salisbury District Hospital for treatment.

All the people involved are being supported by specially trained officers.

The road remained closed between the B3081 Sixpenny Handley roundabout and the Long Critchel junction to allow the emergency services to deal with the incident and for essential forensic examination of the scene and vehicles involved. It was re-opened shortly before 3pm.

Police Sergeant Phil Lee, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or who saw the manner of driving of either vehicle immediately prior to the incident to please contact Dorset Police.

"In particular, I would like the driver of a Silver Volkswagen Passat estate which negotiated that junction immediately prior to the collision to contact us as they may have information relevant to this investigation.

"I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who was travelling on the A354 at the relevant time and may have captured the incident on dashcam.

"Finally, I appreciate this collision occurred on the first day of the Great Dorset Steam Fair and the road closures have caused considerable congestion in the area. We apologise for the inconvenience caused to motorists and residents but I would like reassure them that the closures were absolutely necessary to allow us to tend to the injured and investigate this collision thoroughly."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Police Constable 1970 Kevin Farenden of the Serious Collision Investigation Team at Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 24:76. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
