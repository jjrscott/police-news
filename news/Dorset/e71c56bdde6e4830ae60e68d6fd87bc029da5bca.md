# Witness appeal following reported altercation in Weymouth

05 April 2019

* * *

Detectives investigating reports of an altercation in Weymouth are appealing for any witnesses to come forward.

At around 11.35pm on Monday 1 April 2019 Dorset Police received a report of a fight involving two men at the Jubilee Retail Park, near to the Swannery Bridge.

Following the incident a man aged in his 30s attended Dorset County Hospital for treatment to facial injuries that were apparently caused by a bladed item. The injuries were serious but not believed to be life-threatening.

Following enquiries by detectives, a 36-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of wounding with intent and has been released under investigation.

Detective Sergeant Rhys Griffiths, of Weymouth CID, said: "We are continuing to investigate this matter and I would urge any witnesses to contact us.

"I understand there were a number of motorists in the vicinity of Swannery Bridge at the time of the incident, including a black 4x4 - possibly a Range Rover - which was travelling along King Street to the bridge that was forced to stop as a result of the altercation.

"I am keen to hear from any motorists who may have witnessed these events or who may have captured them on dashcam."
