# Update: Witness appeal after teenage girl allegedly threatened in Christchurch

08 June 2017

* * *

A man arrested in connection with reportedly threatening a teenage girl with a gun has been released under investigation.

It is alleged that at around 5.30pm on Tuesday 6 June 2017 a girl was threatened by a man as she walked her dogs along a bridleway off Bronte Avenue in Christchurch.

It is reported that as the girl was walking along the path a man wearing black trousers, a black hooded top with the hood up and black trainers pulled out a black handgun and pointed it at her.

A 24-year-old man of Christchurch arrested a short time later on suspicion of possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence and possession of a knife or bladed article in a public place has been released under investigation.

No firearm has been located.

Detective Constable Ben Griffin, of Bournemouth CID, said: "A number of enquiries have been carried out, including an extensive and thorough search of the area assisted by the dog section, to try and locate a firearm but so far nothing has been found.

"I am still appealing to anyone who was in the Bronte Avenue area at the relevant time and saw a man matching the description given to please contact Dorset Police.

"Officers from the Neighbourhood Policing Team are continuing to carry out high visibility patrols to offer reassurance to the community and can be approached with any concerns.

"Following discussion on social media linking the incident to terrorism, I would like to reiterate that there is nothing to suggest that this is the case."
