# Update - reported voyeurism incident in Bournemouth

29 May 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a reported voyeurism incident at a Bournemouth shop say a man has come forward.

At around midday on Monday 28 January 2019 a woman entered the female changing room at River Island on Commercial Road to try on a pair of jeans. She then allegedly saw a hand holding a mobile phone under the partition of the changing room.

On 18 March 2019 Dorset Police issued a CCTV appeal appealing for the publicâ€™s help to identify a man.

On Friday 24 May 2019 a 20-year-old man from Christchurch was voluntarily interviewed by officers on suspicion of an offence of voyeurism and has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.
