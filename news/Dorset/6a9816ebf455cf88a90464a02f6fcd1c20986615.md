A man has been charged in connection with a reported attempted robbery in Weymouth.

At around 10.45pm on Tuesday 12 September 2017 it was reported that a man approached two other men as they walked in the area of Crescent Street and Derby Street, repeatedly demanded money and threatened to stab them. No weapon was seen.

The victims, two local men aged 18 and 19, were not physically injured.
