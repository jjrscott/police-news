Detectives are appealing for the public's help to locate the owners of a number of items of jewellery found in Bournemouth.

The rings were recovered from a second-hand shop in Bournemouth and it is suspected that the items may have been stolen.

Two of the rings are silver, two are nine carat gold with precious stones and two are described as 22 carat gold. The remaining rings are described as yellow gold with diamonds and a red gem stone, yellow gold with diamonds in a twist and the final one features a woman's head and shoulder.

Detective Constable Christian Bryant, of Dorset Police's Priority Crime Team, said: "We suspect that these rings may have been stolen and are keen to identify the owners.

"I would ask anyone who recognises these rings to please contact Dorset Police."

A 28-year-old woman and a 32-year-old man, both from Poole, have been arrested on suspicion of handling stolen goods and have been released under investigation.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170156209. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
