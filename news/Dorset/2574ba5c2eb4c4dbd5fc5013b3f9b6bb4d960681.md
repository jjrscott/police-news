Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a fatal collision in Bridport.

The incident occurred at around 3.55pm today, Saturday 8 April 2017, in Sea Road North and involved a blue Honda motorcycle and a green Skoda Octavia.

Sadly the rider of the motorcycle - a 50-year-old man from Martock in Somerset - died at the scene. His next of kin have been informed and the coroner notified.

The driver of the car, a 71-year-old man and his 63-year-old female passenger - both from South Petherton in Somerset - were uninjured.

Sea Road North was closed between the Esso roundabout and St Andrews Road while collision investigators examined the scene. It re-opened at 8.45pm.

Police Sergeant Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or saw the manner of driving of either vehicle immediately prior to the incident to please contact Dorset Police.

"We close roads following serious injury and fatal collisions to enable us to carry out our examinations fully and professionally. I would like to thank the public for their patience while these were in place."
