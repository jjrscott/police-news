A man has been arrested in connection with an alleged criminal damage incident in Bournemouth.

At around 1.15am on Thursday 17 May 2018 it was reported that a man had caused damage to the front door of Noble House in Yelverton Road by kicking the lower section, causing the glass in the top section to crack.

A 33-year-old Bournemouth man has now been arrested on suspicion of attempted burglary and has been released under investigation as officers continue their enquiries.
