# Man to appear in court in connection with fatal road traffic collision in Christchurch

02 March 2018

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with a fatal road traffic collision in Christchurch.

At around 2.30pm on Friday 13 October 2017 Dorset Police received a report of a collision involving a silver BMW, a parked car and a pedestrian on Mudeford.

Sadly, the pedestrian - an 85-year-old woman from the Christchurch area - was pronounced dead at the scene.

A 93-year-old man from Barnet in Hertfordshire has been issued with a postal requisition to appear before Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 9 March 2018 for an offence of causing death by careless driving.
