# Witness appeal following assault in Bournemouth

06 November 2017

* * *

Officers investigating an assault in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward.

Just after midnight on Sunday 29 October 2017 a 20-year-old Bournemouth man was walking from Holdenhurst Road into Christchurch Road when he passed a group of about six people aged between 19 and 20 years old.

A short time later a male member of this group started following the victim and verbally abused him before punching him to the left side of the face. The victim tried to defend himself and in doing so they both fell to the ground before he was kicked by the offender and possibly other members of the group.

The victim was then also punched by a female member of the group before he managed to walk away toward St Swithun's Road.

The main offender was described as white, about five feet nine inches tall, of medium build and with short light brown hair. He was clean shaven, wore a grey zip-up hooded top, dark coloured jeans and black shoes or boots.

The female offender was white, five feet five inches tall, of medium build and with short black hair. She was wearing a black hooded top and black skinny jeans.

Police Constable Sarah Hollosi, of North Bournemouth police, said: "This was a callous attack by a group on a lone man. The victim does not know his attackers and was left with a black swollen eye, bruising and cuts.

"I am appealing for any witnesses to the incident, anyone with information about those responsible or anyone who saw a group as described in the area at the time to come forward to help with our investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170168852. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org
