# Update following alleged kidnap in Poole

28 January 2021

* * *

Two people arrested in connection with an alleged kidnapping incident in Poole have been released from the investigation without charge.

The allegation related to an incident that occurred at around 4.30pm on Thursday 15 October 2020 in the area of the Branksome Recreation Ground. It was reported that a 12-year-old boy was forced to enter a vehicle and driven to an address in order to apologise for a criminal damage he was believed to have caused the previous day.

The boy was not injured during the incident.

Following enquiries, a 30-year-old man and 16-year-old boy, both from Poole, were arrested on suspicion of kidnap. A 32-year-old man also from Poole voluntarily attended for interview in relation to the incident. They were all released under investigation pending further enquiries.

All three men have now been released from the investigation without charge.

Detectives are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.
