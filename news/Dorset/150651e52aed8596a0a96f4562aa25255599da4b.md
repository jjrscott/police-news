# Witness appeal after religiously aggravated incident in Bournemouth

16 August 2016

* * *

Police in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information following a religiously aggravated incident toward a couple in Boscombe.

The incident happened at around 8pm on Sunday 14 August 2016 on the 1C Yellow Bus that was driving along Centenary Way.

The victims, a 29-year-old man and 28-year-old woman who both live locally, were sat on the bottom deck of the bus when a man got on in the Fisherman's Walk area of Southbourne Grove.

The man stared at the couple before shouting religiously aggravated abuse at them. The offender then went up to the top deck of the bus, but could be heard continuing to shout the abuse.

The offender is described as white, aged in his 40s, around five feet eleven inches tall and had short hair. He was wearing blue jeans and a dirty white or beige T-shirt.

Boscombe Deputy Neighbourhood Inspector Matt Chutter said: "Racially and religiously motivated crimes such as this are completely unacceptable and we have launched a full investigation in order to identify the offender.

"I am urging anyone who was on the bus at the time of the incident and witnessed the altercation or who is able to identify the offender from the description to please contact Dorset Police immediately.

"The Neighbourhood Policing Team will continue to patrol the area to offer reassurances to the community and I would encourage anyone with concerns to come and speak to the team."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 15:214. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
