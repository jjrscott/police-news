# Update â€“ appeal following reported road rage incident in Bournemouth

14 March 2019

* * *

Two people have come forward following an appeal in relation to a reported road rage incident in Bournemouth.

The incident began at around 1.30am on Thursday 21 February 2019 at the Somerford roundabout in Christchurch and involved a taxi driver who was reportedly followed by two people in an Audi TT.

It was reported that after the taxi had stopped at traffic lights near the Hilton Hotel in Exeter Road, the occupants of the Audi TT got out and punched and kicked the driver's door and window and smashed the windscreen.

Following an image appeal issued by police, a 17-year-old boy and 24-year-old man, both from Lymington in Hampshire, have come forward and are assisting officers with their enquiries. No arrests have been made at this stage.
