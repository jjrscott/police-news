# Update â€“ reported exposure incident in Purbeck

29 January 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a reported exposure incident in Purbeck have spoken to the man involved and believe no offences were committed.

At around 4.15pm on Friday 4 January 2019 a local woman aged in her 50s was walking in Rempstone Forest, Corfe Castle, when a man approached her in the opposite direction wearing nothing apart from a purple Santa hat, a beige rucksack and shoes. He said hello and continued walking. A second woman also reported that she had seen the naked man in the same area on the same day.

Police Sergeant Carmel Ryan, of Dorset Police, said: "Following our media appeal the man involved has contacted Dorset Police and has been spoken to. I am now confident that no offences were committed. The man and women involved have been updated."
