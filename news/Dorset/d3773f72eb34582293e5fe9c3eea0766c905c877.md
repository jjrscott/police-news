* * *

Detectives have made further arrests in relation to an alleged assault at an address in Christchurch.

Dorset Police was called at 12.04pm on Wednesday 3 February 2021 to reports of a disturbance at an address in Somerford Road.

It was reported that a group of men armed with weapons arrived in vehicles at the address and a man aged in his 20s was assaulted. He was taken to hospital with injuries, which are not life-threatening.

Following enquiries, two 21-year-old men from Bournemouth have now been arrested on suspicion of violent disorder and one of them has also been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage.

Previously, a 42-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of conspiring to cause grievous bodily harm with intent and a 49-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of violent disorder. Both are from Bournemouth.

All four individuals are still assisting officers with their enquiries.

A 70-year-old Bournemouth man who had been arrested on suspicion of violent disorder has been released under investigation.

Detective Inspector Mark Jenkins, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We are continuing with our investigation and are still carrying out a number of enquiries.

"I am still appealing to anyone who was in the area at the time and either witnessed what happened or saw vehicles or a group of men in Somerford Road to please contact Dorset Police.

"We are aware that members of the public may have filmed part of the incident on their mobile phones and I would ask these individuals, or any motorists or residents who may have captured anything relevant on dashcam or home CCTV, to please get in touch.

"If anyone has any concerns, please be reassured that officers from the local neighbourhood policing team can be approached with any community concerns."
