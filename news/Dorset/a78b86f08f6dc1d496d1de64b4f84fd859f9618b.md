# Dorset Police flies to new heights to tackle burglary

25 July 2018

* * *

Dorset Police flies to new heights in a bid to raise awareness of how to prevent becoming a victim of burglary.

A week of action is underway, which began on Monday 23 July and is running until Sunday 29 July 2018, reminding people to secure their homes this summer.

As part of daily patrols, neighbourhood policing teams across the county have been distributing paper airplanes through doors and windows of insecure properties.

The paper airplanes contain advice on securing properties and information on how to find out some simple steps to prevent an opportunistic burglar entering your home.

When neighbourhood policing teams spot an open door or window, they will be attempting to contact the homeowner and offer advice and crime prevention tips.

Over a three month period from 1 June 2017 to 31 August 2017 a total of 431 residential burglaries were reported in Dorset. In comparison, during three winter months between December 2017 and February 2018 a total of 361 burglaries were reported.

Detective Inspector Neil Wright, of the priority crime team, said: "During the warmer evenings, more people tend to leave windows and doors open and enjoy their back gardens out of sight of the front of their properties.

"We have launched this new initiative to raise awareness of simple steps the public can take to prevent a burglary. If your home looks insecure to you, it will look insecure to a burglar.

"Remember to always lock your doors and windows wherever possible. Don't give burglars the opportunity to gain access to your property.

"If you are going away, let your neighbours know and ask them to keep an eye on your property or park their car on your drive to give the impression your property is occupied. Also, be sure to cancel any regular deliveries such as milk or newspapers."
