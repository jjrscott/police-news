# Update â€“ reported dog bite incident in Southbourne

04 January 2021

* * *

The owner of a dog that allegedly bit a woman in Southbourne has been identified following a witness appeal.

At around 7am on Wednesday 9 December 2020 the victim was running with a friend along the beach near to the Bistro on the Beach restaurant when she approached an elderly woman who was with a small dog on a lead.

They became aware that a second dog, which was wearing a high-visibility coat with writing on it, had begun attacking the elderly woman's dog.

She called out to the victim and her friend to help. It is reported that as she attempted to pull the dogs apart, the victim - a local woman aged in her 30s - sustained an injury to her hand.

The owner of the dog - a local woman aged in her 40s - has now been identified and is assisting officers with their enquiries. No arrests have been made.
