# Appeal for information following reported robbery in Bournemouth

18 January 2021

* * *

Officers investigating a reported robbery in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police received a report that at around 1.10pm on Friday 15 January 2021 a robbery occurred on a footpath that leads from Harewood Avenue to the Littledown Estate.

It was reported that a 17-year-old boy was approached by three people, threatened with a knife and his bicycle stolen. The three suspects reportedly made off in the direction of Sevenoaks Drive.

Officers attended and carried out searches of the area. A 15-year-old boy and an 18-year-old man, both from Bournemouth, were arrested on suspicion of robbery and have been released on police bail.

Enquiries to identify a third suspect are ongoing.

Police Constable Chris Raspini, of Dorset Police's Priority Crime Team, said: "We are continuing to investigate this robbery and I am appealing for any witnesses, or anyone with information that might assist our enquiries, to please come forward.

"I am particularly keen to speak to two women - a woman with black hair who was walking her dog in the area and a blonde woman - who the victim spoke to after the incident."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210010929. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
