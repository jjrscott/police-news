# Attempted robbery in Weymouth - witness appeal

03 April 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses following an attempted street robbery in Weymouth.

The incident happened at around 6.50am on Sunday 1 April 2018 on Dorchester Road at the junction of Carlton Road South.

The victim - a local man aged in his 20s - was approached by a man who demanded he emptied his pockets.

The victim refused before he was punched in the face causing him to fall to the ground. He was then punched and kicked again and when he tried to stand up he was pushed into the road before the offender made off. He sustained cuts and grazes, but did not require medical treatment.

A search of the area was carried out shortly after the incident, with assistance from the dog unit, but the offender was not located.

The offender is described as white, around five feet eleven inches tall and of medium build. He was wearing a grey hooded top and blue jeans.

Detective Constable Siobhan Lovering, of Weymouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the incident or who has any information about the offender to please come forward.

"In particular, I believe there may have been a motorcycle rider who went past at the time that may have witnessed what happened and could assist with my investigation."
