# Witness appeal following fail-to-stop collision in Weymouth

11 February 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a fail-to-stop collision in Weymouth.

At 4pm on Tuesday 29 January 2019 a collision occurred on Queen Street involving a Sym Jet4 moped and an unknown 4x4.

The moped was travelling along Queen Street toward King Street when the rider was knocked off by a car, described as a green Mitsubishi Shogun. The driver of the car reversed, drove around the rider, continued along Stanley Street and turned right into Crescent Street.

The rider of the moped, a 17-year-old local girl, sustained cuts and bruises and concussion. Her moped was also damaged.

Police Constable Don Duchscherer, of Weymouth police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the Queen Street area at 4pm on Tuesday 29 January 2019 and either witnessed the collision or saw a 4x4 being driven in the area to please contact me.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who has seen a green Mitsubishi Shogun or similar that has recently sustained damage in unusual circumstances."
