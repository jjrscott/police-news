# Commercial burglary near Dorchester â€“ witnesses sought

19 April 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a commercial burglary near Dorchester are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At 10.39pm on Sunday 14 April 2019 a security alarm was activated at OHE Horticultural Limited on the A352 Wareham Road between Broadmayne and Wool as intruders had gained access to the property.

Officers attended, searched the area and some items of garden machinery were located outside the property. No arrests were made.

Police Constable Simon Rogers, of Dorchester police, said: "It is believed that the offenders were disturbed.

"At this time it is not clear if any items were stolen as a stock take needs to be carried out. If anything was taken, they would been Stihl or Honda items.

"An investigation is underway and we have been able to get a description of one of the offenders. He is white and was wearing a dark Nike hooded top and lighter coloured tracksuit bottoms.

"I am appealing for any witnesses to suspicious activity in the area at the relevant time, or anyone with information about those responsible, to contact us as soon as possible.

"Also, I would like to hear from anyone who has been offered Stihl or Honda items for sale in unusual circumstances."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190056379. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
