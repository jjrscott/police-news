# Witness appeal following fatal road traffic collision near Weymouth

08 December 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a fatal road traffic collision near Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

Dorset Police received a report at 5.38pm on Sunday 8 December 2019 of a collision on the B3157 Coast Road on Bramdon Lane between Chickerell and Portesham involving a black Triumph motorcycle and a green Daihatsu 4x4.

Emergency services attended and the motorcyclist, a man aged in his 20s from Stroud in Gloucestershire, was treated for serious injuries. Very sadly he was pronounced dead at the scene. His family has been informed and is being supported by specially-trained officers.

The two occupants of the Daihatsu was taken to hospital for treatment to minor injuries.

Road closures were put in place to allow the emergency services to respond to the incident and for an examination of the scene to be carried out.

Sergeant Mark Scammell, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the family of the motorcyclist at this time and we are carrying out a full investigation to establish the exact circumstances of this collision.

"I am appealing to any witnesses who have not already spoken to police to contact us. I would also urge anyone who was driving in the area at the time with dashcam to check their footage to see if they may have captured the collision or the manner of driving of the vehicles involved prior to it.

"Finally, I would like to thank members of the public for their patience and understanding while the road closures were in place. These are necessary to allow the emergency services to respond to the incident safely and for a detailed examination of the collision scene."
