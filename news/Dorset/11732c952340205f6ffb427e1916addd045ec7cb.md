# Witness appeal following criminal damage and arson in Christchurch

22 March 2021

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following criminal damage incidents and arson in Christchurch.

The four incidents occurred during the evening of Saturday 20 March 2021 in the Burton area of Christchurch.

At around 7.35pm on Saturday 20 March 2021 Dorset Police received a report that damage had been caused to a vehicle that was parked on Martins Hill Lane in Christchurch. It is reported that a rock was found inside the vehicle. Damage was caused to the front and rear windscreens, as well as a side window.

A short time later at around 8.10pm it is reported that an object was thrown through the window of a property in Martins Hill Lane.

Shortly afterwards, another vehicle that was parked on Martins Hill Lane was found to be on fire.

A fourth incident was reported to Dorset Police at 9.13pm. It is believed that a fire was started deliberately at a property in Summers Lane.

During the evening, a white male teenager was seen in the vicinity acting suspiciously. He was wearing a hooded top and riding a bicycle.

Detective Constable Luke Davis, of Bournemouth CID, said: "These incidents have understandably caused concern and distress for residents and I would like to reassure everyone that a thorough investigation is underway.

"I am extremely thankful that nobody was injured during any of these incidents.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the area and witnessed any suspicious activity, or who recognises the male teenager from the description provided, to please get in touch.

"I would urge residents to please check their home CCTV systems between 7pm and 9.30pm on Saturday 20 March 2021 for any relevant footage to assist my enquiries.

"Officers will be carrying out increased patrols in the area and I would encourage anyone who has any concerns to please contact their local neighbourhood policing team."
