# Witness appeal following serious injury collision in Yeovil

13 January 2017

Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a serious injury collision in Yeovil.

At around 1.45pm on Monday 9 January 2017 a two vehicle road traffic collision occurred on the A30 at Babylon Hill, just before the Peel Centre retail park.

The collision involved a black BMW being driven by a man from Sherborne and a white Jinan Qingqi motorcycle.

The rider of the motorcycle, a local 28-year-old man, sustained serious but not life-threatening injuries and was taken to Yeovil Hospital. He was later transferred to Southmead Hospital in Bristol where he remains in a serious but stable condition receiving treatment to a fractured neck and back and a punctured lung.

The driver of the BMW was uninjured.

An investigation into the collision, which happened inside the Dorset border, is underway led by traffic officers from Dorset Police.

Police Constable Stu Smith, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or saw the manner of driving of either vehicle immediately before the incident to please contact Dorset Police."
