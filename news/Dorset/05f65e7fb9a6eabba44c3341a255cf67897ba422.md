# Witness appeal following fatal collision near Sherborne

11 August 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses after a fatal collision on the A352 near Sherborne.

Dorset Police was called at 4.58am on Saturday 11 August following reports of a collision between a blue Subaru Impreza and a black Volkswagen Golf at Holnest.

The driver of the Volkswagen - a man aged in his 20s from the Yeovil area - was sadly pronounced dead at the scene. His next of kin have been informed and the coroner notified.

A 49-year-old woman from Dorchester who was driving the Subaru was taken to Yeovil Hospital for treatment. Her injuries are not thought to be life-threatening.

The road is closed between Minterne Magna and Longburton to allow the emergency services to deal with the incident.

Police Sergeant Lee Savage, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or the driving of either vehicle prior to the incident to please contact Dorset Police. I'd also request anyone with relevant dashcam footage to get in touch.

"I wish to thank the public for their patience while the road closure is in place. This is necessary to allow emergency services to deal with the collision and for a full examination of the scene to take place."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at scit@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 11:86. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
