The family of a man who sadly died following a collision in West Dorset has issued a tribute.

Dorset Police received a report at 2.03pm on Sunday 1 September 2019 of a collision involving a silver Honda motorcycle travelling east and a black BMW 1 Series travelling in the opposite direction between Abbotsbury and Swyre, near to the junction with Clay Lane.

The motorcyclist, 47-year-old Ian Hateley from the Trowbridge area in Wiltshire, was airlifted to Southampton General Hospital with serious injuries. He sadly died in the early hours of Monday 2 September 2019.

Ian Hateley's family has now issued the following statement: "Ian Hateley, 47 years old, from near Trowbridge, Wiltshire, has sadly passed away following a road accident on 1st September 2019.

"He is already hugely missed as a son, father, brother, partner, nephew, uncle, cousin and friend.

"Ian was loved by all knew him and will be remembered as a very kind, talented, generous, genuine, funny and happy person, with an infectious smile and a cheeky twinkle in his eye.

"The family would like to express special thanks to all the attending emergency services, including the Dorset Air Ambulance, as well as the doctors and staff at Southampton General Hospital, and Dorset Police, especially the family liaison officers."
