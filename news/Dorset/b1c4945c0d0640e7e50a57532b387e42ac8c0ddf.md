# Appeal following sexual assault on woman in Bournemouth

15 October 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a sexual assault on a woman in Bournemouth are appealing for vital witnesses to come forward.

The incident occurred at around 2.15am on Sunday 13 October 2019 in Wellington Road, close to the junction with Milton Road.

The victim - a woman aged in her 20s - had left the Sound Circus nightclub on Holdenhurst Road and walked along past the Royal Mail depot and into Wellington Road toward Charminster.

At this point the victim became aware of footsteps behind her and that she was being followed by a man. She called her friend using her mobile phone in an attempt to stop him following her. However, as she reached the junction of Milton Road she was pushed from behind and fell into a hedge outside a house.

The offender then sexually assaulted her. He was scared off by a number of passing vehicles and ran away. The victim was found by members of the public, who helped to raise the alarm.

Police Constable Luke Arnold, of North Bournemouth police, said: "This was a very frightening incident for the victim and we are supporting her as our investigation continues.

"I am very keen to hear from members of the public who were in the area at the time. Were you driving along Wellington Road and either witnessed the incident or captured it on dashcam? Or did you see a man running away from the area? I would urge anyone with any information to please come forward as your information could be vital to my investigation.

"Members from the local neighbourhood team can be approached with any community concerns."
