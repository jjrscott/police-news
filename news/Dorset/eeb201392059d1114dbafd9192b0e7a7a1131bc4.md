Detectives investigating a reported indecent exposure incident in Bournemouth are appealing for any witnesses to contact them.

At 5.30pm on Sunday 31 March 2019 a woman was cycling alone through Horseshoe Common when she saw a man stood in the bushes. On seeing the victim it is reported he indecently exposed himself.

The victim, a local woman aged in her 20s, immediately stopped cycling and called the police.

Officers attended and carried out a search of the area.

A 58-year-old man from Bournemouth was arrested nearby on suspicion of exposure and has been released on police bail while enquiries continue.

Detective Sergeant Karen Penn, of Bournemouth CID, said: "The victim was left shaken following this incident and I would like to reassure members of the public that a full and thorough investigation is underway.

"I am keen to hear from anyone who was in the Horseshoe Common area at the relevant time on Sunday and saw a man acting suspiciously or was approached by a man in a similar manner.

"Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team are fully aware of this incident and will be carrying out regular visible patrols in this area."
