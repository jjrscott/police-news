# Witness appeal following suspicious incident in Bournemouth

25 May 2016

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a suspicious incident in Bournemouth which has left a man in an induced coma.

At around 10.10am on Saturday 21 May 2016 a man was walking along Fir Vale Road in the town centre with two other men.

As the group - who are all believed to be rough sleepers - approached Old Christchurch Road and Horseshoe Common, one man fell to the ground.

He sustained a fractured right eye socket, fractured skull and bruising on his brain. He was taken to Southampton General Hospital where he remains in a life-threatening condition.

The incident was reported to Dorset Police yesterday evening, Tuesday 24 May 2016.

Detective Sergeant Andy Haworth, of Bournemouth CID, said: "An investigation is now underway and we are conducting enquiries to establish exactly what happened on Saturday morning and how this man sustained his injuries.

"I would urge anyone who saw an altercation or disagreement between two or three men in the area of Fir Vale Road or Horseshoe Common during the relevant time to please call me urgently.

"Finally, I would urge the two men who were with the victim at the time of the incident to please come forward. I believe they may have vital information that will assist my investigation."

No arrests have been made.

Witnesses and anyone with information should call Dorset Police in confidence on 101 quoting incident number 24:354. Alternatively, call the free and anonymous Crimestoppers line on 0800 555 111 where mobile phone tariffs may apply.
