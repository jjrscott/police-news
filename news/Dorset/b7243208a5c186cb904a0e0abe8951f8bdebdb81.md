# Witness appeal following reported robbery in Bournemouth

09 January 2019

* * *

Detectives investigating a reported robbery in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

It was reported that at around 2.40am on Tuesday 8 January 2019 the victims, a woman aged in her 20s and a woman aged in her 50s, were approached by a man and two women in Palmerston Road who began shouting at them.

It is alleged that they then began pulling at the clothes of the younger woman before grabbing the older woman's handbag and kicking and punching her. They reportedly made off with the handbag, which contained the victim's blue purse, bank card and black Nokia phone.

The older woman suffered minor facial injuries as a result of the incident.

Officers attended and four people - two local women aged 28 and 41, a 39-year-old Bournemouth man and a 27-year-old man of no fixed abode - were arrested on suspicion of robbery. They have all been released under investigation as detectives continue their enquiries.

Detective Constable Jane Millard, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We have been carrying out a number of enquiries into this incident and I am appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information to contact us.

"We are also yet to speak to the younger woman who was reportedly a victim of the robbery and I would urge her to make contact with us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190003554. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
