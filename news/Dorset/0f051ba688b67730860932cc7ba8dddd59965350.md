# Dashcam footage appeal following road rage incident in Poole

25 September 2018

* * *

Officers investigating a road rage incident in Poole are appealing for witnesses and motorists with potential dashcam footage to come forward.

At approximately 11.20pm on Friday 14 September 2018 the victim was driving a silver Ford Fiesta from Tower Park to the Mountbatten Arms roundabout with three passengers when he realised he was in the wrong lane. He switched lanes and then noticed a BMW car following very closely behind him.

The victim slowed due to the lights of the BMW dazzling his vision. The driver of the BMW then overtook and forced the victim to stop in the road.

It is reported the offender got out of the car and, as the victim wound down his window, he shouted at the victim and punched him twice in the face. The victim, a 17-year-old boy from Wimborne, did not sustain any injuries.

Police Community Support Investigator Kate Hann, of Dorset Police, said: "We believe we have identified the driver however, I understand a number of motorists were unable to pass due to the incident and I would ask these people to please get in contact with me to assist with my investigation.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who was travelling in the area at the relevant time and has dashcam footage that may assist my enquiry.

"The victim in this case is a new driver and the incident has left him shaken and upset."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180149578. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
