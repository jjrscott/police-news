* * *

A man is due to appear in court charged in connection with an attempted theft at a Tesco store in Bournemouth.

It was reported that at around 12.30am on Monday 25 September 2017 a man entered the store on Riverside Avenue and selected a large amount of alcohol, which he placed into a trolley. When challenged by members of staff, the man produced a pair of scissors and threatened to stab them before making off without any of the goods. No one was injured in the incident.

A 52-year-old Bournemouth man has been charged with attempted theft, possessing a bladed article in a public place and using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause fear of or provoke unlawful violence. He is due to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 10 November 2017.
