Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a reported shooting incident in Blandford.

Dorset Police was called at 3.17pm on Sunday 9 August 2020 by the ambulance service to reports a woman had been shot with a BB gun as she was getting out of her car on Langton Road.

The victim, a woman aged in her 30s, was taken to hospital for treatment, which subsequently established she had been shot in the upper arm with an air weapon. Her injuries are described as serious but not life-threatening.

A search of the area was carried out by armed officers and a 52-year-old local man was arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and is assisting officers with their enquiries.

Detective Sergeant Jeremy Cuff, of Weymouth CID, said: "A full investigation is underway into this incident.

"I am appealing to anyone who either witnessed the incident, saw anything suspicious in the period leading up to it taking place or captured relevant footage on mobile phones or dashcam to please contact Dorset Police."
