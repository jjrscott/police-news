Detectives investigating a report of an attempted sexual assault in Bournemouth are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

Officers would also like to speak to anyone who may have encountered the suspect on the night in question when out socialising in Bournemouth town centre.

An investigation was launched following a report that a man had tried to kiss a 19-year-old woman and enter a house with her in the Bearwood area in the early hours of Wednesday 14 June 2017.

The alleged offender had met the woman and her friend in Horseshoe Common and Old Christchurch Road earlier that evening.

Detective Constable Christian Bryant, of Dorset Police's Priority Crime Team, said: "Officers have carried out a number of enquiries in relation to this allegation and we would appeal for anyone with any information that can assist our investigation to contact us.

"We are keen to hear from any women who may have been approached by a black man wearing denim shorts and a denim shirt between 2am and 4am on Wednesday 14 June 2017 in the area of Horseshoe Common and Old Christchurch Road."

A 24-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of attempted sexual assault and has been released under investigation.
