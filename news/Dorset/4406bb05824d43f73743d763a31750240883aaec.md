# Update â€“ reported theft of cash from store in Bournemouth

20 September 2019

* * *

A man has come forward in relation to a reported theft by finding incident in Bournemouth.

Between 1.30pm and 1.50pm on Saturday 10 August 2019 the victim, a local man aged in his 40s, had used a self-service till at Asda off St Pauls Road to pay for items and request cashback. However, he became distracted and forgot to collect the cash or his receipt.

He returned around 15 minutes later to discover the cash and receipt had gone.

Following a CCTV appeal to identify a man officers wanted to speak to, a 22-year-old Christchurch man has come forward and is assisting officers with their enquiries.
