# Witness appeal following assault in Christchurch

14 September 2020

* * *

Officers investigating an assault in Christchurch are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 10.45am on Thursday 10 September 2020 it was reported that a local woman aged in her 20s was walking her dog on the field near to the cricket pitch at Stanpit Marsh when it approached a white Westie-type dog.

The male owner of the dog shouted to the woman to get her dog away, before allegedly kicking the victim's dog. The man approached the victim and it is reported that he punched her in the face.

The victim sustained bruising and mild concussion and attended hospital for treatment.

The man is described as white, aged in his late 60s or early 70s and around five feet eight inches tall with a large stomach, short white hair and stubble. He was described as wearing white trousers and a maroon-coloured top that was rolled up at the sleeves.

Police Constable Matthew Budd, of Christchurch police, said: "This incident - which occurred in front of her young child - has left the victim feeling very distressed and I am appealing to anyone who was in the area and witnessed what happened to please get in touch.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who recognises the man and his dog from the description given."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200136126. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
