# Witness appeal following serious assault in Weymouth

27 March 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a serious assault on a man in Weymouth.

At around 9pm yesterday, Monday 26 March 2018, a serious assault occurred on the Rodwell Trail.

The victim - a 27-year-old local man - was found on the Marsh playing fields near to the athletics track on Knightsbridge Road having sustained serious head injuries. He was taken to hospital for treatment. His condition is described as serious but not life-threatening.

The offenders are said to have spoken in a Liverpudlian accent.

A full investigation is underway to locate the offenders and detectives are carrying out house-to-house enquiries and looking for relevant CCTV or dashcam footage.

Detective Constable Rich Evans, of Weymouth CID, said: "The victim was subjected to a violent assault and I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or has any information about who was responsible to please contact Dorset Police.

"The Rodwell Trail is popular with dog walkers and cyclists and I would ask anyone who was in the area at the relevant time to please come forward.

"We appreciate that this is the second offence to have occurred in the Rodwell Trail area in recent days and officers from the local neighbourhood policing team will be carrying out high-visibility patrols to reassure the community and can be approached with any concerns. The two incidents are not linked."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk, or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180045435. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
