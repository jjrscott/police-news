28 June 2019

* * *

Officers investigating an assault on a man in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At 9.45am on Friday 21 June 2019 the victim - a local man aged in his 50s - was driving along Wyke Road in his van when he was approached by another man that he knew.

It is reported the offender became irate and he began shouting and swearing at the victim before he punched the victim a number of times in the head through an open window.

Officers have carried out CCTV and house-to-house enquiries. No arrests have been made.

Police Constable Kim Williams, of Weymouth police, said: "We are aware that a woman walked past the incident and there were a number of motorists in the area at the time. I would urge these people to please contact Dorset Police with any information they may have.

"I am also keen to hear from any motorists who were travelling along that road at the time and may have captured something of relevance on their dashcam."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk, or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190095618. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
