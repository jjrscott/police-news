# UPDATE: Witness appeal following reported sexual assault in Poole

27 January 2017

* * *

A man arrested in connection with a reported sexual assault in Poole has been released on police bail.

At around 3.55pm on Wednesday 25 January 2017 officers were called to Jellicoe Close off Constitution Hill following reports a man approached a woman and forcibly persuaded her to get into a white van. It was reported that once inside the van the man sexually assaulted her.

The woman - aged in her 40s - got out of the van and left. She was not physically injured. The van, which had ladders on the back, was found nearby.

A 43-year-old man from Christchurch was arrested on suspicion of sexual assault and has been released on police bail until mid-February 2017 pending further enquiries.

Officers from the local Neighbourhood Policing Team will be carrying out high visibility patrols in the area to reassure the community.

Detective Sergeant Karen Penn, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I would urge anyone who has been approached by a man in unusual circumstances in the area to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident or who saw a similar van driving in the area in recent weeks."
