A 41-year-old Bournemouth man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and aggravated burglary. A 44-year-old Bournemouth man and a 40-year-old Bournemouth woman have been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder and conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary. All three people are currently being questioned by detectives.
