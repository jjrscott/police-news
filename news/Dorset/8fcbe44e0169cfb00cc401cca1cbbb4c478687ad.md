# Large rock fall reported at West Bay

16 August 2016

* * *

A large rock fall has occurred at West Bay this evening, Tuesday 16 August 2016.

The rock fall happened at the East Cliff side of West Bay at around 7.40pm today.

Police, along with colleagues from the ambulance, coastguard, fire service and the local authorities are currently carrying out a multi-agency response.

At this stage it is not believed anyone is trapped following the fall.

Ongoing assessments will be made by the local authority geological experts.

A cordon has been put in place and the coast path is currently closed from the east side of West Bay up to Burton Bradstock.

Chief Inspector Steve White, of Dorset Police, said: "Although at this stage it is not thought anyone has been trapped by the fall I would appeal to the public that In the unlikely event that you are aware of someone who has not returned home from West Bay this evening, please report the details to the police urgently via 999.

"We would like to remind people that the cliffs remain unstable and it is possible further rock falls could occur. We urge the public to obey warning signs, not to stand near the edge of cliffs or stand directly underneath them. Landslides and rock falls can happen at any time and without warning."
