A 42-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm. All three men are from Blandford and are currently assisting officers with enquiries.

Detective Inspector Andrea Power, of Weymouth CID, said: "A full and detailed investigation is now underway to establish the circumstances around this incident.

"I am appealing for any witnesses, or anyone with information who has not yet spoken to police, to please get in touch with us urgently.

"A cordon is currently in place while investigations are ongoing and officers from the neighbourhood policing team continue to conduct house-to-house enquiries and can be contacted with any concerns."
