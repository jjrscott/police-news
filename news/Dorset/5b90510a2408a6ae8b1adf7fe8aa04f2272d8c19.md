# Witness appeal following arson at a boatyard in Weymouth

22 November 2017

* * *

Officers investigating a fire at a boatyard in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At around 7.20pm on Thursday 16 November 2017 Dorset Police was called to reports of a fire at a boatyard on Ferrybridge Way.

The fire, which is believed to have been started deliberately sometime between 7pm and 7.15pm that evening, spread to four boats and caused considerable damage.

Police Constable Matthew Love, of Weymouth police, said: "As part of this investigation we have been carrying out local enquiries, including a trawl of CCTV, in a bid to trace the person or people responsible.

"We believe the offender or offenders gained access to the yard over a perimeter fence and we believe they may have been seen leaving the scene via Preston Beach Road. I would ask anyone who was in the area at the relevant time and who saw someone acting suspiciously to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would also like to hear from any motorists who were travelling in the area with dashcams and believe they may have footage which could assist my investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170179013. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
