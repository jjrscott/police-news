# Witness appeal after thefts in Bridport

04 July 2017

* * *

Officers investigating a series of thefts and attempted thefts from handbags in Bridport are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

A number of incidents were reported in the town last week, which officers believe involved the same two offenders.

Shortly before 3pm on Wednesday 28 June 2017 a woman aged in her 50s had her purse stolen while she was in the Cancer Research UK charity shop in East Street. It was reported that a man and woman had bumped into her while she was in the shop and the victim later realised that her purse had been taken from her bag.

A further three incidents were reported on Thursday 29 June 2017.

At around 1.15pm a woman aged in her 70s was approached by a man and woman on West Allington. The man reportedly distracted the victim by asking for directions and when the victim got home she found her purse and house keys had been taken from her bag.

At around 2.10pm a woman aged in her 90s was outside Boots in West Street when she was approached by a man and woman. Again the man distracted her while the woman attempted to get into the victim's handbag but she was able to push her off and nothing was taken.

At around 2.50pm a woman aged in her 80s was in the long stay section of the East Street car park when a man and woman approached her and asked how to get to Luton Airport. The woman reportedly tried to get in the victim's handbag but she used her walking stick to push her off and quickly got into her car. Nothing was taken on this occasion.

The man is described as white, around 40 years old and short and was wearing a flat cap. The woman is also said to be white, around 40 years old and short, with long dark hair and was wearing dark-rimmed glass. Both suspects reportedly had foreign accents.

Police Constable Brian Puttock, of Bridport police, said: "I am appealing for anyone who may have witnessed these incidents to contact police.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who witnessed a man and woman matching the descriptions given in the relevant areas around the time of the offences or any business that might have any CCTV footage capturing these incidents.

"Anyone who may have experienced similar incidents in and around the town is also urged to get in touch.

"We regularly issue advice crime prevention advice to residents encouraging them to be vigilant with their handbags and to keep them zipped up and closed at all times.

"Other advice includes avoid carrying valuables or large amounts of cash in your handbags and never carry your PIN on you, especially in your purse."
