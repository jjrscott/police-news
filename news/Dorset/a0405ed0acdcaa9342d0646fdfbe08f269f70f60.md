# Witness appeal after alleged road rage incident near Dorchester

09 March 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for information after an alleged road rage incident on the A35 near Dorchester.

The incident happened at around 12.25pm on Wednesday 7 March 2018 between Stinsford roundabout and the Stadium roundabout.

It was reported that a black Audi A3 forced a Volkswagen Fox to stop, before a man got out of the Audi, smashed the window of the other car and then allegedly punched the victim - an 18-year-old man from Blandford - a number of times.

Police Constable Susan Tagg, of Weymouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who was driving along the A35 at the relevant time and either saw an Audi A3 being driven in a noticeable way, or may have been travelling on the A35 and captured all or part of the incident on dashcam."

A 24-year-old man from Portland was arrested on suspicion of assault and driving offences and has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 7:210. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 55511 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
