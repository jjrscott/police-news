21 June 2017

* * *

A woman is due to appear in court charged in connection with a fatal road traffic collision in Ferndown.

At 2.35pm on Saturday 28 January 2017 a collision occurred on Victoria Road near to the junction with Westwood Avenue involving a white Renault Clio and a white Kawasaki motorcycle.

The motorcyclist - a 67-year-old Wimborne man - was treated at the scene by police officers and paramedics and the air ambulance was requested, but he was sadly pronounced dead a short time later.

A 24-year-old Ferndown woman has been issued with a postal requisition to appear before Poole Magistrates' Court on Monday 3 July 2017 charged with causing death by careless driving.
