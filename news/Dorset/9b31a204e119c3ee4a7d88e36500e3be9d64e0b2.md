# Witness appeal following suspicious activity in West Dorset

29 October 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following suspicious activity in West Dorset.

It is reported that at around 10.50pm on Saturday 24 October 2020 two men were spotted acting suspiciously near a kennel on a farm in the Hilfield area.

When the men were disturbed, they got into a Land Rover Discovery that was waiting nearby and drove off toward the Sherborne area.

Police Constable Sebastian Haggett, of Dorset Police's Rural Crime Team, said: "We believe the men were attempting to steal working dogs that are kept in the kennels.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed any activity in the area on the night of the incident to please get in touch.

"I would also like to remind the community to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to Dorset Police."

If you have kennels and wish to have police conduct a crime prevention survey at your address, please email ruralcrimeteam@dorset.pnn.police.uk with your details.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200160678. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
