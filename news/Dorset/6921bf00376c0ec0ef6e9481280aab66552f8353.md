Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a man was seen acting suspiciously in Dorchester town centre.

At approximately 11.30pm on Tuesday 10 September 2019 a local woman aged in her 40s was walking home from Brewery Square along Weymouth Avenue, Edward Road and Queen's Avenue.

The woman reported that a small white Enterprise rental van had followed her journey. When she reached Queen's Avenue she turned around and saw the driver of the van was stood outside his vehicle looking at her.

Concerned, the woman flagged down the driver of a second passing vehicle and told him what had happened. He drove the woman home.

The man did not approach the woman or speak to her at any point during the incident. He was described as wearing a black jumper with a logo on the back.

Police Constable Andrea Watson, of Dorchester police, said: "We are making enquiries to establish who the driver of the van and the second passing vehicle are.

"While the man's intentions are not clear at this stage, I am keen to identity him and find out what he was doing in the area.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed a white van acting suspiciously, or captured it on dashcam, at the relevant time to get in touch."
