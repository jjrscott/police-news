# Update â€“ appeal following alleged assault in Poole

31 August 2017

A man arrested in connection with an alleged assault in Poole has been released without charge.

An investigation was launched following an incident outside Munchies in the High Street at 2.19am on Saturday 26 August 2017.

A 22-year-old Poole man suffered a serious head injury and was taken to hospital.

A 19-year-old man from Ferndown was arrested on suspicion of assault but has now been released without charge.

A CCTV appeal featuring images of a number of people officers wanted to speak to in connection with the incident was issued and, following information received from members of the public, they have been identified. Three men have now attended voluntarily for interviews and have been released under investigation.

Detective Constable Chris Waters, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We would like to thank all of the members of the public who responded to our appeal."
