# Dorset schools recognised for their commitment to road safety education

18 September 2019

* * *

Primary and secondary schools across Dorset have received either a bronze, silver or gold award for their work in partnership with Dorset Road Safe to educate students about road safety.

In the primary schools category, Heathlands Primary School received the gold award, with Christ the King Catholic School receiving the silver award and Cranborne Church of England Voluntary Aided First School receiving bronze.

The gold award in the secondary schools category was awarded to both Poole High School and Twynham School. Silver was awarded to Woodroffe School and Corfe Hills School took away the bronze award.

The awards were held at Kingston Maurward College and attended by the High Sheriff Philip Warr, Dorset Police Assistant Chief Constable Julie Fielding, representatives of the Dorset Road Safe Partnership as well as schools from across Dorset.

Recipients were recognised for their interaction with the Dorset Road Safety Partnership by facility road safety education in schools by Dorset Police, BCP Council, Dorset Council, Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue and the Safewise charity.

Paul Gray, Headteacher at Poole High School said: “Following the success of our annual Road Safety Day, we are delighted to have been recognised as a school that provides the Gold Standard in Road Safety Education in Dorset.

“This event has formed an extension of our pastoral curriculum for the last 7 years and is integral to the safety of our young drivers and road users.

“We would like to thank all of the organisations involved with delivering this event, and are looking forward to hosting our next event in October.”

Assistant Chief Constable, Julie Fielding, Chair of the Dorset Road Safety Partnership said: “It is really important for us to recognise those schools who are actively engaging in road safety education.

“Last year, 16 people were killed and a further 277 were seriously injured on our roads, and while this figure has reduced by 30 per cent since 2012, we must do all we can to protect all road users.

“I would like to thank those schools who are actively working with the partnership and welcome conversations with schools who are looking to improve their education inputs with young people around road safety.”
