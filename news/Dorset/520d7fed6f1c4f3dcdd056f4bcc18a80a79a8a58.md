# Renewed appeal after woman found injured in Gillingham

09 June 2020

* * *

Detectives are renewing their appeal for information in relation to an incident where a woman was found injured in Gillingham and have identified potential witnesses they would like to speak to.

Dorset Police received a report at 12.05am on Saturday 30 May 2020 that a woman had been found with a head injury in the area of Addison Close. She was taken to hospital for treatment and has since been discharged.

Following enquiries, a 33-year-old local man was arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He has been released on police bail.

Detective Constable George Graham, of Weymouth CID, said: "We are continuing to make enquiries to establish how the woman came to be injured and from these we have identified that there was a cyclist and a van that were seen in the area between around 11.45pm and 11.50pm on Friday 29 May 2020.

"The cyclist, who had lights on their bicycle, was travelling along New Road away from the town centre and turned left into Addision Close.

"The white panel van with black and yellow writing on the side was travelling along New Road toward the town centre.

"I am interested in identifying and speaking to the cyclist and occupants of the van as they may have information that can assist our investigation. I would like to stress that they are being sought purely as potential witnesses and to see if they may have any dashcam footage or similar that could be relevant.
"Our investigation is continuing and I would appeal to anyone else with information about this incident who has not already spoken to police to please come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200076447. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
