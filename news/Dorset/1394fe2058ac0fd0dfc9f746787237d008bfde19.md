# Witness appeal following attempted robbery in Bournemouth

12 December 2016

* * *

Detectives in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following an attempted robbery in Bournemouth.

It was reported that at around 9.30pm on Tuesday 6 December 2016 a local man and woman sat in a parked car on Iddesleigh Road.

The female passenger attempted to leave the vehicle when she was approached by two men demanding that she hand over her mobile phone.

The driver - a man aged in his 60s - got out of the vehicle to confront the two men. He was hit on the back of the head by an unknown item causing him to fall to the floor where he was then kicked twice.

The offenders attempted to take items out of the male victim's pockets but nothing was stolen. He sustained minor injuries which were treated at the scene.

The first offender is described as white, tall and aged in his 30s. He had light brown hair worn in a centre parting.

The second offender is described as white, aged in his 30s and of average height. He was described as having short dark hair and no teeth. He was wearing a black coat with red trim.

Detective Constable Mark Richardson, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or has any information that could assist with my investigation to come forward.

"I would particularly like to hear from a female member of the public who intervened during the incident causing the offenders to leave the scene.

"I would also ask that anyone who saw two men matching the description acting suspiciously in the area at the time to please contact police."
