Detectives investigating a sexual assault in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward.

The incident was reported to police just after 9pm on Saturday 21 October 2017.

The victim - a local woman aged in her 30s - reports that she was sexually assaulted by a man in a field off Yeomans Way. She was taken to hospital for treatment following the incident.

A cordon was in place while officers and crime scene investigators examined the scene.

Detective Inspector Andy Bell, of Bournemouth CID, said: "An investigation is now underway with house-to-house enquiries being conducted and specially-trained officers supporting the victim.

"We do not currently have a description of the offender but I would appeal to anyone who was in the Yeomans Way area at the time and saw or heard anything suspicious to please contact Dorset Police."

Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team will be carrying out high-visibility patrols in the coming days to reassure the community and can be approached with any concerns.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 21:401. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
