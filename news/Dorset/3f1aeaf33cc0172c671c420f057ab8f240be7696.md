# Appeal for information following reported robbery in Bournemouth

16 July 2020

* * *

Officers investigating the reported robbery of two teenage boys in Bournemouth are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

The incident occurred by Throop Weir at around 10pm on Friday 3 July 2020. Two 13-year-old boys were riding their bikes when they were approached by two male teenagers and a female teenager.

They reportedly threatened to 'shank' the boys if they did not hand over their bikes. No weapon was seen.

It was reported that the boys gave them their bikes and the group of three rode off, with the female teenager and one of the male teenagers riding on the same bike.

Following enquiries, a 15-year-old Bournemouth boy has been arrested and released under investigation. A second 15-year-old Bournemouth boy was also arrested but was released without charge.

Police Constable Graeme Johnston, of Dorset Police's Priority Crime Team, said: "We are continuing to investigate this matter and I am appealing for anyone with information that might assist our investigation to please come forward.

"I understand there were a number of people fishing in the area that evening and I would urge anyone who witnessed anything to make contact with us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200096529. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
