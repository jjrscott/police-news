# Appeal for witnesses following attempted robbery in Poole

31 January 2019

* * *

Officers investigating the attempted robbery of a teenager in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 5.50pm on Monday 21 January 2019 the victim, a 17-year-old local boy, was walking through Poole Park near to the tennis courts when he became aware of two male suspects following him.

He turned right to go up the steps by the cricket pitch in an attempt to lose them but they still followed him.

The victim ran up to the A35 and got to the steps of the old Poole police station building opposite the Civic Centre when one of the offenders grabbed the backpack he was wearing to try and pull him back.

The victim pushed the first offender away but was then hit in the face by the second. He then managed to get away and ran back toward Poole Park.

Nothing was taken and the victim went to hospital for treatment to a graze and bruising to his face.

The offender who hit him is described as white with short hair and was wearing a grey hooded top and woollen gloves. The other offender is only described as being a teenager or young adult.

Police Constable Andrew Hetherington, of Poole police, said: "This was a very traumatic and distressing incident for the victim, who has been left extremely shaken by it.

"We are determined to identify the offenders involved and are carrying out a number of enquiries.

"I am appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information to contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190010916. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
