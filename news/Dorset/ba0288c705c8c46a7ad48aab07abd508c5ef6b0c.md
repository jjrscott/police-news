# Update in relation to reported sexual assault incident in Bournemouth

17 August 2020

* * *

A man has come forward following a CCTV appeal in relation to a reported sexual assault in Bournemouth town centre.

It was reported that a local woman aged in her 40s was sexually assaulted by a man in Bournemouth Gardens at around 2pm on Thursday 25 June 2020. The victim had reportedly met the man around two weeks previously but knew very little about him, including his name.

Following a CCTV appeal, a Bournemouth man aged in his 40s has come forward and is assisting detectives with their enquiries. No arrests have been made.

We would like to thank everyone who shared our appeal.
