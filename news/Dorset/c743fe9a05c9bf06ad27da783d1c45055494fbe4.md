# Witness appeal following assault in Weymouth

21 January 2019

* * *

Officers investigating an assault in Weymouth are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 2.30pm on Friday 18 January 2019 two women went to intervene in an altercation between a man and a woman in the alleyway that runs between Primula Close and Louviers Road in Littlemoor.

The man responded by turning on one of the women, pushing her and taking her phone before making off up Louviers Road.

The women flagged down a passing vehicle as they went after him and got them to block the offender's path at the entrance to Alamanda Road. The offender turned around and punched one of the women, causing her to fall back and hit her head on the pavement.

The women were able to get the phone back but the man then left the scene.

The man is described as white, aged in his early 20s, with short dark hair. He was wearing a black North Face baseball cap, black Puffa-style jacket and black trousers.

The victim, aged in her 40s, who was punched was left with swelling to her cheekbone and had to go to hospital for an assessment to her head injury.

Police Constable Tom Arnold, of Weymouth police, said: "We are continuing to investigate this incident and I am appealing for any witnesses to contact us.

"We are particularly keen to speak to the motorist who was driving a silver vehicle, possibly a Vauxhall, who assisted the women by stopping the offender at the entrance to Alamanda Road. It is believed the driver was a woman with blonde hair.

"The number 2 bus was also passing at the time of the incident and it is possible someone on the bus may have seen what happened."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190009383. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
