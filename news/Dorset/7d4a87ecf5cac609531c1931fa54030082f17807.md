# Update - CCTV appeal following shoplifting offence in Poole

04 January 2019

* * *

A man has come forward following a CCTV appeal for a shoplifting offence in Poole.

The incident was reported to have occurred at 5.05pm on Thursday 20 December 2018 when a man stole high-value hair straighteners from John Lewis on Poole Retail Park in Branksome.

A 42-year-old local man has since come forward and admitted an offence of theft. He has agreed to a community resolution to return the item and apologise.
