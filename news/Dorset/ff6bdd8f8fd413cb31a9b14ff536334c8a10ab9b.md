# Nine parrots stolen during burglary in Christchurch – appeal

16 October 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a burglary in Christchurch where nine parrots were stolen are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

Between 6pm on Thursday 10 October and 8am on Friday 11 October 2019 the door to an outbuilding of a property in the Burton area was forced open.

Nine parrots, which are worth approximately £9,000, were stolen. This included two Double Yellow-Headed, two African Grey, two pink Galah, a Vinaceous, a Meyer's and a Little Corella.

Police Community Support Investigator Cheryl Belfield, of Christchurch police, said: "These parrots are of great sentimental value to the victim as she has owned them for a number of years.

"I am appealing to anyone who has seen any parrots for sale in unusual circumstances since the time of the incident to get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190160678. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
