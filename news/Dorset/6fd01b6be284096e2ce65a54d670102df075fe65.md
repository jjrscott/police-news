# Burglary in Bournemouth - witness appeal

04 October 2016

* * *

Detectives in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses after an elderly woman was burgled.

The incident happened at around 2pm on Friday 23 September 2016 at an address in the Columbia Road area.

The victim - a woman aged in her 70s - answered to the door to a man who asked her for a glass of water. She went away to the kitchen to get him some water and when she returned to the front door he had left.

She then realised her purse was missing from the table in the hallway.

The offender is described as white, around five feet eight inches tall, with brown hair. He was wearing a light blue knitted sweater and jeans. When he spoke his mouth moved in odd directions.

Detectives are linking the burglary to one that occurred on Sunday 25 September 2016 in the Fernheath Road area where a woman aged in her 80s fended off a burglar with a shoehorn. The man in this incident is additionally described as having his head tilted to one side and he mumbled when he spoke.

Detective Constable Symon Clarke, of Dorset Police's Priority Crime Team, said: "Following a number of enquiries we now believe that the same man may have been responsible.

"I am appealing to anyone who saw someone matching the description acting suspiciously in the Fernheath Road area or Columbia Road area at the relevant time to please get in touch.

"Finally, I would like to remind residents to ensure they keep their doors locked and secure even if they are at home to prevent their home from being targeted and never let anyone into your home if you don't know them."
