A man is due to appear in court in connection with a reported disturbance in Weymouth.

At around 12.30pm on Saturday 2 September 2017 Dorset Police was alerted by colleagues from the British Transport Police to reports of a disturbance in Ranelagh Road near to Weymouth train station.

Officers attended and a 45-year-old Weymouth man was arrested. He has now been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Friday 9 February 2018 for offences of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause fear of or provoke unlawful violence and obstructing or resisting a constable in the execution of their duty.
