# Witness appeal following burglary in Bournemouth

08 March 2019

* * *

Detectives investigating a burglary in Bournemouth and the movement of a stolen vehicle used by the offenders are appealing for help from the public.

At around 3pm on Tuesday 5 March 2019 offenders gained access to an address in Cove Road. Nothing was stolen.

Four men were seen to leave the Cove Road address in an Audi A3, which had been stolen during a house burglary in the Bristol area on Sunday 3 March 2019.

The Audi was then involved in a collision around 10 minutes later on Ringwood Road near to Longham Reform Church. The vehicle was found abandoned in Ham Lane.

Some of the offenders were last seen running along Glissons Road. One offender, who wore a red T-shirt, got into a taxi from Knoll Garden Centre to Poole train station before running off into Poole town centre.

During both incidents the Audi carried one of two false number plates - MA16 FFY and GX18FFY.

Enquiries have revealed that the car entered Dorset via Ringwood at 1pm on Tuesday 5 March 2019.

Detective Constable Christian Bryant, of Dorset Police's Priority Crime Team, said: "I am appealing to anyone who saw the Audi being driven in the locations given at the relevant time or anyone acting suspiciously to please contact me. I am also keen to hear from any motorists who may have captured the Audi on CCTV or dashcam."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190033961. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
