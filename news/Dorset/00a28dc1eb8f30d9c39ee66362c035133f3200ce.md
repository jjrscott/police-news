# Police urge public to follow security advice after a series of burglaries in Dorset

09 May 2017

* * *

Dorset Police is warning home owners and property developers to secure their properties following a series of residential burglaries.

The Force has experienced seven dwelling burglaries during April to homes under renovation, which have resulted in the theft of power tools in most offences but also items of jewellery and antiques.

Although the crimes have been carried out across Dorset, the areas targeted most are Bournemouth and Poole, with four of the offences having taken place in the conurbation. The vast majority of these offences happened over night.

Detective Inspector, Neil Wright of the Priority Crime Team, said: "While the number of these incidents is low, they serve as a reminder of how important securing our home is, particularly when they are being renovated and not occupied."

The seven offences are currently under investigation and the Dorset Police Priority Crime Team is issuing advice in a bid to prevent any more people becoming victims of the crime.

DI Wright added: "Burglars and thieves may try to target any home, but there are some simple yet effective steps you can take to avoid being a victim of burglary.

"Resident and developers should secure the property and not leave any keys in a place where they are visible or easily accessible.

"If possible, ask a trusted friend or family member to keep an eye on the address and report any suspicious behaviour to the police.

"Always close and lock your windows and doors and fit and use a burglar alarm. CCTV cameras also offer valuable protection and can provide valuable evidence to the courts."

Further burglary prevention advice is available on the Dorset Police website at www.dorset.police.uk
