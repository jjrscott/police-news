Detectives investigating a reported indecent exposure incident in Poole Park are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police received a report that at around 3pm on Saturday 13 February 2021 a man was seen exposing himself and performing an indecent act while sat in a white Ford Transit van that was parked in a disabled parking bay at the end of the park nearest Poole town centre.

Following enquiries, a 58-year-old Poole man has been arrested on suspicion of indecent exposure. He is assisting detectives with their enquiries.

Detective Inspector Amy Burbidge, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We have launched a full investigation into this incident and are appealing for any witnesses to come forward.

"We would appeal to anyone who witnessed a vehicle matching the description given in Poole Park on the afternoon of Saturday 13 February 2021, or who has any information that might assist our enquiries, to please contact us.

"I would also urge anyone who was driving in the area and has dashcam fitted to their vehicle to check their footage and get in touch if they have captured anything of relevance."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210025922. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
