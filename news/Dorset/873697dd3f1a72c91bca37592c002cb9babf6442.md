Three people arrested in connection with an incident where a man was found with serious injuries in Boscombe will face no further police action.

Just before 9.30am on Saturday 19 December 2020 officers were called to reports that a man had been found unresponsive outside a block of flats in Southcote Road.

The man, aged in his 40s, was taken to hospital for treatment to a serious injury. He has since left hospital.

Following an investigation a 40-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent and she was subsequently released on police bail. She has now been released without charge.

Two Bournemouth men - aged 35 and 44 - were also arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent and were released under investigation. They have now been released from under investigation and will face no further police action.

A third man - aged 57 and from Bournemouth - also attended for a voluntary police interview in connection with the incident and officers have confirmed he will also face no further police action.

Detectives are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.
