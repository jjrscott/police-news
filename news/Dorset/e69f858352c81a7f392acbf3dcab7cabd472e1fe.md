# Witness appeal following robbery at West Moors bookmakers

17 January 2019

* * *

Detectives investigating a robbery at a bookmakers in West Moors are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Shortly before 8pm yesterday, Wednesday 16 January 2019, a man entered Ladbrokes in Station Road and jumped over the counter before threatening staff with what appeared to be a meat cleaver or large kitchen knife. He stole cash from the safe before making off from the scene.

The man is described as being around five feet ten inches tall and of stocky build and had blue fabric stretched over his face. He was also wearing a black hooded top, dark trousers and red gloves.

Detective Constable Nic Taylor, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This must have been a distressing incident for staff at the bookmakers and I would like to reassure members of the public that a full investigation is underway to identify the offender.

"We have been carrying out a number of enquiries, including house-to-house, a forensic examination of the crime scene and reviewing CCTV footage.

"I am appealing to any witnesses or anyone who saw any suspicious activity around the bookmakers yesterday evening to please contact us.

"There will be an increased police presence in the area as we investigate this incident and local officers can be approached with any community concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190008387. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
