# Update â€“ man due in court in connection with reported street robbery in Dorchester

18 June 2018

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with a reported street robbery in Dorchester.

Dorset Police received a report that at around 6.15pm on Friday 24 November 2017 a local woman aged in her 70s was walking across the Acland Road car park when she felt someone grab her handbag, causing her to lose her balance and fall to the ground.

It was reported that the alleged offender dragged her a short distance along the ground before verbally threatening her and pulling the handbag away.

The woman was treated by paramedics for an injury to her head caused by falling to the ground, but she did not require hospital treatment.

A 31-year-old Dorchester man was arrested and has now been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Monday 25 June 2018 for an offence of robbery.
