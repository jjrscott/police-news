Two people arrested in connection with a reported stabbing in Bournemouth will face no further police action.

Dorset Police was called at 6.35pm on Monday 13 May 2019 to reports of a man found with stab injuries in Gervis Place.

Officers attended the scene and the injured man, aged in his 20s, was taken to hospital for treatment. His injuries were not life-threatening.

Following enquiries, a 26-year-old man and a 17-year-old boy, both from Enfield in London, were arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent. They have now both been released from under investigation and will face no further police action.

Detectives are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.
