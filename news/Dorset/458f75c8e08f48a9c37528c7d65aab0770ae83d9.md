# Witness appeal following reported serious fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth

03 August 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a reported serious injury fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

Dorset Police was called at 11.44pm yesterday, Friday 2 August 2019, to reports of a collision involving a pedestrian and a car on Boscombe Overcliff Drive.

The 36-year-old female pedestrian was taken to Southampton General Hospital by the ambulance service with serious injuries. Her condition is described as serious but not believed to be life-threatening. Her family have been informed.

Following enquiries, a 29-year-old man from Bournemouth has been arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and failing to stop at the scene of a collision. He is currently assisting officers with their enquiries. A Honda Civic has also been seized to assist with the investigation.

The road is currently closed between the junctions of Wentworth Close and Dingle Road.

Police Sergeant Mark Scammel, of the traffic unit, said: "A full investigation is underway and I am appealing to any witnesses who have not already spoken to police to contact us.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who was travelling in the area and may have captured the incident on dashcam.

"Finally, I would like to thank members of the public for their patience while the road closure is in place as it is absolutely necessary to enable the emergency services to respond to the incident and for a detailed examination of the scene to be carried out."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 2:572. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
