# Update - appeal following reported assault and criminal damage in Bournemouth

14 August 2020

* * *

Two men have been identified following an image appeal in relation to an alleged assault and criminal damage incident in Bournemouth.

At around 7.15pm on Saturday 11 July 2020 a male care worker aged in his 40s was out for a walk with other care workers and a patient on Cunningham Place. The patient became distressed and began to struggle with the carers.

It is reported that two men who were in the area came to assist the patient and the carers explained to the men that they were looking after the person.

Despite this, an altercation allegedly occurred and the victim was struck on the head, causing a small bump to his forehead. His mobile phone was also reportedly damaged during the incident.

Following an image appeal, two men have been identified and are assisting officers with their enquiries. No arrests have been made.
