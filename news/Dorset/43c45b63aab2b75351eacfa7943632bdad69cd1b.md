# Serious injury collision in Bournemouth â€“ witness appeal

26 June 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a cyclist sustained serious injuries following a collision in Bournemouth.

Just after 5pm today, Wednesday 26 June 2019, officers were called to reports of a serious road traffic collision on Holdenhurst Road involving a cyclist and a grey Vauxhall Corsa.

The cyclist - a 25-year-old local man - sustained a significant head injury and was airlifted to Southampton General Hospital for emergency treatment. His condition is described as serious but stable.

The driver of the Corsa, a local man aged in his 40s, was uninjured.

Holdenhurst Road was closed while collision investigators examined the scene. It reopened just before 8.30pm.

Inspector Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or caught the incident on dashcam to please contact Dorset Police.

"I appreciate the road closures caused delays and congestion in the area but I would like to thanks motorists for their patience and understanding. We closed the road to allow emergency services to provide vital medical care to the injured cyclist and for collision investigators to establish what happened."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 26:376. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
