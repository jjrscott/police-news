Officers are appealing for the victim of a racial abuse incident in Weymouth to come forward.

At around 12.15pm on Saturday 3 November 2018 an Asian woman was walking along Gloucester Mews when a second woman, who was among a group of people, shouted racial abuse at her.

The incident was reported to Dorset Police by a member of public who witnessed it and is being investigated as a racially aggravated public order offence.

The offender has been described as tall, of slim build, aged in her 40s with messy bleached blonde hair and a spotty complexion. She wore a khaki-coloured coat and jeans.

Police Constable Reuben Fenton-Harvey, of Weymouth police, said: "I am keen to identify the victim of this unpleasant incident to enable us to find out exactly what happened, I would urge her to please make contact.

"I would also ask anyone with information about the incident or either women involved to please get in touch.

"Dorset Police is committed to tackling all forms of hate crime and is keen to encourage people to report it. It is a priority for us to ensure that victims of hate crimes or hate incidents are supported and appropriate actions are taken."
