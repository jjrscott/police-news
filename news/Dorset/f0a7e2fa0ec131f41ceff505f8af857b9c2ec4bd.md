# Witness appeal following fail-to-stop collision in Corfe Castle

06 March 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following a fail-to-stop collision in Corfe Castle.

At approximately 3.30pm on Thursday 1 March 2018 it was reported that a vehicle collided with the Greyhound Inn in The Square and caused damage to a gas main. The vehicle, believed to be a dark-blue estate car, failed to stop at the scene.

The area was evacuated and roads were closed to allow emergency repair work to be carried out on the gas main.

Police Constable Paul Diffey, of Purbeck police, said: "Thankfully no one was injured. However, this incident caused significant disruption to people in the local area who were evacuated or needed to get home.

"We have carried out CCTV enquiries in the area but at this stage we have limited details for the vehicle that was involved in the collision.

"I am appealing to anyone who may know the driver responsible, who has witnessed the collision or may have any dashcam footage that could assist my investigation, to please come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180032044. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
