# Appeal for information after theft of mobile phone in Christchurch

24 January 2018

* * *

A woman who had her mobile phone stolen while she visited Christchurch Hospital has made a direct appeal for the public's help to find it.

The victim, who is aged in her 50s and from Ringwood in Hampshire, was in the pathology department at the hospital between 2.45pm and 3.50pm on Monday 15 January 2018 when it is believed the phone was taken from the pocket of the coat she was wearing.

The phone, a black Huawei Honor 5X, held images of her late son who died in 2014.

The woman said: "I am not interested in the phone itself - that is replaceable but my boy's pictures aren't. He was my first born and my only son. He would have been 30 in December. I miss him and all I have left are those photos.

"I would please ask the person who took my phone or anyone who knows where it is to please contact Dorset Police."

Police Constable Jennie Sykes-Martin, of Dorset Police, said: "The victim has been left devastated, not so much at the theft of the phone itself but at the loss of the treasured photos with huge emotional significance.

"We are making a number of enquiries into this incident and I am appealing to anyone with any information, or who comes across a phone matching the description given in unusual circumstances, to contact police immediately.

"We are desperate to reunite this victim with her phone and any help from members of the public will be gratefully received."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180009101. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
