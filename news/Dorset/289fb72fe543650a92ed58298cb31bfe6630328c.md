Officers investigating a serious injury road traffic collision in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage of the incident to come forward.

At 1.20am on Saturday 6 October 2018 a collision occurred on Charminster Road involving a red Seat Toledo car and a pedestrian.

The pedestrian - a 17-year-old local boy - sustained serious injuries and was taken to Southampton General Hospital for treatment. His condition is not life-threatening. The car driver - a local man aged in his 70s - was uninjured.

Road closures were put in place while emergency services dealt with the incident. It was reopened just after 7.15am on Sunday 7 October.

Police Sergeant Mark Scammell, of the traffic unit, said: "We are investigating the full circumstances of this collision and have spoken to a number of witnesses.

"I am appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident and has not yet spoken to officers to please get in touch. I would also like to hear from anyone who may have any relevant dashcam footage.

"The road was closed to allow the emergency services to deal with the incident and for a thorough examination of the scene to be carried out. We would like to thank motorists for their patience and understanding during the closure."
