# Update â€“ men due in court in connection with reported public order incident in Christchurch

28 January 2021

* * *

Two men are due to appear in court in connection with an alleged public order incident in Christchurch.

The incident occurred at around 5.10pm on Thursday 25 June 2020 in the area of River Way. The victim - a man aged in his 60s - reportedly saw two men on an inflatable dinghy on the River Stour and one of them threw a can into the river. When he challenged the men, the victim reported he was verbally abused by them and was forced to call the police.

Following enquiries, a 25-year-old Bournemouth man and a 25-year-old man from Christchurch attended for voluntary police interviews. They have now been issued with postal requisitions to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 29 January 2021 for an offence of using threatening or abusive words or behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress.
