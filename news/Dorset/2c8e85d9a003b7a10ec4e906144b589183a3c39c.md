# Attempted burglary at cafe in Southbourne â€“ witness appeal

12 October 2016

* * *

Officers in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an attempted burglary at a cafe in the town.

Between 6.31am and 6.35am today, Wednesday 12 October 2016, two men attempted to break into Cafe Riva on Southbourne Overcliff Drive.

The offenders used tools, including bolt croppers, to try and gain access to a door at the back of the cafe and to a gate. It is believed they also attempted to kick the door open but they were unsuccessful.

They have been described as being aged in their 20s and were both wearing hi-visibility tops. One wore shorts and the second wore trousers.

Police Constable Chris Vaughan, of Bournemouth police, said: "I know that there would have been a number of dog walkers in the area at the time and I would urge anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who may have seen which direction the offenders travelled in or whether they used a vehicle to take tools to the scene."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55160154268. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
