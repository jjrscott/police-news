# Fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth â€“ witness appeal

04 January 2021

* * *

Officers investigating a fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

At around 7.45pm on Thursday 31 December 2020 a collision occurred involving a car and a Honda 125 motor scooter on St Swithun's roundabout.

The male driver of the car - believed to be a white 4x4-type vehicle - initially stopped at the scene but left before exchanging any details. He drove off along Christchurch Road in the direction of Boscombe.

The rider of the scooter, a local man aged in his 20s, attended hospital for treatment to minor injuries.

Police Constable Andy Fields, of the traffic unit, said: "I am keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed what happened or has relevant dashcam footage to assist my investigation.

"I am also appealing directly to the driver involved if they see this appeal to please contact us so we can take your account of what happened."
