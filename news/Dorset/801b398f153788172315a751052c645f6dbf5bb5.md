# Appeal for information following report of animal cruelty in Poole

08 January 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for information in relation to an incident of animal cruelty in Poole.

It was reported that at around 11.15am on Saturday 6 January 2018 three men were seen at the Broadstone Recreation Ground releasing rabbits and setting dogs on them.

Witnesses described seeing three men bringing two cages containing rabbits and three dogs into the recreation ground. There was also a child around seven years old with them.

It was reported that the men released a rabbit from the cage and set the dogs loose, who chased it for several minutes before catching it.

Witnesses stated that one man was seen to pull the rabbit from the dogs' jaws on several occasions before setting the dogs on it again and they described hearing the rabbit screaming before it was eventually killed.

The dogs are described as one cream-coloured adult greyhound and two young greyhounds and the rabbits, which were believed to be wild rabbits, were grey or brown with white tails.

The men are described as white and in their 30s or 40s. One of them was of large build and the other two of slim build. One of the slim men was wearing a navy blue top with red writing on the back.

The men were believed to have parked in the car park in the access road off Lower Blandford Road close to Barn Road.

Police Constable Claire Dinsdale, of Dorset Police, said: "We are appealing for further witnesses who may have seen these men on Saturday morning at the Rec, may know who they are or saw the vehicle they were in."
