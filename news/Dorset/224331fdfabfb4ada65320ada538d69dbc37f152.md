Officers are appealing for witnesses after a 10-year-old girl was involved in a collision with a car on Portland.

The incident happened at around 3.50pm yesterday, Tuesday 28 March 2017, on Grove Road.

The collision involved a 10-year-old female pedestrian and a Nissan car being driven by a 37-year-old Portland woman.

The road was closed for around an hour to allow emergency services to treat the girl, who sustained serious but not life-threatening or life-changing injuries.

The girl was taken to Dorset County Hospital by ambulance for treatment to her injuries.

Police Constable Stuart Smith, of the traffic unit, said: "Enquiries into this incident are ongoing at this time and I would ask any witnesses who have not already contacted Dorset Police to please get in touch."
