# Fail-to-stop collision in Poole â€“ witness appeal

17 October 2016

* * *

Officers investigating a fail-to-stop collision in Poole are appealing for three Good Samaritans to come forward.

At around 9.10pm on Monday 10 October 2016 a road traffic collision occurred in Sea View Road between a car and a pedestrian.

A local woman aged in her 70s was crossing the road with the aid of a walking stick when she saw car headlights from a vehicle that was travelling from Ringwood Road toward her.

As the victim continued across the road, the vehicle failed to slow down and part of the car - possibly the wing mirror - struck the woman on her left arm and hand.

She fell to the ground in the centre of the carriageway and remained there until three men helped her onto her feet and took her home.

The Good Samaritans saw the incident and offered the victim their details, but she declined.

The woman was taken to hospital following the incident and sustained bruising to her left arm, hand and knee.

The vehicle involved was said to be a dark-coloured car.

Police Constable Mark Palmer, of Dorset Police's Traffic Unit, said: "As part of my investigation I have now been in a position to speak to the victim in this case.

"I am really keen to speak to the three men who kindly went to the victim's aid and helped her home. I believe they saw the incident and may have valuable information that could assist my investigation.

"I would also urge anyone else who saw the incident to please get in contact."
