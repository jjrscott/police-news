Officers investigating a burglary near Sturminster Newton are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The burglary occurred between 7.50am and 4.20pm on Friday 30 November 2018 at a home off Bath Road between Sturminster Newton and Hinton St Mary.

It is believed the offenders used a large squirrel garden ornament to smash a window and gain access to the property.

A camera bag containing a Canon EOS camera, four lenses, a flash and other items was taken from downstairs and a quantity of jewellery and men's watches were taken from upstairs.

The jewellery stolen included a heavy gold 18-carat twisted link chain bracelet, a 14-carat gold choker necklace, a sapphire and opal eternity ring, an emerald and diamond eternity ring and pearl and gold earrings.

The watches included a Vivienne Westwood horseshoe watch, a Tag Heuer Formula One watch and two Tissot watches.

A World War One Queen Mary brass Christmas box with hand-written cards and a silver bullet pen inside was also stolen.

Police Constable Glen Caddy, of North Dorset police, said: "We have been carrying out a number of enquiries into this incident and conducted a reassurance visit to the victims.

"As we continue our investigation, I am appealing for anyone with information about this burglary or who comes across any of the items described in unusual or suspicious circumstances to contact us."
