# Update - witness appeal after fatal collision in Bournemouth

04 October 2017

* * *

Officers investigating an alleged fail-to-stop fatal collision in Bournemouth have arrested two people.

At around 10.39pm on Tuesday 3 October 2017 it was reported that a collision involving a cyclist had occurred on the A338 Spur Road southbound around one mile from the Ashley Heath roundabout.

Sadly, the cyclist - a 30-year-old man from Poole - was pronounced dead at the scene. His next of kin have been informed and the coroner notified.

It is alleged the driver of the vehicle that struck the cyclist failed to stop at the scene. A search of the area was carried out and, following extensive enquiries, a white Mercedes van suspected to be involved was located in the Nursling area of Southampton in the early hours of this morning, Wednesday 4 October 2017.

A man and woman, both from Southampton, have been arrested in connection with the incident and are currently assisting officers with enquiries.

A road closure was put in place between the Ashley Heath roundabout and the Blackwater junction to allow emergency services to deal with the collision. It was reopened at around 6.30am.

Inspector Matt Butler, of the traffic unit, said: "A full investigation is underway to establish the exact circumstances of how the cyclist sustained fatal injuries.

"I am keen to hear from any motorists who were travelling from Verwood toward the A31 or southbound on the A338 between 9.30pm and 10.40pm last night and may have seen a cyclist. I would also request anyone who may have been in these areas at the relevant time and may have dashcam footage in their vehicles to please contact us.

"We have specially-trained officers supporting the cyclist's family at this very difficult time."
