# Arson investigation in Bournemouth - witness appeal

02 June 2017

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses after a suspected arson in Bournemouth.

The fire is believed to have started at around 1.15pm on Thursday 1 June 2017 in an alleyway behind Shelbourne Road.

The blaze spread to a number of garages and destroyed various property inside the buildings including vehicles. A conservatory was also badly damaged.

The area was evacuated and a cordon was set up to allow the fire service to tackle the blaze.

It is not believed anyone was injured in the incident.

Detective Constable Chris Griffin, of Bournemouth CID, said: "Following an initial investigation by the fire service, the fire investigator has identified that the blaze began in an oil drum in the alleyway and spread to other buildings. However, at this stage it is unclear if the fire was started maliciously or had just been left unsupervised. The owner of the drum has not yet been identified.

"I would ask that anyone who has any more information about the fire or who saw anyone acting suspiciously around the time of the incident to please contact police urgently."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170081276. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
