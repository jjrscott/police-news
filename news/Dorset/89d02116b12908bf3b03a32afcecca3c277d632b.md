Detectives are appealing for witnesses following a serious assault in Bournemouth town centre.

At 12.57am on Friday 2 October 2020 officers were called to reports that someone had been hit in the face with an object on Holdenhurst Road near to Halfords.

It is reported that two men were involved in an altercation and the victim - a local woman aged in her 40s - was struck in the face with a heavy object. She sustained serious injuries and was taken to hospital for treatment. Her condition is not described as life-threatening.

A 19-year-old local man has been arrested on suspicion of wounding with intent and possession of an offensive weapon in a public place and is assisting officers with enquiries. An investigation is underway to locate a second man.

Detective Constable Luke Davis, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am aware that there were a number of taxi drivers, buses and pedestrians who were in the area at the time and I am appealing to anyone who either witnessed what happened or has any information to please come forward.

"I am particularly keen to hear from any motorists who were travelling along Holdenhurst Road between 12.50am and 1am to please check their dashcams for any relevant footage."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200148167. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
