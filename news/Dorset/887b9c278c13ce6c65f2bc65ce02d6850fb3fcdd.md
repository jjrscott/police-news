# Update â€“ man appears in court in connection with collision in Blandford

10 September 2018

* * *

A man has appeared in court in connection with a collision in Blandford.

At 3.25pm on Sunday 10 June 2018 a road traffic collision occurred on the A354 involving a white Land Rover and a silver Skoda Fabia.

The front seat passenger of the Land Rover, a 41-year-old woman from Faringdon in Oxfordshire, was medically trapped in the vehicle and had to be freed. The driver, a 42-year-old man also from Faringdon, sustained minor injuries. They were both taken to Poole Hospital for treatment.

The two occupants of the Skoda were also treated for minor injuries.

A 61-year-old man from the Blandford area was issued with a postal requisition to appear before Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 4 September 2018 for an offence of driving without due care and attention. He is next due to appear at the same court on Friday 21 September 2018.
