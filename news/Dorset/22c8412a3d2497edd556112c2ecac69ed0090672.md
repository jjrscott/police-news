# Witness appeal following reported sexual touching in Bournemouth

11 February 2021

* * *

Officers investigating a reported sexual touching in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward - with images of the suspect being released.

On Monday 14 December 2020 it was reported that at around 10.20am the victim - a 17-year-old Bournemouth girl - had got on the M1 bus at Castlepoint Shopping Centre. At the next stop a man boarded the bus, sat directly behind her and made a short comment, before starting to play with her hair and touch her neck in what the victim believed to be in a sexual manner.

At the top of Lansdowne the man stood up and swore at the victim before getting off the bus and making gestures in the direction of the girl.

Police Community Support Investigator Steph Garner, of Bournemouth police, said: "The victim was understandably left shocked by the incident.

"I am now in a position to release images of the suspect hoping that somebody might be able to identify him.

"Also, I would like to hear from anyone who was on the bus at the time and remembers the incident."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200187668. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
