# Witness appeal following criminal damage incident in Swanage

22 May 2020

* * *

Officers investigating an incident of criminal damage in Swanage are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

It was reported that at around 9.45am on Sunday 10 May 2020 the victim - a woman aged in her 30s - was waiting in a queue outside the Co-Op on Kings Road West when a woman, who appeared to be intoxicated, began pushing a man around the car park in a shopping trolley near to the victim's car. The victim asked them to move away, however the woman became verbally abusive and pushed the trolley twice into the victim's car causing damage.

It is reported that the offender then directed the trolley toward the victim, causing her to step back in fear.

Another customer then pulled up and parked his car nearby, at which point the woman became aggressive and verbally abusive toward him.

The victim reported the incident to a member of staff and the offender was prevented from entering the store.

The woman is described as aged in her 50s with scraggly hair and had teeth missing. She was wearing black leggings.

Police Community Support Investigator Matthew Cast, of Dorset Police, said: "I am appealing directly to the man who parked his car nearby and was reportedly verbally abused by the woman to please come forward as you may have important information to assist my investigation.

"While I appreciate this incident took place over a week ago, I believe there were a number of people in the area at the time and I would like to hear from any of them who remember witnessing the altercation.

"I would also ask that if anyone motorists were in the area at the time with a dashcam please check the footage for anything relevant.

"I am continuing to make enquiries into this incident and would urge anyone who believes they may have relevant information to get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200065858. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
