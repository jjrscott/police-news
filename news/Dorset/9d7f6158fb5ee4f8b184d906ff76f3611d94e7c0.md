Detectives are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following an attempted robbery in Bournemouth.

At approximately 8.10am today, Monday 2 April 2018, a local man aged in his 20s was walking on Holdenhurst Road when he was approached by another man demanding money.

The man pushed the victim to the ground in the middle of the road when he stated that he did not have any money.

The victim sustained minor injuries that did not require hospital treatment.

The offender is described as a white man, aged in his early 20s, approximately six feet tall and of slim build. He was wearing a grey jacket with the hood up and riding a black mountain bike with yellow spokes.

Detective Constable Laura McQueen, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We are carrying out a number of initial enquiries, including CCTV and house to house.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident to please come forward.

"The offender was riding a distinctive bike. I would like to hear from anyone who recognises the man from the description given, or knows anyone who rides a bike similar to the one described, to please get in touch."
