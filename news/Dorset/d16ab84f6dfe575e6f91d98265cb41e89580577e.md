# Witness appeal following break to stores in Dorset

13 April 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for the public's help after burglaries at two WHSmith stores in Dorset.

The most recent incident occurred just before midnight on Monday 9 April 2018 when two men gained access to WHSmith in Crown Mead in Wimborne. Cigarettes were stolen.

The first offender wore black trainers with white edges and grey soles, grey trousers, a grey hooded top, a dark body warmer and one white glove and one black glove. The second offender wore a grey hooded top, black trousers and black trainers with white laces. He carried a dark-coloured backpack.

It is believed the offenders placed the cigarettes into a large white bag before loading them into a vehicle in the car park off Hanham Road adjacent to Co-op.

The first incident occurred at around 4.20am on Tuesday 3 April 2018 in the store on High Street in Shaftesbury. Two men forced open the front door and stole packets of cigarettes.

The first offender is described as between five feet eight inches and six feet tall, of large build and wore dark clothing. The second offender is described as around six feet tall and slimmer than his accomplice. They both wore gloves and took a large plastic bag to the scene.

Police Sergeant Tim Travers, of East Dorset police, said: "Officers are carrying out a large number of enquiries into these incidents, which includes house-to-house visits and viewing CCTV footage.

"Part of our investigation will look at whether the same offenders are responsible for both crimes and we are very much keeping an open mind at this time.

"I am keen to hear from anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious in the area of either of these WHSmith stores at the relevant times.

"I would also ask our business communities to remain vigilant and report any suspicious incidents to us.

"Finally, I am very keen to hear from anyone who has been offered cigarettes for sale in unusual circumstances."
