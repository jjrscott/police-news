# Public appeal following exposure incidents in Poole

08 March 2019

* * *

Officers investigating three exposure incidents in Poole are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

The incidents have all occurred in the Denmark Lane and Shaftesbury Road area between 9.30pm and 10pm and, due to the similarities of the offences and description of the offender, it is believed the same man is responsible.

The first incident occurred sometime in January 2019 at the junction of Denmark Lane and Shaftesbury Road when a man indecently exposed himself to a woman aged in her 50s.

The same woman was the victim of a second similar incident on the evening of Friday 1 February 2019.

The third incident occurred on Monday 4 March 2019 at around 10pm and involved another local woman aged in her 50s.

The offender is described as white, aged in his late 20s or early 30s, five feet eight inches tall and of average build. He was clean shaven with dark scruffy hair.

Police Constable Charlotte Harvey, of Poole police, said: "These were unpleasant incidents for the victims involved and I would like to reassure them and local residents that a thorough investigation is underway. As a result of our initial enquiries we believe the same man may be responsible.

"I would ask anyone who was in the relevant area at the times mentioned and saw or heard anything suspicious to please contact Dorset Police. Anyone who suspects they know who this man may be is also urged to contact me.

"We are carrying out additional patrols in the area and officers from the local neighbourhood policing team can be approached with any concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190034534. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
