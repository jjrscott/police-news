A man is due to appear in court in connection with a reported burglary in Weymouth.

Dorset Police received a report at around 7am on Thursday 19 April 2018 of a burglary at an address in Abbotsbury Road that had occurred since 9.30pm on Wednesday 18 April 2018.

It was reported that access had been gained through the rear of the property and a bottle full of coins, an Atlantic Academy blazer, £4 in cash and a wallet containing bank cards and cash had been taken.

A 47-year-old Weymouth man has been issued with a postal requisition to appear before Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Monday 13 May 2019 for an offence of burglary as well as fraud by false representation relating to alleged use of one of the stolen bank cards.

A second man arrested in connection with the incident, aged 43 and from Weymouth, will face no further police action.
