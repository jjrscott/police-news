Officers investigating a reported affray at a bar in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

The incident occurred at Felson's Bar on Old Christchurch Road at around 11.40pm on Monday 26 March 2018.

It was reported that a verbal argument began between two women, which escalated into an altercation between two separate groups of four people.

During the altercation, it is alleged that a man aged in his 20s was hit on the head with a glass bottle, causing a small bleed on the brain not thought to be life-threatening. A woman aged in her 20s was reportedly punched in the face causing a possible fractured cheekbone.

A 21-year-old woman from Bournemouth was arrested on suspicion of affray, assaulting an officer, criminal damage and possession of a class B drug and has been released under investigation.

Two men aged 27 and 29 and a 22-year-old woman all from the Manchester area were arrested on suspicion of affray and released under investigation.

Police Constable Brennan, of Bournemouth police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who may have been in the bar at the time or during the lead up to the incident and who has not yet spoken to police to please contact me.

"We have been making a number of enquiries since the incident occurred and have been reviewing the bar's CCTV footage and speaking to potential witnesses and investigations remain ongoing."
