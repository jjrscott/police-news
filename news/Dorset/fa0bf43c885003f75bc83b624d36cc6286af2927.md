15 May 2017

* * *

A man has been charged following reports that a vehicle failed to stop for officers in Poole.

At around 10.30am on Tuesday 28 February 2017 a vehicle travelled from Holes Bay Road to Sterte Road Railway Bridge along Broadstone Way, Willis Way and Fleets Lane and reportedly failed to stop for officers when requested.

A 19-year-old London man who was arrested on suspicion of traffic offences has now been charged with dangerous driving, failing to stop for a constable, driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence and with no insurance.

He is due to appear before Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 19 May 2017.
