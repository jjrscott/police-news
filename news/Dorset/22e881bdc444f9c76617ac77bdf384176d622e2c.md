# Update â€“ witness appeal following serious road traffic collision in Poole

22 August 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a serious collision in Poole are renewing their appeal for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward - with one man arrested and released on police bail.

The incident, which happened on Melbury Avenue, was reported at 2.27pm on Friday 21 August 2020. It involved a pedestrian, a 13-year-old local boy, and a grey Mercedes A-Class.

The boy remains in Southampton General Hospital with life-threatening head injuries. His family is being supported by officers.

It was reported that the driver did not stop at the scene, but has since been located.

A 28-year-old man from Poole who was arrested on suspicion of driving offences has been released on police bail pending further enquiries.

Police Sergeant Rhys Griffiths, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the injured boy and his family and friends at this time.

"Following enquiries, we believe the driver reportedly travelled from Melbury Avenue onto Aspen Road. I am keen to speak to any witnesses who were in the area at the time and have not already spoken to Dorset Police.

"Also, I would like to renew my appeal for anyone who may have captured the incident on either dashcam or mobile phone footage to please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 21:284. Alternatively, or alternatively to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
