# Witness appeal following robbery in Poole

07 November 2016

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a woman was robbed in a Poole street.

At around 10.15pm on Thursday 3 November 2016 a woman was walking along Samson Road in the Hamworthy area when she was attacked from behind by an unknown person.

The victim, a local woman aged in her 40s, was pushed into a brick wall. The offender first went through her right rear jeans pocket and then her left. They made off between two rows of houses in Hercules Road with a quantity of cash.

The victim continued walking until she found two people near Hercules Road and asked for help.

She sustained injuries to her face.

The suspect is described as between five feet six inches and five feet nine inches tall and of slim build. The victim does not know whether the offender was a man or a woman.

Detective Constable Luke Davis, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who saw someone acting suspiciously in Samson Road or Hercules Road at the relevant time to please contact me.

"I am also keen to hear from the two members of the public who spoke to the victim after the incident."
