A man has been arrested in connection with an incident where shots were reportedly fired in Weymouth.

Dorset Police received a report at 5.53pm on Tuesday 22 May 2018 of shots being fired - possibly from an air weapon - in Marsh Road near to the Asda supermarket in Weymouth.

There were also reports of a number of men seen running from the scene.

Officers, including armed officers, attended and a thorough search of the area was conducted.

There have been no injuries reported to police.

Enquiries are still ongoing to establish what firearm was involved.

A 54-year-old Weymouth man has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder and is assisting officers with their enquiries.

Detective Inspector Andrea Power, of Weymouth CID, said: "We are still carrying out an extensive investigation and are determined to identify those involved, as we do believe there is still a suspect outstanding.

"We have been carrying out searches at a number of addresses in the Weymouth area and are continuing to appeal for anyone with information that can assist our investigation to contact police."

Inspector Steve Yeoman, of Weymouth police, said: "I understand that residents will be concerned given the nature of this incident. However, I want to reassure the local community that we still believe there is no wider threat to members of the public and a thorough investigation is ongoing to identify those involved.

"Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team will continue to have an increased presence in the area and can be approached with any concerns."
