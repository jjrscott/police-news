# Appeal for information after boy bitten by dog in Poole

13 January 2021

* * *

Officers investigating an incident where a boy was bitten by a dog in Poole are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

At around 2.30pm on Sunday 10 January 2021 a 12-year-old boy was riding his bike on the heath at Delph Woods in Broadstone.

He rode near to a woman walking two dogs, who asked that he did not get so close to her.

As the boy was riding away, the two Rottweiler-type dogs began following him. One of the dogs then bit him and turned away momentarily when called by the owner, but then returned and bit the boy a second time.

The boy was bitten to his thigh and bottom, but did not sustain serious injuries.

The dog owner is described as white, aged in her 40s, around five feet four inches tall and of stocky build with shoulder-length pink or purple hair. She was wearing dark clothing including a jacket and possibly waterproof trousers.

Police Constable Jennie Sykes-Martin, of Dorset Police, said: "This was a distressing incident for the young boy involved and we are keen to speak to the owner of the dogs. I understand she did check if the boy was all right but he did not get her details.

"I would urge anyone with information as to her identity to contact us and would ask that the woman involved comes forward so we can take her account."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210008383. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
