# Dorset Police officers to appear in ITV cocaine documentary alongside Gordon Ramsay

16 October 2017

* * *

Dorset Police traffic officers are to feature in an ITV documentary focusing on the impact of the international cocaine industry and how law enforcement is tackling the issue, with the two-part programme due to air on Thursday 19 October and 26 October.

According to ITV.com, ‘Gordon Ramsay on Cocaine’ shows Gordon Ramsay as viewers have never seen him before, stripping away the veneer of cocaine’s glamorous image to expose how behind the powder many Brits consume as part of a night out lies a trail of criminality, cruelty and death driving its global trade.

Britain is the biggest consumer of cocaine in Europe and in Gordon’s own business, the restaurant trade, it is rife. He has witnessed it wreck the careers of colleagues and tragically he lost his close friend and chef protégé to a cocaine overdose in 2003.

Gordon joined officers out on patrol for a special operation to tackle the issue of drug driving back in April, which resulted in the arrest of two drivers who tested positive at the roadside for having cocaine in their system.

Speaking during filming, Gordon Ramsay, said: “In just over three hours in Bournemouth on a random Thursday afternoon I’d witnessed two men nicked for drug driving and both of them on the school run.

“I’m shocked and nervous, the fact that it’s that prevalent, it is everywhere, in broad daylight. I think it’s the tip of the iceberg because it’s clearly going on a lot more than we know.”

Police Constable David Cotterill, who Gordon joined on patrol, said: “It is great that Gordon is raising the issue of drug driving to a national audience. We’ve been able to test drivers at the roadside for drugs since March 2015 and in the first six months of this year, 360 drug tests were completed in Dorset alone, with 204 drivers being arrested after a positive sample was given.

“Driving under the influence of drugs can have devastating consequences and sadly, we’ve seen deaths on Dorset roads as a result of drivers having taken drugs.”

Dorset Police is set to feature in the first part of the documentary which will air on Thursday 19 October on ITV at 9pm. Members of the public are invited to submit drug driving related questions to @DorsetPolice on Twitter during the programme.

**ITV programme synopsis:**

In this two-part series Gordon’s journey takes him to South and Central America where he witnesses the illegal ‘cooking’ process by which the drug is made, meets hired assassins and a big time drug-smuggler, is witness to the immediate aftermath of a cocaine-related murder and experiences the harsh reality of the ‘war on drugs’ by joining an elite Colombian anti-narcotics unit on a helicopter raid.

Back in the UK, Gordon joins police to catch a dealer and coke-taking drug-drivers, witnesses the arrest of couriers on their way to a major deal carrying tens of thousands of pounds, and handles 30 kilos of freshly confiscated cocaine at a police testing lab. He also reflects on the challenge of tackling the damage done by cocaine, regarded by many casual users as harmless fun, as he meets a UK dealer and a recovering addict.
