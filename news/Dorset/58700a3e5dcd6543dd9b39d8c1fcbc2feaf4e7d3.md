# Incident in North Bournemouth â€“ man found not guilty

20 December 2017

* * *

A man charged in connection with a disturbance at a block of flats in North Bournemouth has been found not guilty.

Dorset Police was called at 12.50am on Thursday 17 August 2017 to reports of a disturbance at a block of flats where a man was setting fire to items in the garden in Gillam Road. It was alleged that the man also made threats that he was making a bomb.

Officers attended, along with Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service and the South Western Ambulance Service. During a search of one of the flats unknown items were found. A cordon was put in place and, as a precaution, around 30 residents were evacuated for their own safety.

The Military Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) team attended and, alongside scenes of crime officers, assessed the items. They were subsequently found not to be a viable explosive device and no controlled explosions were necessary.

A 42-year-old man from Bournemouth was charged with using threatening, abusive, insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause fear of violence and appeared at Poole Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 13 December 2017. He was found not guilty by magistrates.
