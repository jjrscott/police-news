Detectives investigating an alleged assault in Charminster near Dorchester have charged a man.

Dorset Police was called at 9.07pm on Saturday 10 December 2016 to a report of an assault on a man outside The Three Compasses pub in The Square.

It is reported that the victim - a local man aged in his 20s - was hit over the head with an unknown glass object by another man.

He sustained lacerations to his face, which required treatment at hospital.

A 38-year-old man from Weymouth has been charged with wounding with intent and is due to appear before Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Monday 27 February 2017.
