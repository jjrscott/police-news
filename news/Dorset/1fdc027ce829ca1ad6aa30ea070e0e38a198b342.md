# Witness appeal following fatal road traffic collision near Sherborne

28 November 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a fatal road traffic collision near Sherborne are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

At 10.02am on Thursday 28 November 2019 Dorset Police received a report of a collision involving a blue Triumph motorcycle and a grey Skoda Karoq near to the Boys Hill Drove turning on the A352 between Longburton and Holnest.

Officers attended, along with the fire and ambulance services.

The rider of the motorcycle - a 47-year-old man from the Sherborne area - was very sadly pronounced dead at the scene. His family has been informed and are being supported by specially-trained officers.

The driver of the Skoda, a Sherborne man aged in his 70s, and his passenger, a woman also aged in her 70s, went to hospital for treatment to minor injuries.

Road closures were put in place to allow emergency services to respond to the incident and for a detailed examination of the scene to be carried out. The road was reopened at 3.45pm.

Police Sergeant Mark Scammell, of the traffic unit, said: "We are carrying out an investigation to establish the circumstances of this collision and I would urge any witnesses who have not already spoken to police to please contact us.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who was travelling in the area at the time and may have relevant dashcam footage.

"Finally, I would like to thank members of the public for their understanding while the road closures were in place as they were absolutely necessary to allow us to thoroughly examine the collision scene."
