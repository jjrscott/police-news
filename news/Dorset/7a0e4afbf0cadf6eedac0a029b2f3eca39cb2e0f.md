# Appeal following indecent exposure incident in Bournemouth

01 October 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for any witnesses to come forward following an indecent exposure incident in Bournemouth.

At around 12.35pm on Sunday 29 September 2019 the victim - a local woman aged in her 50s - was walking her dog along a path to the right hand side of the play area in Bradpole Park when she became aware of movement in the bushes. A man came out of the bushes with his trousers down and performed a lewd act.

The victim shouted at the man and he slowly walked back into the wooded area.

The suspect is described as white, aged in his 20s, slim and was wearing a balaclava so only his eyes and nose were visible and a blue tracksuit.

Police Constable Dave Wilcox, of North Bournemouth police, said: "I am aware that a number of people were in that area of the park at the time of the incident and I would ask anyone who saw this man or has any information that may assist my investigation to please contact me."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190153685. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
