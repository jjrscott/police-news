# Murder investigation launched following death of man in Weymouth

14 September 2019

* * *

Detectives have launched a murder investigation following the death of a man in Weymouth.

Dorset Police was called at 10.17am on Saturday 7 September 2019 by the ambulance service following reports of the sudden death of a 75-year-old man at an address on The Esplanade in Weymouth.

The death was initially treated as unexplained and enquiries into the circumstances surrounding the death have been carried out by detectives from the Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT).

A post-mortem examination took place on the afternoon of Thursday 12 September 2019. Further neurology and toxicology tests have been requested before a cause of death can be given, but the pathologist stated that the victim suffered injuries that are believed to be consistent with an assault.

A 28-year-old woman of no fixed abode, who was known to the victim, was arrested on suspicion of murder. Subsequently, a 38-year old Weymouth man was arrested on suspicion of murder and a 37-year-old man, also from Weymouth, was arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. All three are assisting detectives with their enquiries

Detective Chief Inspector Rich Dixey, of MCIT, said: "Following the conclusion of the post-mortem examination and as a result of further extensive enquiries, we have launched a murder investigation.

"We have kept the victim's family updated with these developments and they continue to be supported by specially trained officers. Our thoughts remain with them at this difficult time.

"We are conducting enquiries to establish the full circumstances surrounding the death and I would appeal to anyone with information that may assist our investigation to contact us.

"I am keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed or heard anything suspicious in the area of The Esplanade, to the rear of Alexandra Gardens, on the morning of Saturday 7 September 2019.

"There will be a scene in place as we continue to investigate this incident and officers from the local neighbourhood policing team can be approached by members of the community with any concerns."
