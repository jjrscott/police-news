# Man jailed for possession of drugs in Swanage

12 March 2021

A man has been jailed for two years and nine months after he was caught in possession of drugs by officers in Swanage.

Matthew Kenneth Timothy Bates, 32 and of Higher Days Road in Swanage, appeared at Bournemouth Crown Court on Thursday 24 September 2020 and pleaded guilty to two counts of possession of a controlled drug of class A with intent to supply, possession of a controlled drug of class B with intent to supply and resisting or wilfully obstructing a constable in the performance of their duties.

He was sentenced at the same court on Monday 8 March 2021.

At around 11pm on Thursday 1 August 2019 Dorset Police received information that there was a Seat car parked on Exeter Road in Swanage and the driver was believed to have wraps of white powder on his lap.

Officers attended and located the vehicle. As they approached the drivers side where Bates was sitting, he was seen to place a substance into the pocket of his hooded top.

Bates then exited the vehicle and began to make off, but was stopped by officers. As officers tried to detain Bates he began to fight with them.

Bates was found to be in possession of a quantity of suspected illegal drugs and a small quantity of cash.

He was arrested and taken into custody. A search of Bates' home address was carried out and a sock containing £990 in cash was located.

The drugs that were seized were analysed and found to be cocaine, ketamine and MDMA with the total value estimated to be between £540 and £1,150.

Detective Constable Kelly Wood, of Weymouth CID, said: "I am pleased that we were able to bring Bates before the court. Drug-related crime can have a real detrimental impact on our communities and we are determined to do all we can to catch offenders.

"I would urge anyone with information about suspected drug-related activity to contact us at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101."
