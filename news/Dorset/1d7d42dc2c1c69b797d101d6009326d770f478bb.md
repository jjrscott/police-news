15 March 2019

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward after cigarettes were stolen from a Poole supermarket.

At around 12.15am today, Friday 15 March 2019, five men with their faces concealed were seen to force entry into Sainsbury's in Pitwines Close, Poole. A large quantity of cigarettes was stolen.

It is believed the offenders may have left the scene in a red van and a black saloon car.

Detective Sergeant Adam Gill, of Dorset Police's Priority Crime Team, said: "Enquiries are underway to establish who was responsible for this offence, including house-to-house and CCTV searches. I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the relevant time and either saw or heard something or saw the cars mentioned."
