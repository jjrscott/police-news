# Police investigating multiple road traffic collisions in Poole

31 August 2016

* * *

Police are investigating reports of multiple road traffic collisions reportedly involving the same vehicle in Poole.

Officers were called at around 8.40pm today, Wednesday 31 August 2016 following an initial report that a black Chrysler 300c had collided with two parked cars in the car park to Alum Chine beach.

It was then reported that the vehicle had collided with a number of other cars along Poole Road and then in the Civic Centre area.

The vehicle was seen by officers along West Quay Road before it eventually stopped on Holes Bay Road and the driver was detained.

It is not believed that anyone was seriously injured. The total number of vehicles damaged is currently being investigated.

A 21-year-old man from Poole has been arrested on suspicion of a number of driving offences and aggravated vehicle taking and is currently assisting police with enquiries.

Chief Inspector Steve White, of Dorset Police, said: "I am appealling to anyone who witnessed the Chrysler driving through Poole to contact police.

"I would also ask anyone who believes their vehicle may have been damaged and has not yet been in contact with us to come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 31:427. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
