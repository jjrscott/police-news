# Update â€“ CCTV appeal following theft at Dorchester store

24 July 2019

* * *

A man has come forward in relation to the theft of a model plane kit from a shop in Dorchester.

Following a CCTV appeal in relation to the theft at Frank Herring and Sons in High West Street on Saturday 15 June 2019, a 36-year-old man from the Dorchester area attended the store and admitted the offence before paying for the model that was taken.

He has now been spoken to by officers and a community resolution has been agreed, which is supported by the victim.
