Officers have carried out a series of arrests following joint work with the Metropolitan Police to disrupt the activity of suspected county lines drug dealers operating in the Poole and Bournemouth area.

Following fast-time enquiries, two men - aged 19 and 20 and both of no fixed abode - were arrested on suspicion in the area of Poole Bus Station shortly after 12pm on Tuesday 23 February 2021.

The 19 year-old has been charged with possessing class A drugs with intent to supply, being concerned in the supply of class A drugs and possessing an offensive weapon.

The 20-year-old man has been charged with possessing class A drugs with intent to supply.

Both men are due to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Thursday 25 February 2021.

A warrant was subsequently executed at an address in Ashley Road in Boscombe and three further arrests were made.

A 21-year-old Birmingham man has been charged with possessing class A drugs with intent to supply. He will also be appearing at Poole Magistrates' Court on Thursday 25 February 2021.

A 47-year-old Bournemouth man arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of class A drugs has been released under investigation and a 39-year-old Bournemouth woman arrested on suspicion of conspiring to supply class A drugs was released without charge.

In total more than 150 wraps of suspected class A drugs were seized.

The investigation is being led by specialist officers from the Metropolitan Police.
