# Positive results following maritime operation at Poole Ports

04 October 2016

* * *

A week long maritime operation targeting Dorset's main points of entry concluded today with Dorset Police and partners seeing positive results.

The purpose of the operation was to deter, disrupt and detect exploitation of the Common Travel Area (CTA), general maritime (GM) and commercial maritime (CM) arena by those involved in criminality.

It also acted as an opportunity for community engagement, to obtain intelligence and build working relationships with the maritime and aviation community.

Recently there has been an increase in concern about the perceived vulnerability in ports across Dorset.

The operation to deliver additional coverage was successfully completed with the support of the National Crime Agency, Department of Work and Pensions, UK Border Force, and National Maritime Information Centre.

In total, 55 officers and staff were deployed to Poole Ports for the week, meeting every commercial maritime vessel that came in. The Marine Section rib and UK Border Force Cutter vessels assisted the operation.

In total, 48 unaccompanied freight searches and 14 individual searches were conducted during the operation.

Two vessels were boarded and nine people searched for drugs.

Two illegal immigrants were detected during a search of a freight container and handed over to the UK Border Force for processing.

In addition, two people were arrested during the operation, one for disqualified driving and the other for Breach of a Court Order.

In order to build working relationships and form engagement opportunities, general aviation sites, maritime sites and travel agents were visited and briefed during the operation.

Strategic Commander, Assistant Chief Constable David Lewis said; "This operation has provided reassurance that the intelligence led approach we take in Dorset is effective. It has highlighted the importance of our continued vigilance around this kind of activity.

"We are committed to working with our partner agencies and our maritime and aviation communities to build intelligence and keep our ports safe."

Dorset Police ask that the public continue to support their work by passing any information to them online at www.dorset.police.uk, via the 101 non-emergency number, or by calling Crimestoppers anonymously.
