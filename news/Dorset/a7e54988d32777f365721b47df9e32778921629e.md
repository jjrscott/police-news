# Dorset Police survey to raise awareness of specialist crime fighters

09 October 2020

* * *

Dorset Police is raising awareness of some of the less well-known crime-fighting teams the Force works alongside as part of a major effort to seek the public’s views.

The first phase of the survey – called Your Dorset. Your Police. Your View – opens on Friday 9 October 2020.

The survey will ask people who live in, work in or visit Dorset how much they know about some of the national and regional crime-fighting organisations the Force works with. It also provides an opportunity for members of the public to have their views heard, while learning more about the challenges facing modern policing.

Chief Constable James Vaughan said: “Our officers work alongside specialist teams who use the latest technology and crime-fighting techniques to keep communities safe. These are organisations that perform a vital role, but are often not as well known by the public.

“It’s important people know that, aside from the more visible policing delivered in the county, our officers are supported by a wide range of experts from these teams. The first phase of our survey is a chance for you to find out more about their work, and for us to find out more about your views.”

The survey will look into the work of bodies such as the South West Regional Organised Crime Unit (SW ROCU), the Forensic Capability Network (FCN), the National Crime Agency (NCA) and Action Fraud. The budgets of police forces in England and Wales are ‘top sliced’ by the Government to pay for these national arrangements.

This is the third time in recent years the Force has launched a county-wide consultation to ask Dorset communities to consider important aspects of local policing and share their opinions.

Chief Constable James Vaughan said: “Listening to the views of residents is important to Dorset Police. Findings from previous surveys have helped shaped the Force we are today and the information we collect from you over the next few weeks will help steer our future direction.

“Last year, we asked the public for their views on our priorities and I want to follow up on that valuable exercise by exploring two further key areas in even greater depth.

“Through Your Dorset. Your Police. Your View we are once again giving you the opportunity to tell us how we can improve our service, better meet your needs and keep you safe. We also intend to share further information with you about the challenges and complexities of modern policing.”

The first phase of the survey will run until Wednesday 4 November 2020, after which a second phase will launch, examining another aspect of policing.
