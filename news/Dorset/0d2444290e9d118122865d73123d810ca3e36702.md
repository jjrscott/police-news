# Update â€“ men due in court following reported robbery in Bournemouth

26 July 2018

* * *

Three men are due to appear in court in connection with an alleged robbery in Bournemouth.

At 2.35am on Saturday 3 December 2017 a 26-year-old Bournemouth man was using a cash machine at the Post Office in Cunningham Crescent in the presence of three other men.

It was reported that while he used the ATM the other three men attacked him, punching him to the ground and kicking him before taking his wallet. He sustained cuts and bruises and was taken to hospital.

Two men, aged 26 and 30 and both from Bournemouth, were arrested in connection with the incident and have now been issued with postal requisitions to appear before Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 3 August 2018 for an offence of robbery.

A third man, aged 28 and of Bournemouth, attended a police station voluntarily in relation to the incident and has also been issued with a postal requisition to appear before the same court on the same date for an offence of robbery.
