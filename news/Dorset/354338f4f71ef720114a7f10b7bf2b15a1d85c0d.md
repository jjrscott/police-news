# Witness appeal after man stabbed in Bournemouth

30 September 2016

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a man was stabbed in a Bournemouth street.

At around 5.13pm today, Friday 30 September 2016, a man was found with serious injuries in Regent Drive in the Littledown area of the town.

The victim - a local man aged in his 20s - sustained a stab wound to his chest and was taken to hospital for treatment. His condition is said to be potentially life-threatening.

It is believed the offender - described by a witness as a man of mixed race and aged in his late teens or early 20s - left the scene in a silver Vauxhall Astra.

Officers, assisted by the NPAS helicopter, attended and a search of the area was carried out. Enquiries are continuing this evening.

Detective Inspector Wayne Seymour, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing for anyone who was in the Regent Drive area at around 5pm today and witnessed the incident or saw a man or silver Astra in suspicious circumstances to please come forward.

"A similar car was found in Linwood Road a short time later and we believe this may be connected to the incident. If anyone saw this vehicle arriving in Linwood Road I would like to hear from them.

"Finally, the weapon used in this incident has not been found and I would urge anyone who lives in the Regent Drive or Linwood Road area to check their gardens tonight and in the morning. If you find a knife, please do not touch it but call Dorset Police immediately."

No arrests have been made.
