Officers are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following a road rage incident near Sixpenny Handley.

At 12.34pm on Saturday 27 August 2016 it was reported that the drivers of a silver Kia Picanto and a black BMW coupe were involved in an altercation.

Both vehicles had travelled from Salisbury to Sixpenny Handley before stopping in a layby near the village.

The driver of the Kia Picanto, a 42-year-old man from Salisbury, got out of his car to speak to the BMW driver. A confrontation then took place, resulting in the Kia driver sustaining injuries of bruising, scratching and bleeding to his head. The BMW then left the scene.

"I am appealing for any witnesses to the incident to come forward and would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the manner of driving of either vehicle leading up to them stopping near Sixpenny Handley.

"Also, I am appealing for the BMW driver involved in the incident to come forward so that I can establish what exactly happened."
