* * *

Detectives investigating an alleged assault in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At around 11pm on Friday 2 September 2016 it was reported that a man was walking in Holdenhurst Road near to the Queen's Park pub when he was assaulted by an unknown man.

The victim - a 59-year-old local man - sustained a fractured spine and suspected fractured eye socket.

A 29-year-old man of no fixed abode has been arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm with intent and is currently assisting officers with enquiries.

Detective Constable Amy Burbidge, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am aware that there were a number of people who may have witnessed the incident or stopped at the scene to offer help and I would urge these people to please get in contact with us.

"I am particularly keen to trace the drivers and occupants of an orange Subaru car and a small white or silver coloured car that were travelling along Holdenhurst Road at the time of the incident and stopped at the scene."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 2:445. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
