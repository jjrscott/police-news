# Witness appeal following exposure incident in Studland

15 January 2020

* * *

Officers investigating an incident of indecent exposure in Studland are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 7pm on Friday 10 January 2020 a man knocked on the window of the victim's home address in the Ferry Road area. When she went to see what it was, she found him standing on her door step indecently exposing himself.

Officers, along with a police dog, attended. The dog picked up a scent that led to a nearby layby but searches were unsuccessful.

The offender is described as white and around five feet ten inches tall. It is believed he had his face covered during the incident.

Police Constable Clare Gillard, of Purbeck Police, said: "This was an alarming experience for the victim and we are determined to identify the offender.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed a man acting suspiciously in the village at the relevant time to please contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200005027. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
