# Fatal collision in North Dorset

15 August 2019

* * *

An investigation is underway following a fatal collision in Gillingham.

At 9.11am on Thursday 15 August 2019 Dorset Police was called to reports of a single vehicle collision on the B3081 Shaftesbury Road involving a blue Peugeot 207 that had left the road, gone through a hedge and come to rest next to the wall of a house.

Very sadly the driver, an 81-year-old man from Gillingham, was pronounced dead at the scene. His family have been informed and the coroner has been notified.

His front seat passenger, a 79-year-old woman also from Gillingham, was shocked but uninjured.

The road was closed between New Road and Le Neubourg Way while emergency services dealt with the incident. The closures were lifted just before midday.

Inspector Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "We remain open minded into the circumstances of this collision, however initial indications are that this was a potential medical episode.

"To assist us with our investigations I am appealing to anyone who was travelling along that stretch of the B3081 at the relevant time and either witnessed the collision or captured any of the incident on dashcam to please contact Dorset Police.

"We closed the road to ensure emergency services could provide medical treatment and for us to carry out an examination of the scene. I appreciate the closures caused congestion in the area so I would like to thank motorists for their patience and understanding."
