# Witness appeal following road rage incident in Shaftesbury

27 July 2018

* * *

Officers investigating a road rage incident in Shaftesbury are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

It was reported that at around 8.30am on Friday 20 July 2018 the victim, a woman aged in her 20s, was driving her black Volkswagen Golf and was exiting the Ivy Cross roundabout northbound on the A350 when a silver Mercedes stopped suddenly in front of her.

The Mercedes continued driving again but then stopped once more a short distance later.

The victim put her hazard lights on to warn the vehicle behind her and could see a man in the Mercedes making gestures toward her from inside his car.

She indicated to overtake the Mercedes but before she could do so the man got out and opened her driver's side door. He then put his fist just below her chin and shouted at her before getting back in his car and driving off.

Police Community Support Investigator Luke White, of Dorset Police, said: "This was understandably very distressing for the victim and we are carrying out a number of enquiries into the incident.

"I understand there were a number of other cars in the area around the time of the incident, including a blue Peugeot that was immediately behind the victim. I am appealing for any witnesses to please contact us.

"I would also urge anyone with daschcam footage who was in the area at the time to check their footage to see if they have captured the incident."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180114517. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
