14 September 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a reported firearm incident in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 7pm on Wednesday 11 September 2019 Dorset Police received a report from a member of the public of a man pulling a suspected firearm out of his pocket before walking off in Bournemouth Road.

Officers attended and, following a search of the area and carrying out enquiries, a 51-year-old local man was arrested on suspicion of possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence. What is believed to be a gas-powered BB gun was also seized from an address.

Police Constable Ellie Meteau, of Dorset Police's Volume Crime Team, said: "We have been carrying out enquiries into this incident and it is believed the alleged offender was in possession of the suspected firearm when he travelled on the M1 bus from Bournemouth to Poole on the evening of Wednesday 11 September 2019, arriving at Ashley Road in Poole at around 6.50pm.

"I would appeal to anyone who may have been on this bus and witnessed anything suspicious, or who has any information that can assist our investigation, to please contact us."
