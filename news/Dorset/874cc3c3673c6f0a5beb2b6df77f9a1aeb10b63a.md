# COVID-19 message to our communities

21 March 2020

* * *

Message from Assistant Chief Constable Mark Callaghan, who is leading the police response for COVID-19:

"I would like to reassure our Dorset communities that we have taken all necessary steps to ensure we can continue to protect you, prevent crime and uphold the service that keeps you safe day in, day out.

"These are unprecedented times for all of us and it is more important than ever for us to work alongside our partners to ensure our core services are maintained.

"I understand that many of you will be feeling anxious and worried about the impact this will have on your loved ones and your lives.

"We all need to play our part in reducing the spread of this virus. Please continue to follow the advice from Public Health England and the Government around good hygiene, access to health services, social distancing and self-isolation.

"We are here to help our communities and if you need to report a non-urgent crime we encourage you to visit our website dorset.police.uk.

"Our local policing teams are on social media so please follow your local officers through those channels for updates.

"The Force is doing all it can to keep our officers and staff safe while they continue to serve the public. I would like to thank them for their unwavering commitment.

"We recognise that now is the time that you'll need us more than ever before. Virus or no virus, we are here for you."
