# Appeal for witnesses following fatal collision on A31 in East Dorset

30 April 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a fatal road traffic collision on the A31 in East Dorset are appealing for witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage of the incident to come forward.

Dorset Police was called at 8.46am today, Tuesday 30 April 2019, to a report of a collision outside Henbury Stud Farm near Sturminster Marshall. The collision involved a green Kawasaki motorcycle, a white Ford transit panel van and a white Citroen Relay dropside lorry.

Emergency services attended and very sadly the motorcyclist, a 40-year-old man from Poole, was pronounced dead at the scene. His family has been informed and is being supported by specially-trained officers.

The occupants of the other vehicles involved did not sustain any serious injuries.

Road closures were put in place between the Roundhouse roundabout and the Lake Gates roundabout to allow the emergency services to deal with the incident and for collision scene investigators to carry out examinations. The road reopened shortly after 4pm.

Police Sergeant Fern Graham, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the family of the motorcyclist at this difficult time and we will be carrying out a full investigation to establish the exact circumstances of this collision.

"I am appealing to any witnesses to the incident, or the manner of driving of any of the vehicles involved prior to it, to contact us. We would also like to hear from anyone who was driving in the area at the time of the collision and may have relevant dashcam footage.

"I appreciate the closure of a main trunk road for a long period will have caused significant disruption but we owe it to the family of the deceased to carry out a thorough investigation of the collision, which includes a detailed examination of the scene. I would like to thank all those affected for their patience and understanding during these road closures."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 30:70. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
