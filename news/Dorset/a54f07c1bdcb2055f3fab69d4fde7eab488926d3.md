11 September 2020

* * *

Officers investigating an alleged animal cruelty incident in Bournemouth say no further police action will be taken against an arrested woman.

Dorset Police was called at 8.13pm on Wednesday 12 August 2020 to a report of concern for the welfare of a woman who had allegedly attempted to strangle her golden Rhodesian Ridgeback dog on the beach to the right of Bournemouth pier.

Following an appeal, a witness came forward and the woman has been formally released from the investigation without any further police action.
