# Update – man arrested following reported theft at Poole store

29 August 2019

* * *

A man has been arrested in connection with the reported theft of a tent from a store in Poole.

At around 12.10pm on Friday 19 July 2019 a man and woman were seen to enter the Decathlon store at Poole Retail Park at Redlands.

The man was allegedly seen to pick up a Quechua Air Seconds 4.1 XL tent, valued at £199.99, and put it behind a stand closer to the door. The woman then reportedly picked up the tent and left the store without paying.

Following a CCTV appeal issued by officers, a 28-year-old Verwood man has been arrested on suspicion of theft and has been released under investigation as officers continue to make enquiries.
