A man is due to appear at court in connection with a reported assault at a pub in Corfe Mullen.

At around 10pm on Saturday 7 July 2018 it was reported that a man had been knocked unconscious in the car park of The Dorset Soldier in Wareham Road. The offender reportedly left the scene.

The alleged victim was taken to hospital for treatment to injuries to his head and neck.
