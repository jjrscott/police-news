# CCTV appeal following suspicious vehicle fire in Bournemouth

09 January 2021

* * *

Detectives investigating a vehicle fire in Bournemouth are issuing CCTV images of the suspects and appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

At around 8.35pm on Monday 28 December 2020 officers attended a report of a vehicle fire that was believed to have been started deliberately on Holdenhurst Avenue.

The fire spread from the vehicle and caused damage to a nearby property. There were no reports of any injuries.

Following CCTV enquiries, it is believed that two male offenders started the fire at around 8.05pm.

Detective Constable Phillip Riggs, of Bournemouth CID, said: "Thankfully the fire was put out quickly, but this could have led to devastating consequences as there were vulnerable people in the property at the time.

"I appreciate the images of the suspects are of poor quality. However, I am hoping they may jog someone's memory from the night and of the incident, or that someone may recognise them from the clothing they are wearing.

"If anyone has any information that may assist my investigation, please get in contact with Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200194916. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
