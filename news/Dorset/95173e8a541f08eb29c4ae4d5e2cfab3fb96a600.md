# Update â€“ witness appeal following reported fail-to-stop collision in Weymouth

21 August 2017

* * *

A man has come forward to Dorset Police following a reported fail-to-stop collision in Weymouth.

At around 11.54pm on Saturday 19 August 2017 a collision occurred on Sundew Close.

A black pick-up truck, which has now been established to be a Ford Ranger, left the road and collided with a property causing serious structural damage to the front kitchen area of the building.

The driver reportedly failed to stop at the scene and drove away in the direction of Dorchester Road.

A 23-year-old Weymouth man has come forward and is assisting police with their enquiries.

Police Sergeant Mark Scammell, of the traffic unit, said: "The vehicle has now been recovered and our investigation continues.

"I am still appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision, or saw the manner of driving of the pick-up truck prior to the incident, and has not yet spoken to police to come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 19:547. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
