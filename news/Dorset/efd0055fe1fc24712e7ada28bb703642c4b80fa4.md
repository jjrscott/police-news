29 August 2016

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following a burglary of a shop in Wareham.

At 3.58am on Monday 29 August 2016 Dorset Police received reports that a vehicle had been rammed into the front of the Co-op on North Street.

A cash machine, which was located inside the store, had been taken.

Officers searched the area but no arrests were made.

Detective Constable Rhys Griffiths, of Western CID, said: "I am appealing for any witnesses to the incident, who have not spoken to police yet, to come forward.

"I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who has seen a khaki coloured Landrover with a tyre on the bonnet in the area at the time or has seen it driven to or away from the scene.

"Anyone with information about those responsible should contact Dorset Police as soon as possible."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 29:65. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
