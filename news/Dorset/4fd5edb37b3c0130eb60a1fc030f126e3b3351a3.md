# Appeal for information after woman bitten by dog in Bournemouth

24 August 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for anyone with information to come forward after a woman was bitten by a dog in Bournemouth.

The incident occurred at around 4.45pm on Saturday 15 August 2020 in the Iford Playing Fields off Iford Lane.

The victim was walking near to the river with her husband and toddler son when they saw a man throwing stones into the water for three black and white Border Collies that he had with him.

The dogs approached the woman and her family and started barking and becoming excitable. The victim told her husband to stay still and did the same but the dogs began jumping up at her and one of them bit her on her leg where she was wearing wellington boots and tried to pull her.

The dogs' owner approached and was shouting at the animals. He did not apologise and the dogs moved so the family made off from the scene.

The man with the dogs is described as white, aged in his 50s and of medium height and build with shoulder length grey scraggly hair and stubble. He was wearing a T-shirt despite wet weather and spoke in a local accent.

Police Constable Jennie Sykes-Martin, of Dorset Police, said: "This was a distressing incident for the family involved and we are keen to identify the owner of the dogs involved so we can speak to them and take their account.

"I would urge anyone with information to please come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200122005. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
