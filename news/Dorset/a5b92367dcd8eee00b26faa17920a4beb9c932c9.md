Detectives are appealing for witnesses following an assault in Bournemouth.

Police were called at 8.19am this morning, Thursday 27 July 2017, to a report of an assault along St Winifreds Road.

Officers attended and located a man with a cut to his face caused by a sharp object. It is not known at this stage what the object was.

A search of the area was carried out, with support from armed officers and NPAS helicoper, however the offender was not located.

The offender is described as a white man aged in his late 20s. He was wearing a light grey hooded top with the hood up, a blue T-shirt and grey trousers.

The victim - a local man aged in his 40s - was taken to hospital for treatment. His injuries are not thought to be life-threatening. He also reported that he had a cut to one of his car tyres.

Detective Constable Matthew Loader, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We believe this may have been a targeted attack, but it is not known at this stage whether the offender and victim were known to each other.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident, or knows who the offender might be, to contact Dorset Police or pass on any information anonymously to Crimestoppers.

"We have stepped up patrols in the area and have been making a number of enquiries, including door to door, and have also been trawling CCTV in order to identify the offender."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 27:70. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
