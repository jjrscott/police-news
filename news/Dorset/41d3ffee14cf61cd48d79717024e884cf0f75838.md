The other suspect is described as white, in his early 20s, around six feet two inches tall and of slim build with blond hair. He was wearing a blue hooded top.

Detective Sergeant Dave Horn, of Weymouth CID, said: "We have made a number of enquiries into this incident, including a trawl of CCTV footage in the area.

"I understand there will have been a number of people in the area around the time of the incident and I am appealing to any witnesses who have not already spoken to police to contact us immediately.

"I would also ask for anyone with information that can assist our investigation to come forward."
