# Public appeal to motorists following theft of hydraulic equipment from vehicle in Poole

14 March 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for the public's help in relation to a theft of a hydraulic breaker digger from a vehicle in Poole.

Sometime between 8pm and 8.45pm on Saturday 3 March 2018 a yellow hydraulic breaker digger attachment was stolen from a Scottish and Southern Energy vehicle while workers tried to locate a fault that had cut power in the area of the Poole Road junction with Palmerston Road in Upton.

It is believed that during these times a number of passers-by travelling along Poole Road tried to alert the workers by sounding their vehicle horns.

Police Constable Simon Shaw, of Dorset Police, said: "These workers were carrying out vital emergency works during the severe weather disruptions last weekend. The theft of this equipment could put vulnerable people's lives at risk, having to be without power for longer because the workers have to use the manual breakers instead.

"I believe that a number of passers-by saw the theft occurring and tried to alert the workers. I would ask these people to please contact Dorset Police as they may have valuable information that could assist my investigation.

"Finally, I would urge anyone who knows where this stolen equipment might be to call us."
