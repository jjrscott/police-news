# Update â€“ man due in court in connection with reported assaults in Weymouth

04 April 2019

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with two alleged assaults in Weymouth.

At around 4.15am on Saturday 8 September 2018 a man was reportedly assaulted on The Esplanade. The victim, aged in his 20s and from Somerset, sustained a suspected broken jaw.

A short time later, at about 5.05am, officers were called by the ambulance service to reports of an assault in Maiden Street in which a local man aged in his 20s sustained serious head injuries. He was taken to hospital for treatment to a fractured eye socket and partial loss of sight in one eye.

A 40-year-old Weymouth man was arrested and has now been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Monday 15 April 2019 for offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and inflicting grievous bodily harm.
