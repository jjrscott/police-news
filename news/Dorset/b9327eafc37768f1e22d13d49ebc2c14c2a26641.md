# Avoid getting a red card during the World Cup

12 June 2018

* * *

Don't kick-off during this summer's tournament.

Dorset Police and Devon & Cornwall Police are advising people of the consequences of drinking too much and letting their emotions get the better of them during this summer's World Cup.

Russia 2018 starts on Thursday 14 June 2018 for a month-long festival of football featuring 32 nations from across the globe, including England.

Incidences of alcohol-related violence often increase during the summer months, especially when there is a large sporting event taking place.

Detective Chief Inspector Craig McWhinnie, of Devon & Cornwall Police, said: "Most people just want to enjoy the football and support their teams. We just want to remind people that alcohol is not an excuse for bad behaviour and we will be taking a robust stance in dealing with any perpetrators of violent crime and domestic abuse."

Police are working closely with partner agencies, bars, pubs and social clubs to help them prepare for the tournament, to make them aware of their responsibilities and to encourage people to drink responsibly.

DCI McWhinnie added: "During the World Cup there is increased potential for drivers to still be over the limit the morning after as some of the matches are scheduled in the evening, and people may be drinking later than they usually would.

"We are reminding people to be sensible, not get too carried away and to drink responsibly. Please don't drink and drive as you could lose your licence, your job or even take a life - it's simply not worth the risk.

"We will also be monitoring incidents and arrests both here and in Russia linked to the football, with a view to applying to the courts for football banning orders where appropriate.

"Those in the UK who had an existing football banning order have already been prevented from leaving the country until the Russia 2018 has ended."

In an emergency, always call 999.
