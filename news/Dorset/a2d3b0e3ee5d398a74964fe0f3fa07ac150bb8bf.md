Detectives investigating a reported robbery in Weymouth are appealing for any witnesses to come forward.

The incident occurred at around 10.45am on Saturday 30 March 2019 outside the Sports Direct store at the Jubilee Retail Park.

The female victim reported seeing a disturbance outside the store involving members of the public and staff. An altercation then occurred during which a man reportedly took the victim's mobile phone and damaged it before leaving the scene.

A 28-year-old man from Luton was subsequently arrested in connection with the offence and has been charged with robbery. He was due to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Monday 1 April 2019.

Detective Constable Neil Hooker, of Weymouth CID, said: "We are continuing to make enquiries into this incident and I would ask that any witnesses contact police."
