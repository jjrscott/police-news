A man arrested in connection with a fatal road traffic collision in Bridport has been released under investigation.

At 11.15pm on Monday 13 November 2017 a two vehicle collision occurred on the A35 Sea Road South close to the Crown roundabout involving a silver Mercedes convertible and a black Mitsubishi L200 pick-up truck.

Sadly, the driver of the Mitsubishi, 64-year-old Steve Spear from Bridport, died at the scene.

Three men aged 30, 32 and 35 from the Bridport area, all occupants of the Mercedes, suffered serious but not life-threatening injuries and were taken to hospital for treatment.

A 30-year-old local man was arrested on suspicion of driving offences and has now been released under investigation.

A 33-year-old man and 27-year-old woman, both from Bridport, were also arrested on suspicion of driving offences but have been released without charge.
