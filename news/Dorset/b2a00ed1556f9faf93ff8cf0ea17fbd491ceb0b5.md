# Witness appeal following robbery in Bournemouth

05 February 2021

* * *

Detectives investigating the robbery of a teenage boy in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The 13-year-old victim was walking in the area of Kings Park Road at around 3.30pm on Thursday 4 February 2021 when he was approached by two teenage boys, who were riding on Beryl Bikes. They demanded the victim's coat before assaulting him.

The two teenagers cycled off with the coat, which contained Â£20 cash in a pocket.

The victim sustained a cut and swollen lip and a cut to his nose.

Both of the offenders are described as being around 15 or 16 years old. One is described as being less than five feet nine inches tall, of slim build and was wearing a black tracksuit with a hood and a black mask covering most of his face.

The other offender is described as mixed race, taller than five feet nine inches and of slim build with black curly hair. He was wearing a grey or silver jacket or hooded top that had a zip across the body and was also wearing a face mask.

Detective Constable Jo Regan, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This must have been a frightening incident for the victim and we are carrying out a full investigation to identify the individuals responsible.

"I would urge anyone who witnessed the robbery, or who saw two teenagers matching the descriptions given in the area on the afternoon of Thursday 4 February, to please contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210021360. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
