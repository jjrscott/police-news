# Witness appeal following distraction burglary in East Dorset

27 September 2017

* * *

Officers investigating a distraction burglary in East Dorset are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 3.45pm on Wednesday 20 September 2017 a man entered the home of the victim, a man aged in his 70s, at Oak Tree Park in St Leonards.

The man claimed he was there to check the electrics and distracted the victim before stealing his wallet containing cash and leaving the property.

The offender is described as white, aged in his 30s, of slim build with a thin round face. He was clean shaven and wearing a dark jumper and dark trousers.

Police Constable Tracey Downer, of East Dorset police, said: "We are continuing to investigate this incident and officers have visited the victim to provide reassurance and offer advice to residents in the local area.

"I would ask anyone who witnessed this incident or who saw any suspicious activity in the area at the time to please contact police.

"I would also like to take this opportunity to remind residents to always ask for identification if you have any doubts about the intentions of a visitor to your property. They should have no issues with showing it if they are genuine.

"Never let anyone you do not know into your property. If you do have any concerns contact a family member or neighbour and inform the police."
