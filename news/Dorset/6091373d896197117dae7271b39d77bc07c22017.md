# Witness appeal following serious collision in Bournemouth

12 May 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a serious road traffic collision in Bournemouth.

It was reported that a VW Beetle was in collision with a cyclist on Malvern Road at around 1.45pm on Tuesday 12 May 2020. Officers attended the scene along with the ambulance service.

The cyclist - an 18-year-old local man - has been taken to Southampton General Hospital with injuries that are believed to be serious. His family have been informed.

The female driver of the car did not sustain any injuries.

The road is currently closed to allow emergency services to deal with the incident.

Police Sergeant Craig Totton, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the family of the young man involved in this collision and we are carrying out a full investigation to establish exactly what happened.

"I would urge any witnesses who have not already spoken to police or anyone who may have captured the incident on dashcam to please contact us.

"Finally, I would like to thank members of their public for their patience and understanding while the road closures are in place. These are necessary to allow for the emergency services to deal with the incident and for a detailed examination of the scene to be carried out safely."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 12:182.
