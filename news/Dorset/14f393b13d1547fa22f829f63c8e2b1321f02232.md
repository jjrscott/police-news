# UPDATE: Request for public help after report of paraglider out of control

08 May 2017

* * *

A paraglider who was reported to have been out of control in Gillingham has contacted officers to say he is safe and well.

At 9.48pm on Sunday 7 May 2017 Dorset Police received a call from a concerned member of the public.

Around 30 minutes earlier he had seen what he believed to be a paraglider in trouble. It appeared that the engine had cut out and it was losing control. The glider was spinning round and fell from about 200 feet to 50 feet before going out of sight. The location has been described as Chantry Fields behind Sainsbury's and Asda.

Chief Inspector John Foster, of Dorset Police, said: "Following the report from the concerned member of the public, a full search was carried out in the area but nothing was found.

"We are pleased to say the paraglider made contact with us shortly after 8am on Monday 8 May 2017 to say he landed safe and well at 9.30pm yesterday.

"I would like to thank all those members of the public who called us following our appeal."
