Two men have been charged in connection with an alleged assault in Weymouth.

The incident happened at around 11pm on Saturday 21 January 2017 in the Golden Lion pub on St Edmund Street.

It is alleged that the victim - a local man aged in his 60s - was pushed, causing him to fall to the ground.

The victim sustained a broken leg that required surgery.

A 35-year-old Weymouth man and a 33-year-old Portland man have jointly been charged with inflicting grievous bodily harm without intent and are due to appear before Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Monday 10 April 2017.

The 33-year-old Portland man has also been charged with using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause fear of or provoke unlawful violence.
