# Witness appeal following fatal collision on the A30 near Sherborne

07 March 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a fatal collision on the A30 near Sherborne.

Dorset Police was called at 7.54pm yesterday, Tuesday 6 March 2018, by Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service to reports of a road traffic collision on the dual carriageway section of the A30 Yeovil Road at Babylon Hill involving a blue Honda Civic.

The driver of the Honda - a 23-year-old local woman - sustained very serious injuries and had to be cut free from her vehicle by firefighters. She very sadly died at the scene. No one else was injured.

Her family has been informed and the coroner notified.

The A30 was closed between the Babylon Hill roundabout and the junction of the A352 while the emergency services dealt with the incident and collision investigators examined the scene. It reopened at 1.27am today, Wednesday 7 March 2018.

Police Sergeant Craig Tatton, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or saw the manner of driving of the Honda Civic immediately prior to the incident to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would like to thank the public for their patience during the road closures, which were necessary to allow us to establish the circumstances of the collision."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at scit@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 6:447. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
