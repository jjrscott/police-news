# Further police reassurance in relation to rise in UK threat level

25 May 2017

* * *

Assistant Chief Constable Russ Middleton said: "In response to the recent change in the threat level to critical, armed officers from Devon and Cornwall Police and Dorset Police will be seen out and about in our communities, throughout both Force areas.

"Armed officers will be doing overt foot patrols, carrying a long-armed firearm, which is the first time this has happened in our area.

"This is not based on any change in intelligence or threat for the South West, but the decision has been taken, whilst we are at a critical threat level, to make firearms officers more deployable and visible to our communities. We think this is what the public would expect at this time.

"Our priority is to provide as much reassurance to communities as possible but we do recognise that some may feel anxious. The firearms officers will be engaging and talking with people and we would actively encourage you to approach the officers and ask any questions you may have.

"We are continuing to work with our local partners, event organisers and the military, to ensure appropriate security is in place and the public are kept safe.

"Separately we have been asked what the public should do in terms of attending events outside of our area. Anyone wanting to travel to big events should go and enjoy themselves but as always, we would urge everyone to be alert and not be alarmed, and keep an eye out for anything suspicious.

"If anyone sees anything suspicious that they believe may be related to terrorism, they can report this to the Anti-Terrorist Hotline on 0800 789321 or call 999.

"For more information about what to do in the unlikely event that anyone is caught up in a firearms or weapons attack, visit the NPCC website which contains advice about run, hide, tell or watch the video on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUCW_mk35Xc)."
