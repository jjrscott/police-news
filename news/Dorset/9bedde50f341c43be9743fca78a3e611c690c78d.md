# Family tribute to woman who died in collision in Weymouth

14 September 2018

* * *

The family of a woman who sadly died in a collision in Weymouth has paid tribute to her.

At 10.05am on Wednesday 22 August 2018, Dorset Police received a report of a collision involving a red Citroen C4 Picasso and a pedestrian outside Weymouth Community Hospital in Melcombe Avenue.

The pedestrian, 89-year-old local woman Edna Floyd, was taken to Dorset County Hospital for treatment. However, very sadly her condition deteriorated and she died later that afternoon.

In a statement, her family said: "Edna Floyd was not just a wife to her husband Tony and mother to her two, now grown up children, but was known as Granzy to her six grandchildren and was friends to the many people she met and worked with over the years.

"Edna and Tony while living in Weymouth made many friends, but Edna will probably be best known to the hundreds if not thousands of children to whom she was their teacher at both Bristow Infants School and then Watchetts Middle School in Frimley, Camberley in Surrey.

"Edna and Tony moved to Weymouth 14 years ago to enjoy an area they had visited and enjoyed for years. As they aged they supported each other. After finally stopping driving they enjoyed using their bus passes to get around. They often walked along the seafront into the town to meet friends and enjoy a coffee.

"Living near the beach meant they had a stream of grandchildren always willing to visit and make sandcastles before returning for tea and sandwiches around the kitchen table.

"She will be sorely missed by her surviving husband, children, grandchildren and all those that got to meet such a loving and caring lady over the years."
