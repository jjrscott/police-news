# Appeal after elderly couple conned out of life savings after distraction burglary

07 February 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information after an elderly couple were conned out of their £40,000 life savings in West Moors.

At around 1pm on Monday 5 February 2018 three men attended their address on Pinehurst Road claiming to be from a company called Kennedy Water.

The men convinced the couple that they needed to access the property, claiming that there had been issues with the water supply and they needed to perform some checks.

The men roamed the property supposedly checking taps and the boiler, before leaving.

The victims then discovered sovereign coins and 6kg bars of silver - with a total value of around £40,000 - had been taken from a safe.

The three men are described as white and spoke with Irish accents. One of the men was around six feet four inches tall and well-built with short brown hair. The second man was described as five feet ten inches tall and of slight build. The third man was around five feet eight inches tall and was carrying a blue jiffy bag.

Detective Constable Ben Swain, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This crime has understandably left the victims devastated and we are doing everything we can to find those responsible. I would urge any witnesses or anyone with information to please contact me.

"I would also like to remind residents that if they are in any way worried about the intentions of a visitor to their property to ask for identification as they should have no concerns about showing it if they are genuine.

"Never let anyone you do not know into your property if you have any worries about their legitimacy and contact a family member or neighbour and inform the police."
