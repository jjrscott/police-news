# Witness appeal following reported rape in Wimborne

04 November 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating a reported rape in Wimborne are making a direct appeal for two witnesses to come forward.

At around 1.10am today, Sunday 4 November 2018, it is reported a rape occurred inside an address off Eastbrook Row. The victim - a local woman aged in her late teens who had been out for the evening with her uncle - immediately informed him.

An altercation then reportedly occurred between the alleged offender and the victim's uncle outside the nearby Rising Sun pub at 1.30am. Two members of security staff and two members of the public intervened and spoke with those involved.

The victim left to go home and reported the incident to Dorset Police at 2am.

A 48-year-old man from Bournemouth has been arrested on suspicion of rape and is assisting officers with their enquiries.

Detective Sergeant Stef Belton, of Bournemouth CID, said: "A full investigation is underway and the victim is being supported by specially-trained officers.

"As part of our enquiries I am very keen to identify the two people who were outside the Rising Sun pub in the early hours of this morning and witnessed the altercation and spoke to those involved as I believe they may have important information that could assist my investigation.

"I would ask these two individuals to please contact me as soon as possible."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 4:40. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
