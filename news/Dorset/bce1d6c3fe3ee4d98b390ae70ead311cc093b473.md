08 March 2019

* * *

Officers investigating reports of a man impersonating a police officer in Bournemouth have made an arrest.

At 5.36pm on Wednesday 6 March 2019 Dorset Police received a report from a woman in Wellington Road reporting that a suspicious man had attended her address claiming to be a police officer and wanting to search her home. The man was not in uniform.

The woman asked to see the man's ID but he allegedly did not show her.

It is reported the woman let him into a communal area but then told him she was calling police, at which point he left.

At 6.17pm on Thursday 7 March 2019 officers were called to reports that a man had stolen a uniform from the ambulance station in Portchester Road in Bournemouth.

A 17-year-old boy from Bournemouth has been arrested on suspicion of impersonating a police constable and theft and is assisting officers with their enquiries.
