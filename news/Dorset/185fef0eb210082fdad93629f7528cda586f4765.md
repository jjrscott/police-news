# Family tribute following fatal collision in Weymouth

14 June 2018

* * *

The family of a teenage boy who sadly died in a road traffic collision in Weymouth has issued a tribute.

Dorset Police was called to the collision in Portland Road at 3.30pm on Wednesday 6 June 2018 involving a young cyclist and a white Mercedes articulated lorry.

Tragically 14-year-old Rowan Lloyd from Portland died from his injuries.

The driver of the lorry was uninjured.

Rowan's mum, Sara Rushton, said in a statement: "As a family we feel empty without our beautiful, fun loving, happy-go-lucky son, brother, grandson and nephew.

"Rowan is irreplaceable and we will always remember the best of times we had and how privileged we were to have had him in our lives. There'll always be a hole in our hearts that Rowan belongs in."

Rowan's dad said: "Ro - you will always be in my heart. I love you so much robot - love Daddo."

The family would also like to say thank you: "As a family we have been absolutely overwhelmed by the support and compassion shown to us by the community and for that we are very grateful.

"The ambulance staff, police and all professionals involved have been truly incredible throughout and for that we will always be grateful."

A crowdfunding page has been set up for the family https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/rowan-lloyd.
