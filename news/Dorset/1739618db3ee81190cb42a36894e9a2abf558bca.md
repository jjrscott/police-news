# Update - appeal following reported rape in Wimborne

05 November 2018

* * *

A man arrested in connection with a reported rape in Wimborne has been released under investigation.

At around 1.10am on Sunday 4 November 2018 it is reported a rape occurred inside an address off Eastbrook Row. The victim - a local woman aged in her late teens who had been out for the evening with her uncle - immediately informed him.

An altercation then reportedly occurred between the alleged offender and the victim's uncle outside the nearby Rising Sun pub at 1.30am. Two members of security staff and two members of the public intervened and spoke with those involved.

A 48-year-old man from Bournemouth who was arrested on suspicion of rape has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.
