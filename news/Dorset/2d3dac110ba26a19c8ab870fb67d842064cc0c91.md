# Statement regarding incident in Bournemouth

07 August 2018

* * *

At 8.26pm on Tuesday 7 August 2018, armed officers stopped a vehicle containing three people along Castle Lane West in Bournemouth. This was in relation to an ongoing investigation into a reported serious assault in Wimborne Road on Thursday 2 August.

During the incident, police discharged a firearm. One man from the vehicle sustained a gunshot wound to the arm and was taken to hospital for treatment. His condition is not believed to be life-threatening.

A second man from the vehicle - a 36-year-old - was arrested by officers at the scene. A woman was also in the vehicle. Neither suffered any injuries.

A cordon has been put in place. As is normal in such circumstances the matter has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct which is responsible for investigating the circumstances.

For operational reasons we cannot go into any further details at this time.
