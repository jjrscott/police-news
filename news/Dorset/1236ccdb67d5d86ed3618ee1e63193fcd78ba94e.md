# Appeal for information following reported dangerous driving incident in Bournemouth

01 September 2019

* * *

Detectives investigating a reported dangerous driving incident in Boscombe are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

At around 6.40pm on Friday 30 August 2019 officers from the local neighbourhood policing team attempted to stop the occupants of a grey Range Rover that had just parked in The Sovereign Centre car park.

They parked their unmarked police vehicle directly behind the Range Rover and approached the vehicle on foot.

The Ranger Rover then reportedly moved forward and collided with a wall before reversing back and colliding with the police vehicle then driving off, causing one of the officers to have to take evasive action.

Another officer arrived in a marked police car and the Range Rover was stopped in the car park.

Nobody was injured during the incident.

A 50-year-old Bournemouth man was arrested and has been charged with dangerous driving, criminal damage, failing to provide a specimen for analysis, failing to stop when required by a constable and driving without valid insurance. He is due to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Monday 2 September 2019.

Detective Constable Rebecca Joyce, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We are continuing to make enquiries into this incident and I would urge any witnesses to please contact us.

"I would also ask anyone who was in the area at the time who has dashcam fitted to their vehicle to check their footage for anything relevant."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190136758. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
