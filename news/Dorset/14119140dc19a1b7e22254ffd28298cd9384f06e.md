Officers are appealing for witnesses following a fatal road traffic collision in Ferndown.

The incident happened at 2.35pm today, Saturday 28 January 2017, on Victoria Road near to the junction with Westwood Avenue.

A white Renault Clio being driven by a 23-year-old Ferndown woman was in collision with a white Kawasaki motorcycle ridden by a 67-year-old Wimborne man.
