# Witness appeal following assault in Bournemouth

05 November 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward as they investigate an assault on a man in a Bournemouth park.

The victim, aged in his 70s, was walking through Redhill Park at around 1pm on Sunday 3 November 2019 when he was approached by a group of teenagers on bicycles and assaulted.

The man had challenged the group of around six or seven male teenagers as they rode past him on the footpath in the middle of the park at speed. He was then dragged to the ground and kicked to the lower back and head several times.

The victim sustained a cut and bruising to his head as well as internal bruising to his lower back.

The main offender in the group of teenagers is described as white, of chubby build and around five feet ten inches tall with brown, cropped, medium-length hair. He was wearing a full navy blue tracksuit, possibly with Slazenger branding.

Police Constable Liam Pryer, of North Bournemouth police, said: "This was a cowardly attack on an elderly man and we are carrying out a detailed investigation to identify the offenders.

"I would urge anyone who witnessed the assault or who has any information that can assist our investigation to please contact us.

"The incident occurred around 100 metres from Redhill Avenue on the path leading from Hill View Road and I understand there were at least two other people in the area who may have seen what happened."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190173467. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
