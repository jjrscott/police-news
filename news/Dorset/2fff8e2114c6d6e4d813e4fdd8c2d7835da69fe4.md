# Appeal after distraction burglary in Poole

18 November 2016

* * *

Detectives investigating a distraction burglary in Poole are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward.

The incident happened at around midday on Thursday 17 November 2016 at an address in the Old Farm Road area.

A local female pensioner answered the door and a man, described as in his 20s and smartly dressed, told her that he needed to get into the back garden to mend a fence for the neighbour.

The man was allowed access to the property where he opened a rear window before going out into the garden. He then stated that he needed to get some tools but did not return.

Detective Constable Christian Bryant, of Bournemouth and Poole CID, said: "It is believed that while the pensioner was distracted another person entered the property and stole a black leather handbag containing a large amount of money.

"I am appealing for anyone who may have seen a man acting suspiciously or matching the description in the area at the time to contact us.

"Victims of bogus callers or distraction burglaries are usually elderly and live by themselves and I'd urge everyone to help reduce the chance that the people you care about and your elderly neighbours are subject to this type of crime.

"Do not buy, sell or sign up to any work on the doorstep no matter how urgent they say the work is. If you are suspicious of the caller's intentions, tell them to go away and call a family member or neighbour and inform the police. If they won't leave, then call 999."

Members of the public should consider the following advice when answering the door:

LOCKED - Is the back door locked?
STOP - Am I expecting anyone?
CHAIN - Put the chain on BEFORE opening the door.
CHECK - Ask for the caller's identification. Shut the door leaving the caller on the doorstep and phone the number in the phone book NOT the one on the card they give you, as this could be an accomplice around the corner - especially if it is a mobile number. A genuine caller will be happy to wait while you do this.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 17:169. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
