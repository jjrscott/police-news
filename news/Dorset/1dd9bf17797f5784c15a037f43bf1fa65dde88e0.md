# Witness appeal following serious injury collision on Portland

09 June 2016

* * *

Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a serious collision on Portland.

At 11.22pm last night, Wednesday 8 June 2016, a single vehicle collision occurred on Portland Beach Road when a blue Mitsubishi Shogun, registered to a Portland man, overturned.

The driver - a 70-year-old local man - sustained serious injuries. His condition is not described as life-threatening but he remains in Dorset County Hospital undergoing treatment to his arm.

The road was closed while officers investigated the cause of the collision. It was reopened at around 1.30am.

Police Constable Mike Henstridge, of Dorset Police's Traffic Unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or who saw the manner of driving of the vehicle prior to the incident to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly keen to trace a white or light coloured hatchback car that is believed to have been in area at the time of the collision. I would urge the driver of this vehicle to please get in touch."

Witnesses and anyone with information should call Dorset Police in confidence on 101, quoting incident number 8:473. Alternatively, call the free and anonymous Crimestoppers line on 0800 555 111, where mobile phone tariffs may apply.
