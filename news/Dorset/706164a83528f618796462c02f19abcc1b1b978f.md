# Witness appeal following serious collision in Christchurch

09 August 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a serious injury road traffic collision in Christchurch are appealing for witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage of the incident to come forward.

Dorset Police was called at 10.29am today, Friday 9 August 2019, to a report of a collision on Barrack Road, outside the Premier Inn hotel.

The collision involved a white Volvo lorry and a grey Mazda 6, which subsequently collided with a wall of the hotel as well as a number of parked vehicles in the car park.

Officers attended, along with the ambulance and fire services, and the driver of the Mazda - a woman aged in her 80s from Christchurch - was freed from the vehicle before being airlifted to Southampton General Hospital. Her condition is described as life-threatening.

The woman's family has been informed and are being supported by officers.

The driver of the lorry was uninjured and no other members of the public were involved.

Road closures were put in place to allow the emergency services to respond to the incident and for an examination of the scene to take place.

Police Sergeant Fern Graham, of the traffic unit, said: "We are carrying out a full investigation into this collision to establish what happened and our thoughts are with the family of the injured woman.

"I would urge any witnesses or anyone who was driving in the area at the time and may have relevant dashcam to contact us.

"I would also like to thank motorists and members of the public for their patience during the road closures, which have been necessary to allow ourselves and emergency services colleagues to respond to this incident and for a detailed examination of the scene to be carried out."
