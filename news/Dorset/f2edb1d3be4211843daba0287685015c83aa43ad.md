# Distraction burglary in Dorchester â€“ witness appeal

08 March 2017

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a distraction burglary in Dorchester.

The incident happened at around 2pm yesterday, Tuesday 7 March 2017, at an address in the Celtic Crescent area of the town.

The victim - who is aged over 80 - had left her front door insecure after receiving a home visit from the doctor. Immediately after the visit and while she was in her kitchen cooking, an unknown man approached her. He placed his arm around her shoulder and asked if she wanted any trees or hedges cut. The victim told the offender she did not require any work and he left.

At approximately 11.15pm that evening she noticed that her purse, containing money and a bank card, was missing. She last recalled seeing it on her walking aid in the kitchen.

The offender is described as white, aged in his late 40s or early 50s, five feet eight inches tall and of very large build with a fat face. He was wearing a light-coloured jacket and spoke with a local accent.

Detective Constable Sarah Desmond, of Weymouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who saw a man matching the description given in the Celtic Crescent area yesterday afternoon to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would like to remind residents to ensure they keep their doors locked at all times regardless of whether they are expecting a visit. A genuine visitor will not mind waiting while you answer the door."
