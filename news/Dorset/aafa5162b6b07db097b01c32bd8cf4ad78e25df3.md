# Witness appeal following assault in Poole

12 February 2020

* * *

Officers investigating an assault in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 2am on Sunday 2 February 2020 a man aged in his 40s was walking near to Munchies on Old Orchard Road when he saw a woman in distress, so he went over to see if she was all right. The woman, who was with two men, became verbally abusive towards the victim, and one of the men grabbed him by his hood and pulled him to the floor, before repeatedly hitting him in the face.

The victim managed to free himself and began walking up the High Street in the direction of the Dolphin Centre. The two men followed him. One of them pushed the victim to the floor, held him down and began hitting him in the face, before placing both thumbs over his eyes and starting to push. The offender stopped when the victim - in a bid to escape - pretended to become unconscious.

The men then left the area.

The victim suffered severe bruising under both eyes as a result of the assault, along with multiple bruises and grazes on his face, as well as bloodshot eyes.

The first man is described as white, aged in his 20s, around five feet eight inches tall, with short, dark hair with a straight fringe. He was wearing a black jumper and grey tracksuit bottoms. The second man is described as white, aged in his 30s, around five feet 11 inches tall and with short, black hair. He was wearing black clothing and a beige jacket.

Police Constable Ryan Malcolm, of Poole police, said: "We are carrying out a full investigation to identify the offenders of this particularly nasty and unprovoked assault, which understandably left the victim very shaken.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed what happened or who has any information about who is responsible to please contact us."
