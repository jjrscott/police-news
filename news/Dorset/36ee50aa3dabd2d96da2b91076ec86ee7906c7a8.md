# Update â€“ witness appeal following reported stabbing in Boscombe

11 May 2018

* * *

A second man has been arrested in connection with an alleged stabbing in Boscombe.

Dorset Police was called by the ambulance service just before 8pm on Wednesday 2 May 2018 to Windsor Road following reports that a man had sustained stab wounds to his upper body. The alleged stabbing is reported to have occurred in nearby Cecil Road.

The injured man, who is aged in his 20s, was taken to Southampton General Hospital by air ambulance for emergency treatment. His condition was initially described as potentially life-threatening but he has since been released from hospital.

A 25-year-old Bournemouth man previously arrested on suspicion of attempted murder remains released under investigation.

A 21-year-old man, also from Bournemouth, has also now been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and released under investigation.

Detectives are still looking to locate a third suspect, who was the subject of a CCTV appeal issued on Wednesday 9 May 2018.
