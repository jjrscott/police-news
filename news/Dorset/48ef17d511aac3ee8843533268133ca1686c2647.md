# Witness appeal after attempted rape in Poole

03 April 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses after an attempted rape in Poole.

The incident occurred at around 8pm on Monday 2 April 2018 in Sherborn open space near to the junction of Verity Crescent and Adastral Road in Canford Heath.

The victim - a woman aged in her 20s - entered the park when a man approached her from behind, grabbed her around the waist and put a hand over her mouth. She elbowed him in the stomach and released herself from his grip, turned around and kicked him between his legs causing him to fall to his knees. The victim then managed to run away.

The offender is described as white, five feet seven inches tall and of medium build. He had dark hair with a long bit at the front and was wearing black trainers, blue jeans, a grey hooded top and a black scarf. He was also described as smelling of alcohol.

Detective Sergeant Andy Haworth, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was an understandably traumatic incident for the victim and she is being supported by specially-trained officers. A detailed investigation is now underway.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed a man acting suspiciously in the area around the time of the offence to please come forward.

"We have been making various enquiries since the incident, including investigating the scene, house-to-house enquiries and checking the availability of CCTV."
