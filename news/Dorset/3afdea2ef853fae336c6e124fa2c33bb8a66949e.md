# Witness appeal after two cars set alight in Poole

13 July 2016

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward after two cars were set alight in Poole.

Sometime between 4am and 5am today, Wednesday 13 July 2016, offenders set fire to two vehicles parked in Puddletown Crescent and Warmwell Close in the Canford Heath area.

The fire service attended each incident to deal with the blaze. Both vehicles - a Ford KA and a Toyota Corolla - were left badly damaged.

Detective Constable Neil Jones, of Bournemouth CID, said: "It is believed that some kind of accelerant was used to set fire to a tyre on each vehicle.

"I am appealing to anyone who saw someone acting suspiciously in the Canford Heath area in the early hours of this morning to please contact Dorset Police."

Witnesses and anyone with information should call Dorset Police in confidence on 101 quoting occurrence number 55160104954. Alternatively, call the free and anonymous Crimestoppers line on 0800 555 111 where mobile phone tariffs may apply.
