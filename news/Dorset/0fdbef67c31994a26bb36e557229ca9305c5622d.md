A man is due to appear in court in connection with alleged criminal damage to a bus shelter in Weymouth.

It was reported that at around 11.55pm on Wednesday 5 February 2020 a man was seen kicking over bins in St Thomas Street and jumped through a glass pane of a bus shelter.

Officers attended and, following enquiries, a 27-year-old man from Merthyr Tydfil in Wales was arrested. He has now been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Friday 20 March 2020 for an offence of criminal damage.
