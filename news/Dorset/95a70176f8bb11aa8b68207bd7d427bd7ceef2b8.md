07 August 2020

* * *

Detectives investigating a reported stabbing incident in Poole are appealing for any passing witnesses or motorists with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

Dorset Police was called at 6.11am on Friday 7 August 2020 to reports of a stabbing in Adastral Road outside Magna Academy.

A local man aged in his 30s sustained injuries to his head and was taken to hospital for treatment. His condition is not described as serious.

A cordon is in place outside the school and in Warburton Road to Ashdown Close to allow for investigators to examine the scene.

A 29-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm. Enquiries are underway to locate and detain a second suspect.

Detective Inspector Amy Burbidge, of Bournemouth CID, said: "A full investigation is underway into this incident, which occurred in the area of Adastral Road, Warburton Road and Ashdown Close.

"I am appealing to anyone who either witnessed what happened or any passing motorists who may have captured relevant footage on their dashcam to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 7:62. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
