Officers investigating a serious injury road traffic collision in Ferndown are appealing for witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage to come forward.

At around 10.55am on Monday 2 December 2019 a collision occurred on New Road involving a green Land Rover Discovery and a pedestrian.

"I would urge any witnesses or anyone who may have captured the collision on dashcam to please contact us.

"Finally, I would like to thank motorists and members of the public for their patience and understanding while the road closures were in place."
