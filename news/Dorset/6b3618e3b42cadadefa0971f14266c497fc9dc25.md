# Three people arrested following drugs warrants across Purbeck

30 August 2018

* * *

During the last week, a series of search warrants have been executed in Swanage, Wareham and Bovington in relation to the supply of controlled drugs.

Officers from Neighbourhood Policing Teams in Poole and Purbeck as well as other specialist departments undertook a total of six warrants across the Purbeck area.

Drugs were located at five of the six addresses, a quantity of cash and valuable items were also located and have been seized by officers as investigations continue.

A 48-year-old Swanage man has been arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A drugs and money laundering offences, and has since been released under investigation.

A 15-year-old boy from the Wareham area was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A and B drugs and has been released under investigation.

A 44-year-old man from Swanage was issued a warning after being found in possession of a class B drug.

A number of other individuals are assisting officers with their enquiries.

In addition to the warrants, a number of proactive operations have been taking place across Purbeck over the Summer. On Sunday 12 August 2018, a 38-year-old Swanage man was arrested for possession with intent to supply class A controlled drugs, and production of a controlled drug. He is currently released under investigation.

Inspector Andy Keel, of the Purbeck Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "This week's operation has come about following several months of proactive and investigative work by my team and would not have been possible without the vast quantity of information fed through to us from the wider Purbeck community.

Purbeck is not a 'soft-touch' and we will deal robustly with anybody believed to be involved in drug dealing.

Those who deal drugs as part of 'county lines' networks often prey on the vulnerable, taking over their homes and trapping them in debt, leading many to turn to crime. This in turn impacts on the wider community.

"There is absolutely no justification for committing crime but we can through effective partnerships safeguard and assist anybody feeling trapped in such a situation.

"Purbeck has one of the lowest crime rates in the country and we strive to keep it that way by deterring and disrupting this kind of criminal activity, we can continue to make Purbeck one of the safest areas to live and work.

"We would encourage residents with any intelligence around drug related activity to get in touch by calling Dorset Police on 101, or if you prefer, you can report confidentially to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
