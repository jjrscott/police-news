# Witness appeal following serious collision in Bournemouth

26 February 2021

* * *

Officers investigating a serious injury road traffic collision in Bournemouth are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

At around 4.35pm on Thursday 25 February 2021 a collision occurred on St Leonard's Road, near to the junction with Stewart Road, involving a silver Ford Transit panel van and a pedestrian.

Emergency services attended and the pedestrian - a Bournemouth man aged in his 20s - was taken to hospital and is being treated for injuries that are believed to be serious but not life-threatening. His family has been informed.

Road closures were put in place to allow officers and the ambulance service to respond to the incident and were lifted at around 7.40pm.

Police Constable Simon Hatch, of the traffic unit, said: "We are carrying out an investigation to establish the full circumstances of this collision and I would urge anyone with information to please come forward.

"I would ask any pedestrians or motorists who were in the area and saw what happened to get in touch if they have not already spoken to police. I would also encourage anyone who was driving in the area and has dashcam fitted to their vehicle to please check their footage for anything of relevance.

"Finally, I would like to thank members of the public for their patience and understanding while the road closures were in place. These were necessary to allow emergency services to respond to the incident and for an examination of the scene to be carried out."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at scit@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210032103. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
