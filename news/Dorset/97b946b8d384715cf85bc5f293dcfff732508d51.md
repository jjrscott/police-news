# Witness appeal following alleged fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth

28 September 2016

* * *

Police in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses after a woman was seriously injured following an alleged fail-to-stop collision in the town.

At around 5.15pm on Tuesday 27 September 2016, a serious road traffic collision occurred on Pine Road when a blue Ford Focus was in collision with a parked unattended Volkswagen Polo and a parked Mini Cooper. The driver of the Focus failed to stop at the scene.

A 35-year-old woman from Blandford, who was collecting items from the back of her car at the time of the collision, sustained life-changing injuries and was taken to Southampton General Hospital by the air ambulance.

Police Sergeant Mark Scammell, of Dorset Police's Road Traffic Unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision, or who saw the Ford Focus being driven immediately before the incident, to please contact Dorset Police.

"The road was closed for several hours while emergency services treated the injured woman and collision investigators examined the scene.

"I would like to thank motorists for their patience during the road closures and members of the public for their assistance at the scene."

A 22-year-old local man was arrested on suspicion of driving offences and has been released on police bail pending further enquiries until the middle of November 2016.
