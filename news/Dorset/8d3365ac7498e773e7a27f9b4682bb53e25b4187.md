# Update in relation to fatal collision in Hamworthy

22 December 2020

* * *

Two boys arrested in connection with a fatal collision in the Hamworthy area of Poole will face no further police action.

At around 10.45pm on Monday 19 October 2020 Dorset Police received a report in relation to a collision involving a teenage boy on a pit bike on the recreation ground between Poole Rugby Football Club and the Turlin Moor estate in the Blandford Road area.

The rider, a 16-year-old local boy, was taken to hospital with serious injuries and very sadly died from his injuries in hospital on Friday 23 October 2020.

It was reported that the bike was involved in a collision with metal railings. When officers arrived at the scene, the pit bike was not there. It was located on the afternoon of Tuesday 20 October 2020.

Two local boys, aged 13 and 16, were arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice and were released under investigation. They have now been released from the investigation and will face no further police action.

Sergeant Craig Tatton, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts remain with the family of the boy who sadly died and they are continuing to be supported by officers.

"Our investigation to establish the full circumstances of this collision is ongoing."
 Local officers are continuing to engage with members of the community affected by this incident and can be approached by anyone with concerns. They can also be contacted via the Force website at www.dorset.police.uk/neighbourhood-policing/.
