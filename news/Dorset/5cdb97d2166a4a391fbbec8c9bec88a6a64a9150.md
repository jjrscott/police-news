# Update â€“ man due in court in connection with serious collision near Gillingham

24 December 2020

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with a serious road traffic collision near Gillingham.

Dorset Police received a report at 7.13pm on Sunday 21 June 2020 of a collision on New Road - the B3092 - south of the town involving a purple Mini Cooper and a silver Land Rover Discovery.

The driver of the Mini sustained serious injuries and was airlifted to Southampton General Hospital for treatment.

The 32-year-old man from Gosport in Hampshire has since been discharged and has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 5 January 2021 for an offence of driving without due care and attention.

None of the other occupants of either vehicle sustained any serious injuries.
