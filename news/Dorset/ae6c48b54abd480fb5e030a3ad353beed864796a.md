# Update â€“ appeal following suspicious incident in Poole

02 November 2017

* * *

A man has come forward following a suspicious incident in Poole that sparked a police search.

At 5.30pm yesterday, Wednesday 1 November 2017, Dorset Police received reports that a man entered the Dancing Moose public house in Station Road in Ashley Cross wearing a balaclava and with canisters taped to his body with duct tape.

The man did not say anything and left shortly afterwards.

An extensive search was carried out involving the police helicopter and armed officers in order to locate the man and protect the public.

Subsequent enquiries established that two other men appeared to be with the man filming the incident.

One of the men believed to be involved has now contacted police to claim it was a prank and that there was no viable device involved. He is assisting with enquiries.

At this stage no arrests have been made and detectives are continuing to investigate.
