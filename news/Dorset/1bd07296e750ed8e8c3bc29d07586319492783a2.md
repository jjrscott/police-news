# Witness appeal following armed robbery near Sherborne

10 January 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating an armed robbery at a store near Sherborne are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 12.30pm on Tuesday 9 January 2018, Dorset Police received a report of an armed robbery at the Spar store in Yetminster.

It was reported that a man armed with a knife jumped over the counter and stole the till drawer before making off in a Blue Renault Clio. The vehicle was seen to drive off along Thornford Road in the direction of Chetnole.

The till drawer was later recovered near to the scene in Stonyacres.
 The offender was described as white, aged in his 20s and around six feet tall. He was wearing a black coat and a dark beanie hat. Nobody was injured as a result of the incident.

Detective Sergeant Nicky Jenkins, of Weymouth CID, said: "I am appealing for any witnesses to this incident to contact police immediately. I am particularly keen to speak to a woman who was in the shop at the time of the offence who has not yet spoken to police.

"I appreciate this incident has caused concern for the village community and officers have been carrying out reassurance patrols in the area."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 9:153. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
