# Arrest made after alleged aggravated burglary in Christchurch

20 February 2017

* * *

Detectives have made an arrest in relation to an alleged aggravated burglary where an elderly woman was reportedly tied up and burgled in her own home in Christchurch.

The incident happened at around 9.30pm on Wednesday 1 February 2017 in the Oak Avenue area when the victim heard a knock at her front door.

She opened the door and a man and a woman wearing scarves over their faces allegedly forced themselves into her address.

They reportedly tied the victim to a chair with cable ties and stole cash and jewellery from the address before leaving.

The victim - aged in her 80s - managed to free herself from the ties and contact police. She suffered some bruising.

A 32-year-old Bournemouth woman was arrested on Saturday 18 February 2017 on suspicion of robbery and is currently on police bail until the beginning of May 2017 pending further enquiries.

Enquiries are ongoing in relation to the second suspect.
