# Family name man who died in Bournemouth collision

04 October 2017

* * *

The family of a man who sadly died in an alleged fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth has named and paid tribute to him.

At around 10.39pm on Tuesday 3 October 2017 it was reported that a collision involving a cyclist had occurred on the A338 Spur Road southbound around one mile from the Ashley Heath roundabout.

It is alleged the driver of the vehicle that struck the cyclist failed to stop at the scene. A search of the area was carried out and, following extensive enquiries, a white Mercedes van suspected to be involved was located in the Nursling area of Southampton in the early hours of this morning, Wednesday 4 October 2017.

Sadly, the cyclist - 30-year-old Christopher Gibbs from Poole - was pronounced dead at the scene.

A statement on behalf of his family, said: "Christopher was a well-loved and respected son who his family were very proud of. We wish to thank everyone for their kind words and support and would request privacy at this deeply upsetting time."

A full investigation is underway to establish the exact circumstances of the collision.

A 57-year-old man from Southampton has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and failing to stop at the scene of a collision. A 57-year-old woman, also from Southampton, has been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. The pair are currently helping officers with their enquiries.

Inspector Matt Butler, of the traffic unit, said: "I am keen to hear from anyone who was in the area of Verwood, the A31 or the A338 between 9.30pm and 10.40pm last night and may have seen a cyclist."
