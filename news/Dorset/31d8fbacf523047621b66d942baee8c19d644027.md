"An investigation is underway into this collision and I would urge anyone who may have witnessed the incident, or has relevant dashcam footage to assist my enquiries, to please get in touch.

"I would like to thank the public for their patience and understanding while the road closure is in place. It is absolutely necessary to allow us to carry out a thorough examination of the scene."
