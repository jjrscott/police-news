Officers investigating a reported assault and a series of burglaries in the Bridport and Lyme Regis area over Christmas say a man has come forward.

The assault is reported to have occurred at Esso petrol station shop on East Road in Bridport at around 1.30am on Wednesday 26 December 2018.

The reported burglaries are said to have occurred in Lyme Regis at the Ocean View Restaurant on Marine Parade, Boots and the Red Panda on Broad Street.

The alarm was also set off at nearby Arthur Fordham & Co but no entry was gained and nothing was stolen.

A 33-year-old man has contacted officers after seeing the appeal and is assisting with the investigation. No arrests have been made.
