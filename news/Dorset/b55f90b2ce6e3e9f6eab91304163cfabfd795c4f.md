* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a woman was assaulted in an unprovoked attack in Wool.

At 11.30pm on Thursday 2 May 2019 the victim - a woman aged in her 40s - was putting her rubbish out into a communal area between Toll Gate and The Briars when she was approached from behind by an unknown man and assaulted. The offender also made verbal threats to the victim.

She sustained cuts to her hands and face.

Officers attended and carried out a search of the area but no one was located. House-to-house and CCTV enquiries have also been carried out. No arrests have been made.

Police Constable Tony Tyndall, of Wareham police, said: "It is believed this was a targeted assault but at this time we do not know why or who was responsible. I am appealing to anyone who was in the area and saw or heard anything suspicious to please contact Dorset Police."
