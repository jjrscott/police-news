# Witness appeal following distraction burglary in Bournemouth

14 March 2019

* * *

Detectives are appealing for the public's help following a distraction burglary in Bournemouth.

At around midday on Sunday 10 March 2019 a man knocked on the door of an address in Redbreast Road and told the elderly female resident that he had been on the roof of an adjoining property and claimed he had noticed she had a loose tile on her roof.

The victim told the offender she did not have any money and would need to go to the bank to get some cash out.

The offender offered to go to the local Co-Op to get cash out for her. The victim made the offender a cup of tea and he then left with her bank card but failed to return.

The victim subsequently discovered the offender had left a set of large ladders outside of her address.

Enquiries are underway to establish whether the bank card has been used.

The offender is described as white, aged around 30 years old, of pale complexion and carried a note book in his hand.

Detective Constable Luke Davis, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who saw a man acting suspiciously in the Redbreast Road area on Sunday to please contact me. I am also keen to hear from anyone who may have been approached by a man in a similar manner.

"A set of ladders were left at the scene. These were very bulky and heavy and may have been stolen nearby by the offender. I would ask anyone who may have had ladders stolen in the area recently to please get in touch.

"Finally, I would like to ask residents to be vigilant and not be forced or coerced into commissioning work by people who turn up unexpectedly, even if you are told it's urgent."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190036751. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
