# Appeal for information after woman bitten by dog in North Dorset

06 April 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for the public's help to identify the owner of a dog that bit a woman in North Dorset.

During the morning of Wednesday 25 March 2020 a local woman aged in her 60s was walking her dog on the North Dorset Trailway, known locally as the Shillingstone Trailway, when she entered a field off the footpath in the direction of Child Okeford.

A young boy was in the field and shouted back to a woman. Four dogs then entered the field and the largest one, which was similar to a St Bernard, approached the victim and bit her on the leg. This caused her skin to pierce and bruise.

The woman did not speak to the victim and took the dog away from her.

The owner of the four dogs is described as white, aged in her late 30s or early 40s and of stocky build with short blonde hair.

Police Constable Jennie Sykes, of Dorset Police, said: "This incident has had a lasting impact on the victim and she is now finding alternative routes to walk her dog.

"While I appreciate this took place over a week ago, I am hoping someone may recognise the owner of the four dogs from the description given.

"If you were the woman walking the four dogs on that day, please get in touch so we can speak to you and establish the full circumstances of what happened."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200044499. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
