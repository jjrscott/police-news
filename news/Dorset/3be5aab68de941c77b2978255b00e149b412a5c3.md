# Update â€“ man arrested in connection with reported assault and criminal damage incident in Bournemouth

21 August 2019

* * *

A man has been arrested in connection with a reported assault and criminal damage incident in Bournemouth.

At approximately 8.30pm on Tuesday 4 June 2019 it was reported that a man and a woman were eating in The Christopher Creeke pub on Holdenhurst Road when an altercation occurred with a staff member over the quality of their food.

The woman allegedly threw bottles of sauce at the staff member, however they managed to avoid them and no injuries were sustained.

When leaving the pub, the woman was reportedly then seen to take a painting off the wall and throw it on the floor, breaking the glass frame.

A member of the public tried to intervene but was allegedly assaulted by the woman and sustained a cut to his arm.

After the suspects had left the address, it was reported that the man returned and threatened members of the public with a crowbar.

Following enquiries by officers and a CCTV appeal, a 28-year-old Bournemouth man has been arrested on suspicion of assault and using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause fear of or provoke unlawful violence. He has been released under investigation as officers continue to make enquiries.
