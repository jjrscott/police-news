# Image appeal following public order incident in Weymouth

23 December 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a public order incident in Weymouth are issuing an image of a man they would like to speak to.

It was reported that at about 12pm on Monday 7 December an enforcement officer was issuing a ticket in relation to a red Vauxhall vehicle that was parked on double yellow loading bay lines on Westham Road outside of the Wilko store.

The enforcement officer was then approached by a man who was swearing and questioning why he was being given a ticket. The man then made threats and was verbally abusive toward both the enforcement officer and another male member of the public.

The man left the area when he was advised that police were going to be contacted.

Police Constable Sian Maynard, of Dorset Police, said: "We have been carrying out enquiries into this incident and have made efforts to identify the man involved through the vehicle registration but these have proved unsuccessful.

"I am now issuing an image of the man and would ask anyone with information as to his identity to please contact us.

"I appreciate the image is not the best quality but he has distinctive clothing on and I am hoping someone will be able to recognise him."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200183911. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
