# Family tribute following fatal road traffic collision on Portland

03 July 2017

* * *

The family of a man who died following a road traffic collision on Portland are paying tribute to him.

At 11.25pm on Wednesday 28 June 2017 Dorset Police was informed of the incident along the Portland Beach Road, involving a blue BMW and a grey Peugeot 2008.

Sadly, 72-year-old Mervyn Thomas, who was a passenger in the Peugeot died from his injuries the following afternoon.

His wife Lin Thomas and their daughter Suzanne have released the following statement: "Words fail to convey the great sadness felt by myself, my daughter Suzanne and her son, following Mervyn's death.

"The utter tragedy of the similarities between the death of Mervyn and that of our son Gareth nearly 13 year ago seems particularly cruel."

Gareth died on 18 July 2004 when his motorcycle was involved in a collision with another vehicle on the Coast Road from Weymouth to Bridport.

Lin and Suzanned added: "Despite the communication difficulties Mervyn experienced, following a Stroke in 2000, those close to him will remember him as loving all social events. His huge laugh would fill a room, we will forever miss hearing it.

"Our thanks go to all family and friends that have expressed messages of love and support, you are all equally in our thoughts. The teams of professionals that assisted at the scene of the collision, attended to Mervyn at Dorchester Hospital and now the excellent communication and compassion shown by Mark our Family Liaison Officer has been truly amazing."

Police Constable Mark Palmer, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts remain with Mervyn's family. They have asked for privacy at this very difficult time.

"Our investigation is still ongoing. Therefore we need any witnesses to the collision or the manner of driving of either vehicle prior to it, who have not yet spoken with an officer, to come forward."
