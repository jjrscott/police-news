# Witness appeal following assault in Weymouth

04 May 2017

* * *

Officers investigating an assault in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At approximately 9.20pm on Sunday 23 April 2017 the victim was walking his dog along Radipole Lane opposite the fire station when a man shone a green laser pen into the eyes of the dog.

The laser caused the dog to bolt forward and aggravated an existing back injury the victim had received.

The victim - a local man aged in his 40s - fell to the ground and the offender shone the pen into the man's eyes before leaving the scene.

The offender is described as white, six feet tall, of medium build and was wearing a brown jacket.

Police Constable Gareth Morris, of Weymouth police, said: "Due to the circumstances of the assault, the victim is likely to have to undergo surgery to repair damage caused to his back following this incident.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed this incident or who saw a man with a laser in the area on that evening to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170059225. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
