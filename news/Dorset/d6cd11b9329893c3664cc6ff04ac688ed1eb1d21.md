Officers investigating the attempted robbery of a man in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 9.25am on Friday 24 May 2019 the victim, a 19-year-old local man, entered Kings Park from the Ashley Road entrance when he was approached by two male suspects.

One of the suspects demanded money from the victim who refused. The victim was then punched in the face causing him to fall to the floor. He was then punched and kicked by both suspects.

The victim was treated at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital for injuries to his face, which are not life-threatening or life-changing.

The offenders are described as white, aged between 15 and 17 years old, approximately five feet nine inches tall and of slim build with short blond hair. One was wearing a black jacket with a Nike logo and the other was wearing a burgundy Fila jacket.

Police Constable Alex Browning, of Bournemouth police, said: "This was an unprovoked incident and I am carrying out a number of enquiries to identify the offenders involved.

"I am appealing for any witnesses to the incident or anyone with information to get in touch."
