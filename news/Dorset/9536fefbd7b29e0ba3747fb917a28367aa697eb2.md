# Update – appeal after reported theft of Lego in Poole

30 May 2018

* * *

Two women are due to appear in court in connection with a reported series of high-value Lego thefts in Poole.

It was reported that on Monday 15 May 2017 at around 7.30pm four boxes of Lego, with a value of £858, were stolen from the Tesco store at Tower Park.

Officers received a further report that around ten minutes later Lego with a total value of £1,363.85 had been stolen from the Toys R Us store in Nuffield Road.

Two women, aged 38 and 41 and both from Southampton, have been issued with postal requisitions to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 1 June 2018 for two offences of theft.

A 39-year-old Bournemouth man who was arrested on suspicion of theft has been released without charge.
