Officers are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following a serious road traffic collision in Christchurch - with one man being arrested.

The incident happened at around 2.36am this morning, Saturday 15 October 2016, on the B3059 near to the Somerford roundabout.

The collision involved a yellow Fiat Punto and a blue Citroen Saxo. Each vehicle was occupied by four people.

The front seat passenger of the Punto, a 20-year-old man from New Milton, was taken to Southampton Hospital with life-threatening injuries but his condition is described as stable.

Four other people attended hospital for non-life-threatening injuries.

Police Sergeant Rhiannon Stroud, of Dorset Police's Road Policing Team, said: "I am appealing for any witnesses to the incident to contact police.

"Also, I would like to hear from anyone who saw the manner of driving of either vehicle leading up to the collision."

A 22-year-old man from New Milton was arrested on suspicion of driving offences and has been bailed until late October 2016.
