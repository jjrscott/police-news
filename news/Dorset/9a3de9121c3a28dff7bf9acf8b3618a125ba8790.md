# Murder investigation in Sherborne â€“ man charged

23 May 2019

* * *

Detectives investigating the death of a pensioner in Sherborne have charged a man with murder.

At 5.11pm on Tuesday 21 May 2019 Dorset Police received a report of a serious assault at an address in Ridgeway.

Officers attended together with the ambulance service. The victim - named by detectives as 73-year-old Robert Hodgson - was taken to hospital by air ambulance, where sadly he later died. His family is being supported by specially trained officers.

A post-mortem examination was carried out on Wednesday 22 May 2019, which concluded that he died as a result of a head injury.

Today, Thursday 23 May 2019, his son Dominic William Hodgson - aged 36 and from Sherborne - has been charged with murder and is due to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Friday 24 May 2019.

The investigation is being led by detectives from Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT).

Detective Inspector Simon Huxter, of Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team, said: "Our enquiries into the full circumstances of the incident are ongoing.

"Following a fast moving and detailed investigation, we have consulted with the Crown Prosecution Service who authorised the charge.

"Family liaison officers have updated Robert's family with this development and our thoughts are with them all at this extremely difficult time.

"A cordon remains in place around an address in Ridgeway while crime scene investigators examine the scene.

"Residents will see officers conducting house-to-house enquiries. However, if anyone has any information relating to the incident I would ask that they please contact Dorset Police.

"Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team are continuing to carry out high visibility patrols in the area over the coming days to offer reassurance to the community and can be contacted with any concerns.

"It is important to stress - as is typical in such circumstances - that it would be entirely inappropriate for Dorset Police to comment further ahead of the trial. It is vital that the justice system is allowed to follow its course."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 21:349. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
