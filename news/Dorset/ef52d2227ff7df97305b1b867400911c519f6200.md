# Update - appeal after reported distraction burglary in Dorchester

25 September 2017

* * *

A woman has been arrested following a distraction burglary in Dorchester.

The victim, aged in her 80s, was at home at her address in The Grove when it was reported that she was visited by a woman she assumed to be the relief warden at around 12.15pm on Thursday 3 August 2017.

The woman allegedly walked past the victim into the front room and left the property when the victim's carer arrived. The victim later discovered Â£45 had been taken from her purse.

A 52-year-old Dorchester woman has been arrested on suspicion of burglary and released under investigation.
