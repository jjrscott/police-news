# New Dorset Police contact point to open

26 September 2016

* * *

Following the successful pilot of the volunteer contact point service in Dorchester, Dorset Police is launching an additional contact point for the public from the iconic Boscombe Police Box.

The volunteer contact point service was piloted earlier this year in response to changes to Dorset Police counter service provisions. Along with improvements to the 'Do it Online' function of the Dorset Police website, the community contact points provide another alternative way for members of the public to get in touch with the Force.

The new contact point will be handled by Dorset Police volunteers, who will be trained to provide support to members of the public. This will include help and support with online services, 101 telephone access, crime prevention information and signposting to alternative agencies, where relevant.

To administer the new services from the Boscombe Police Box, Dorset Police is seeking to recruit public contact volunteers to fulfil a public-facing and highly important service to the local community.

East Bournemouth Neighbourhood Inspector, Alan Setchell, said: "I am confident that the early successes of the Dorchester contact point service, which have brought the police into the community in an innovative way, can be replicated and built upon in Boscombe.

"I would like to see the Boscombe Police Box becoming a focal point for the community, providing a service that reflects the community we police. With a growing Polish community, I am pleased to already have on board a Polish volunteer who can help us address language barrier issues and improve the accessibility of the service we provide.

"I am committed to developing the contact point as a platform for proactive, community engagement events that will run throughout the year, focusing on the key issues facing Boscombe, from anti-social behaviour to more general crime prevention advice.

"All of our contact points provide an opportunity for volunteers to get involved, drive forward change and make a real difference to the community they live in."

Martyn Underhill, Dorset Police and Crime Commissioner, said: "The introduction of a Boscombe community contact point is just one way the public in that area can now get in touch with the police.

"Utilising our crucial police volunteer resources are vital if we are to continue to expand this new service, and provide the public with alternative methods of contacting Dorset Police."
