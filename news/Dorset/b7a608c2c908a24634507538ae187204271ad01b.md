A man has come forward following a CCTV appeal in relation to a reported serious assault in Bournemouth.

The incident occurred at around 10.15pm on Tuesday 7 July 2020 in the Kings Park area. It was reported that a man aged in his 20s had been assaulted and sustained serious injuries to his head.

Following enquiries, two boys - aged 14 and 16 from Bournemouth - were arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm with intent and subsequently released under investigation.

Detectives also released a CCTV appeal to try and identify a man they wanted to speak to as part of their investigation.

A man has now come forward and is assisting them with their enquiries. No further arrests have been made.
