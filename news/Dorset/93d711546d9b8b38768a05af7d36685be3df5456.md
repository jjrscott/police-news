Officers are issuing CCTV images of three people they would like to speak to after fragrances were stolen from a shop in Bournemouth.

At around 5.10pm on Monday 4 January 2021 two men and a woman entered Boots on Commercial Road and concealed over Â£2,000-worth of Chanel perfume, before leaving the store without paying.

Police Sergeant Gareth Bridger, of Dorset Police, said: "Following enquiries I have obtained CCTV images of three people I would like to speak to.

"I would ask anyone with information about their identity to please get in touch."
