# Witness appeal following assault on woman in Weymouth

01 July 2019

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a woman was assaulted by a man in an unprovoked incident at a cemetery in Weymouth.

Sometime between 4am and 5am on Saturday 29 June 2019 the victim - a local woman aged in her 50s - was walking across the grass from the crematorium through the cemetery off Quibo Lane when she was approached from behind by unknown man. He grabbed her and following a struggle the pair fell to the ground.

The woman screamed and kicked the man and he ran away. A member of the public who was in the area raised the alarm. She was taken to hospital for treatment to injuries that were not believed to be serious.

The offender is described as aged in his 20s or 30s, clean shaven, with dark hair, which was shaved at the side and longer on top, and had a tanned complexion. He was wearing a light-coloured hooded top, dark-coloured jeans and grey trainers.

Officers attended and carried out a search of the area but the offender was not located. No arrests have been made.

Detective Sergeant Rhys Griffiths, of Weymouth CID, said: "We are carrying out a full investigation into this incident. At this moment in time we do not know the motive for this incident and a full investigation is underway to identify the man responsible.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the area of the cemetery between the relevant times and either saw or heard anything to please contact Dorset Police.

"Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team will be continuing their proactive patrols in the area and can be approached with any community concerns."
