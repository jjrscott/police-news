# Appeal for witnesses following assault in Poole

13 August 2020

* * *

Officers investigating an assault in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Between 12.20am and 12.40am on Saturday 8 August 2020 two men were walking along the High Street when they came across a fight outside Taco Bell.

One of the men tried to intervene, but he was approached by a man and punched repeatedly in the jaw. The victim - aged in his 20s and from Poole - attended hospital for treatment to a bruised jaw and a broken finger.

The offender is described as white, aged around 20 to 22 years old, five feet 11 inches tall and of medium build with stubble on his face and dark-coloured hair that was slicked back. He was wearing a grey and white checked shirt and shorts.

Police Constable Cara Bradley, of Poole police, said: "I understand there were a number of people in the area who witnessed the incident and I would urge anyone who has not already spoken to police to please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200117311. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
