# Further update in relation to reported restaurant bilking in Christchurch

13 January 2021

* * *

An incident where two people allegedly made off from a Christchurch restaurant without paying their bill has been resolved.

At around 9pm on Wednesday 23 December 2020 a man and woman entered Soho in Church Street and ordered food and drink to the value of Â£68.25. It is reported they left the premises around an hour later without paying their bill.

Following an appeal, the matter has now been resolved and the outstanding value of the bill has been paid to the restaurant. After consulting with victim and taking their wishes into account, no further police action will be taken in relation to this incident.
