# Update â€“ witness appeal following reported fail-to-stop collision in Sturminster Newton

09 July 2018

* * *

A man has been arrested in connection with a reported fail-to-stop collision in Sturminster Newton.

At around 7.20pm on Thursday 5 July 2018 Dorset Police was called to reports of a collision on Manston Road, at the junction with Green Close, involving a green Mini and a silver Chevrolet Kalos.

The driver of the Mini - a local 19-year-old man - sustained a very serious head injury and was taken to Dorset County Hospital. He remains in a serious but stable condition, which is not believed to be life-threatening.

The driver of the Kalos reportedly failed to stop at the scene and the vehicle was located unattended nearby.

A 21-year-old man from the Blandford area has been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving, failing to stop after an accident and failing to report an accident, driving without valid insurance and driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence. He is currently assisting officers with their enquiries.

Officers are still appealing for anyone who witnessed the collision to contact police.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 5:467. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
