# Witness appeal following road traffic collision in Bridport

18 December 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a road traffic collision in Bridport are appealing for witnesses or the driver of the vehicle involved to come forward.

At around 2pm on Tuesday 15 December 2020 a local man aged in his 60s was riding his bicycle along St Swithins Road when he was hit by a wing mirror of a passing car and knocked to the floor.

The victim sustained a broken collar bone.

The female driver of the car, which is described as silver, stopped at the scene and gave the victim a contact number, but this does not work. She is described as aged in her 30s and of slim build with blonde hair.

Police Constable Neil Gauden, of Bridport police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the area and may have witnessed what happened, or captured the incident on dashcam, to please get in touch.

"I would also like to appeal directly to the female driver involved to come forward so we can take an account from you."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200188762. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
