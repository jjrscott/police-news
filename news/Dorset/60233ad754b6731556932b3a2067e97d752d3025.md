# Witness appeal following indecent exposure in Poole

06 October 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for the public's help to identify a man who indecently exposed himself in Poole.

At around 10.45pm on Wednesday 27 September 2017 a woman was driving along Parkstone Road past the entrance to Poole Park when she saw a man hiding behind the railings.

The man was then seen to expose himself.

The suspect is described as of Hispanic appearance, aged in his mid-30s, of large build, with dark brown hair styled into a bowl cut. He was wearing a multi-coloured jacket with big colourful stripes that looked like a blanket and jeans. He also carried a backpack.

Police Constable Craig Tiernan, of Poole police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who saw this man in the Poole Park area at the relevant time or recognises him from the description given to please contact Dorset Police."

Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team will be carrying out high visibility patrols in the area to offer reassurance and can be approached with any concerns.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170151328. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
