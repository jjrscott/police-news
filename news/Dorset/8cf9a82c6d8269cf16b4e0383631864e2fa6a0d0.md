# Update: witness appeal following burglaries in North and East Dorset

02 December 2016

* * *

Officers investigating a series of burglaries in North and East Dorset have found a vehicle.

Between Friday 25 November and Tuesday 29 November 2016 there have been a number of reported burglaries to properties in rural areas of Dorset - Blandford, Child Okeford, Lytchett Matravers, Pimperne, Tarrant Gunville, Verwood, Wimborne and Winterborne Whitechurch.

A number of high-value garden machinery items have been stolen including chainsaws, hedge trimmers, tree surgery equipment and leaf blowers.

A silver Volvo estate V70, registration number Y79 LYA, had been seen in the area at the time of each of the incidents.

This vehicle has now been recovered after officers were called to reports of a car alight in Weymans Avenue in Bournemouth at 8.52pm yesterday, Thursday 1 December 2016.

No arrests have been made.

Enquiries into the burglaries continue.

Members of the public should consider the following advice to protect their property:

• Secure access to your outbuilding by locking gates and using thorny bushes next to walls and fences.
• Make a note of serial numbers of equipment and photograph valuable plants and ornaments.
• Use external security lights which are activated by movement.
• Use strong padbars and close shackle padlocks to secure doors and locks or grilles to secure windows.
• Chain cycles, mowers, ladders and tools to a strong anchorage point.
