Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward following a road traffic collision in Weymouth.

At 8.06pm on Friday 30 October 2020 Dorset Police received a report of a two vehicle collision involving a blue Nissan Juke and a silver Mercedes C220 on the A354 between the Veasta roundabout and the Jurassic roundabout.

The driver of the Nissan - a man aged in his 20s - sustained minor injuries and was taken to hospital as a precaution.

The Mercedes driver - a Weymouth man aged in his 40s - was arrested at the scene on suspicion of driving offences and has been released under investigation while enquiries continue. He was also taken to hospital as a precaution.

The road was closed to allow for emergency services to deal with the incident. It reopened at around 11pm.

Police Constable Adam Chudley, of Weymouth police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the area and witnessed the incident, or the manner of driving of either vehicle prior to the collision, to please get in touch.

"I am also keen to speak to any motorists who have dascham fitted to their vehicles and may have captured any relevant footage."
