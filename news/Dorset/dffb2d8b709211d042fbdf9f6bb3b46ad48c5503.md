Detectives have launched a murder investigation following the death of a man at a flat in Poole - with another man having been arrested.

At around 1.35pm today, Sunday 14 August 2016, officers were called to reports of a disturbance at an address in Wessex Road in the town.

On arrival officers discovered that a man aged in his 20s had sustained a serious stab injury. Sadly he was pronounced dead at the scene. His next of kin have yet to be informed. The coroner has been informed.

The circumstances of the man's death are suspicious and a murder investigation, led by Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT), is underway.

A 49-year-old man of no fixed abode has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is currently assisting officer with enquiries.

Detective Chief Inspector Neil Devoto, of the MCIT, said: "Following the discovery of a man's body, Dorset Police has launched a murder investigation.

"Enquiries are now underway to establish exactly what happened earlier today.

"I am appealing for anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious in the Wessex Road area today to contact Dorset Police as soon as possible.

"Officers from the local Neighbourhood Policing Team will be carrying out high visibility patrols in the area to officer reassurance to the community and can be contacted with any concerns."

A cordon has been put in place at the flat while crime scene investigators examine the scene. Officers are also carrying out house-to-house enquiries.
