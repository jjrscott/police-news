# Update â€“ arrest in connection with reported serious assault in Poole

11 January 2021

* * *

A teenager has been arrested in connection with a reported serious assault in Poole.

At around 4.30am on Monday 21 December 2020 an altercation reportedly occurred in the multi-storey car park in Hill Street. A man aged in his 30s sustained a deep laceration to his neck and another man, also aged in his 30s, sustained a stab wound to his back.

Both men were taken to hospital for treatment to serious injuries, but have since been discharged.

Following enquiries and a CCTV appeal, a 16-year-old boy from Poole has been arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent. He has been released on police bail as detectives continue their investigation.

We would like to thank everyone who shared our appeal.
