# Class A drug dealer behind bars

11 December 2020

* * *

A man is behind bars after being caught dealing class A drugs in Bournemouth by an officer on proactive patrols.

Jahvon Robinson, 23 and of Wyke Road in London, was sentenced at Bournemouth Crown Court on Friday 11 December 2020 after previously pleading guilty at the same court to two counts of possession with intent to supply heroin and crack cocaine. He was handed a three-year prison sentence.

On the afternoon of Sunday 10 June 2018 Robinson was seen by an officer on proactive patrol to make a hand-to-hand exchange with suspected drug users near to the East Overcliff Drive toilet block. He then walked around to the entrance of The Suncliff Hotel, made a phone call and met two other suspected drug users who were sitting on a bench near to the cliff top.

The officer approached Robinson and said he was being detained for a drug search. Robinson immediately ran away, careered through the cliff gorse and discarded items and clothes.

Officers from Bournemouth South Neighbourhood Policing Team and Bournemouth East Neighbourhood Policing Team attended and carried out a search of the area. Robinson was detained on the beach front.

Enquiries were carried out and officers established that Robinson and a woman were staying at the hotel. A search of the hotel room and surrounding area was carried out. A plastic bag was located outside the main bedroom window tucked into a metal grill, which contained three bags of suspected class A drugs and a quantity of cash. Cash was also found in a desk inside the room.

Robinson was released under investigation while enquiries continued. He was subsequently forensically linked to a mobile phone found in the room, as well as the seized drugs and was charged.

Police Constable Stuart Grant, of the Bournemouth South Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "Jahvon Robinson operated his drug dealing business from a Bournemouth hotel and he was responsible for selling class A drugs in the town.

"Drug dealing and misuse can blight lives and cause real concern to our communities. Dorset Police is committed to tackling these offences and using all available resources to bring offenders to justice."
