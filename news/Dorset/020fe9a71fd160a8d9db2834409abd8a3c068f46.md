Detectives in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward after an alleged assault in the town centre - with two men being arrested.

The incident happened at around 1.10am on Saturday 28 May 2016 outside Eden Bar, Terrace Road.

The victim sustained a suspected fractured cheekbone and was taken to Poole Hospital for treatment.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have seen what happened to contact me."

A 29-year-old man from Wales and a 30-year-old man from Staffordshire have been arrested on suspicion of assault and are currently on police bail until the beginning of August 2016 pending further enquiries.
