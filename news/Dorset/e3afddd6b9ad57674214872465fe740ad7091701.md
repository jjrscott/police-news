# UPDATE: Appeal following fatal road traffic collision near Wimborne

12 April 2017

* * *

An 84-year-old woman being treated for life-threatening injuries following a collision near Wimborne has sadly died.

The incident happened at around 10.30am on Sunday 12 March 2017 at Badbury Rings on the B3082 at the junction leading to Sturminster Marshall.

A silver Toyota Corolla, travelling from Wimborne to Blandford, collided with a blue Ford Focus, which was going in the opposite direction.

The 85-year-old male driver of the Toyota was taken to Poole hospital and a 64-year-old female passenger went to Salisbury hospital, both from the Trowbridge area. They sustained slight injuries.

The rear passenger of the Toyota, an 84-year-old woman also from the Trowbridge area, was airlifted to Southampton hospital but sadly died yesterday afternoon, Tuesday 11 April 2017, as a result of her injuries. Her next of kin have been informed and the coroner has been notified.

The three occupants of the Ford - a 75-year-old male driver, a 72-year-old woman and an 89-year-old man - are all from the Blandford area and were taken to Poole hospital with slight injuries.

Police Constable Angus Wilson, of the traffic unit, said: "I am still appealing to anyone who has any information about the collision which may help me with my investigation and has yet to speak to officers to please contact Dorset Police."
