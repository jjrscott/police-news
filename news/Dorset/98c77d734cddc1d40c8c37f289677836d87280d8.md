Officers investigating a serious road traffic collision in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

Dorset Police was called at 11.08am on Sunday 18 October 2020 to a report of a collision involving an Audi A3 and a cyclist on Birds Hill Road at the junction with Parkstone Road.

The male cyclist, aged in his 40s, sustained serious injuries and was taken to hospital for treatment by the ambulance service.

The driver of the Audi - a Poole woman aged in her 80s - was uninjured.

Police Sergeant Lee Savage, of the traffic unit, said: "An investigation is underway to establish the full circumstances of this collision.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident and has not already spoken to police to please get in touch.

"I would also urge any motorists who were travelling in the area and have dashcam fitted to their vehicles to please check it for any relevant footage that may assist my enquiries."
