# Appeal following suspicious incident in Poole

01 November 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating a suspicious incident in Poole are urging the individuals involved to come forward.

At 5.30pm today, Wednesday 1 November 2017, Dorset Police received reports that a man entered the Dancing Moose public house in Station Road in Ashley Cross wearing a balaclava and with canisters taped to his body with duct tape.

The man did not say anything and left shortly afterwards.

An extensive search was carried out involving the police helicopter and armed officers in order to locate the man and protect the public.

The man has not been located and no arrests have been made.

Subsequent enquiries have established that two other men appeared to be with the man filming the incident.

Detective Chief Superintendent Mark Callaghan, of Dorset Police, said: "This was a fast-moving incident and, as a result of initial police investigations, it would appear that this incident was a hoax and not someone wearing a viable device.

"However, extensive resources were deployed to the scene in order to ensure members of the public were protected and an investigation is underway.

"I would like to thank the public for their patience and understanding during this incident and praise the professionalism of the officers deployed.

"Investigations are underway to find these three men and I am making a public appeal for them to come forward in order to prevent further valuable police time being wasted."
