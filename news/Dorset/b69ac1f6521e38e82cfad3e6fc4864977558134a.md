# Appeal following reported fraudulent Scottish notes circulated in Bournemouth

08 November 2016

* * *

Police in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a number of counterfeit Scottish notes reportedly being circulated in the town.

On Thursday 3 November 2016 at approximately 12.25am three people travelled in a taxi to Charminster Road in Bournemouth. It is reported that they attempted to pay with a counterfeit Scottish £20 note but made off toward the Golden Supermarket after the driver challenged them.

A 17-year-old boy and an 18-year-old man, both from Basingstoke, and a 19-year-old Bournemouth woman have been arrested on suspicion of fraud and have been released on police bail pending further enquiries until the middle of December 2016.

A quantity of counterfeit Scottish £10 and £20 pound notes have been seized.

They have the following serial numbers: Scottish £10 note 141303 or 331968 and Scottish £20 note 126896.

Investigations Officer Adrian Facey, of Bournemouth CID, said: "It is alleged these notes were being used in shops to purchase small value items in order to receive a large amount of change in genuine currency.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have received one of the counterfeit notes in similar circumstances to come forward.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who has any information which may help me with my investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55160165804. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
