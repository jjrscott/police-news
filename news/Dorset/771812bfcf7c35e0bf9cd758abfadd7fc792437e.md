# Appeal for information following public order incident in Christchurch

24 September 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a public order incident in Christchurch are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

At around 7pm on Wednesday 16 September 2020 a man aged in his 20s was walking his Alsatian dog on the clifftops at Highcliffe near to Beacon Drive. He approached a man who was walking in the opposite direction with a small brown dog, which was the size of a Jack Russel and had a green harness on.

The victim recognised the man with the small dog as someone he had seen three or four times before and his Alsatian had been aggressive toward their dog on previous occasions.

As they approached each other a verbal altercation took place. As the victim went to walk away he turned back and saw the suspect holding a black item three to four inches in length. The suspect made threats to 'cut' the victim.

The victim believes the item he was holding may have been a folding knife, but he did not see a blade.

The man is described as white with a sun tan, aged in his 50s, around five feet nine inches tall and of average build with fair, short, balding hair and stubble. He was wearing a navy blue T-shirt and shorts.

Police Community Support Investigator Richard King, of Dorset Police, said: "We are making enquiries to try and identify the man involved in this incident and I would urge anyone with information that may assist our investigation to please come forward.

"I am also keen to speak to any witnesses, particularly a woman who was seen by the victim shortly after the incident and may have witnessed what happened."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200139924. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
