Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a reported serious assault in Bournemouth.

At 6.51pm today, Sunday 28 July 2019, a report was received that a man had entered a restaurant with stab wounds on Wimborne Road in the Winton area.

It is reported that an assault took place a short time earlier inside an address on Wimborne Road.

The man was flown to hospital by air ambulance for treatment to serious injuries that are not believed to be life-threatening.

A cordon is in place at an address in Wimborne Road while examination of the scene takes place. A section of the road was closed but has now reopened. Officers are also in the area conducting enquiries.

A 28-year-old man from Bournemouth has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. A 29-year-old woman also from Bournemouth has been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. They are currently assisting officers with their enquiries.

Detective Inspector Gavin House, of Bournemouth CID, said: "A full investigation is underway by detectives and I would urge anyone who was in the area at the relevant time and saw or heard anything suspicious to please contact Dorset Police.

"There will be an increased police presence in the area while enquiries are ongoing and officers from the local neighbourhood policing team can be approached with any community concerns."
