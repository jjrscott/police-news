# Update - man arrested following alleged assault in Weymouth

18 February 2019

* * *

A man has been arrested following an alleged Christmas Day assault in Weymouth.

At around 2am on Tuesday 25 December 2018, a man aged in his 50s was walking on Dorchester Road between the Marks and Spencer garage and the Manor roundabout when it was reported he was almost involved in a collision with a grey or silver car that did not have its headlights on.

The pedestrian gestured at the vehicle and a few minutes later when he was walking up the road he was allegedly assaulted from behind with a blunt weapon. He suffered lacerations to his head as well as bruising and swelling and was taken to hospital for treatment.

A 19-year-old man from Weymouth was arrested on suspicion of assault, driving a motor vehicle dangerously and criminal damage. He has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.
