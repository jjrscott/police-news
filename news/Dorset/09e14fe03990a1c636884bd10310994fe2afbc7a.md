19 August 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward following a fatal road traffic collision near Wimborne.

At 8pm on Tuesday 18 August 2020 Dorset Police was called to a report of a two vehicle collision on Blandford Road near to Kingston Lacy involving a white BMW 114i and a white Skoda Fabia.

Officers attended the scene, along with the ambulance and fire services.

The driver of the BMW - a woman aged in her 50s from Warminster in Wiltshire - was very sadly pronounced dead at the scene. Her next of kin has been informed.

The driver of the Skoda - a man aged in his 40s from the Ferndown area - was also very sadly pronounced dead at the scene. His family has been informed.

The road was closed to allow for a thorough examination of the scene to be carried out.

Sergeant Nikki Burt, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts remain with the families of both the man and woman who very sadly died.

"An investigation is underway into this collision and I would ask anyone who witnessed the incident, or either vehicle involved prior to it, and has not yet spoken to officers to please get in touch.

"I am also keen to hear from any motorists with dashcam fitted to their vehicle who may have captured any relevant footage or owners of any properties on Blandford Road with home CCTV systems that cover the road.

"Lastly, I would like to thank the public for their patience and understanding during the road closures. These are absolutely necessary to allow the emergency services to respond to the incident."
