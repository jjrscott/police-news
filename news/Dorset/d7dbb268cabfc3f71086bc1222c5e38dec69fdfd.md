Officers are appealing for the public's help to locate the owner of a suspected stolen iPad.

The iPad 2 was recovered by police in the Bournemouth area on Thursday 18 January 2018 and enquiries to identify and locate the owner have been unsuccessful.

Police Sergeant Jess Pearcey, of Bournemouth police, said: "As part of my enquiries I am keen to reunite this iPad with its owner. I would ask anyone who has either lost or had their iPad stolen on or around Thursday 18 January 2018 in the Bournemouth area to please contact Dorset Police.

"The iPad has an access code so we should be able to identify the rightful owner quickly."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk, or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180009291. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestopper-uk.org.
