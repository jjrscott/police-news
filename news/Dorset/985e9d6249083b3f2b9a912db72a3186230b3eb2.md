# Witness appeal after fail-to-stop collision near Weymouth

24 March 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses after a fail-to-stop collision near Weymouth.

The incident happened at around 2.30pm on Tuesday 21 March 2017 on the B3157 near the Bagwell Farm Touring Park west of Chickerell.

A silver Mercedes coach travelling west was in a collision with a black BMW travelling in the opposite direction. The BMW failed to stop at the scene and continued toward Chickerell.

Nobody was injured as a result of the collision.

Police Constable Anneka Harding, of Weymouth police, said: "The coach was damaged in the collision and the driver believes the BMW would have sustained noticeable damage to the front of the vehicle and the driver's side.

"I am appealing for witnesses who may have seen the vehicle travelling along this road around the time of the collision or who have seen a black BMW that has sustained damage on the date in question.

"I would also ask the driver of the BMW to do the right thing and make themselves known to police so they can assist with the investigation."
