# Man due to appear in court in connection with a fatal collision in Bournemouth

11 May 2018

* * *

A man is due to appear in court this month in connection with an alleged fail-to-stop fatal collision in Bournemouth.

At around 10.39pm on Tuesday 3 October 2017 it was reported that a collision involving a cyclist had occurred on the A338 Spur Road southbound around one mile from the Ashley Heath roundabout. It is alleged the driver of the vehicle that struck the cyclist failed to stop at the scene.

Sadly, the cyclist - 30-year-old Christopher Gibbs from Poole - was pronounced dead at the scene.

A 58-year-old man from Berkshire has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 25 May 2018 for causing death by careless driving, failing to stop at the scene of a collision and failing to report a collision. He is also due to face a charge of dangerous driving following the collision.
