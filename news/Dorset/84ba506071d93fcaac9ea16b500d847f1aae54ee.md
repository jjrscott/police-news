# Appeal for information following scrap metal theft in East Dorset

22 March 2021

* * *

Officers investigating the theft of scrap metal from a country park in East Dorset are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Between around 9.35pm and 9.45pm on Sunday 14 March 2021 a quantity of scrap metal was stolen from a yard area at Moors Valley Country Park.

Police Community Support Investigator Kate Hann, of Dorset Police, said: "We are carrying out an investigation into this theft and I would appeal to anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area on the evening of Sunday 14 March 2021 to please contact us.

"From our enquiries it is believed the metal may have been loaded into a dark-coloured saloon vehicle, which left the premises with no lights on at around 9.45pm.

"As it left the premises, this vehicle is understood to have nearly been involved in a collision with a cyclist coming through the park. I would be keen to speak to this cyclist as they may have information that could assist our investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210041383. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
