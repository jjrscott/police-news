# Appeal for information following theft of tractor near Dorchester

05 March 2019

* * *

Officers investigating the theft of a tractor from a farm near Dorchester are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The incident occurred between 5.30pm on Saturday 2 March and 9.30am on Sunday 3 March 2019 at a farm on Norden Lane near Maiden Newton.

A gate padlock was cut and a blue Landlegend 254 tractor was stolen along with a number of other items including 20 aluminium sheets, a battery and a generator. Two chainsaws were also taken from a large metal container.

Muddy tyre prints indicate that the tractor was driven left out of the farm toward the A37. It was subsequently located overturned on the side of a road near to Yeovil in Somerset on the morning of Sunday 3 March 2019.

Police Community Support Officer Tom Balchin, of Dorset Police's Rural Crime Team, said: "We are carrying out enquiries into this incident and I am appealing for anyone with information to contact us.

"We are keen to hear from anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area on the night of Saturday 2 March 2019 or who saw a blue tractor driving between Maiden Newton and the A37."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190032723. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
