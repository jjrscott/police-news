* * *

Detectives investigating an alleged knifepoint robbery in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 8.30pm on Friday 26 June 2020 the victim - a man aged in his 20s - was standing on St Peter's Road in Bournemouth holding a bicycle when it is reported that a man approached and threatened him with a knife.

It is alleged that the victim dropped the bike and the offender then grabbed it, before cycling off toward Bath Road.

The victim did not sustain any injuries during the incident.

A 43-year-old Bournemouth man has been arrested on suspicion of robbery and released on police bail pending further enquiries.

Detective Constable Fran Howard, of Bournemouth CID, said: "Enquiries are underway into this incident and I am appealing to any witnesses, or anyone who may have information to assist my investigation, to please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200092554. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
