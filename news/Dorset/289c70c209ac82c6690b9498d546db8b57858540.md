# Witness appeal following fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth

10 September 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information in relation to the driver involved to come forward.

At around 8.20pm on Wednesday 9 September 2020 a collision occurred on Christchurch Road, at the junction with Colemore Road, involving a car and a cyclist.

The cyclist - a 14-year-old boy - had been travelling toward the Iford Roundabout and was knocked from his bike as a result of the collision. He was treated at hospital for a broken wrist and concussion.

The car involved, described as a dark-coloured BMW possibly with the registration beginning with HF56, reportedly failed to stop at the scene of the collision.

Police Constable Mike Burt, of the traffic unit, said: "We are making enquiries into this collision and are keen to identify the driver of the vehicle involved.

"I would appeal to any witnesses or anyone who may have relevant dashcam footage to please come forward.

"I would also appeal to the driver involved if they see this appeal to contact us so we can take your account."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200135837. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
