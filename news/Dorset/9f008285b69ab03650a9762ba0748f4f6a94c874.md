# Appeal for information following criminal damage in Bournemouth

22 June 2020

* * *

Officers investigating criminal damage to a theatre in Bournemouth are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

At around 8.10pm on Monday 15 June 2020 it was reported that two teenage boys were seen in the area of the Shelley Theatre in Beechwood Avenue, Boscombe, kicking a football at the building for around half an hour.

It was subsequently reported that a window of the building had been smashed and the teenagers were seen riding off on bicycles.

The building is listed and the cost of repairing the window is estimated to be around Â£2,000.

Police Community Support Investigator Martin Young, of Dorset Police, said: "This building is a much valued community facility that has been refurbished for the benefit of local people and now faces the significant cost of repairing the damaged window.

"I would urge anyone with information about who is responsible for the damage to please contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200085804. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
