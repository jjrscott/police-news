# Update in relation to reported assault in Christchurch

25 October 2019

* * *

A man arrested in connection with a reported assault in Christchurch will face no further police action.

The incident was reported to have occurred at the We Buy Any Car garage at the Bailey Bridge Retail Park at around 2.50pm on Thursday 12 September 2019.

It was alleged that a male customer had shut a member of staff's finger in the door, which resulted in a broken finger.

A 49-year-old man from New Milton was arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent but has now been released from under investigation and will face no further police action.

Officers are not looking for anyone else in connection with this incident.
