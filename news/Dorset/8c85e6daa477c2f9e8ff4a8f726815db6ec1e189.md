# Update in relation to reported dog bite incident in Poole

18 January 2021

* * *

A woman has come forward following an appeal in relation to a reported dog bite incident in Poole.

It was reported that at around 2.30pm on Sunday 10 January 2021 a 12-year-old boy was riding his bike on the heath at Delph Woods in Broadstone when he was bitten twice by a Rottweiler-type dog.

The boy was reportedly bitten to his thigh and bottom, but did not sustain serious injuries.

Following an appeal to identify the owner of the dog involved, a woman has come forward and is assisting officers with their investigation. No arrests have been made.

We would like to thank everyone who shared our appeal.
