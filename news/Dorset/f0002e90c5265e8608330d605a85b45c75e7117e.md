A man has been charged and is due to appear in court in connection with reported threats to staff and attempted theft at a Christchurch store.

Officers issued an appeal in relation to an incident at the Co-Op store in Fairmile Road at around 4pm on Wednesday 8 April 2020. It was alleged that a man who had attempted to steal wine and chocolate bars became aggressive when challenged by staff and threatened them.

Following enquiries by officers and the CCTV appeal, a 30-year-old Bournemouth man was arrested and has been charged with attempted theft and two offences of common assault.

He has also been charged with a further assault and shoplifting offence in relation to an incident at the same store on Thursday 16 April 2020.

He is due to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 26 May 2020.
