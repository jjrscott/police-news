# Appeal to locate missing ring

16 November 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for help from the public to locate a ring they believe may have been stolen in Poole.

A local man aged in his 80s walked from Poole bus station to Kingland Crescent between 12.45pm and 1pm on Tuesday 14 November 2017 and was carrying the ring in a small box in his hand. He believes the box opened and the ring fell out as he was walking.

The man retracted his steps but could find no trace of the ring, which is described as gold with a large oval sapphire stone surrounded by diamonds.

Police Constable Charley Dunstan, of Dorset Police, said: "The ring belonged to the man's wife and he is very upset at losing it.

"I would urge anyone who comes across a ring matching the description given or who has any information that can assist us to please contact police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170177684. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
