# Witness appeal following indecent exposure incident in Broadstone

19 February 2018

* * *

Officers investigating an indecent exposure incident in the Broadstone area of Poole are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At around 7.10am on Thursday 15 February 2018 a woman drove out of the car park on Grange Road when she saw a man indecently expose himself to her.

The offender continued to walk on Grange Road toward Lower Blandford Road.

He is described as white, aged in his 50s, around five feet eight inches tall, with short dark hair and of medium build. He was wearing black three-quarter-length trousers, a black T-shirt and red jacket which was not done up. He was possibly carrying a backpack.

Police Constable Samuel Perry, of Poole police, said: “This was a frightening experience for the victim and I am appealing to anyone who was in the Grange Road and Lower Blandford Road area and saw a man matching the description given to please contact Dorset Police.

“I would also urge anyone else with information to please come forward.”

Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team are available and can be approached with any community concerns.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk, or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180023600. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
