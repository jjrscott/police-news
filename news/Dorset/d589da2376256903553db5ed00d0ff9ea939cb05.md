# Witness appeal after robbery in Bournemouth toilet block

20 January 2017

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses after a man was robbed inside a public toilet in Bournemouth.

The incident happened at around 1pm on Wednesday 18 January 2017 at a toilet block off Leslie Road.

The victim - a local man aged in his 30s - was inside the public toilets when he heard someone calling for help from inside a toilet cubicle.

He opened the cubicle, which was unlocked, and one man came out and threatened to stab the victim if he didn't hand over his wallet. A second man also came up from behind and threatened the victim.

The offenders stole his mobile phone and made off. The victim sustained minor injuries.

The first offender is described as white, of medium build and around five feet ten inches tall. The victim was unable to get a description of the second offender.

Detective Constable Felicity Bracewell, of Bournemouth CID, said: "The victim was left very shaken by what happened.

"The incident occurred at a busy time of the day and I am appealing to anyone who saw two men acting suspiciously in the area, or running along Winton high street, around the time of the incident to contact police."
