# Appeal for witnesses following robbery in Poole

27 July 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a robbery in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 2.45pm on Thursday 16 July 2020 the victim - a man aged in his 60s - was walking along Banks Road when he was approached by a woman who started a conversation with him at the junction with Panorama Road.

Following a short interaction the woman threatened him with a flick knife. A second woman approached from behind and grabbed the victim's arm before unclipping his watch, while also holding a knife.

A solid gold Omega watch with black roman numerals on the face was stolen during the incident.

The women left the area in a dark grey or silver saloon or hatchback car in the direction of Brownsea Road and Panorama Road. The car was driven by a man who is described as being of Turkish decent and was wearing a white T-shirt.

The women are described as being Eastern European. The first woman was wearing a short dress and had shoulder-length black hair. The second woman had her hair tied up and was wearing a blue skirt and black top.

Detective Constable Christian Bryant, of Dorset Police's Priority Crime Team, said: "This was a distressing incident for the victim and a full investigation is underway to identify those responsible.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the area of Banks Road between the roundabout near the Rick Stein restaurant and the ferry crossing at the relevant time and witnessed any suspicious activity to please get in touch.

"I am keen to hear from anyone who recognises the women or the vehicle involved from the descriptions given.

"I would also urge any residents who have home CCTV systems to check their footage from the day for anything that may assist my investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200107003. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
