At around 6.25pm on Saturday 11 April 2020 Dorset Police received a report of a black BMW 3 Series being driven dangerously on Higher Shaftesbury Road in Blandford. The vehicle failed to stop when requested by police.

The vehicle was subsequently driven along Salisbury Road toward Pimperne and was involved in a collision with a lamppost near to the Hilltop roundabout. No other vehicles were involved and the driver made off from the scene. A search of the area was carried out but they were not located.

"I would also urge anyone who was driving in the area on the evening of Saturday 11 April 2020 and has dashcam fitted to their vehicle to check their footage for anything relevant."
