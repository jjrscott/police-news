# Witness appeal following road traffic collision in Poole

29 December 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a road traffic collision in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

Dorset Police received a report at around 9.20pm on Monday 28 December 2020 of a collision involving a blue Ford Fiesta ST-2 on Holes Bay Road.

Officers attended with the fire and ambulance services.

The driver of the Ford - a man aged in his 20s from New Milton in Hampshire - sustained injuries to his back and hand. His passenger, a 19-year-old man from Bournemouth, sustained back pain and an injury to his ankle. They were both taken to hospital for treatment.

The road was closed to allow emergency services to deal with the incident. It reopened just after midnight on Tuesday 29 December 2020.

Police Constable Mark Burton, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision and has not yet spoken to police to please get in touch.

"I am also keen to hear from any motorists who were travelling in the area and may have captured the incident on dashcam footage."
