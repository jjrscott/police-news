Three people from Bournemouth have been arrested after warrants under the Misuse of Drugs Act were carried out in the town.

Officers executed warrants at two addresses off Jewell Road on Thursday 15 September 2016 following community intelligence about the alleged production and supply of cannabis.

A 27-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possessing cannabis with intent to supply.

A 38-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of class B controlled drug.

And a 58-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the production of class B controlled drug.

They have all been released on police bail pending further enquiries until the end of October 2016.

A large quantity of cannabis plants and bags of cannabis were discovered and have been seized.

North Bournemouth Deputy Neighbourhood Inspector Jonathan Wasey said: "We carried out these warrants following information from the community.

"Dorset Police will always act on information received about drug misuse and dealing and we would encourage anyone with information about such activity in their area to contact us."
