# Sexual assault in Bournemouth town centre â€“ e-fit appeal

03 May 2017

* * *

Officers investigating a sexual assault on a woman in Bournemouth have issued an e-fit of the suspect and are urging anyone who recognises him to come forward.

At 4.40pm on Saturday 18 March 2017 a woman was sitting on a bench in Westover Road close to The Stables when she was approached by an unknown man.

The suspect made several sexual comments toward the victim before he grabbed her face with both of his hands and used force to kiss her on the lips.

He then left the area without saying anything.

The victim - a local woman aged in her 30s - was not physically injured.

The suspect is described as aged in his 40s, of Middle-Eastern appearance, medium build and with short dark receding hair which was combed back. He wore a black jacket, dark blue shirt with white emblems on it, a gold watch and sunglasses.

Police Constable Lee Mabey, of Bournemouth police, said: "As part of my investigation I am now in a position to issue an e-fit which has been completed according to the details given by the victim.

"I would urge anyone who recognises this man from the e-fit and the description given to please contact Dorset Police."
