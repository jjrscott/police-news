# Update â€“ man due in court in connection with reported theft in Bournemouth

09 December 2019

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with a reported theft by finding incident in Bournemouth.

It was reported that between 1.30pm and 1.50pm on Saturday 10 August 2019 a man aged in his 50s had used the self-service till at Asda off St Pauls Road to pay for items and request cashback. However, he forgot to collect the cash or his receipt.

He returned around 15 minutes later to discover the cash and receipt had gone.

Following a CCTV appeal, a 22-year-old Poole man came forward and was interviewed by officers. He has now been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 13 December 2019 for an offence of theft.
