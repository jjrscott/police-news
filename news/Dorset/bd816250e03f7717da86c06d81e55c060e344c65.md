# Renewed witness appeal after Post Office robbery in Bournemouth

08 June 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating a robbery at a Post Office in Bournemouth are releasing an E-fit image of one of the suspects.

Officers were called at 9.09am on Friday 5 May 2017 after a man entered the shop on Broadway in Southbourne and threatened members of staff with what was described as a handgun.

The offender then stole a quantity of cash from the till before making off in the direction of Kingsley Avenue.

It is believed that two men were involved in the incident and they were last seen at the junction of Kingsley Avenue with Braemar Avenue getting into a small silver car.

No one sustained any physical injuries.

The suspect who entered the shop is described as white, aged in his late 40s, around six feet tall and with a thin face.

He was wearing a black baseball cap and is thought to be bald or with very short cropped hair. He was also wearing what was described as a blue material choker round his neck.

Detective Constable Michelle Lawrence, of Bournemouth CID, said: "As part of our ongoing investigation into this case, I am now able to release an E-fit image of this suspect.

"I would ask anyone who recognises the man or who has any information about this incident to please contact police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170065396. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
