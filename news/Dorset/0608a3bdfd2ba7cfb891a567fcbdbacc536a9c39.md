# Witness appeal following sexual assault in Bournemouth

25 November 2016

* * *

Detectives in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a woman was sexually assaulted in the town.

At 9.40pm yesterday, Thursday 24 November 2016, officers were called to reports that a woman had been sexually assaulted in Boundary Road.

The victim - a local woman aged in her 20s - was walking alone when she was approached by an unknown man, pushed to the ground and assaulted.

A member of the public disturbed the offender and he cycled away.

The victim is being looked after by specially-trained officers.

The offender is described as white, approximately five feet seven inches tall and aged in his late 20s or early 30s. He has pale skin, short dark hair and was wearing a thigh-length black coat and was riding a mountain-style bike.

A cordon is in place to allow crime scene investigators to carry out their examinations.

Detective Chief Inspector Sarah Derbyshire, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to please come forward.

"I would urge anyone who was near to Bournemouth University, Boundary Road and the access road adjacent to it at around 9.40pm last night to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who saw a man riding a bike in this area in suspicious circumstances."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 24:426. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
