# Update â€“ appeal after woman found with serious injuries on Bournemouth road

13 December 2018

* * *

A man arrested following an incident where a woman was found in the middle of a Bournemouth road will not face any further police action.

Dorset Police was called at 9.12am on Thursday 8 November 2018 to reports of a concern for welfare of a woman in the westbound carriageway of the Wessex Way prior to the Cambridge Road roundabout.

The woman - aged in her 30s, was found with head injuries. It was reported that she was in a moving vehicle immediately prior to being located.

She was taken to hospital for treatment to serious injuries but has since been discharged.

An investigation was launched to establish how she sustained her injuries and came to be at the side of the road.

A 32-year-old Bournemouth man was arrested and released under investigation. Following detailed enquiries by detectives at Bournemouth CID, it was established that no criminal offences had been committed and he has now been released from under investigation and will face no further police action.
