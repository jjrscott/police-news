# Witness appeal after woman robbed of her phone in Poole

14 February 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a woman was robbed of her mobile phone in Poole.

At 1.15pm on Tuesday 12 February 2019 the 25-year-old victim was walking along Archway Road in the Penn Hill area holding her mobile phone and with headphones over her head when she was grabbed by an unknown woman.

The suspect grabbed the victim's hand and repeatedly demanded her mobile phone. The victim, who feared she would be harmed, gave the suspect her phone.

The suspect ran off behind the church on the junction of Archway Road and Bournemouth Road toward Norman Motors.

The suspect is described as white, aged in her 30s, pale and with mousy brown hair to below her shoulders. She wore a distinctive red padded coat, blue jeans, beige or brown boots and a light-brown bobby hat. She was described as looking unkempt.

Police Constable Adam Carr, of Poole police, said: "This was a frightening incident for the victim, which occurred in broad daylight. I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the relevant time to please contact me."
