# Witness appeal following serious injury collision in Purbeck

18 July 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a serious injury collision in Purbeck.

At 2.30pm yesterday, Tuesday 17 July 2018, a road traffic collision occurred on the A351 between Stoborough and the Halfway Inn involving a grey BMW motorcycle and a grey and black Renault Captur.

The rider of the motorcycle - an 82-year-old man from Bournemouth - sustained life-changing injuries and was taken to Poole Hospital. He was later transferred to Southampton General Hospital for further treatment.

The Renault came to rest in a hedge and the driver, a 52-year-old man from Portland, and front seat passenger, a 52-year-old woman from Sidmouth, were trapped in their vehicle. They were freed by the ambulance service and checked over at the scene. They did not sustain any injuries.

The road was closed while emergency services dealt with the incident. It reopened just before 5.30pm.

Police Sergeant Mark Scammell, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was travelling along the A351 at the time of the collision and witnessed the incident or saw the manner of driving of either vehicle to please contact Dorset Police.

"I have been informed that the collision happened very close to a bus stop and there were a number of people there. These members of the public left before officers arrived and I am keen to hear from them as they may have important information that could assist my investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180112900. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
