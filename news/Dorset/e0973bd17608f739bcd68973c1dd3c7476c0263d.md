* * *

Officers have arrested a man and a woman in relation to a reported series of high value Lego thefts in Poole and Bournemouth.

At around 4.15pm on Wednesday 10 May 2017 it was reported that two men and two women had entered the Smyths Toys Superstore at Mallard Road Retail Park in Bournemouth and made off with around £600 worth of Lego without paying.

It was also reported that on Monday 15 May 2017 at around 7.30pm two women entered the Tesco store at Tower Park in Poole and stole four boxes of Lego, with a value of £858\. It is believed they may have been with two men.

Officers received a further report that around ten minutes later four people had pushed three trolleys containing Lego out of the Toys R Us store in Nuffield Road without paying and made off in a silver Vauxhall Vectra. The total value of the Lego was £1,363.85.

A 38-year-old Bournemouth man and an 38-year-old Southampton woman have been arrested on suspicion of theft and have been released under investigation.

Active enquiries are ongoing to identify the further suspects.
