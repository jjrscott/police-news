Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward as they investigate a serious injury collision in Christchurch.

Dorset Police received a report at 8.09am on Tuesday 8 December 2020 of a collision on Quay Road involving a black Ford Fiesta and a pedestrian.

Officers attended, along with the ambulance service, and road closures were put in place to allow the emergency services to respond.

The pedestrian, a local woman aged in her 70s, was taken to hospital for treatment to injuries that are believed to be life-threatening. Her family has been informed.

The road was reopened at around 1.40pm.

Sergeant Lee Savage, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the woman involved and her loved ones.

"We are carrying out an investigation to establish the full circumstances of this collision and I would ask any witnesses who have not already spoken to police to please contact us.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who was driving in the area and may have captured anything relevant on dashcam.

"Finally, I would like to thank members of the public for their patience and understanding during the road closure, which was necessary to allow the emergency services to respond to the incident and for an examination of the scene to be carried out."
