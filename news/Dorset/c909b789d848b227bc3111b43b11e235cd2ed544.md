# Arson at nursery and pre-school in Poole â€“ photo appeal

01 May 2019

* * *

Officers investigating an arson at a children's nursery and pre-school in Poole are appealing for the public's help to find those responsible.

At 9.55pm on Sunday 14 April 2019 the fire service was called to reports of flames coming from the playground area at Sunbeams & Buddies Day Care on Library Road.

The offender or offenders had gained access to the site and set fire to play equipment. The fire spread to the side of the building, causing significant damage.

Police Constable John Upsher, of Poole police, said: "This was a mindless and reckless act that could have been far worse had it not been for the swift attendance of the fire service following a call from a resident.

"The centre had to close for a day following the incident and this closure affected a great number of families who were relying on the day care within the Easter holidays.

"We are conducting a number of enquiries in relation to this incident and I am appealing anyone who saw something, or has any information about who may be responsible, to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190056376. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
