# Appeal for information following report of rape in Bournemouth

26 October 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following a report of a rape in Bournemouth.

On the evening of Friday 19 October 2018, the victim - a local woman aged in her 40s - was at the Buffalo Bar on Wimborne Road.

She left the bar at approximately 11pm and returned home in the early hours of Saturday 20 October. It is believed the incident occurred during that time period somewhere in the Winton area and investigations are underway to establish the exact location.

During the night, the victim also lost her handbag. A man and woman found the handbag containing ID with the victim's home address and returned it to her the following morning but did not give their details.

The incident was reported to police at approximately 6.30pm on Tuesday 23 October 2018.

Detective Inspector Gavin House, of Bournemouth CID, said: "The victim is being supported by specially-trained officers and I would like to reassure the public that a full investigation into the incident is being carried out by detectives.

"We are carrying out a number of enquiries to establish the full circumstances of the incident, including looking at any available CCTV in the area.

"I am particularly interested in speaking to the man and woman who returned the handbag to the victim the following morning as they may have vital details which can assist my investigation.

"If you were in the Wimborne Road area between 11pm on Friday 19 October and 3.30am on Saturday 20 October 2018 and have any information, please get in touch.

"Local officers from the neighbourhood policing team can be approached with any community concerns."
