# National security threat level reduced from critical to severe

27 May 2017

* * *

In a statement on behalf of Dorset Police and Devon & Cornwall Police, Assistant Chief Constable Sharon Taylor, said: "As people will be aware, the Prime Minister has now reduced the national security threat level from critical to severe.

"However, she has also said that the additional resources given from the military will remain in place until midnight on Monday. Therefore, we will continue to maintain an overt firearms presence across Devon & Cornwall and Dorset during the bank holiday weekend, and as a result the public may see more officers out on the streets.

"We would like to remind people that they should remain alert, not alarmed, and to support us in keeping our region safe by keeping an eye out for anything that seems out of place, unusual or doesn't seem to fit with day to day life.

"If anyone sees anything suspicious that they believe may be related to terrorism, they can report this to the Anti-Terrorist Hotline on 0800 789321 or call 999."
