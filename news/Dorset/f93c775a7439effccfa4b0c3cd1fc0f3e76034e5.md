# Witness appeal following robbery in Bournemouth

23 September 2019

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a man was robbed of money he had withdrawn from a cash machine in Bournemouth.

The incident occurred at around 9am on Friday 20 September 2019 in Stamford Road in the Southbourne area.

It is reported the victim - a local man aged in his 70s - withdrew Â£400 from the Lloyds bank cash machine on Southbourne Grove. Following the transaction he was asked by an unknown man for some change, which he refused.

The victim then walked along Beresford Road and into Beaufort Road, where he became aware that someone was following him. He turned into Kimberley Road and then Stamford Road.

The offender rugby tackled the victim to the ground, pinned him down and stole the cash from his trouser pocket.

The suspect is described as white, tanned, aged in his 20s, five feet 11 inches tall and with short dark hair. He wore blue jeans and a grey top.

Detective Constable Holly Sexton, of Bournemouth CID, said: "The victim believes the offender was the same man who asked him for change at the cash machine. Enquiries are underway to obtain any relevant CCTV footage.

"A second man was in the queue at the ATM at the time of the incident and after using the machine he left in a vehicle. I would ask this man to please come forward as he may have important information that could assist my investigation.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who was driving along Southbourne Grove or the route the victim took immediately prior to the incident and may have captured the offender or victim on dashcam. If you have, please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190148446. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
