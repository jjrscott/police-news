# Renewed appeal following alleged assault on Portland

23 July 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating an alleged assault on Portland are renewing their appeal for anyone with information to come forward as they are looking for a possible injured person.

At 4.40am on Saturday 22 July 2017 Dorset Police received a report that several people entered an address on Fortuneswell which contained a number of men and threatened some of them with a knife. A fight ensued during which it appears someone was injured. The people then left the address, however it is unclear at this time if anything was taken from the property.

Officers, including armed officers and a dog unit, attended and searched the area.

Detective Inspector Paul Graham, of Dorset Police CID, said: "Despite our search and further enquiries we are yet to find the injured person.

"The inspection of the scene led us to believe that one of the people involved may be seriously injured. We are very concerned about this person and need to ensure they get the necessary medical help.

"Anyone who knows of this injured person's whereabouts should contact us urgently to enable us to help."

A 43-year-old man, a 36-year-old man and a 29-year-old woman, all from the Weymouth area, and a 17-year-old boy of no fixed abode, were arrested on suspicion of assault and have been released under investigation.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 22:67. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
