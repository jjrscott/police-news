Officers investigating a burglary at a bike store in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 9.45pm on Tuesday 31 December 2019 a door at Mud Sweat and Gears on Link Park was smashed. Entry was gained to the building and three electric bikes were stolen.

The three stolen bikes included a white Scott Sub Tour eRide 10 ladies bike with a beige saddle and grips, a white Liv Amiti E+ 4 with a blue logo and a men's grey Ridgeback Cyclone.

"I am appealing for anyone who may have seen any suspicious activity in the area at the relevant time to please come forward.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who may have seen an electric bike for sale in unusual circumstances matching one of the descriptions given."
