# Witness appeal following aggravated theft of vehicle in Wareham

11 December 2019

* * *

Officers investigating an aggravated theft of a vehicle in Wareham are appealing for any witnesses to come forward.

At about 4.30pm on Friday 6 December 2019 the victim, who is a parcel delivery driver, parked his car on Church Street and locked it before walking to a nearby property.

When he returned, he realised that he had dropped his keys. The engine of his vehicle was running and there was a man in the driver's seat.

The victim attempted to stop the vehicle by leaning across the bonnet, but the offender drove off with him on the car.

The vehicle stopped abruptly on St John's Hill and the victim fell off and was dragged along the floor. He sustained grazes to his body and an injury to his hand.

The offender was described as white, aged in his early to mid-twenties with a very thin, gaunt face and long nose. He was wearing a beanie hat with a grey jumper.

Following a search of the area, the vehicle was located in Stoborough. A quantity of parcels and a wallet were stolen.

Police Constable Clare Gillard, of Purbeck police, said: "I would urge anyone who witnessed this incident, and has not yet spoken to police, to please come forward.

"I am appealing to any motorists with a dashcam who were travelling in the area at the time to check their footage for anything relevant.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who has any information about who was responsible to assist my investigation."
