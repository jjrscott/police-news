# Update â€“ image appeal following reported assault in Dorchester

27 August 2019

* * *

A woman has come forward following an image appeal in relation to a reported assault in Dorchester.

At approximately 3.30pm on Wednesday 14 August 2019 it was reported that a woman was shopping in Marks & Spencer on South Street when an altercation occurred involving another woman.

The victim was allegedly pushed, causing her to fall backwards and she sustained a shoulder injury that did not require hospital treatment.

Following an appeal issued by officers featuring an image of a person they wanted to speak to in connection with the incident, a woman has now come forward and is assisting officers with their investigation.
