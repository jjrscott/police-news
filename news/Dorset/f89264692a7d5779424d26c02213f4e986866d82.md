17 November 2018

Detectives investigating a knifepoint robbery at a bookmakers in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 11.05am today, Saturday 17 November 2018, a man entered Betfred in Commercial Road and threatened a female cashier with a large kitchen knife and ordered her to place money in a black holdall. He made off with a total of Â£2,240, running down Avenue Road before getting in a taxi.

The victim was not injured during the incident but was left shaken.

The offender is described as black, aged in his late 20s to early 30s, of slim build and short with a shaven head. He was wearing a black jacket with white writing or a logo on it and was carrying a black Nike holdall.

Detective Constable Aimee Lloyd, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was understandably a very distressing incident for the victim and we have launched a full investigation to identify the man responsible.

"I am appealing for anyone with information about this incident or who saw a man matching the description given in the area of Commercial Road around the relevant time to please contact us."
