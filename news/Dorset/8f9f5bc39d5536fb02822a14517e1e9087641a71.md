A fourth person has been arrested in relation to the murder investigation in East Dorset.

The latest arrest was made on Wednesday 3 May 2017 after the man attended Bournemouth police station.
Superintendent Kevin Connolly, of Dorset Police, said: "In total four arrests have now been made.

"However, our enquiries still continue and our appeal still stands for anyone with information that could aid us to come forward. This is the case for anything relating to suspicious activity after 3am on Sunday 30 April 2017 in the Verney Close area of West Howe and in Winterborne Stickland as well as information about anyone acting unusually in Castlewood in the days or hours leading up to Guy Hedger being killed.

"We would like to thank everyone who has contacted us already. The support we have received from the public has been encouraging."
