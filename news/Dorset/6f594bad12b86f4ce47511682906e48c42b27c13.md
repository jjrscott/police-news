# Witness appeal following dog attack in Poole

13 June 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward after two women and a dog were attacked by three Rottweilers in Poole.

At around 9.20pm on Wednesday 6 June 2018 the women were walking with their West Highland Terrier at the nature reserve off Border Drive in Upton when they noticed three Rottweilers in the distance. The dogs were with a man, woman and child but were not on leads.

Shortly afterwards one of the dogs came running toward them and one of the woman, aged in her 40s, picked up their pet to protect him.

She was jumped on from behind and knocked to the ground by the Rottweiler, which began to attack the dog and the woman.

The two other Rottweilers came over and knocked the other woman, aged in her 70s, to the ground.

The man who was with the dogs came over to intervene and managed to get the Rottweilers away from them but then became abusive toward the two women. He then left with the dogs in the direction of Turlin Moor.

The West Highland Terrier sustained a deep bite to the back of the leg and required veterinary treatment.

The younger woman was left with bite marks and bruising to her arm and hands. The other woman did not sustain any significant injuries.

Police Constable Sophie Flood, of Poole police, said: “This was a very traumatic incident for the women involved and their dog has been left with nasty injuries.

“We are carrying out enquiries into this incident and I am appealing for any witnesses or anyone who saw a group of people with three Rottweilers in the area on the evening of Wednesday 6 June 2018 to please contact police.”

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180086829. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
