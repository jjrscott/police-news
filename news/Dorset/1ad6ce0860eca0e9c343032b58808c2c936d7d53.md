A 16-year-old boy arrested in connection with a drug incident in Bournemouth has accepted a youth conditional caution.

Officers were called by the ambulance service at 10.44pm on Tuesday 24 October 2017 following reports that a 14-year-old girl had fallen ill on Fir Vale Road after taking a substance reported to have been ecstasy.

She was taken to hospital for treatment and was discharged the following morning.

A 16-year-old boy from Poole was arrested on suspicion of supplying class A drugs and has accepted a youth conditional caution.

The disposal requires the boy to attend appointments with the Youth Offending Service and if he fails to comply he faces being charged for the offence.
