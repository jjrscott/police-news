# Further update following arrest in connection with death of man in Weymouth

02 October 2019

* * *

A fourth person arrested in connection with the death of a man in Weymouth has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

An investigation is ongoing into the death of a 75-year-old man at an address on The Esplanade that was reported on the morning of Saturday 7 September 2019.

The death was initially treated as unexplained and enquiries into the circumstances surrounding the death are being carried out by detectives from the Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT).

A post-mortem examination took place on the afternoon of Thursday 12 September 2019. Further neurology and toxicology tests have been requested before a cause of death can be given, but the pathologist stated that the victim suffered injuries that are believed to be consistent with an assault. Following the conclusion of the post-mortem examination and as a result of further extensive enquiries, a murder investigation was launched.

A 28-year-old woman of no fixed abode and a 38-year-old Weymouth man have previously been arrested on suspicion of murder and were released on police bail. A 37-year-old Weymouth man was also arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender and was released under investigation.

Following further enquiries by MCIT detectives, a 66-year-old Weymouth man was arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender on Tuesday 1 October 2019. He has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.
