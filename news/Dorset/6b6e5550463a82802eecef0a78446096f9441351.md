# Image appeal following theft by finding in Ferndown

12 March 2021

* * *

Officers investigating the theft by finding of jewellery in Ferndown are issuing images of a man they would like to speak to. Images of a vehicle of interest and the missing jewellery are also being released.

At around 11.40am on Thursday 25 February 2021 a woman dropped a bag containing jewellery in a car park opposite Victoria Road. After she discovered it was missing, CCTV footage was reviewed. It appeared to show a man getting out of his car - a white Volvo - and pick up the bag before getting back into his vehicle.

The items of jewellery in the bag were three small glass figurine pendants - a small orange and two small blue glass parrots.

Police Community Support Investigator Rich Frew, of Dorset Police, said: "These items of jewellery were of great sentimental value to the victim and we are carrying out enquiries to try and locate them.

"I would urge anyone who recognises the man or vehicle pictured or has any information that might assist our investigation to please contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210038355. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
