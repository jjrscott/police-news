# Appeal for information after elderly man scammed in East Dorset

10 February 2021

* * *

Officers investigating an incident where an elderly man was scammed out of thousands of pounds in East Dorset are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

At around 11.30am on Monday 8 February a man aged in his 80s from Alderholt received a call from a man claiming to be a detective from Manchester police and asked for their assistance in catching a man who had obtained a large amount of counterfeit money from the victim's local bank.

He was put through to a woman claiming to be from the bank before he spoke to the man again, who asked the victim to withdraw £7,000 from the bank so police could check whether it was genuine or not.

The victim was only able to withdraw £5,000 and arrangements were made for someone to come and pick the money up.

At around 2.30pm on Monday 8 February 2021 a black man wearing a face mask came and collected the money.

Two further similar incidents were reported in the Alderholt area - one on Thursday 28 January 2021 and one on Monday 8 February 2021 - where elderly residents were contacted by people claiming to be from the police and asked to withdraw money, but on these occasions no money was handed over.

Fraud investigator Shane Cherrett, of Dorset Police, said: "We are carrying out a full investigation into these matters and I am appealing for anyone with information that might assist our enquiries to please come forward.

"We believe the man who collected the money may have been waiting in the Alderholt area on the afternoon of Monday 8 February 2021 and I would ask for anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the vicinity to please contact us.

"Finally I would urge people to make sure any vulnerable elderly family members, loved ones or neighbours are aware of this scam. Anyone who is contacted in similar circumstances is asked to please report it to us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210023725. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
