# Update â€“ man charged in connection with reported robbery in Bournemouth

17 June 2020

* * *

A man has been charged and has appeared in court in connection with an alleged robbery in Bournemouth.

It was reported that at around 12.45am on Monday 25 May 2020 a man aged in his 40s was walking along Old Christchurch Road in the area of Richmond Gardens when he was approached by a group of people who became verbally abusive toward him.

Some of the members of the group allegedly proceeded to hit the victim and he was kicked after falling to the ground.

A black bag belonging to the victim was reportedly stolen, which contained keys and a bank card.

Following enquiries by officers and a CCTV appeal, a 21-year-old Bournemouth man was arrested and subsequently charged with robbery. He appeared at Poole Magistrates' Court on Saturday 13 June 2020 and is next due to appear at Bournemouth Crown Court on Friday 17 July 2020.
