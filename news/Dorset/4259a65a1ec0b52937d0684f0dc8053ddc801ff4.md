Detectives have made two further arrests as they investigate a reported aggravated burglary in Blandford.

Dorset Police received a report that at around 2.30am on Sunday 12 July 2020 a group of three or four men had forced their way into an address in Victoria Road.

One of the occupants of the property fled the address and a second man, aged 18, was allegedly assaulted with what was believed to be a machete, causing a serious injury to his leg.

The men reportedly stole a quantity of cash before making off in a black vehicle.

Two men - a 22-year-old from Liverpool and a 28-year-old from Derbyshire - were arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary and they have both been released under investigation.

Following further enquiries, a 22-year-old man from Bournemouth and a 24-year-old man from Blandford have also been arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary and are assisting detectives with their enquiries.

The investigation into this incident continues and local officers can be approached by members of the community with any information or concerns.
