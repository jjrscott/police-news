# Road rage incident in East Dorset

06 September 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a reported road rage incident in East Dorset.

At around 7.20am on Monday 2 September 2019 a woman was driving her black Ford C-MAX along the A31 from Ringwood toward Poole. As she approached the Canford Bottom roundabout the woman became agitated by the manner of driving of another motorist in a small black car and beeped the horn.

The driver of the small car then stopped approximately 400 yards short of the roundabout in an attempt to stop the victim from moving. He reportedly got out of his vehicle holding a hammer, approached the driver's window and shouted at her. The man then got back into his car and drove away. No one was injured.

Police Community Support Investigator Kate Hann, of Dorset Police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed this incident, or captured it on dashcam, to please contact Dorset Police.

"The victim believes that the driver of a dark-coloured Mercedes who was travelling behind her may have recorded some of the incident on a mobile phone. I would ask this driver to please come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190138315. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
