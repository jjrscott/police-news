# Witness appeal after suspicious incident in Dorchester

15 December 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses after a suspicious incident in Dorchester.

At around 8.40am on Wednesday 13 December 2017 a 14-year-old girl walked past Poundbury Village Stores along Cambridge Walk when she approached a black saloon or hatchback car with tinted windows, which was parked facing the bollards.

The driver of the car made sexually-motivated comments toward her as she continued onto Cambridge Road.

As she approached Baynard's Road, she noticed the car had seemingly followed her from Poundbury to Cambridge Road where it parked up. After a short time the man drove away.

The driver is described as a white man, aged in his late 20s or early 30s, with a shaven oval head and stubble.

Dorchester Neighbourhood Inspector Neil Wood said: "This incident has understandably left the victim shaken. We take such reports very seriously and officers are making active enquiries in order to establish what happened.

"The victim believes that the man may have been spooked by a passing member of the public, so I am appealing to that person or anyone who was in the area at the time and noticed anything suspicious to please contact me.

"We would like to reassure the public that such reports are extremely rare, however we would urge people to report any suspicious incidents or vehicle registration details to us.

"The local Neighbourhood Policing Team has increased patrols and can be contacted with any concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170193004. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
