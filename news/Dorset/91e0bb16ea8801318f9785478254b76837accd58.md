* * *

A man has been arrested in connection with an alleged stabbing in Weymouth.

Officers were called at 2.14pm on Thursday 3 May 2018 to Westwey Road following reports that a man had sustained stab wounds to his leg as he walked along the Rodwell Trail.

The man - a 38-year-old from Weymouth - was taken to hospital for treatment. His injuries are not life-threatening.

A 31-year-old local man has been arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent and has been released on police bail pending further enquires until later this month.

Detective Inspector Andrea Power, of Weymouth CID, said: "I am renewing my appeal for anyone who was in the Westwey Road or Rodwell Trail area at the relevant time and may have witnessed the incident or seen anyone acting suspiciously to please come forward.

"Our enquiries into this incident remain ongoing."
