A 5.39am on Sunday 6 December 2020 officers received a report from the ambulance service of a sudden death of a 44-year-old woman from Poole at an address in Cashmoor Close.

A 46-year-old Poole man was arrested on suspicion of murder and was released under investigation. He has now been released from under investigation without charge.
