# Appeal following fatal collision in Bournemouth

09 September 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to a fatal collision in Bournemouth to get in to contact.

At around 2.30pm today, Sunday 9 September 2018, a serious road traffic collision occurred on Ringwood Road outside the Turbary Retail Park involving a green Kawasaki motorcycle and a pedestrian.

Very sadly the pedestrian, a 74-year-old man from Poole, sustained very serious injuries and died at the scene. His family have been informed and the coroner notified.

The rider of the motorcycle - a 50-year-old man from Ferndown -sustained serious injuries and was taken to Poole Hospital for treatment. His injuries are not thought to be life-threatening.

Ringwood Road was closed while the emergency services attended and dealt with the incident. The air ambulance also landed but was not needed to take any patients to hospital.

The road remains closed while collision investigators examine the scene. Closures are in place at the Clock roundabout and the Mountbatten roundabout.

Police Sergeant Craig Tatton, of the traffic unit, said: "An investigation is now underway into the circumstances of this collision and I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the time and witnessed the incident to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am also keen to hear from any motorists who were travelling along Ringwood Road at the time and may have relevant dashcam footage.

"I appreciate the road closures have caused inconvenience to motorists and shoppers at the retail park but I would like to reassure them that they were entirely necessary to allow paramedics to treat the injured man and for officers to establish what happened today."
