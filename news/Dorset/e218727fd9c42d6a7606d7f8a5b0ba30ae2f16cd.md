19 April 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses after a break-in at a supermarket in Poole.

At around 7.15pm on Sunday 16 April 2017 entry was forced to the Tesco store at Tower Park.

Entry was gained through an emergency exit door.

It is believed a number of vacuum cleaners were taken and loaded into a silver people carrier outside the store.

Police Constable Donal Doyle, of Poole police, said: "I believe there may have been people using the car park by the store at the time this incident happened and would ask any witnesses or anyone with information to please contact me."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170055547. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
