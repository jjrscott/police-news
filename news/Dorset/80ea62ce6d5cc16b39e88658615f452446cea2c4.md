# Witness appeal following robbery in Bournemouth

17 October 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating a robbery in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At around 1.10pm on Sunday 15 October 2017 the victim - a local woman aged in her 60s - was walking along Poole Road and was near to the junction with Pine Tree Glen when she was pushed from behind. She fell to the floor and the offender took her handbag before leaving the scene.

Members of the public came to the woman's aid and an ambulance was contacted. The woman suffered bruising to her right hand and is awaiting the results of an x-ray to establish if it is broken.

Detective Sergeant Karen Penn, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We have launched an investigation into this incident and are doing everything we can to locate the offender as well as support the victim.

"I am appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information that might assist our investigation to get in touch.

"I understand there were a number of members of the public in the area at the time, including people who came to the aid of the victim and I would urge anyone who has not already spoken to police to please contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170161211. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
