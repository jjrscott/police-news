# Christmas drink and drug driving campaign â€“ nine further people charged

18 December 2017

* * *

A further nine people have been charged with drink or drug driving offences as part of Dorset Police's Christmas drink and drug driving campaign.

They are due to appear at courts in Poole and Weymouth during December 2017 and January 2018.

The campaign runs between Friday 1 December 2017 through to Monday 1 January 2018.

Throughout the month-long operation, officers will be requesting breath tests from all drivers involved in road traffic collisions, irrespective of whether or not they suspect a drink driving offence.

Drivers can expect to be tested during routine stop checks and if they are stopped for an offence. Drugwipe sample kits will be used on drivers suspected of being unfit to drive through drugs.

As in previous campaigns, anyone charged with a drink or drug driving related offence during the campaign will have their name and court appearance details released to the media.
