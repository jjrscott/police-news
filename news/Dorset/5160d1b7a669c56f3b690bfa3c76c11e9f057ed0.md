Officers investigating a reported burglary in Weymouth have arrested a man.

Dorset Police received a report that a burglary had occurred at an address in Milton Crescent between 8.30pm and 8.45pm on Wednesday 21 February 2018.

The offender had allegedly entered the house through an insecure door while the occupants were at home and stole a handbag containing the victim's purse.

Further enquiries established that the victim's bank card had been used at four locations in Weymouth between 9.10pm and 9.41pm that same night.

It was reported that an attempt was made to use the card at Euro Garage in King Street, which was refused, and transactions were carried out at Park Corner Convenience Store, Asda in Newstead Road and McDonald's in St Mary Street. The total value reportedly spent on the card was £46.28.

A 46-year-old Weymouth man has been arrested on suspicion of burglary and has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.
