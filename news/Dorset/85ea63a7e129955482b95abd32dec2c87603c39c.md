A man who was stopped by officers on proactive patrols in Bournemouth has been charged with class A drug supply offences.

The 32-year-old from London was arrested on the evening of Thursday 20 September 2018 in West Hill Road in the West Cliff area of the town. A quantity of suspected class A drugs were seized.

He appeared at Poole Magistrates' Court on Saturday 22 September 2018 to face two charges - possession with intent to supply crack cocaine and possession with intent to supply heroin. He is next due to appear back at the same court on Wednesday 3 October 2018.

A 26-year-old woman from Bournemouth, who was also arrested, was subsequently issued with an adult caution for possession of a controlled class B drug - cannabis.

Neighbourhood Inspector Adam Gill said: "Proactive patrols remain ongoing in the area involving uniformed and plain-clothed officers from Bournemouth South Neighbourhood Policing Team.
