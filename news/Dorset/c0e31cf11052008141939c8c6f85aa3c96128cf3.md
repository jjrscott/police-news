# Family tribute to man who died in collision in Bournemouth

26 July 2019

* * *

The family of a man who died in a collision in Bournemouth has issued a tribute.

Dorset Police was called at 8.36am on Sunday 26 May 2019 to reports of a collision in West Cliff Road.

It was reported that a green Volkswagen Sharan collided with a blue Yamaha motorcycle and the motorcycle then collided with a green Peugeot 307.

The motorcyclist, who has been named by his family as 54-year-old Colin Lazenbury from Bournemouth, was taken to hospital with critical injuries.

Very sadly, he passed away in hospital on Sunday 14 July 2019.

His family has issued the following tribute: "Colin, an amazing Partner, Son, Brother, Father, Grandfather and Friend.

"Loving, loyal, kind, caring and considerate. He will be remembered for his outgoing personality and his ability to befriend everybody.

"We are heartbroken that he has been taken from us too soon, when he still had so much to give.

"He will be deeply missed."

A 25-year-old man from Nuneaton in Warwickshire was arrested on suspicion of driving offences and has been released under investigation as officers continue to make enquiries into the collision.
