# Reported assault in Weymouth â€“ witness appeal

21 October 2016

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a reported assault in Weymouth.

Sometime between 4.30pm and 6pm on Monday 17 October 2016, a man had just stepped off the number 10 bus at the Kings Statue bus stop on The Esplanade when it is alleged his head was forced into a metal railing.

The victim, a local man aged in his 20s, sustained multiple fractures to his jaw and has had to undergo surgery to have metal plates put into his jaw and cheek.

The alleged offender is described as having long hair worn in a ponytail and was wearing dark clothing and a dark-coloured beanie hat.

Detective Constable Sean Garrett, of Weymouth CID, said: "I know there were a number of people on the bus and in the area at the time of the incident and I would urge anyone who saw the incident and has yet to speak to officers to please contact Dorset Police."

A 42-year-old man from Portland has been arrested on suspicion of assault and grievous bodily harm and has been released on police bail pending further enquiries until the end of November 2016.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55160157860. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
