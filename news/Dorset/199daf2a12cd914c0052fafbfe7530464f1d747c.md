Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a burglary at a cafe in Sherborne.

The incident happened sometime between 2.30am and 3am on Sunday 13 January 2019 at The Pear Tree Deli & Cafe on Half Moon Street.

It is believed he was carrying a large 'bag for life' with black side panels and red end panels with a white emblem on it.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the incident, or who has any information that could assist with the investigation, to please come forward."
