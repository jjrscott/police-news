# Witness appeal after alleged assault in Bournemouth

24 August 2019

* * *

Detectives investigating an alleged assault in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward - with five teenagers arrested.

The incident, which happened in the Lower Gardens, was reported to police at 10.25pm on Friday 23 August 2019.

Three 17-year-old boys from Saudi Arabia sustained puncture wounds and a 15-year-old boy from Bournemouth received a cut to his head. All were taken to hospital, but their injuries are not believed to be life-threatening.

A 14-year-old boy from Bournemouth has been arrested on suspicion of assault. Three 15-year-old girls and a 13-year-old girl, all from Bournemouth, have been arrested on suspicion of conspiring to cause grievous bodily harm with intent. All five teenagers are helping officers with their enquiries.

Detective Sergeant Richard Winn, of Dorset Police, said: "There were a lot of people in the area during that time and I am appealing for witnesses and anyone with information, who has not yet spoken to police, to contact us.

"We are aware that an incident in such a public place causes concern to our residents and visitors.

"There will be enhanced patrols throughout the bank holiday weekend, which should not alarm anyone, but will hopefully serve as a reassurance."

As a result of the incident a Section 60 order under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act was issued for the evening of Friday 23 August 2019 for the area of the Lower Gardens. A renewed Section 60 order will be in place from 6pm on Saturday 24 August 2019 until 7am on Sunday 25 August 2019.

A Section 60 order gives police the right to search people in a defined area during a specific time period when they believe, with good reason, that serious violence will take place and it is necessary to use this power to prevent such violence.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190132583. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
