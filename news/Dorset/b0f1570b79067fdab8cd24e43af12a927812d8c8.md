# Appeal to find two witnesses following fatal collision in Poole

20 January 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a fatal collision in Poole are appealing for two men who may have witnessed the incident to come forward.

Police were called at 11.07pm on Friday 18 January 2019, to reports of a collision between a pedestrian and a car on Poole Road in Branksome.

The 71-year-old female pedestrian was taken to Poole hospital but sadly died from her injuries. Her family are being supported by specially-trained officers.

Police Sergeant Nikki Burt, of Dorset Police's traffic unit, said: "Following our enquiries we believe that there were two male pedestrians who may have walked through Tesco car park and along Poole Road toward Poole around the time of the collision.

"I am appealing for both men to please come forward as they may hold vital information that could assist with the investigation.

"We also want to identify the drivers of five vehicles that we believe were travelling along Poole Road around the time of the collision. There was a small light-coloured vehicle similar to a Renault Clio and a dark-coloured saloon similar to a Mercedes E Class travelling behind an ambulance, along with three other unknown vehicles.

"We are now confident that we have identified the vehicles directly involved in the collision and are now purely looking for key witnesses to the incident.

"The full circumstances continue to be investigated and I would ask anyone who witnessed the incident who is yet to contact officers, or who has dashcam footage available, to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 18:491. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
