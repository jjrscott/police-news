Detectives investigating an incident where a woman was assaulted in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The victim, a woman aged in her 30s, was standing outside a row of shops on Cunningham Crescent at around 8.10pm on Sunday 28 March 2021 when a man and woman got out of a silver Mercedes car and approached her. The man struck her several times to the head with a baseball bat and the woman stamped on her arm as she lay on the ground.

It was reported that the man and woman are known to the victim.

The victim was taken to hospital for treatment to two cuts to her head, bruising to her face and jaw and a bruise on her arm. She has since left hospital.

Detective Constable Phillip Riggs, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We take violent assaults of this nature extremely seriously and we are carrying a full investigation into this incident.

"I understand there were a number of people in the area at the time of this assault and I would urge anyone who witnessed what happened who has not already spoken to police to please contact us."
