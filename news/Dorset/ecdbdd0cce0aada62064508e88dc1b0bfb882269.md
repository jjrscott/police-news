# Update â€“ woman due in court in connection with serious injury collision in West Moors

29 August 2018

* * *

A woman is due to appear in court in connection with a serious injury collision in West Moors.

At 2.11pm on Sunday 10 June 2018 Dorset Police was called to reports of a collision in a car park off Station Road involving a blue Daewoo Matiz and a parked and unattended blue Ford B-Max.

As a result of the collision, the Ford was forced into a bench. A local woman, aged 61, who was sitting on the bench was trapped by her legs by the vehicle and had to be freed by firefighters.

She was taken to Poole General Hospital for serious injuries. She has since been released from hospital.

No one else was injured.

An 80-year-old woman from West Moors has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 4 September 2018 for an offence of driving without due care and attention.
