Police investigating an alleged robbery in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward - with one man arrested.

At around 3.20am on Monday 27 June 2016 it was reported that a woman was approached by a man on a bike along Commercial Road.

Whilst engaging in conversation, the woman removed her black purse from her handbag. It is alleged that the offender snatched the purse from the victim and cycled off.

Police Constable Nigel Belton, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I would urge anyone who witnessed this incident or has any information to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who was in or around The Triangle area and saw anything unusual taking place to get in touch."

A 36-year-old man of no fixed abode has been arrested on suspicion of robbery and is currently on police bail until the beginning of August 2016.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 27:25. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
