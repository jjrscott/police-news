Detectives have launched a murder investigation after the body of a woman was discovered at a flat in Bournemouth - with one man arrested.

At around 6.23pm today, Friday 16 September 2016, officers were alerted to reports that a woman had died at an address in Gainslea Court in Derby Road in the town.

On arrival officers discovered that a woman aged in her 30s had sustained a serious head injury. Sadly she was pronounced dead at the scene. Her next of kin have yet to be informed. The coroner has been informed.

The circumstances of the woman's death are suspicious and a murder investigation, led by Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT), is underway.

A 50-year-old local man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is currently assisting officer with enquiries.

Detective Inspector Neil Phillips, of the MCIT, said: "Following the discovery of a woman's body, Dorset Police has launched a murder investigation.

"Enquiries are now underway to establish exactly what happened at this address in Gainslea Court.

"A cordon has been put in place at the flat while crime scene investigators examine the scene. Officers are also carrying out house-to-house enquiries.

"I am appealing for anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious in the Derby Road area during Thursday evening or today to contact Dorset Police as soon as possible.

"Officers from the local Neighbourhood Policing Team will be carrying out high visibility patrols in the area over the coming days to officer reassurance to the community and can be contacted with any concerns."
