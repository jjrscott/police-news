# Witness appeal following road traffic collision in North Dorset

13 April 2018

* * *

Officers investigating a road traffic collision in North Dorset are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to get in contact.

At around 3.50pm yesterday, Thursday 12 April 2018, a two-vehicle collision occurred on the B3081 near Motcombe by the approach to Port Regis School.

The collision involved a first responder ambulance service car and a silver Seat Ibiza.

The driver of the Seat, a woman from Bedfordshire aged in her 70s, was initially taken to hospital as a precaution after sustaining injuries that were not believed to be serious. However, her condition has since deteriorated and she is now believed to be in a life-threatening condition.

The paramedic driving the first responder vehicle was uninjured. The ambulance service is assisting officers with their investigation into the circumstances of the collision.

Police Sergeant Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the family of injured woman at this time.

"We are making enquiries to establish exactly what happened and I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision who has not already spoken to police to contact us.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time and has dascham fitted to their vehicle that may have captured the incident."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at scit@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 12:315. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
