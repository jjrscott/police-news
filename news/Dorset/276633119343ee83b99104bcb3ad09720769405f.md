# Update – appeal following reported theft in Poole

05 June 2020

* * *

A boy has been arrested in connection with the reported theft of an electric mountain bike in Poole.

It is alleged that at around 10.30am on Friday 22 May 2020 a bike had been stolen from where it was secured outside W E Boone's hardware store on the High Street.

The bike, a Cube Acid One 500 hybrid electric mountain bike in charcoal grey with black saddlebags and a bottle holder, is worth around £1,700.

Following enquiries, a 16-year-old boy from Bournemouth was arrested on suspicion of theft of a pedal cycle. He has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

The bike has now been recovered and returned to the owner, a 75-year-old man from Poole.
