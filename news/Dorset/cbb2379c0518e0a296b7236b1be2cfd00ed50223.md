# Witness appeal after fatal collision near Lytchett Matravers

30 December 2016

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following a fatal road traffic collision near Lytchett Matravers.

At 1.45pm on Friday 30 December 2016 emergency services were called to a two vehicle serious injury collision on the A35 just east of Morden Park Corner.

A grey Citreon Zsara Picasso registered to an address in West Dorset was in collision with a blue Volkswagen Tiguan registered to an address in Doncaster.

The passenger of the Citreon, a 71-year-old woman from the Dorchester area, sustained serious injuries. The driver, a 73-year-old man and also from the Dorchester area, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene. The next of kin have been informed and the coroner has been notified.

Two people from the Volkswagen received serious injuries and one minor injuries.

The coastguard helicopter attended the location and assisted the ambulance service with the transport of one of the injured people.

The road was closed for three and a half hours to allow investigators to examine the scene and for the recovery of the vehicles to take place.

Police Sergeant Gareth Blaken, of the Road Policing Team, said: "I am appealing for any witnesses who saw the collision or the manner of driving of this vehicle prior to the incident to contact police.

"We would like to thank everyone affected for their patience."
