# Appeal for information after woman bitten by dog in Ferndown

15 June 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for information to help identify the owner of a dog that bit a woman in Ferndown.

The victim, aged in her 40s, was jogging on Poor Common at around 10.45am on Sunday 7 June 2020 and was near to the Heathlands Avenue entrance when she saw a woman with approximately eight dogs.

The dogs were all small ones apart from a black lurcher or greyhound type dog. The woman also possibly had a dog in a buggy.

As the victim approached she went to the opposite edge of the path in an attempt to comply with social distancing guidance and one of the dogs that was on a lead, described as a brown terrier type, bit her to the back of the leg, causing an injury.

The woman with the dogs is described as white, aged in her 60s, around five feet six inches tall and of slim build with greying blonde hair.

Police Constable Jennie Sykes-Martin, of Dorset Police, said: "We are carrying out enquiries into this matter and I would urge anyone who was in the area and witnessed it to please contact us.

"I would also urge the owner of the dog involved to do the right thing and come forward so we can take your account."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200082928. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
