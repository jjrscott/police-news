Dorset Police's new Assistant Chief Constable Julie Fielding says she is looking forward to the challenges the role will bring.

Julie started in her new role this week and is delighted to become a part of the team at Dorset Police.

Julie was previously Chief Superintendent with Devon & Cornwall Police, where she spent more than 24 years working in a variety of positions from patrol and detective roles to Head of Crime and Justice and previously served as the Policing Commander for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly.

Julie said: "I applied for the post in Dorset to work alongside officers and staff in the county to deliver the best policing service.

"These are challenging times in policing and I look forward to working with partners and communities to keep Dorset safe.

"I am fortunate to have worked with staff in Dorset through the strategic alliance and part of my role will be to ensure that, with increased demand, we continue to tackle the issues which are important in local communities whilst planning ahead for the future."

Dorset Police and Crime Commissioner Martyn Underhill said: ''I would like to congratulate Julie on her new role as Assistant Chief Constable. Her experience and dedication will be a great asset to the communities we serve and I very much look forward to working with her in the future."
