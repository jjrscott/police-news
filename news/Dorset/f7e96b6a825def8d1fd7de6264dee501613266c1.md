A woman who sustained life-threatening injuries following a collision in a supermarket car park in Poole has very sadly died.

The incident, which happened in the car park of Asda Stores in West Quay Road and involved a silver Vauxhall Insignia and a pedestrian, was reported to police at 2.08pm on Friday 18 September 2020.

The pedestrian, a 69-year-old local woman, was taken to Southampton General Hospital by the ambulance service with life-threatening injuries. Very sadly, the woman died from her injuries in hospital on Saturday 26 September 2020. Her family has been informed and the coroner notified.

The driver of the car, a 39-year-old man from Poole, was uninjured. He voluntarily attended a police station for interview on suspicion of driving offences and was released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Police Sergeant Craig Tatton, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with this woman's family and friends at this very difficult time.

"We are continuing to investigate the circumstances of this incident and I would ask witnesses who have not yet spoken with police to please come forward.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who may have captured relevant footage on dashcam."
