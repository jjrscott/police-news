# Man robbed at knifepoint on Portland â€“ witness appeal

16 August 2017

* * *

Detectives are appealing for the public's help to trace two men who robbed a man at knifepoint on Portland.

At around 12.37pm on Monday 14 August 2017 the victim was walking along a footpath off Channel View Road when someone grabbed his right arm and spun him around. He saw two men, one armed with a knife and the other with a piece of wood.

One offender held the knife to the victim's face and neck and demanded money. The victim handed over a small quantity of cash.

The offenders demanded the victim's keys and phones but the victim refused to hand them over and he was struck with a piece of wood. They then fled the scene toward Clarence Road before the victim raised the alarm.

The victim - a local man aged in his 50s - did not sustain any visible physical injuries.

The first offender is described as white, six feet tall, of muscular build and approximately 19 years old. He wore a blue zipped up hooded top with the hood up, blue baggy denim jeans, white Nike trainers and had letters tattooed on each knuckle on his right hand. He spoke with an eastern European accent.

The second offender is described as white, approximately 19 years old, of slight build and was wearing a blue hooded top with yellow writing across the chest area and the hood up. He also wore blue denim jeans. He spoke with a local accent.

Detective Constable Siobhan Lovering, of Weymouth CID, said: "This was a frightening ordeal for the victim who thankfully did not sustain serious injuries.

"The incident took place during the day and I would appeal to anyone who was in the Channel View Road or Clarence Road area of Portland at the relevant time and saw anything suspicious to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly keen to trace an elderly man who walked along the footpath shortly before the incident and said hello to the victim."

Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team are fully aware of incident and can be contacted with any concerns.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 14:186. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
