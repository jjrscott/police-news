Three men have been charged and have appeared in court in connection with an alleged aggravated burglary in Ferndown.

It was reported that at around 9.55pm on Thursday 28 May 2020 three men entered an address on Ford Lane and allegedly took a quantity of cash before driving away in a white BMW.

During the incident it was reported that a male occupant was stabbed and he sustained injuries to his head and eye. He was taken to hospital for treatment.

A woman also reportedly sustained injuries to her arm that did not require hospital treatment.

Following enquiries three people were arrested. A 20-year-old Christchurch man was subsequently charged with aggravated burglary, criminal damage and failing to stop a vehicle when required by a constable. A 17-year-old boy of no fixed abode was charged with aggravated burglary and a 15-year-old Bournemouth boy was charged with aggravated burglary, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and inflicting grievous bodily harm.

All three appeared at Poole Magistrates' Court on Monday 1 June 2020 and are next due to appear at Bournemouth Crown Court on Thursday 2 July 2020.
