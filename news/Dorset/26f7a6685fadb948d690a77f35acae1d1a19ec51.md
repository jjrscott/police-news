A man has appeared in court in connection with an alleged assault on a woman in Gillingham.

Dorset Police received a report at 12.05am on Saturday 30 May 2020 that a woman had been found with a head injury in the area of Addison Close.

The victim, who was 29 weeks pregnant at the time, was taken to hospital for treatment to injuries sustained and very sadly it was found that her baby had died within the womb.

Following enquiries, a 34-year-old local man was arrested in connection with the incident. He was issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Friday 26 February 2021 for offences of child destruction and inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent. He is next due to appear at Bournemouth Crown Court on Friday 12 March 2021.
