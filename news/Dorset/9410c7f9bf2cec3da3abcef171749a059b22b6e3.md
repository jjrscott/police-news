# Update â€“ three due to appear at court in connection with reported affray at Bournemouth bar

16 October 2018

* * *

Three people are due to appear at court in connection with a reported affray at a bar in Bournemouth.

The incident occurred at Felson's Bar on Old Christchurch Road at around 11.40pm on Monday 26 March 2018.

It was reported that during an altercation a man aged in his 20s was hit on the head with a glass bottle, causing a small bleed on the brain that was not believed to be life-threatening and he was subsequently discharged from hospital. A woman aged in her 20s was also reportedly punched in the face, causing a facial injury.

A 22-year-old Bournemouth woman has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 26 October 2018 for offences of affray, assaulting a police constable in the execution of their duty, criminal damage and possessing a class B drug.

A 30-year-old Manchester man and a 22-year-old Derbyshire woman have also been issued with postal requisitions to appear at the same court on the same date for an offence of affray.

A 28-year-old man from Cheshire who was arrested on suspicion of affray in connection with the incident has now been released without charge.
