# Witness appeal following assault in Poole

25 September 2020

* * *

Officers investigating an assault in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The victim, a woman aged in her 20s, was walking along Catalina Drive, near to the Harbourside Car Park, at around 5.20pm on Wednesday 16 September 2020 when she was approached by two boys on a bicycle.

The boys, believed to be aged around 13, slapped the woman hard on her bottom before riding off. She sustained bruising as a result of the assault.

One of the boys was pedalling the bicycle and was wearing dark clothing, including a hooded top with the hood up. The other boy was standing on the back of the bike and was also wearing dark clothing, including a hooded jacket with a zip.

The bike was metallic grey in colour.

Police Constable Andrea Watson, of Poole police, said: "This was an unpleasant incident for the woman involved and I am appealing for anyone with information about who was responsible to please come forward.

"I am also keen to speak to any witnesses. I understand there was a woman nearby who called out to the victim to check that she was all right and would like to talk to her and take her account.

"There is also a taxi rank near to the incident and I would like to hear from any taxi drivers, or other motorists, who were in the area at the relevant time and may have dashcam footage of the boys or the assault."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200139886. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
