A woman aged in her 20s reported that she had been sitting talking to a man on the beach between the pier and the lifeguard hut between 3am and 4am today, Monday 18 June 2018, when he tried to kiss her and sexually assaulted her.

A 26-year-old Bournemouth man has been arrested on suspicion of sexual assault and is assisting officers with their enquiries.
