# Update in relation to reported dog bite incident in Weymouth

24 February 2021

* * *

The owner of a dog that was involved in an alleged dog bite incident has been identified following an image appeal.

At around 10.30am on Thursday 18 February 2021 a family group was walking along Queensland Road when they came across a small black Terrier type dog running loose on its own.

It is reported that the dog was barking aggressively and at one stage tried to get at another dog in a garden. It is also alleged that the dog jumped up at an elderly woman.

The dog then reportedly jumped up at one of the children from the group, so the woman of this group tried to look at the dog's collar for its details. When she did, the dog reportedly turned around and bit her hand causing puncture wounds.

Following enquiries, the owner of the dog has been identified and spoken to by officers. No arrests have been made.
