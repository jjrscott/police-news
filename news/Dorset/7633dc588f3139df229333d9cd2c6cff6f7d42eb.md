# Update â€“ man due in court in connection with alleged fail-to-stop collision in Weymouth

18 February 2020

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with an alleged fail-to-stop collision in Weymouth.

At approximately 6.15am on Wednesday 24 July 2019 it was reported that a cyclist was involved in a collision with a red Honda Civic on Greenhill near to the junction with Westerhall Road. It was alleged that the Honda failed to stop at the scene.

It was reported that the cyclist, a local man aged in his 50s, came off his bicycle as a result of the collision and sustained bruising.

Following enquiries by officers, a 50-year-old Swanage man has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Monday 24 February 2020 for offences of dangerous driving and failing to stop after a road accident.
