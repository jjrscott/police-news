# Update in relation to fatal collision in Charmouth

15 March 2021

* * *

A man arrested in connection with a fatal road traffic collision in Charmouth will face no further police action.

Dorset Police was called at 7.11pm on Thursday 23 January 2020 to reports of a collision involving a pedestrian and a car at the junction of The Street and Lower Sea Lane.

Very sadly, the pedestrian - named by his family as 90-year-old Peter Bide - died at the scene.

A local man aged in his 40s was arrested in connection with the matter and was released under investigation.

Following enquiries, officers have confirmed that he has now been released from under investigation and will face no further police action.

Officers will continue to support HM Coroner as the matter now proceeds to an inquest.

Police Sergeant Nikki Burt, of the traffic unit, said: "We have carried out a thorough investigation into this collision and compiled detailed evidence, which was considered by the Crown Prosecution Service. Following a review of all the evidence in this case, it was confirmed that the driver involved would face no charges in relation to this matter.

"Our thoughts remain with the family of Mr Bide at this very difficult time for them."
