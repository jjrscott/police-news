# Witness appeal following burglary in Dorchester

13 February 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for anyone with information to come forward following a burglary in Dorchester.

Sometime between 11pm on Tuesday 12 February and 7am today, Wednesday 13 February 2019, entry was gained to a property in Dagmar Road through an insecure door. A white Vodafone mobile phone and a black Huawei P Smart mobile phone were stolen from the victim's handbag as well as Â£5 in cash.

Police Constable James Curtis, of Dorset Police, said: "We are carrying out an investigation into this burglary and the victim is particularly keen for the phones to be recovered as they contain sentimental photos.

"I am appealing for anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area of Dagmar Road last night, or who comes across any phones matching the descriptions above, to contact us.

"I would also urge homeowners to make sure they take steps to help protect themselves against burglars and keep doors secure at all times.
