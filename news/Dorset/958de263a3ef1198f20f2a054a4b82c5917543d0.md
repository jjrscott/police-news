Officers investigating a fail-to-stop collision in Weymouth are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

Shortly before 9am today, Wednesday 19 December 2018, a collision occurred on the mini roundabout at the junction of Dorchester Road and Littlemoor Road.

The collision involved a red Nissan Juke and a black vehicle, which reportedly sustained significant front end damage but did not stop at the scene.

The female driver of the Nissan was taken to hospital for treatment to injuries that were not believed to be serious.

Police Sergeant Geraint Butler, of Weymouth police, said: "We are carrying out an investigation to identify the black vehicle involved and I am appealing for any witnesses to the collision to come forward.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who may have dashcam footage of the incident or who comes across a black vehicle that has sustained significant damage in unexplained circumstances."
