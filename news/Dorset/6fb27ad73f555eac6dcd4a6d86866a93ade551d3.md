# Update on arrest following reported fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth

17 May 2017

* * *

A man arrested in connection with a reported fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth has been released under investigation.

At about 9.05am on Tuesday 16 May 2017 it was reported that a collision occurred between a blue Citroen Berlingo van and an electric-assisted bicycle, which looks similar to a moped, on Christchurch Road at the junction with Derby Road.

The van reportedly failed to stop at the scene and was located a short time later nearby.

The bicycle rider, a 63-year-old Bournemouth man, sustained serious injuries and was taken to Southampton General Hospital. His condition is described as serious but not life-threatening.

A 44-year-old Bournemouth man arrested on suspicion of failing to stop after a road traffic collision has been released under investigation.

Police Sergeant Nikki Burt, of the traffic unit, said: "I am still appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision, or the moments leading up to it, and has not yet spoken to officers to please come forward."
