# Witness appeal following aggravated burglary in Boscombe

25 September 2020

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward as they investigate an aggravated burglary in Boscombe.

At around 6pm on Thursday 24 September 2020 the victim - a woman aged in her 30s - arrived at the block of flats where she lives in Sea Road and saw a man and woman on the communal stairway.

As she reached her front door the victim was approached by the couple. The woman assaulted the victim with a hammer and she was also kicked in the head by the man.

The offenders stole the victim's keys and took her into the flat before assaulting her further. The offenders then stole a number of items from the flat including the victim's handbag, which contained her purse, mobile phone and various keys.

The victim was taken to hospital for treatment to various injuries, including cuts and bruising to her head and face.

The female offender is described as white, aged in her early 30s, five feet five inches tall with blonde hair and a piercing on her upper lip.

The male offender is described as aged in his 30s. His face was covered with a scarf and he wore a big winter coat and woollen hat.

Detective Constable Stuart Dalladay, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was a shocking incident where the victim was subjected to a violent assault in her own home. We are determined to identify those responsible and are carrying out a full investigation into this matter.

"I am appealing for anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area around the relevant time, or who has any information that might assist our investigation, to please come forward.

"Local officers can be approached by members of the community with any concerns."
