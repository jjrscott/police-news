Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a serious injury collision near Verwood.

At 5.44pm today, Thursday 20 October 2016, a four vehicle collision occurred on the B3081 close to the Bakers Hanging junction which leads to Alderholt.

The collision involved a grey Seat Leon, a black Land Rover registered to a company from Verwood, a red Vauxhall Astra registered to a woman from Verwood and a silver Mitsubishi Colt registered to a woman from Bournemouth.

Police, paramedics, the fire service and the air ambulance attended.

The driver of the Seat, a man from Bournemouth aged in his 30s, had to be freed from his car by the fire service. He was taken to Southampton General Hospital by land ambulance after sustaining hip, pelvis and rib injuries. His injuries are not considered to be life-threatening or life-changing.

The B3081 was closed between Black Moor Road by the Ebblake Industrial Estate and at the Bakers Hanging junction which leads to Alderholt. It re-opened at 8.49pm.
