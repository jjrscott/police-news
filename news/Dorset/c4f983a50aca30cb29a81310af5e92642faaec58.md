# Dorset Police pilot partnership with Portland Port Police

17 July 2020

* * *

Dorset Police and Portland Port Police have signed a Memorandum of Understanding.

The signing took place on Friday 17 July 2020 and formalises a working relationship, which will see the two services support each other to keep the area safe for both local and transient communities.

Portland Port Police function under powers from the Department of Transport and manage the day-to-day security of the port and the immediate surrounding area. They provide a vital service in maintaining the safety and security of an important area within Dorset and to the thousands of visitors to the area every year.

Dorset Police and Portland Port Police have been working on a joint Memorandum of Understanding to develop this partnership. Now that it is complete a 12-month pilot of the work between both forces will follow.

Chief Inspector Stuart Pitman said: "This is an exciting opportunity for both forces. I am looking forward to supporting each other in developing our relationship into a sustainable long-term effort.

"While we have assisted each other in the past, this Memorandum of Understanding allows us to share resources and work much more closely than before to police Portland Port."

The partnership will involve the sharing of assets, improved communication and collating information. A 12-month pilot will allow both forces to adapt to the partnership and consider where any future improvements can be made and see where further developments are needed.

Martyn Underhill, Dorset Police and Crime Commissioner, said: "I have voiced concerns about the vulnerability of our coastline for several years and approached Portland Port Police to improve our working relationship.

"This announcement will see Portland Port Police and Dorset Police working more closely together and is an important step forward which will enable us to improve the safety and security of an area which is critical to our local economy and used by thousands of visitors every year."

Chief Inspector James Grant, the Chief of Portland Port Police, said: "The signing of this Memorandum of Understanding between Dorset Police and Portland Port Police is the result of a great deal of partnership work between us.

"This is an excellent opportunity for the development of a long-standing relationship that will enhance the security of our international port borders as well as enabling us to work together more closely with our colleagues in Dorset Police."

The Memorandum of Understanding between both forces will be reviewed after the first 12 months to understand if any further developments are needed.
