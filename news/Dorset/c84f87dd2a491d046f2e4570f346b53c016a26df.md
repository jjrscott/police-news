Officers investigating two assaults and a public order incident in Weymouth are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

The incidents occurred between 5.45pm and 7.45pm on Sunday 3 May 2020 outside the Londis store on Abbotsbury Road. Two male suspects were reportedly seen drinking alcohol and smashing bottles in the area.

They were seen to assault a man on a bicycle near to Old Parish Lane shortly before 6pm.

At around 7.30pm one of the offenders also reportedly assaulted a man who was assisting an elderly woman out of a car.

The offenders were described as white and aged in their late teens or early twenties. One had short brown hair and was wearing a dark tracksuit. The other had dark hair and was wearing a parka jacket with an orange inner hood.

Police Constable Don Duchscherer, of Weymouth police, said: "We are continuing to investigate these incidents and have made efforts to try and identify the victims involved but these have so far been unsuccessful.

"I would urge anyone with information as to who was involved to please contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200062395. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
