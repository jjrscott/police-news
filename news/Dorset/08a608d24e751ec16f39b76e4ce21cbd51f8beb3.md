# Witness appeal following racially aggravated incident in Boscombe

17 August 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a racially aggravated incident in Boscombe.

At around 2pm on Monday 3 August 2020 the victim - a man aged in his 40s and from Christchurch - was driving his taxi along Christchurch Road when he noticed a police car with blue lights approach.

He put his indicator on, pulled over and stopped opposite Woolverton Road.

The victim then saw a group of around three cyclists approach in his rear view mirror. One of the cyclists went into the back of the victim's black taxi at low speed.

It is reported the cyclist approached the passenger window of the taxi and racially abused the victim. He is then said to have banged on the roof of the car with closed fists, causing damage to the vehicle.

The victim was not injured in the incident.

The suspect is described as white, of large build and around five feet three inches tall. He wore a yellow Lycra T-shirt, yellow cycling shorts and sunglasses. His bicycle was black.

Police Constable Luke Kerslake, of Bournemouth police, said: "From my enquiries I have established that there were a number of people in the area at the time who may have witnessed the incident and filmed it on their mobile phones. I have also established that a man who worked in a nearby shop may have seen what happened. I would ask these people to please contact me as they may have important information that could assist my investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200114480. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
