# Appeal for information following robbery in Canford Cliffs area

31 December 2017

* * *

Police are investigating the suspected robbery of a man in Spur Hill Avenue, Poole at around 12:30am in the early hours of this morning (Sunday 31 December 2017).

The victim - a man in his 40s - was walking home from a night out in Penn Hill when he was pushed to the ground on Spur Hill Avenue. He was forced to hand over his mobile phone and wallet.

DC Adrian Turner from Bournemouth CID said: "Unfortunately, due to the poor weather and darkness, the victim was unable to confirm how many people were involved or give good descriptions.

"We are now conducting a number of enquiries, including identifying any CCTV and speaking to householders in the area who may have seen or heard something.

"I would ask anyone who saw something suspicious in the Canford Cliffs area to get in touch. For example, did you see a person or group of people running at around half-past midnight or a car driving at speed?"

"If you have private CCTV on your home or business, I would also ask you to check any footage around this time and let us know if you see anything unusual".

Anyone with information in asked to call Dorset Police on 101 quoting incident 31:11 or to call the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
