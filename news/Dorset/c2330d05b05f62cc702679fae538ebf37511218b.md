# Family tribute following fatal collision in Poole

25 March 2021

* * *

The family of a motorcyclist who sadly lost his life in a fatal road traffic collision in Poole have paid tribute to 'a very loved young man'.

Officers were called to a road traffic collision that occurred just after 9pm on Monday 15 March 2021 on the Dorset Way between the Oakdale slip road and the Tower Park roundabout involving a white Honda motorcycle.

Very sadly, the rider of the motorcycle - named by his family as 21-year-old Joshua Cartlidge from Poole - died at the scene.

His family said in a statement: "Joshua was a very loved young man, full of dreams and ambition. Unfortunately, his life ended far too soon. Joshua will be very much missed by his mum, dad, brother, sisters, niece and family and friends.

"Joshua did have a faith, as a family we hold onto this knowing we will see him again one day. Fly high Joshua, we love and miss you so very much. You will always be in our hearts."

Officers are continuing to carry out an investigation to establish the full circumstances of the collision.
