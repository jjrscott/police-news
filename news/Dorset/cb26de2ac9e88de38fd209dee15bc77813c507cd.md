A man has been arrested in connection with an alleged assault in Bournemouth.

Police received a report of an assault in Wootton Gardens at around 10.30pm on Monday 31 July 2017.

A man, aged in his 50s, was found in a property near to the scene of the incident with a serious head injury. He was taken to hospital for treatment and has since been discharged.

A 51-year-old Bournemouth man has now been arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent and has been released under investigation.

A 58-year-old Poole man previously arrested in connection with the incident was released without charge.

Officers are continuing to investigate the alleged assault and are keen to hear from any witnesses who have not already spoken to police.
