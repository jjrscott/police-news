# Witness appeal following serious road traffic collision in Gillingham

23 April 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a serious injury road traffic collision in Gillingham are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

At 11.46am on Thursday 23 April 2020 Dorset Police received a report of a collision in Le Neubourg Way, opposite the Waitrose supermarket, involving a red Seat Leon and a pedestrian.

Emergency services attended and the pedestrian, a three-year-old girl, was taken by air ambulance to Southampton General Hospital for treatment to injuries that are believed to be potentially life-changing. Her family has been informed.

The driver of the Seat, a 43-year-old man from Gillingham, was arrested on suspicion of driving offences and is assisting officers with their enquiries.

Road closures have been put in place to allow the emergency services to respond to the incident and for an examination of the scene to take place.

Sergeant Rhys Griffiths, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the family of the young girl involved in this collision and we are carrying out a full investigation to establish exactly what happened.

"I would urge any witnesses who have not already spoken to police or anyone who may have captured the incident on dashcam to please contact us.

"Finally, I would like to thank members of their public for their patience and understanding while the road closures are in place. These are necessary to allow for the emergency services to deal with the incident and for a detailed examination of the scene to be carried out safely."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at scit@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 23:132. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
