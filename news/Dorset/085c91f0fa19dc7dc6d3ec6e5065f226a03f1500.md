# Report of serious sexual assault in Bournemouth â€“ update

04 June 2016

* * *

Detectives investigating reports of a rape in an alleyway between Manor Road and Monkey Island on Friday 3 June 2016 have closed their investigation after the man who reported the offence confirmed to officers that he no longer wishes to make the allegation or support an investigation.

Dorset Police takes any reports of sexual assault extremely seriously and investigating these crimes is a Force priority. There are specialist investigators in the Force who are dedicated to investigating sex crimes and victims are always supported by specially trained officers and partner agencies.

We would like to take the time to thank those members of the public who came forward following the witness appeal and assisted detectives with the investigation.

If you have been a victim of a sexual offence do not suffer in silence, come forward and report it to the police. We will thoroughly investigate such offences, we will safeguard victims and we will bring offenders to justice
