A woman injured in a serious road traffic collision in Poole has sadly died.

Officers are renewing their appeal for witnesses to the collision involving a grey Toyota Yaris and a pedestrian, which occurred at the junction of Lake Road and Upwey Avenue in Hamworthy at around 4.35pm on Tuesday 20 November 2018.

The pedestrian, a 74-year-old Poole woman, was taken to hospital for treatment to a serious head injury following the collision. Very sadly, she was pronounced dead at hospital this morning, Friday 30 November 2018.

The driver of the Toyota, a local woman aged in her 70s, was checked over by paramedics at the scene but did not require hospital treatment.

Police Inspector Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "We were very sad to learn of the death of the pedestrian involved in this collision and her family is being supported by specially-trained officers.

"We are continuing to carry out a detailed investigation into the circumstances of the collision and I would urge any witnesses who have not already spoken to police to contact us.

"I would also urge any motorists who were travelling in the area at the relevant time and have dashcam fitted to their vehicle to check their footage."
