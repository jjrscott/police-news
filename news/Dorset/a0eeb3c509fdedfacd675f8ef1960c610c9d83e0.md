# Update â€“ two men due to appear in court in connection with fatal collision in Wareham

03 October 2018

* * *

Two men are due to appear in court in connection with a fatal collision in Wareham.

At 8.43am on Thursday 29 March 2018 Dorset Police was called to a report of a road traffic collision in North Street.

The collision involved an articulated lorry and a three-year-old boy, who was crossing the road with his family at a pedestrian crossing.

The boy sustained very serious injuries and was taken to Dorset County Hospital for treatment. Very tragically, he was pronounced dead a short time later. The boy's family continue to be supported by specially-trained officers.

A 43-year-old Basingstoke man was arrested at the scene and has now been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 9 November 2018 for an offence of causing death by dangerous driving.

A 71-year-old Wareham man also attended for a voluntary police interview in connection with a vehicle parked at the scene of the collision. He has now been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on the same date for offences of driving without due care and attention and failing to comply with the indication given by a traffic sign.
