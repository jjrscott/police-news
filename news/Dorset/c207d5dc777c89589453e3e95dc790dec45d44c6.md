* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following a very serious road traffic collision on the A350 near Blandford.

At 10.50am on Sunday 24 July 2016 officers were called to the incident at Blandford St Mary involving a red and black Suzuki motorcycle and a silver Honda Civic car.

The motorcyclist, a man from Poole in his thirties, was taken by air ambulance to Southampton with very serious head injuries. The driver of the Honda Civic, a woman in her thirties and from Blandford, was uninjured.

A road closure has been put in place between the Tesco roundabout and the Roundhouse roundabout.

Police Constable James Howes, of Dorset Police's Traffic Unit, said: "I am appealing for witnesses to the collision or the manner of driving of either vehicle prior to the incident to please come forward.

"I would also ask motorists to please avoid the area and use alternative routes as the road is still closed to enable collision investigators to examine the scene.

"We would like to thank the public for their patience while emergency services are dealing with the incident."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 24:162.
