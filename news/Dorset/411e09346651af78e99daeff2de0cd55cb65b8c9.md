# Appeal following assault and criminal damage incident in Bournemouth

17 April 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses and anyone with dashcam footage to come forward following a assault and criminal damage incident in Bournemouth.

At 5.50pm on Thursday 21 March 2019 the victim, a local man aged in his 40s, was driving along Wellington Road in a silver Audi A4 when he came to a stop at a set of traffic lights.

A man appeared at his passenger side window, banged on it with his fists and shouted abuse. He then lent into the car and attempted to pull the victim out of the car. As the victim tried to drive away, the suspect kicked the car and caused damage. The suspect got into a green Land Rover and followed the victim, forced him to make an emergency stop before he caused further damage.

The suspect is described as white, aged in his early 30s, five feet nine inches tall and of medium build. He had a fair complexion, jet black hair and a dark black beard. He wore a black jumper, high visibility jacket and black combat trousers.

Police Constable Ollie Burns, of North Bournemouth police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed this incident, or was travelling along Wellington Road at the relevant time and may have captured all or part of the incident on dashcam, to please contact Dorset Police."
