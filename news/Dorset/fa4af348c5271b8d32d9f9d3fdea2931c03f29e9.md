A man is due to appear in court in connection with a fatal road traffic collision in Bridport.

At 11.15pm on Monday 13 November 2017 a two vehicle collision occurred on the A35 Sea Road South close to the Crown roundabout involving a silver Mercedes convertible and a black Mitsubishi L200 pick-up truck.

Sadly, the driver of the Mitsubishi - 64-year-old Steve Spear from Bridport - died at the scene.

Three occupants of the Mercedes suffered serious but not life-threatening injuries and were taken to hospital for treatment.

A 31-year-old local man was arrested on suspicion of driving offences following the incident and has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Monday 1 April 2019 for offences of causing death by dangerous driving and causing serious injury by dangerous driving.
