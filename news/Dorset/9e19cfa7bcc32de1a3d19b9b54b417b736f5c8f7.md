Detectives are appealing for witnesses after a teenage girl was sexually assaulted in Dorchester.

The incident happened at around 8.40pm on Sunday 23 September 2018 along Bowling Alley Walk.

The victim - a 16-year-old girl from Dorchester - was walking toward Cornwall Road when she was approached from behind by a man. He pulled her into a gateway and touched her inappropriately before she managed to run away.

The offender is described as being shorter than five feet ten inches and was wearing dark-coloured coat.

Detective Constable Andy Marsh, of Weymouth CID, said: "We have specially-trained officers supporting the victim and are carrying out a number of enquiries in the town centre, including house-to-house visits and assessing any available CCTV.

"I would urge anyone who was in the area at the relevant time and saw a man acting suspiciously to please contact Dorset Police. This includes anyone who may have been driving along Trinity Street or Cornwall Road and may have dashcam footage available.

"The local neighbourhood policing team has stepped up patrols in the town centre and can be approached with any information or concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180154466. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
