# Elderly woman injured in collision in Wimborne has sadly died

25 June 2019

* * *

An elderly woman who sustained very serious injuries following a collision in Wimborne has sadly died.

At 1.51pm on Monday 24 June 2019 Dorset Police was called by the ambulance service to a report of a collision involving a white Chevrolet Trax and a pedestrian on Allenview Road.

The pedestrian, a 93-year-old woman from Ferndown, sustained a serious head injury and was taken to Poole Hospital for treatment. She sadly died from her injuries in the early hours of this morning. Her family are aware and the coroner has been notified.

The driver of the Chevrolet, a woman from Hampshire, was uninjured.

Allenview Road was closed to allow emergency services to deal with the incident. It reopened just before 8.30pm.

Sergeant Nikki Burt, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with this woman's family and friends at this very difficult time.

"We are carrying out a full investigation into the circumstances of this collision and would continue to appeal to anyone who was travelling along the road around the time of the incident and either witnessed the collision or may have relevant dashcam footage to please come forward.

"I would like to thank motorists and local residents for their patience and understanding while the road closure was in place. This allowed emergency services to provide emergency treatment and for collision investigators to carry out a thorough examination of the scene."
