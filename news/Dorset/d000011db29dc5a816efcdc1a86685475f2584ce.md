Detectives investigating a robbery at a bookmakers in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At 3.50pm today, Friday 15 March 2019, Dorset Police was called to a report of a robbery at Coral bookmakers in Seamoor Road, Bournemouth.

It was reported that the male offender had entered the store and made threats that he was in possession of a weapon before making off with cash. There were no reports of any weapon being seen and no reports of any injuries.

The man is described as black, aged around 30, six feet tall and of large build with a bald head. He was wearing a dark jacket, black trousers and white trainers.

Officers attended and searches of the area were carried out. Enquiries are ongoing to identify and locate the offender.

Detective Sergeant Mark Portelli, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I would like to reassure members of the public that we have launched a full investigation to identify the man responsible for this robbery.

"I would urge any witnesses or anyone who saw a man matching the description given in the area of Seamoor Road around the relevant time to contact us.

"I would also ask anyone who was driving in the area around the time of the incident to check their dashcam footage for anything relevant.

"I appreciate there may be concerns from members of the public as this is the second robbery involving a business incident in the town in two days. There is nothing at this stage to suggest the incidents are linked but we will have an increased police presence in the area and local officers can be approached with any concerns."
