# Advice from police after a series of jewellery burglaries

17 November 2016

Householders who own and keep jewellery in their homes are being urged to take steps to prevent them falling victim to burglary.

The advice comes from Dorset Police and Operation Liberal, the national police intelligence unit protecting vulnerable members of society from organised criminals who cross force, regional and national boundaries.

It is being shared as a response to a total of eleven incidents since late August this year, where burglars have appeared to be targeting properties in the Poole area for high value Asian jewellery.

While the majority of cases have seen unorganised, untidy searches, it does appear that properties have been targeted specifically to acquire jewellery pieces composed of Asian gold.

This aligns with a national trend identified by Operation Liberal, which shows criminals targeting homes belonging to families which have traditions of investing in gold as well as purchasing jewellery to wear at community and religious festivals.

Detective Inspector Neil Wright, of the Dorset Police Priority Crime Team, said: "While we do not want to deter anyone in our generally very safe county from wearing jewellery, this series of burglaries serves as a sobering reminder of the importance of home security in protecting our most valuable possessions.

"In all of the cases we are currently investigating, the intruder gained access to the property by forcing entry through a window or door. Several of the crimes were facilitated by either an insecure door or the intruder being able to force locks or frames open.

"You should ensure that all your windows and doors, and their frames and locks, are in good condition, are secured at night and when you leave your property, and could not be forced open by a criminal."

While jewellery was stolen in each of the incidents, a number also saw the burglars successfully making off with large amounts of cash.

DI Wright continued: "In terms of protecting your cash from burglars, the simplest and most effective advice is not to keep large amounts in your home.

"If you do need to keep cash at your property, secure it and any other valuable items in a home safe. Importantly, ensure this is bolted down and cannot be lifted: in one of the incidents in this series, the offender made off with a safe containing jewellery, passports and cash.

"Take photographs of your valuable jewellery pieces and keep a written record. This will aid police in returning any stolen property to you and will make it difficult for burglars to sell the items on without detection.

"If you are concerned about keeping your home safe, or think you may be at risk to this type of incident, please contact your local Neighbourhood Policing Team via the Dorset Police website, or call 101."

Crime Prevention Advice: Protecting your Jewellery

• Take photographs of your valuable jewellery pieces and keep a written record of what you have - do not keep the list and the photographs in the same place.
• Take extra care during times of celebration when more valuables may be in your home.
• Mark your jewellery and other valuable possessions. Laser engraving for jewellery is offered at many jewellers. You can also forensically mark your property, by using UV marking kits or similar methods.
• Register valuable items with a free register company such as immobilise.com: this will help police return any stolen items to you and make it difficult for burglars to sell property on.
