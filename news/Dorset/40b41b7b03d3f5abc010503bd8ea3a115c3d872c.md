# Witness appeal following reported robbery in Weymouth

28 January 2021

* * *

Detectives investigating a reported robbery in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The incident occurred at around 4.45pm on Monday 25 January 2021 on a gravel path that runs between Weymouth Rugby Club at the rear of Weymouth Bay Avenue and Lodmoor Country Park.

It was reported that a woman aged in her 50s was riding her bicycle when she was approached by two teenagers on electric scooters. They stopped to ask her for directions before reportedly grabbing her bag and dragging the woman to the floor.

The victim was allegedly kicked several times before her bag was taken from her and the offenders made off.
The victim sustained a cut to her face, as well as bruising.

Following enquiries two teenage boys - a 16-year-old from Southampton and a 17-year-old from Weymouth - were arrested on suspicion of robbery. They have been released under investigation as enquiries continue.

Detective Constable Charlie Soutine, of Weymouth CID, said: "Our investigation into this matter is ongoing and I am appealing for anyone with information that might assist our enquiries to please contact us.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who may have seen two teenage boys on electric scooters in the area around the time of the incident.

"I am appealing to any motorists who were travelling in the Weymouth Bay Avenue area around the relevant time to check their dashcam for any relevant footage. Also, please can I ask residents to check their home CCTV systems for any footage that may assist my investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210015798. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
