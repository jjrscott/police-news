Officers investigating a burglary in Ferndown are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Between 2.30pm and 3.50pm on Thursday 4 March 2021 a break-in occurred at a property in Church Road. The victim returned home to find that a front window had been forced open.

A security box containing personal documents and a number of items of jewellery were stolen.

Police Constable Liam Moss, of Dorset Police's Priority Crime Team, said: "Following initial enquiries, we believe there were three men seen acting suspiciously outside the property around the relevant time.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or has any information about who was responsible to please get in touch.

"Finally, I am also keen to speak to any motorists who were driving along Church Road and may have captured anything of relevance on dashcam footage."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210035951.
