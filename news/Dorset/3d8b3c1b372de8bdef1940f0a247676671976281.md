30 January 2019

* * *

Officers in Weymouth are appealing for anyone with information to come forward after a man indecently exposed himself to three teenage girls in the town.

Dorset Police was called at 8.35pm on Wednesday 23 January 2019 to reports that a man indecently exposed himself by the steps of Alexander Bridge on the Radipole Park side. The victims - three 16-year-old girls - had approached the steps before they ran away when they saw the man.

He is described as white, aged in his 30s and and around five feet six inches tall. He was wearing a dark coat.

Police Constable Will Harris, of Weymouth police, said: "This was understandably a very distressing incident for the victims and we are determined to trace this man.

"I am appealing to anyone who saw a man matching the description given in the area at the relevant time, or saw anything suspicious, to please contact Dorset Police.

"Officers have stepped up patrols in the area and anyone with concerns can contact the neighbourhood policing team."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190012032. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
