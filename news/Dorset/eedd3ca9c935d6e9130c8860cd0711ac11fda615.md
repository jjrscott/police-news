A 51-year-old man from Shaftesbury is due to appear in court charged with perverting the course of justice.

The charge relates to a series of acts which are alleged to have taken place between Wednesday 16 March and Thursday 5 May 2016.

The man is alleged to have given numerous false statements to police making allegations against a woman and sent a series of threatening text messages to himself from a different phone which he claimed were from the woman.

The offender and woman were known to each other.

The man is due to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Monday 12 September 2016.
