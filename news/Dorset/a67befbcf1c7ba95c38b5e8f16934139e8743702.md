Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a man was reportedly racially abusive to a passenger on a bus in Bournemouth.

At around 10.30am on Friday 26 April 2019 Dorset Police was called to reports that a man had been racially abusive to another passenger on board the route 222 More Bus. The incident was reported to the driver and he stopped the bus near to the Roundhouse Hotel in Meyrick Road.

The victim is unknown but is described as Asian.

A 38-year-old man from Poole was arrested on suspicion of using racially or religiously aggravated words intended to cause harassment, alarm or distress and has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Police Constable Ben Carter, of Bournemouth police, said: "We have been carrying out a number of enquiries but I have so far been unable to find out who the reported victim in this incident is and I would ask them to please come forward and contact me.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who was travelling on this bus and saw or heard what happened."
