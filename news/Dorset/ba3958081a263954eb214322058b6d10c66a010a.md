# Renewed appeal following reported burglary in Blandford

20 December 2016

* * *

Officers have renewed their appeal for witnesses following a reported burglary in Blandford - with an image being released of the missing medals.

It was reported that sometime between 1pm and 9pm on Thursday 1 December 2016 offenders gained access to a property in Damory Court Street and a number of items of jewellery and six WWI and WWII war medals belonging to the victim's father were stolen.

Five people have been arrested on suspicion of burglary and are currently on police bail until the end of January 2017 pending further enquiries. They are two men aged 28 and 34 and both from Portsmouth, a 29-year-old woman and a 26-year-old man - both from Southsea - and a 20-year-old woman of no fixed abode.

Police Constable Matt Weldon, of Blandford police, said: "I am releasing a picture of medals similar to those missing after the incident and am appealing to anyone who has seen these items for sale under suspicious circumstances to please contact Dorset Police.

"The medals are of great personal significance to the victim.

"Finally, I would like to remind residents to be vigilant, to ensure their properties are secure and report any suspicious activity to Dorset Police."
