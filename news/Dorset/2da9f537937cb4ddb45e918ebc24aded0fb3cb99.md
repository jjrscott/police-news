# Closure order secured for Dorchester property

28 January 2021

* * *

Local officers in Dorchester have secured a closure order for a property in the town.

The order was secured for an address in St Georges Road following reports of anti-social behaviour and drug-related activity.

At a hearing at Poole Magistrates' Court on Thursday 28 January 2021 the three-month partial closure order was imposed under the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014.

The order states that only the legal owner, legal tenant and those with written permission from Dorset Police can access the premises while it is in place.

Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team have been working over a period of several months to compile evidence to put before the court following concerns raised by residents in relation to anti-social behaviour and suspected drug-related activity.

Police Constable Natalie Skinner, of the Dorchester Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "We recognise the impact this kind of activity can have on those living in the area and we are committed to taking action in response to concerns of this nature that are raised by residents.

"We liaised closely with our local partners and have worked hard to put the evidence before the court to ensure this order could be secured. It is hoped it will improve the life of neighbouring residents and safeguard vulnerable individuals."

Anyone who has concerns about anti-social behaviour in their community is urged to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or call us on 101.
