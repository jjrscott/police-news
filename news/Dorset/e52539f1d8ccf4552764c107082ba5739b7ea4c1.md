Detectives investigating a serious assault in Dorchester are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 3.30am today, Wednesday 30 January 2019, Dorset Police received a report of a disturbance involving a group of men and women near to the Shell petrol station in London Road.

It was reported that two men were assaulted with a bladed weapon during the altercation. The offender is believed to have arrived at the scene in a dark-coloured car and was wearing a hooded top with the hood up.

One man, aged in his 30s, was taken to hospital for treatment to an arm injury that required surgery. The other victim, also aged in his 30s, suffered superficial cuts to his arm and attended hospital as a precaution.

Detective Inspector Andrea Power, of Weymouth CID, said: "This was a violent assault with a bladed weapon and we have launched a full investigation to identify the man responsible.

"I am appealing to any witnesses or anyone with information about this incident who has not already spoken to police to contact us immediately.

"There will be an increased police presence in the area as we investigate this incident and local officers can be approached with any community concerns."
