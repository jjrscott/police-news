# Witness appeal following reported robbery in Weymouth

22 September 2019

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward as they investigate an alleged robbery in Weymouth.

At around 2.20am on Friday 20 September 2019 a local man aged in his 20s was on The Esplanade, near to The Boat Cafe, when he was approached by a group of three white men.

The men reportedly demanded he hand over his property and one of them allegedly punched the victim in the face before they took his mountain bike from him.

The victim left the scene and the alleged offenders also made off, one of them reportedly riding the stolen mountain bike.

Three men - aged 19, 23 and 27 and all from Weymouth - have been arrested on suspicion of robbery and have been released under investigation as enquiries into the incident continue. The mountain bike has also been recovered.

Detective Constable Jacqui Gravenor, of Weymouth CID, said: "Our investigation is ongoing and I am appealing to anyone who witnessed this incident or who has any information about it to please come forward.

"I am particularly keen to speak to a man who is reported to have assisted one of the alleged offenders when they sustained an injury to their leg during the incident."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190148222. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
