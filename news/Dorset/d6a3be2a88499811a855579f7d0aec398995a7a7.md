04 January 2018

* * *

Two men arrested in connection with an incident in Poole that left a 13-year-old boy with a serious eye injury have been released under investigation.

It was reported that the boy was walking along Wimborne Road, close to its junction with Tatnam Road and the Co-Op food store, between 8pm and 8.15pm on Sunday 31 December 2017 when he felt something hit him on the leg. He turned round and was hit by something in his eye.

The boy sustained a serious eye injury and was taken to hospital. He is continuing to have treatment.

Two men, aged 19 and 20 and both from Poole, were arrested on suspicion of wounding with intent. They have both been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Police are still appealing for any witnesses to the incident, or anyone with information that can assist the investigation, to come forward.
