# Appeal following robbery at Bournemouth store

15 December 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a man robbed a Bournemouth store at knifepoint.

At around 5.20am today, Saturday 15 December 2018, a man entered Costcutter on Wimborne Road in Winton, approached the counter brandishing a large knife and stole a quantity of cash from the till.

He was seen to leave the store and run down Avebury Avenue. No one sustained any physical injuries.

The suspect is described as five feet 11 inches tall and of slim build. He wore a light grey zipped up hooded top, dark blue Nike tracksuit bottoms, dark-coloured trainers with white soles and bright blue shoelaces. He had a mask covering his face and wore gloves with orange fingertips.

Detective Constable Nick Taylor, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the Wimborne Road or Avebury Avenue area at around 5.20am today and saw a man matching the description given to please contact me.

"This was a terrifying experience for the member of staff and I would like to reassure the community that a full and thorough investigation is underway, including house-to-house and CCTV enquiries.

"We are also looking for the knife that was used in this incident and I would ask local residents to check their gardens in the event the weapon may have been discarded by the suspect. If they find something of interest, please do not touch it but call Dorset Police immediately."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180200851. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
