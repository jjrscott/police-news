# Appeal for information after man bitten by dog in Poole

12 October 2020

* * *

Officers investigating an incident where a man was bitten by a dog in Poole are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

At around 12.30pm on Sunday 27 September 2020 the victim, a man aged in his 40s from Poole, was running on Canford Heath when he briefly stopped to catch his breath.

At this point, a man and two women walked toward him with a black-haired German Shepherd that was carrying a stick. It is reported that the dog bit the victim's thigh near to his groin, causing a puncture wound.

One of the people with the dog forcibly got it away from the victim and put it back on a lead, while apologising to him.

The man is described as white, aged in his 40s, approximately six feet tall and of medium build with short brown hair that had a bit of grey in it. He was wearing blue jeans and a dark grey zipped-up hooded top.

The first woman is described as white, aged in her 40s, around five feet five inches tall and of slim build with blonde hair worn in a ponytail. She was wearing blue jeans and a black jacket.

The second woman is described as white, aged in her early 20s, also around five feet five inches tall and of slim build with blonde shoulder-length hair. She was wearing blue jeans and a black jacket.

Police Constable Jennie Sykes-Martin, of Dorset Police, said: "We have been carrying out a number of enquiries into this incident to try and identify the dog's owners, but these have so far been unsuccessful.

"While I appreciate this incident took place a while ago, I am hoping the local community may recognise the three people and their dog from the descriptions given.

"I would urge anyone with any other information to assist my investigation to please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200146228. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
