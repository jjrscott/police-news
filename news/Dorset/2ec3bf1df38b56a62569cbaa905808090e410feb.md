# Witness appeal following serious injury collision at Hurn

26 May 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a serious injury collision at Hurn are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At 2.20pm on Friday 24 May 2019 a road traffic collision occurred on Matchams Lane between Raceway and Snowtrax involving a blue Mercedes, a black Mercedes, a red Toyota Yaris, a Yamaha motorcycle and a tanker carrying human waste.

The driver of the tanker - a 52-year-old man from Poole - was taken to Southampton General Hospital for treatment to serious leg injuries, described as potentially life changing.

The driver of the blue Mercedes - a 34-year-old man from Eastleigh - sustained serious injuries to his spine and leg and was taken to Poole Hospital for treatment.

Matchams Lane was closed while a forensic examination of the scene was conducted. The road was fully reopened at 10.30pm after also being inspected by the local council.

Sergeant Phil Lee, of the traffic unit, said: "We are carrying out a full investigation into this collision and I would appeal to anyone who was travelling along the road at the relevant time and either witnessed the collision or saw any of the vehicles being driven immediately prior to the incident to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would also ask anyone with relevant dashcam footage to please get in touch.

"Finally, I appreciate the road closure caused considerable disruption to motorists but these were entirely necessary to allow us to establish exactly what happened."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 24:233. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
