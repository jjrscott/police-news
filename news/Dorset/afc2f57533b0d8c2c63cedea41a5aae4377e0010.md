# Witness appeal following serious injury collision near Upton in Poole

10 June 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a serious injury collision in Poole.

At 4.26pm yesterday, Sunday 9 June 2019, a collision occurred on the A351 near to the Bakers Arms roundabout involving a Honda motorcycle, a Honda CR-V car and a Mercedes Sprinter van.

The rider of the motorcycle - a 30-year-old local man - was airlifted to Southampton General Hospital with serious injuries that are described as life-changing.

No one else was injured.

Road closures were put in place between the Bakers Arms and the Holton Heath roundabouts to allow for collision investigators to examine the scene and for the casualty to be treated. The closures were lifted just after 7pm.

Inspector Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or saw the manner of driving or riding immediately prior to the incident to please call Dorset Police.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who may have any relevant dashcam footage.

"Finally, I would like to thank motorists for their patience and understanding during the road closure, which was entirely necessary to allow us to examine the scene and treat the injured rider."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 9:322. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
