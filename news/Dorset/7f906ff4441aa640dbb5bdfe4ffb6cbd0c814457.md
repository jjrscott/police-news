# Update â€“ man identified following reported suspicious incidents in Poole

09 June 2018

* * *

Officers investigating reported suspicious incidents at a bus station in Poole have identified a man they wished to speak to.

On four occasions between Monday 12 March and Friday 16 March 2018 two teenage schoolgirls had left school and were waiting at the station in Kingland Road to catch the bus home when they were approached by an elderly man.

The man is reported to have touched the girls' hair and made comments about how nice it was.

A further similar incident occurred at around 2.40pm on Monday 28 May 2018 at the bus station.

Officers carried out extensive enquiries to identify the man and establish the background behind the incidents but this was unsuccessful.

As a direct result of a photo appeal, a man was identified this afternoon, Saturday 9 June 2018, and has been spoken to by officers and is assisting with the investigation.
