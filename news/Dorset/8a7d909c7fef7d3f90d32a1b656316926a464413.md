Following a fatal road traffic collision on the B3082 Blandford Road near Kingston Lacy officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At approximately 9.20am today, 29 May 2016, emergency services were notified of the collision which had taken place at Badbury Rings.

A Honda motorcycle, being ridden by a 49-year-old man from Shaftesbury, was in collision with a Peugeot car, being driven by a 64-year-old woman from Gillingham.

Despite the best efforts of emergency services the rider of the motorcycle was pronounced dead at the scene.

Next of kin have been informed and the coroner has been notified.

The road was closed for a number of hours to allow a collision investigation to take place. Officers would like to thank members of the public for their patience during this time.

Police Constable Dave Cotterill, of Dorset Polices Traffic Unit, said: "The Honda motorcycle was in the company of two other motorcycles prior to the collision.

"I would like to appeal to anyone who witnessed the incident or may have seen the manner of riding of the motorcycles or the driving of the Peugeot prior to the collision taking place to contact us."

Witnesses and anyone with information should call Dorset Police on 101 quoting incident number 29:127. Alternatively, call the free and anonymous Crimestoppers line on 0800 555 111 where mobile phone tariffs may apply.
