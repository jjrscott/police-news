A woman has come forward in relation to a reported assault in Bournemouth.

A CCTV appeal was issued in relation to alleged assault and theft incidents that occurred at around 3.20am on Sunday 1 September 2019.

It was reported that a 22-year-old woman from Cardiff was attempting to withdraw Â£100 from the cash machine at Bath Hill service station on Bath Road when an altercation occurred with another woman. The suspect allegedly punched the victim on the lip and pulled her hair.
