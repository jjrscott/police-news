The man who died in a fatal collision in Bournemouth has been named by his family as Kevin Peat.

Officers were called at around 3.05am on Sunday 5 March 2017 to reports that a grey Vauxhall Astra had collided with a lamp post before hitting a tree along Harewood Avenue, near to the junction with Harewood Place.

The driver - 28-year-old Kevin Peat from Bournemouth - suffered serious injuries and was extracted from the vehicle by the fire service but sadly died at the scene.

The family of Mr Peat have today, Monday 6 March 2017, issued the following statement: "We are totally heartbroken to lose our beloved Kevin so tragically. Much loved son, father, fiance, brother, nephew, uncle, cousin, grandson and friend. He was truly loved by all who knew him and will be sorely missed."

Two male passengers of the Astra were taken to hospital for treatment to non-life threatening injuries.

Police Sergeant Mark Scammell, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or the manner of driving of the Astra immediately prior to the incident to please contact Dorset Police."
