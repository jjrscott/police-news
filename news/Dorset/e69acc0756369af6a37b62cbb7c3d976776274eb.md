# Alleged assault in Poole â€“ witness appeal

30 December 2019

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses after two men were allegedly assaulted at Poole's Tower Park.

At 7.46pm on Sunday 29 December 2019 it is reported an altercation occurred at McDonald's involving a group of teenagers and two male customers, who were helping staff asking the group to leave.

One of the men - aged in his 50s - was reportedly punched several times in the head. The second man - aged in his 60s - was reportedly punched and sustained serious injuries to his face, including a swollen left eye, a deep cut to his eye, a suspected broken cheekbone and possible chipped teeth.

A 15-year-old local boy has been arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm and is assisting officers with their enquiries.

Detective Sergeant Stef Belton, of Bournemouth CID, said: "One of the victims in this incident sustained some very serious injuries and we are carrying out extensive enquiries.

"I am aware that there were a number of people in the restaurant and outside at the time and I would ask anyone who saw what happened and has not yet spoken to officers to please contact Dorset Police."

Inspector Adrian Thompson, of Poole police, said: "I am aware this is the second serious assault reported to have occurred in the town over the weekend. While there is nothing at this time to suggest they are linked, I would like to reiterate that full investigations are underway and officers from the local neighbourhood policing team will be continuing with their proactive patrols and can be approached with any concerns."
