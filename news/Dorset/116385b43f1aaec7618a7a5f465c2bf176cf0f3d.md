# Further appeal following serious assaults in Boscombe gardens

17 June 2016

* * *

Detectives investigating two serious assaults in Boscombe Gardens in Bournemouth are appealing for the public's help to find the offender.

Officers were called at 4.07pm on Sunday 12 June 2016 to reports of a stabbing in the gardens.

Two men sustained serious injuries. A 34-year-old sustained injuries to his neck and face and a 44-year-old was also injured at the neck. Their condition was not life-threatening and they have since both been released from hospital.

No arrests have been made.

The offender is described as a white man and aged in his thirties. He has brown hair and was wearing a polo shirt, dark blue track suite type three quarter length trousers and a cream hooded top.

Detective Sergeant Greg Tansill, of Bournemouth CID, said: "As part of our early investigations the indications are that the victims and offender are known to each other.

"We believe the offender cut himself during the incident and I would urge anyone who knows of someone who sustained an injury to his hand on Sunday afternoon in suspicious circumstances to please come forward.

"Any witnesses to the incident, or anyone who knows who may have been responsible, is urged to contact Dorset Police.

"Officers from the local Neighbourhood Policing Team continue to carry out high-visibility patrols in the gardens to reassure the public."

Witnesses and anyone with information should call Dorset Police in confidence on 101 quoting incident number 12:308. Alternatively, call the free and anonymous Crimestoppers line on 0800 555 111 where mobile phone tariffs may apply.
