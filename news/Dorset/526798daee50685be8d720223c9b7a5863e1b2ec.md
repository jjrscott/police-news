11 November 2019

* * *

Officers investigating an alleged robbery in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward - with one man being arrested.

It was reported that at about 1.45am on Thursday 31 October 2019 the victim, a man in his early 20s, was approached on Glen Fern Road by another man who engaged him in a conversation and started to walk with him before assaulting him opposite the Glen Fern Garage and stealing a quantity of cash.

The victim sustained minor injuries to his hands.

Following initial enquiries by officers, a 46-year-old man from Bournemouth was arrested on the same day on suspicion of robbery and has been released under investigation.

Detective Constable Steve Allen, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We have made a number of enquiries and we now believe some members of the public were in Glen Fern Road at the time of the incident. They might have either witnessed the incident in full or in part.

"I would urge anyone who was in the area during the relevant time and has some information that could assist us to please come forward.

"It is also possible that somebody may have captured the incident on their dashcam. Therefore, I would asked motorists to please check and contact us if they have related footage."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190171582. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
