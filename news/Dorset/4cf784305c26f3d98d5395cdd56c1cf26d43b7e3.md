# Christmas drink and drug driving campaign â€“ 24 further people charged

02 January 2018

* * *

A further 24 people have been charged with drink or drug driving offences as part of Dorset Police's Christmas drink and drug driving campaign.

They are due to appear at court in Poole and Weymouth during January, February and March 2018.

The campaign ran from Friday 1 December 2017 through to Monday 1 January 2018. A total of 53 people were charged with offences during the campaign.

Throughout the month-long operation, officers requested breath tests from all drivers involved in road traffic collisions, irrespective of whether or not they suspected a drink driving offence.

Drivers expected to be tested during routine stop checks and if they were stopped for an offence. Drugwipe sample kits were used on drivers suspected of being unfit to drive through drugs.

As in previous campaigns, anyone charged with a drink or drug driving related offence during the campaign had their name and court appearance details released to the media.
