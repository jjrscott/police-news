# Family tribute following fatal collision in Crossways

09 August 2018

* * *

The family of a man who died in a road traffic collision in Crossways have paid tribute to him.

Mark Coombs, 51 and from Weymouth, sadly died when his blue Aprilia motorcycle was involved in a collision with a black Land Rover Discovery at 2.42pm on Tuesday 31 July 2018.

The collision occurred near to the entrance to the Hybris Business Park on Warmwell Road.

In a statement, his family said: "During his life Mark Coombs was a fun yet caring soul that lived to experience many memories. He always lived life in the fast lane and his positive outlook influenced many around him. His life was a thrill ride and he always celebrated life and was a true example of a brave, young-hearted man. And after his passing he has left us all with happy and funny memories.

"His friends and family have many fond memories that represent the special person he was, mainly involving motorbikes or some kind of party or festival, his favourite things. Like when he turned up to a wedding in his all leather bike gear and a helmet under his arm or throwing bbqs where his big group of friends would all come over. His fun soul would make anyone laugh and he took every opportunity and hurdle life threw at him.

"Mark was a caring man too, an amazing dad, husband, relative and friend. He would always be there whether he was by your side or a phone call away. He would put all his effort into everything to keep his family safe, happy and proud. He was chilled and positive and you would often find him enjoying life and soaking up the sun in the garden, music playing and a glass of wine.

"Making memories we will never forget were driven by his passion of finding the beauty in life, to live everyday as it comes and to enjoy it, we remember Mark with an important lesson to appreciate every day of your life."

The family has asked for privacy during this difficult time.
