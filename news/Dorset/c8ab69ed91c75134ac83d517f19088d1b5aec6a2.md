# Update in murder investigation following death of man in Weymouth

15 September 2019

* * *

A man and a woman arrested in connection with the death of a man in Weymouth have been released from custody while enquiries continue.

Dorset Police was called at 10.17am on Saturday 7 September 2019 by the ambulance service following reports of the sudden death of a 75-year-old man at an address on The Esplanade in Weymouth.

The death was initially treated as unexplained and enquiries into the circumstances surrounding the death have been carried out by detectives from the Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT).

A post-mortem examination took place on the afternoon of Thursday 12 September 2019. Further neurology and toxicology tests have been requested before a cause of death can be given, but the pathologist stated that the victim suffered injuries that are believed to be consistent with an assault. Following the conclusion of the post-mortem examination and as a result of further extensive enquiries, detectives launched a murder investigation.

A 28-year-old woman of no fixed abode, who was known to the victim and had been arrested on suspicion of murder, has been released on bail. A 37-year-old Weymouth man, who was arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender, has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

A 38-year old Weymouth man, arrested on suspicion of murder, remains in custody to assist detectives with their enquiries.

Detective Chief Inspector Rich Dixey, of MCIT, said: "We have kept the victim's family updated with these developments and they continue to be supported by specially trained officers. Our thoughts remain with them at this difficult time.

"We are conducting enquiries to establish the full circumstances surrounding the death and I am renewing my appeal to anyone with information that may assist our investigation to contact us. Especially if they may have witnessed or heard anything suspicious in the area of The Esplanade, to the rear of Alexandra Gardens, on the morning of Saturday 7 September 2019."
