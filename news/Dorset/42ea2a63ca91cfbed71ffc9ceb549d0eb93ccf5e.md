Detectives investigating an aggravated burglary in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 7.50pm yesterday, Saturday 6 January 2018, Dorset Police received a report of a disturbance at an address in Spetisbury Close in Bournemouth. It was reported that three men with baseball bats, whose faces were covered, had pushed their way into the property after knocking on the door and the occupants, a man and a woman aged in their 20s, had fled the scene.

It is not clear whether anything was stolen during the incident and nobody was injured.

Officers attended the address and a search was carried out for the three men, but they were not located.

Detective Inspector Scott Johnson, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I would like to reassure members of the public that a detailed investigation is underway to identify the men who forced their way into the address.

"I am appealing to any witnesses to the disturbance in Spetisbury Close or anyone with information that can assist our investigation to contact police."
