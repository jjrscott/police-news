Officers are appealing for any witnesses to come forward after a woman was injured by a dog in Poole.

At approximately midday on Saturday 6 July 2019 the victim - a local woman aged in her 50s - was walking her dog on the green area near to Hungerhill roundabout when a dog came over and jumped up at her.

The dog, described as a tanned pitbull or mastiff-type, dug his claws into the victim's thigh. She went to hospital for treatment to injuries to her leg and chest.

The owner is described as a white man aged in his 30s, approximately five feet five inches tall and of slim build with short blond hair. He was wearing a red T-shirt and dark-coloured trousers.

Police Constable Ferry van Rooij, of Poole police, said: "An investigation is ongoing following a full account from the victim a couple of days after the incident.

"The owner of the dog was with three other men at the time and took the dog away immediately after the incident without helping the victim.

"I am keen to trace the owner of the dog and would ask that anyone who knows who he is, or witnessed the incident take place, to please contact Dorset Police."
