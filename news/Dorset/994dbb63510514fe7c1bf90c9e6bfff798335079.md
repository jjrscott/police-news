# Annual awards ceremony marks exceptional contribution to policing in Dorset

27 February 2020

Dorset Police recognised police officers, staff and volunteers for their exceptional contribution to policing at the annual awards ceremony on Wednesday 26 February 2020.

The ceremony, which took place at Queen Elizabeth School in Wimborne, saw a total of 24 awards presented to the recipients in the company of family and friends.

Following nominations from colleagues within the Force, as well as endorsements from partner agencies, the honours were presented by Chief Constable James Vaughan, High Sheriff Philip Warr, Police & Crime Commissioner Martyn Underhill, former chair of the lay custody visitors Kathleen Emery, and previous Dorset Chief Constables, Jane Stichbury and Dirk Aldous.

Kevin Sargent was given the Lifetime Achievement Award at the event for his dedication and professionalism during his time in the Force. Kevin joined Dorset Police in 1986 as a dispatcher and by 2013 had secured the operations manager role in the Force Command Centre. Kevin has gone above and beyond the terms of what can be expected and has worked hard to make sure the first point of contact for the public is as professional as possible.

Police Sergeant Andy Jenkins received the Leadership Award for his work in developing and leading the County Lines Neighbourhood Team for Weymouth. Andy's vision was clear in how he could address the problem of county lines, he recognised that many of those involved were exploited and vulnerable people. Therefore, he focused on building relationships with victims in order to gain their trust. This has seen a large reduction in the threat of county lines in Weymouth.

The youngest recipient of an award was Cadet Molly. She has shown herself to be an excellent role model and leader at such a young age.

Citizens in Policing Coordinator Jenny Bronson, who is Molly's unit leader, said: "Molly is a cadet I would go to if I needed a responsible cadet for a task. She is an excellent role model and is absolutely thriving in cadets. It has been wonderful to see her grow in confidence each week."

As the winner of this award, Molly will take on the role of the High Sheriff's Police Cadet.

Chief Constable James Vaughan said: "It is always humbling to present these awards to our officers, staff, volunteers and partners. Our teams work incredibly hard and it is only right that we recognise them for their efforts in preventing and detecting crime and supporting victims."

Police & Crime Commissioner Martyn Underhill said: "The dedication, bravery and professionalism I see from Dorset Police officers, staff and volunteers on a daily basis never fails to fill me with admiration.

"It was a great honour for me to have presented some of these well-deserved awards, and I was particularly proud to have met one of Dorset's first police cadets - it's wonderful to see this great scheme go from strength to strength and help inspire brilliant young people like Molly."
