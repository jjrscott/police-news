# Witness appeal following assault and criminal damage in Dorchester

07 November 2019

* * *

Officers investigating an assault and criminal damage incident in Dorchester are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The incident took place at around 2pm on Saturday 2 November 2019 in the area of High East Street and followed a minor collision involving a car and a pedestrian.

A man, who appeared to be intoxicated, and a woman were seen leaving the Tom Brown's pub in High East Street and crossing the road near to Icen Way.

A woman drove past in a silver Volvo X60 sports utility vehicle and inadvertently clipped the man with her wing mirror.

The man proceeded to verbally abuse the woman, who had her eight-year-old daughter in the car, before assaulting her, attempting to take her mobile phone and causing damage to her vehicle.

The man then left the area by running up Icen Way in the direction of Fordington.

He is described as white, aged in his 50s, around five feet seven inches tall and of medium build with short dark hair. He was wearing a black jacket, blue jeans and brown boots.

Police Constable Nathan Boisse, of Dorchester police, said: "This incident understandably left the victim and her daughter very distressed and we are carrying out a number of enquiries to identify the man involved.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the incident, or who was driving in the area at the time and may have captured it on dashcam, to please contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190173028. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
