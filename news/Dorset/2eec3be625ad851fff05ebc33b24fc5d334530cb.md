# Witness appeal following theft from a store in Charmouth

29 March 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following the theft of items from a shop in Charmouth.

At 2.30pm on Monday 26 March 2018 a man is reported to have stolen a camping stove and sleeping bag from Dorset Leisure Centre on Newlands Bridge.

It is believed a second man distracted staff while the offence took place. They are said to have possibly spoken with Liverpudlian accents.

The offenders are described as white, five feet nine inches tall and of slim build. One wore a green cap and a green Barbour-style jacket.

They are thought to have left in a tatty gold-coloured Subaru Forester, registration Y215 HWE.

Police Constable Paul Metcalf, of Bridport police, said: "Both items stolen are worth a considerable amount of money and this theft will have a financial impact on the business.

"We have carried out research into the vehicle but it refers to the previous owner and no insurance details are currently held. We are conducting other checks on the vehicle, including speaking to neighbouring forces.

"I would ask anyone with information about the location of the vehicle or the offenders to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who has seen a camping stove or sleeping bag for sale in suspicious circumstances to please come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk, or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180045208. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
