# Witness appeal following robbery in Poole

10 April 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for anyone with information to come forward after a teenage boy was robbed in Poole.

The 14-year-old victim was near to the public toilets at Canford Cliffs beach with his girlfriend at around 8.50pm on Friday 6 April 2018 when he was approached by a group of around 15 teenage boys.

One of the group asked what was in his bag and demanded that the victim empty his pockets.

Another member of the group told the victim: "Give us your stuff or we will beat you up."

The victim held out a Nike bum bag that he had strapped across his body and it was grabbed off him.

The group went off with the bag and, although his girlfriend was able to recover it a short distance away, the victim's wallet was missing from it. The black leather faux Armani wallet contained cash, a bank card and a bus pass.

The first offender who confronted the victim is described as white, aged around 16 and around five feet ten inches tall and was wearing a full black tracksuit with the hood up.

The second offender who told him to hand over his stuff is described as white, aged around 14 and with his hair shaved short. He was wearing black jeans and a black padded body warmer with a long-sleeve black top underneath.

Detective Constable Lucy Hale, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This must have been a very distressing incident for the victim and we are carrying out a number of enquiries to identify those responsible including speaking to potential witnesses and investigating CCTV opportunities in the area.

"I am appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident and has not already spoken to police or who has any information that can assist our investigation to please come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180051672. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
