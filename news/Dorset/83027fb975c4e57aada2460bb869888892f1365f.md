A man arrested in connection with an alleged assault in Weymouth has been released from police bail without charge.

At around 3.20am on Friday 16 December 2016 Dorset Police received a report that a man had been assaulted in St Albans Street, following an altercation between a group of people in Actors Bar on New Street.

It is alleged that the victim - a local man aged in his 20s - was punched and hit on the head with a glass bottle during the incident.

The victim suffered a cut to his ear that required stitches and a swollen eye.

A 33-year-old man from Portland who was arrested on suspicion of assault has been released from police bail without charge.
