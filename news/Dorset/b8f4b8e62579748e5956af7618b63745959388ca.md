# Witness appeal following alleged armed robbery in Bournemouth

21 April 2018

* * *

Officers investigating an alleged armed robbery in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At around 1.40pm today, Saturday 21 April 2018, the victim, a 28-year-old Bournemouth man, was driving in a BMW along Wallisdown Road when he was held up in traffic prior to the roundabout near the BMW dealership.

It was reported that at this point the passenger door was opened by a man brandishing a knuckleduster and the driver's door was opened by another man threatening the victim with a knife and telling him to get out the car, which he did.

The two suspects then reportedly drove off with the BMW. The victim did not sustain any injuries.

Detective Sergeant Andy Haworth, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We believe that this incident didn't happen at random and there is a connection between those involved.

"As the incident happened in the middle of the day on a very busy road, I am sure a number of people would have seen what exactly happened and I am appealing for any witnesses to come forward."

A 21-year-old man from Poole and a 25-year-old man from Weymouth have been arrested on suspicion of robbery and a 24-year-old woman from Poole has been arrested on suspicion of conspiring to commit robbery. All three are helping officers with their enquiries.
