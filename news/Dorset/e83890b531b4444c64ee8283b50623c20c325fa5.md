# Officers appeal for information after indecent exposure near Dorchester

26 April 2018

* * *

Officers investigating an indecent exposure near Dorchester are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The incident happened at around 12.15pm on Saturday 14 April 2018 in Puddletown Forest.

It was reported that a male cyclist indecently exposed himself to two female horse riders before cycling away.

On Saturday 17 March 2018 a similar incident occurred when a cyclist indecently exposed himself to a female dog walker in Puddletown Forest. An e-fit appeal was issued on Thursday 5 April 2018.

Police Constable Gemma Nowell-Smith, of Dorchester police, said: "This is the second similar incident within a month and we believe both exposures to be linked.

"I would ask that anyone who may recognise the man from the e-fit to please contact Dorset Police or call Crimestoppers anonymously.

"Officers have increased patrols in the area and this will continue. I would urge anyone with concerns to contact the neighbourhood policing team."
