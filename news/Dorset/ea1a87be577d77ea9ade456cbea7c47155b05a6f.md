# Investigation into death of man on Portland â€“ update

05 August 2019

* * *

Detectives investigating the death of a man on Portland say a witness has come forward following an appeal.

Officers were called to High Street, Fortuneswell, at 5.30am yesterday, Sunday 4 August, following a request from the ambulance service for assistance as they treated a man with a head injury.

Sadly, the man - aged in his 50s and from Weymouth - was pronounced dead at the scene at 5.45am.

An investigation was launched to establish the circumstances of the death and an appeal was issued to identify a man who had been seen with the deceased man shortly before the incident.

Detective Inspector Scott Johnson, of Bournemouth CID, said: "Following our appeal, this man has now come forward to provide an account and assist with our investigation.

"As previously indicated, we do not believe there was any third party involvement in the death. We are not treating it as suspicious.

"I would like to thank all those who shared our appeal as well as those who came forward and our thoughts are with the man's family at this difficult time."
