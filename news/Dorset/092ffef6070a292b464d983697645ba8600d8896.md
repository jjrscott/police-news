# Witness appeal following fail-to-stop collision in Weymouth

20 August 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a fail-to-stop collision in Weymouth.

At around 11.54pm yesterday, Saturday 19 August 2017, a collision occurred on Sundew Close.

A black pick-up truck, possibly a Nissan Navara or Ford Ranger, left the road and collided with a property causing serious structural damage to the front kitchen area of the building.

The driver failed to stop at the scene and drove away in the direction of Dorchester Road.

Police Sergeant Mark Scammell, of the traffic unit, said: "Thankfully, the occupants of the property were in another room at the time and nobody was injured. The owner has been left devastated by the incident.

"The vehicle involved would have sustained extensive damage to the front end.

"I am appealing to anyone who saw the collision, or the manner of driving of the pick-up truck prior to the incident, to please get in touch.

"If you have any information about who was driving the vehicle at the time of the collision, or have seen a vehicle matching the description with extensive damage, contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 19:547. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
