# Assault in Weymouth â€“ witness appeal

23 June 2016

* * *

Officers in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward after an assault in the town.

The incident happened at around 6.30am on Wednesday 22 June 2016. A local man in his sixties was near Westham Bridge next to the swannery when he all of a sudden became the victim of an unprovoked attack as another man punched him in the face causing him to fall over. He sustained marks and bruising to his head.

The offender has been described as white, about five feet nine inches tall and of medium build. He has dark hair and was wearing a black hooded top, black jeans and trainers.

Police Constable Caroline Orchard, of Weymouth police, said: "The offender is unknown to the victim and this was a malicious attack on an innocent man.

"I would urge anyone who saw the assault or has information about the man responsible to please contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 22:51. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
