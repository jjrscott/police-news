# Man charged following alleged distraction burglary in West Moors

04 April 2018

* * *

Detectives have charged a man with burglary after it was alleged an elderly couple were conned out of their life savings in West Moors.

It was reported that at around midday on Monday 5 February 2018 three men attended their address on Pinehurst Road allegedly claiming to be from a water company who needed access to their property to perform checks.

The men reportedly roamed the property supposedly checking taps and the boiler, before leaving.

The victims then reported that sovereign coins and 6kg bars of silver - with a total value of around Â£40,000 - had been taken from a safe.

A 36-year-old London man was charged with burglary and is next due to appear before Bournemouth Crown Court on 26 April 2018.
