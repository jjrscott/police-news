# Alleged serious assault in Bournemouth - witness appeal

04 June 2016

* * *

Detectives in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward after reports that a man was seriously assaulted - with two men being arrested.

Police were called to Palmerston Road at around 11.45pm on Friday 3 June 2016 following reports of a stabbing.

It was reported that a man was seen carrying a knife near to the scene.

The victim, a 21-year-old man from London, was taken to Poole Hospital for surgery on puncture wounds to his arm and abdomen.

Detective Sergeant Andy Haworth, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who saw the incident or anything suspicious in the area at the time to please contact me.

"The weapon used is still outstanding and may have been discarded locally. If you do see a knife or similar object, please do not touch it and contact police immediately.

"A cordon has been put in place while officers make enquiries and there will continue to be a police presence in the area as part of the investigation and to offer reassurance to the public."

A 38-year-old man from Poole and a 46-year-old man from Bournemouth have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and are currently assisting police with their enquiries.

Witnesses and anyone with information should call Dorset Police in confidence on 101 quoting incident number 3:499. Alternatively, call the free and anonymous Crimestoppers line on 0800 555 111 where mobile phone tariffs may apply.
