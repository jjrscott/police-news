# Appeal for witnesses following fatal road traffic collision in Christchurch

13 October 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for any witnesses to come forward following a fatal road traffic collision in Christchurch.

At 2.32pm today, Friday 13 October 2017, Dorset Police received a report that a silver BMW was involved in a collision with a parked car and a pedestrian on Mudeford.

Sadly, the pedestrian - an 85-year-old woman from the Christchurch area - was pronounced dead at the scene. Her family has been informed and is being supported by a family liaison officer. The coroner has been notified.

The 94-year-old male driver of the car was uninjured.

The road was closed while emergency services dealt with the incident and to allow for collision investigators to examine the scene.

Police Sergeant Nikki Burt, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to any motorists or pedestrians who were in the area at the time and witnessed the collision to please contact me.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who witnessed the manner of driving of the vehicle immediately prior to the collision or who has a dash cam fitted in their vehicle.

"I would like to thank motorists and anyone affected by this incident for their patience during the road closure, which was essential to allow the emergency services to carry out their vital work and to allow for an effective examination of the scene."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at scit@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 13:245. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
