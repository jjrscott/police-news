# Investigation launched following death of man off Portland

10 September 2017

* * *

An investigation is underway following the death of a man who was pulled from the sea off Portland.

At 12.45pm today, Sunday 10 September 2017, Dorset Police was contacted by HM Coastguard following reports that they had rescued a man from the water near Pulpit Rock.

The man, who is aged in his 30s, was found to be in a life-threatening condition and was taken to hospital for emergency treatment. Sadly he was pronounced dead just after 1.30pm. His next of kin have yet to be informed. The coroner has been notified.

Chief Inspector Guy Shimmons, of Dorset Police, said: "We are currently trying to establish how the man came to be in the water. I believe he may have been with two other men prior to the incident and they are currently being spoken to by officers.

"I would ask anyone who was in the Portland Bill area earlier today and either witnessed what happened or saw a group of men prior to the incident to please contact Dorset Police."

No arrests have been made.
