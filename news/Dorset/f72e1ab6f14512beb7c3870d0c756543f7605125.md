A man who sustained life-threatening injuries in a collision near Holt in East Dorset has sadly died.

At 10.38pm on Friday 24 January 2020 Dorset Police was called to an unnamed road running from Chalbury Common to Holt Forest to reports that a white Volkswagen Golf had left the road and collided with a tree.

The fire service attended to cut the injured driver free.

The driver, a 20-year-old local man, sustained serious life-threatening injuries and was airlifted to Southampton General Hospital for treatment. He very sadly passed away earlier today.

Police Sergeant Craig Tatton, of the traffic unit, said: "All of our thoughts are with this young man's family and friends.

"Our investigation into the circumstances of this collision remain ongoing and I would appeal to anyone who witnessed the incident, or was travelling in the area at the relevant time, to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would also ask any motorists who were driving along that road at the relevant time with dashcams fitted to please check their footage and contact me if they find anything that may be relevant to my investigation."
