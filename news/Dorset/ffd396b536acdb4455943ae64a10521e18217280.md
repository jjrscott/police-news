Detectives investigating a reported robbery in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The robbery is alleged to have occurred on Southcote Road between 9.50pm and 10.20pm on Sunday 24 February 2019.

The victim, a woman aged in her 40s, reported that she was approached by a car - a black Audi A3 - being driven by a man known to her. He allegedly got out and threatened her, causing the woman to try and run away.

She then reportedly felt him grab her handbag from her shoulder before he walked off.

A 41-year-old Wimborne man was arrested in connection with the incident and has been charged with robbery. He appeared at Poole Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 26 February 2019 and is next due to appear at Bournemouth Crown Court on Thursday 28 March 2019.

Detective Constable Neil Jones, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We are continuing to investigate this alleged robbery and I would like to hear from anyone who witnessed a disturbance in the area on the night of Sunday 24 February.

"I would also urge anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area involving a car matching the description given to contact us."
