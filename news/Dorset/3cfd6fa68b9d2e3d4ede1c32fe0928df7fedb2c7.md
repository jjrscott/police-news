# Witness appeal following fatal road traffic collision in Bournemouth

22 January 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a fatal road traffic collision in Bournemouth are asking for any witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The collision along Holdenhurst Road at the junction with Windham Road was reported to police at 6pm on Tuesday 22 January 2019. It involved a white Ford Transit van and a green Triumph motorcycle.

Sadly, the motorcyclist - a 21-year-old man from Bournemouth - died at the scene. His family has been informed and is being supported by specially trained officers.

The driver of the van - a 27-year-old man from Bournemouth - was not injured.

Road closures have been put in place to allow emergency services to deal with the incident and carry out investigations.

Police Inspector Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "My thoughts are with the man's family at this difficult time.

"I am appealing for any witnesses to the collision or the manner of driving of either vehicle beforehand to please come forward. I would also ask anyone with relevant dashcam footage to contact us.

"I would like to thank motorists for their patience during the road closure, which is necessary to enable officers to investigate the scene thoroughly."

Due to the fact that the motorcycle was in close proximity to a police vehicle shortly before the incident, a referral will be made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 22:310. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
