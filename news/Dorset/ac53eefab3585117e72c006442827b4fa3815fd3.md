# Update â€“ wanted man from Bournemouth located

26 February 2021

* * *

A Bournemouth man wanted in connection with breaching the conditions of his licence has been located.

An appeal was issued by officers making enquiries to locate Damien Stephen Cable, aged 35, who was wanted for prison recall after reportedly breaching the terms of his licence having been released on Monday 9 November 2020 after serving part of a two-and-half-year prison term for drug offences.

Officers can now confirm that he has been located and has been recalled to prison.

We would like to thank everyone who shared our appeal.
