# Witness appeal following disturbance in Bournemouth

10 June 2016

* * *

Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a disturbance in Bournemouth in which two men were assaulted.

At around 12.25am on Thursday 2 June 2016, a disturbance took place involving around 15 people outside Southbourne Fried Chicken in Seabourne Road in the Southbourne area of the town.

During the incident two members of the public attempted to intervene to break up the disturbance.

A local man aged in his 50s was pushed to the floor and kicked in the head. He sustained injuries to his face and the back of his head.
A second man, aged in his 30s, was punched in the face and sustained an injury to his eye.

Two of the offenders were then seen to pick up chairs from outside the premises and throw them at the plate glass window causing it to crack.
No arrests have been made.

Police Constable Chris Brolan, of Bournemouth police, said: "I know that there were a number of people in the area at the time of the incident and I am appealing to anyone who saw the incident or who may have information as to who was responsible to please contact Dorset Police."

Witnesses and anyone with information should call Dorset Police in confidence on 101, quoting incident number 2:11. Alternatively, call the free and anonymous Crimestoppers line on 0800 555 111, where mobile phone tariffs may apply.
