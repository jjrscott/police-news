29 January 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a reported suspicious fire near Dorchester.

At 9.24pm on Thursday 25 January 2018 Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service was called to reports of a fire at the old RAF hangers at Crossways. They notified Dorset Police at 10.27pm and officers attended the incident.

Following examinations at the scene, it is believed the fire was started deliberately and an investigation is underway.

A 15-year-old boy from the Dorchester area has been arrested on suspicion of arson and has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Detective Sergeant Rhys Griffiths, of Weymouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the relevant time and saw or heard anything suspicious to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk, or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180013296. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
