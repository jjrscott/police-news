# Do you want to be a 101 & 999 call taker/radio operator?

23 September 2016

Dorset Police has launched recruitment for those considering a unique career as a 101 & 999 call taker/radio operator.

From the Force Command Centre based in Dorset Police's Headquarters at Winfrith, teams of 101 and 999 call takers and radio operators answer calls and co-ordinate police resources across the whole of Dorset, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

Dorset covers 1,024 square miles, has a resident population of 742,000 and attracts 14.3 million overnight stays by visitors each year. It is a busy place but has one of the lowest recorded crime rates in the country, and the Force Command Centre is key to keeping it that way.

The Force Command Centre is separated into two areas: call handling and radio operators, who task the appropriate police team. A team of 36 members of staff are normally on duty in the Force Command Centre at any one time.

Of the 290,000 or so calls received each year, on average just under 30 per cent are received via 999. Answering 999 calls is not always a matter of life and death. However, the way calls are handled can make a vital difference.

Force Command Centre Operations Manager, Wendy Eveleigh, said: "As you may have noticed with our recent 101 campaign, joining us means learning to expect anything. Dorset throws unusual, diverse and sometimes difficult situations at our staff every day.

"As a call taker you will be the first point of contact in answering and responding to calls of either an emergency or non-emergency nature, and as a radio operator, provide the vital link between members of the public and operational police officers.

"You must have the ability to listen and capture information quickly and accurately, an aptitude for quick decision making, and the ability to extract specific information to determine the correct response."

Matt Moore, a Force Command Centre team supervisor, said: "If you're looking for a job where you can really make a difference in a supportive environment, visit the website and find out more."

101 & 999 call taker/radio operator recruitment is open from 19 September to 14 October 2016. Dorset Police offers full time and part time working opportunities, with a potential salary of Â£25,682 and the satisfaction of being part of a team, making every contact count.
