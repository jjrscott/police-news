# Public appeal following theft of sheep in Dorchester

07 June 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for information from the public after a large number of sheep were stolen from a field in Dorchester.

Sometime between 6pm on Sunday 3 June and 8.30am on Monday 4 June 2018 approximately 25 ewes and 45 lambs were removed from a field off Maiden Castle Road.

The offenders cut a chain to gain access to the field and smashed the gates.

Enquiries are underway to identify the offenders.

Police Community Support Officer Sarah Pilcher, of Dorchester police, said: "A large cattle trailer with a 4x4 or a small lorry would have been required to remove the sheep from this field.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the area between the relevant times and saw or heard anything suspicious to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am also keen to hear about anyone who has gained livestock suddenly or has heard of meat being offered for sale cheaply.

"These type of offences have a huge financial impact on the victim. Dorset Police takes rural crime very seriously and such offences will be investigated thoroughly."

Members of the farming or rural community can access crime prevention advice at www.dorset.police.uk or by contacting their local neighbourhood policing team.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180085416. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
