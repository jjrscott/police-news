# Witness appeal following reported dangerous driving in Weymouth

10 April 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a reported dangerous driving incident in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage to come forward.

At around 5.35pm on Monday 8 April 2019 officers attempted to stop a silver Vauxhall Vectra in the area of Spa Road. It was reported that the vehicle made off from officers toward Dorchester Road.

The Vauxhall is alleged to have travelled along Dorchester Road at speed, weaving in and out of traffic and causing other vehicles to take evasive action before turning into Cranford Avenue and then into Fernhill Avenue. The vehicle was subsequently found abandoned in Ferndale Road.

The two male occupants were reportedly seen to leave the vehicle and head toward the Lodmoor Nature Reserve. Following a search of the area, two men were detained by officers.

Following a search of the vehicle a quantity of suspected class B drugs were located.

A 37-year-old man of no fixed abode was arrested on suspicion of driving offences and possessing a class B drug and has been released under investigation.

A 23-year-old Weymouth man was given a caution for possession of a class B drug.

Police Sergeant Geraint Butler, of Weymouth police, said: "We are carrying out an investigation into this incident and I am appealing for any motorists who may have witnessed it to contact us.

"I would also urge anyone who was driving in the area at the relevant time and has dashcam fitted to their vehicle to check their footage for anything relevant."
