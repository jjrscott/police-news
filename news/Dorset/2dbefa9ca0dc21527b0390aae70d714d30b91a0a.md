# Update - CCTV appeal following alleged racially aggravated public order incident in Bournemouth

12 January 2018

* * *

A man has come forward in relation to an appeal following an alleged racially aggravated public order incident in Bournemouth.

At around 7am on Sunday 24 December 2017 it was reported that a man, who was believed to be intoxicated, entered the Bath Road service station and attempted to use contactless on his mobile phone to pay for a pasty and obtain cashback.

When the cashier advised the man that the means of payment was not accepted, it was reported that he became verbally abusive toward the cashier and made racist comments.

Following a CCTV appeal, a 30-year-old Hampshire man has contacted officers and is assisting with enquiries. Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with this incident. We would like to thank everyone who shared our appeal.
