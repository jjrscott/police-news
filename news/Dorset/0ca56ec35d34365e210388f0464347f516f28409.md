# Update - appeal following concern for welfare at Studland

24 January 2017

* * *

Following our earlier appeal we are pleased to say that the man reported missing at Studland is safe and well.

The man's family contacted police after seeing the appeal and confirmed he is now back home in Wareham.

Police initially received a call from a member of the public at 3.35pm today, Tuesday 24 January 2017, reporting concerns for an elderly man at the Studland side of the Sandbanks Ferry.

We would like to thank everyone for sharing the appeal.
