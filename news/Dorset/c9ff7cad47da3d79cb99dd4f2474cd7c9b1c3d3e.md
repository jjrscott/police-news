Officers investigating a fatal road traffic collision in Holt are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At 2.07pm Dorset Police was informed of the collision in which a blue Jaguar had collided with a tree.

Sadly, a 78-year-old woman from Ferndown was pronounced dead at the scene. A man in his 80s, also from Ferndown, sustained life-threatening injuries and was airlifted to Southampton Hospital.

Officers are in the process of informing next of kin. The coroner has been notified.

A road closure has been put in place to allow emergency services to deal with the incident.

Police Sergeant Rhiannon Stroud, of Dorset Police's Traffic Unit, said: "I would like to thank motorists for their patience during the road closure.

"I am appealing for witnesses to the collision and to the manner of driving of the vehicle leading up to the collision to come forward."
