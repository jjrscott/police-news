# Renewed appeal for witnesses following serious collision in Hamworthy

20 October 2020

* * *

Officers are renewing their appeal for witnesses or anyone with home CCTV footage to come forward following a serious collision in the Hamworthy area of Poole.

Dorset Police received a report at around 10.45pm on Monday 19 October 2020 in relation to a collision involving a teenage boy on a pit bike on the recreation ground between Poole Rugby Football Club and the Turlin Moor estate in the Blandford Road area.

It was reported that the pit bike was involved in a collision with metal railings.

Officers attended, along with the ambulance service. The 16-year-old boy was taken by air ambulance to hospital in a life-threatening condition. His family has been informed.

When officers arrived at the scene, the pit bike was not there. It was located on the afternoon of Tuesday 20 October 2020.

Two local boys aged 13 and 16 have been arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice and are assisting officers with their enquiries.

Sergeant Rhys Griffiths, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts remain with the injured boy and his family at this time.

"Enquiries are continuing and I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision, or has captured all of part of it on home CCTV, to please get in touch."
