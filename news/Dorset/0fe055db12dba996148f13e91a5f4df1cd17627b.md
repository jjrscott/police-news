# Street robbery in Bournemouth - witness appeal

04 July 2016

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following a street robbery on a pensioner in Bournemouth.

The victim, a local woman aged in her 80s, had been to the Spar shop on Wimborne Road on the junction with Wycliffe Road in the Winton area to collect her morning paper. As she left and walked into Cardigan Road she was approached and pushed from behind causing her to fall over.

She sustained a fractured hip and a graze to her forehead and was taken to Poole Hospital for treatment.

The incident happened at around 10.35am on Sunday 3 July 2016.

The offender stole a brown shopping bag with zips on the outside. It contained her newspaper, a white purse, a second green purse and a green and black PDSA 'paw print' patterned umbrella. The purses contained a small amount of change.

Unfortunately, the victim was unable to get a description of the offender.

Detective Sergeant Andy Haworth, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was a cowardly attack and I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the incident to come forward.

"It is possible the bag or purses were discarded locally so I am asking the public to keep an eye out and if they spot these items to report them to police immediately and not to touch them.

"The victim has expressed her thanks and appreciation to a group of students who came to her aid following the robbery. The group have spoken to officers.

"The local Neighbourhood Policing Team has stepped up patrols in the area to offer reassurance to the community."

Witnesses and anyone with information should call Dorset Police on 101 quoting occurrence number 55160099803. Alternatively, call the free and anonymous Crimestoppers line on 0800 555 111 where mobile phone tariffs may apply.
