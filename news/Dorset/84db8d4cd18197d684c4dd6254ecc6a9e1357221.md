# Witness appeal following theft from motor vehicles in Christchurch

17 May 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a number of cars were broken into in Christchurch.

The offences occurred overnight between the evening of Tuesday 14 May and the morning of Wednesday 15 May 2019. In total Dorset Police received reports involving seven cars being targeted in Saffron Drive, Celandine Close, Juniper Drive, Coltsfoot Way and Woodruff Close.

Some vehicles may have been left insecure and it is unknown how offenders gained access to the others as the owners believed they had been locked but no damage was caused.

Police Community Support Officer Sarah Burton, of Christchurch police, said: “I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the relevant time and saw or heard anything suspicious to please contact Dorset Police.

“A number of the vehicles targeted had been left unlocked overnight. I would urge motorists to ensure they lock their vehicles and avoid leaving personal items inside, even if it is for a moment. Please don’t make life easy for offenders!
