# Witness appeal following burglary in Blandford

25 July 2018

* * *

Officers investigating a burglary at a home in Blandford are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 11.10am on Wednesday 18 July 2018 the victim, a woman aged in her 80s, returned to her home in Chapel Gardens having been away for around 40 minutes and found an untidy search had taken place throughout the whole of the property.

It is believed the offender or offenders scaled a fence at the rear of the property and forced entry through a back door. Two gold rings and two small hooped gold earrings were taken from the address.

Police Constable Dave Mullins, of Blandford police, said: "This burglary has understandably left the victim very shaken up after the privacy of her home was invaded.

"We are carrying out a number of enquiries into this incident, including house-to-house and exploring any CCTV opportunities in the area.

"I am appealing for anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area of Chapel Gardens or Black Lane around the time of the incident to contact police.

"I would also urge anyone with dashcam fitted to their vehicles who was in the area at the time to check their footage."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180113467. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
