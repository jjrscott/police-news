A man has been interviewed by officers in relation to a reported assault in Bournemouth.

The incident occurred at around 7.15pm on Thursday 23 April 2020 at the Tesco Express Store in Holdenhurst Road. It was reported that staff refused to serve alcohol to man who appeared to be intoxicated and when ushered out of the store he allegedly spat in their direction, with the saliva landing on one of the staff member's shoe.

Following a CCTV appeal, a 55-year-old Bournemouth man has attended for a voluntary police interview and is assisting officers with their investigation. No arrests have been made.
