# Appeal after criminal damage to Roman sarcophagus in Dorchester

20 April 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for information after a 1,600-year-old Roman sarcophagus was vandalised in Poundbury.

The artefact was being kept in Brownsword Hall in Pummery Square and was damaged sometime between 11pm on Saturday 15 April and 6am on Sunday 16 April 2017.

The lid of the sarcophagus has been removed and damaged beyond repair.

There was nothing inside the sarcophagus.

PCSO Matt Barton, of Dorchester police, said: "Because of the age of the item, it was considered priceless and irreplaceable.

"Due to the weight of the lid, it is likely to have taken several people to remove it and I am appealing for anyone who has seen anything suspicious in the area on the night in question or who has any information to contact me."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170057253. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
