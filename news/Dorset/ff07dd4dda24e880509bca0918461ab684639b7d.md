# Appeal for information following criminal damage to taxi in Poole

21 July 2020

* * *

Officers investigating an incident in Poole where damage was caused to a taxi are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

At around midday on Thursday 9 July 2020 the victim was driving his silver Mercedes E220 along Ashley Road when he noticed an elderly man on a bike on the other side of the road who appeared to be purposefully inconveniencing other road users.

It is reported that the elderly man got into an argument with a member of the public and the taxi driver shouted out of his window and told them not to become involved in the incident.

The cyclist approached the victim and began to strike the windows and doors of their vehicle with his fists and feet. He also used the handle bars of his bicycle to scratch the passenger side of the car.

Police Community Support Investigator James Somerville, of Poole police, said: "I have been carrying out a number of enquiries into this incident so far, including CCTV trawls of the area.

"While I appreciate this incident took place a while ago, I am appealing to any motorists who may have captured any relevant dashcam footage to please get in touch.

"I also understand that a number of other people spoke to the man on the bicycle and I would urge them to come forward as they may have information to assist my investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200099658. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
