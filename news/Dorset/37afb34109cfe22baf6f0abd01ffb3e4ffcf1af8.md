# Update â€“ arrest made in connection with reported criminal damage and arson incidents in Christchurch

24 March 2021

* * *

Detectives investigating a spate of reported criminal damage and arson incidents in Christchurch have arrested a man.

Four incidents are reported to have occurred during the evening of Saturday 20 March 2021 in the Burton area.

At around 7.35pm on Saturday 20 March 2021 Dorset Police received a report that damage had been caused to a vehicle that was parked on Martins Hill Lane. It is reported that a rock was found inside the vehicle and damage was caused to the front and rear windscreens, as well as a side window.

A short time later at around 8.10pm it is reported that an object was thrown through the window of a property in Martins Hill Lane. Shortly afterwards, another vehicle that was parked on Martins Hill Lane was found to be on fire.

A fourth incident was reported to Dorset Police at 9.13pm. It is alleged that a fire was started deliberately at a property in Summers Lane.

A number of other reported offences are being investigated between Monday 15 March and Tuesday 23 March 2021.

Detective Constable Luke Davis, of Bournemouth CID, said: "Following a detailed investigation, a 20-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage, arson and arson with intent to endanger life.

"We have recorded further reported crimes outside of this date period in this area and we are particularly interested to hear from anyone in Burton who either has home CCTV cameras and may have captured something of relevance or seen a young male on a peddle bike acting suspiciously in the area.

"Again I would appeal to anyone who has any information that may assist our investigation to please contact Dorset Police, or Crimestoppers anonymously."
