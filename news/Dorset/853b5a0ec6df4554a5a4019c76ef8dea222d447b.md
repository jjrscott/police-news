Police in Poole are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an indecent exposure at Upton Country Park.

At around 2.20pm on Saturday 8 October 2016, a local woman aged in her 70s was walking along a cycle path at the country park toward Poole when she was approached by a man.

The man indecently exposed himself before he ran away from the scene.

The offender is described as being aged in his 20s, of slim build and over six feet tall. He was white with a very pale complexion and had very blonde hair which was short at the sides and with a sweeping fringe at the front. He wore a black zipped up fleece and boxer shorts.

Police Constable Donal Doyle, of Poole police, said: "This was a distressing incident for the victim and I am appealing to anyone who saw this man on the cycle path at the relevant time, or has any information about who may have been responsible, to please contact Dorset Police."
