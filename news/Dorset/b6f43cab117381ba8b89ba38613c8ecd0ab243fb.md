# Family tribute following fatal collision in East Dorset

05 November 2019

* * *

The family of a woman who very sadly died following a collision in East Dorset has issued a tribute.

Dorset Police was called at 8.41am on Saturday 2 November 2019 to a report of a collision involving a grey Ford B-max and a tree on Verwood Road between the Alderholt turning and the A31. It is reported that the tree had fallen on the car.

Very sadly the driver of the Ford, 69-year-old Flora Walsh from Verwood, was pronounced dead at the scene.

Flora Walsh's family has now issued the following statement: "We are devastated to announce that our wonderful mum Flora, died on Saturday morning when a tree fell on her car.

"We are in shock and utterly heartbroken.

"Knowing what a popular, kind and loved woman she was, is such a comfort but we would appreciate privacy whilst we try to process what's happened and deal with our grief. Thank you."
