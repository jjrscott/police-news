A man is due to appear in court in connection with an alleged burglary in Bournemouth.

The 40-year-old of Bournemouth is due to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 8 April 2020 charged with burglary.

The charge relates to a reported burglary at the Co-Op store on Queen's Road in Bournemouth on Tuesday 7 April 2020. It was reported that, at 12.06am, two men gained access to the shop and stole alcohol, cigarettes and scratch cards.

Officers attended as the reported burglary was in progress and detained a man. The scene was secured while police dogs and the NPAS police helicopter searched for the second man, who had reportedly fled the premises.

All of the items were recovered, apart from two bottles of alcohol, which were dropped and smashed in the process.

Detective Constable Christian Bryant, of Dorset Police's Priority Crime Team, said: "Enquiries into this incident are ongoing and an investigation is underway to identify the man who reportedly evaded police.

"I would urge anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area at the relevant time, or who has any information, to please get in touch."
