Officers investigating a robbery in Blandford are appealing for any witnesses to come forward.

The incident is reported to have occurred at around 4.30am on Saturday 26 January 2019 in the Station Court car park.

The victim, a local woman aged in her 30s, was carrying her coat under her arm when she was approached by a man who was known to her. He grabbed the coat, wrenching it off her arm and causing the victim to lunge forward, hurting her shoulder.

The offender then made off in the direction of Damory Court with the coat, which is described as a black Gelert coat with distinctive pink zips and pink lining. Inside the coat was Â£150 cash, a mobile phone, tobacco, cigarettes, house keys and a small red torch.

Police Constable Ali James, of Blandford police, said: "We have been making enquiries into this incident, including attempts to locate the suspect.

"I am now appealing to anyone who witnessed the robbery, or who has any information that can assist our investigation, to contact police."
