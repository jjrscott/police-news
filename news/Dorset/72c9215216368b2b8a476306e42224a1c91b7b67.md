27 October 2020

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with a serious injury collision in Verwood.

Dorset Police received a report at 7.49am on Saturday 5 July 2020 of a collision on Black Hill, at the junction with Crescent Road, involving an Aprilia motorcycle and a Volkswagen Golf.

Officers attended, along with the ambulance service, and the motorcyclist - a local man aged in his 50s - was taken to hospital for treatment to serious injuries.

A 34-year-old Bournemouth man was arrested and has now been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 3 November 2020 for offences of driving without due care and attention, failing to provide a specimen for analysis and driving without valid insurance.
