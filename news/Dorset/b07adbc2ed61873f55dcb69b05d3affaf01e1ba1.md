# Witness appeal following fatal road traffic collision near Bridport

24 January 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a fatal road traffic collision near Bridport are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The collision occurred at around 7.50pm on Wednesday 23 January 2019 on the A35 near to the turning to Eype. It involved a red Ford Fiesta, a silver Nissan Micra and a silver Volkswagen van.

Sadly, the driver of the Fiesta, a 74-year-old man from the Dorchester area, was pronounced dead at the scene. His family is being supported by specially-trained officers.

The drivers of the Micra and the van sustained minor injuries.

Road closures were put in place between the Miles Cross junction and the Crown Roundabout to allow the emergency services to deal with the incident and for an examination of the collision scene to be carried out.

Police Sergeant Fern Graham, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the family of the man who died and we are carrying out a full investigation to establish the circumstances of this collision.

"I am appealing to any witnesses who have not already given an account to police to contact us. I would also like to hear from anyone who was travelling in the area at the time and may have relevant dashcam footage.

"Finally, I would like to thank motorists for their patience and understanding while the road closures are in place. I can assure members of the public that the closures are absolutely necessary to enable emergency services to respond to the incident and to allow us to carry out an examination of the scene."
