# Update â€“ man released without charge following alleged assaults on bus drivers

13 September 2017

* * *

A man arrested in connection with two separate alleged assaults on two bus drivers in Bournemouth has been released without charge.

The first incident occurred at around 7.30pm on Saturday 14 January 2017 on a bus that had stopped along Ashley Road in Boscombe. It was alleged that the bus driver was spat at during an altercation.

The second report related to an incident at around 1pm on Saturday 4 February 2017 when the bus was stationary at a bus stop in Horseshoe Common in Bournemouth. Again it was alleged that the bus driver was spat at.

A 58-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of assault in connection with both incidents and has now been released without charge and the bus drivers have been informed.

Officers are not looking for anyone else in connection with either incident.
