# Little girl dies following road traffic collision in Blandford

26 August 2017

* * *

A little girl involved in a road traffic collision in Blandford this week has sadly died last night.

At 7.52am on Thursday 24 August 2017 Dorset Police was informed by the ambulance service of the collision between a white Ford Transit van and a silver Vauxhall Astra on the A354 at Thickthorn Cross.

The driver of the Astra - a 34-year-old woman from Shaftesbury - and her three-year-old daughter were flown by air ambulance to Southampton General Hospital. The driver of the van - a 44-year-old woman from Salisbury - was taken to Salisbury District Hospital for treatment.

Police Sergeant Phil Lee, of the traffic unit, said: "It is with the heaviest of hearts, that I confirm that the young girl passed away yesterday evening."

"Our sincerest thoughts and condolences are with her parents and wider family. Specially trained officers are providing them support and I would ask everyone to respect their privacy at this exceptionally difficult time."

The drivers of both vehicles have now been released from hospital and are recovering at home with their families.

PS Lee continued: "I would like to renew our appeal for anyone who witnessed the collision or who saw the manner of driving of either vehicle prior to the incident to please contact Dorset Police.

"In particular, I would like the occupants of a silver Volkswagen Passat estate that exited the junction immediately prior to the collision to contact us as I believe they are significant witnesses and may have key information that can help us with our investigation.

"If anyone, who was travelling on the A354 at the relevant time, has captured the incident on dashcam, please come forward and get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Police Constable 1970 Kevin Farenden of the Serious Collision Investigation Team at Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 24:76.
