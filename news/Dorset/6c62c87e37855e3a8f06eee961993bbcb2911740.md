12 August 2020

* * *

Detectives investigating the death of a man in Poole following an alleged stabbing have charged a man with murder.

At 7.36pm on Sunday 9 August 2020 Dorset Police was called to a report of a stabbing at an address in Rossmore Road.

Officers attended, along with the ambulance service. A local 66-year-old man - named by detectives as Gary Ballett - sustained a stab wound to his abdomen and was taken to hospital for treatment.

Sadly, he died in hospital on the morning of Monday 10 August 2020. His family is being supported by specially trained officers.

A post-mortem examination was carried out on Tuesday 11 August 2020, which concluded that he died as a result of a stab wound to his abdomen.

Today, Wednesday 12 August 2020, Christopher John Stocks, 53 and of Poole, has been charged with murder. He is due to appear via video link at Poole Magistrates' Court on Thursday 13 August 2020.

Detective Chief Inspector Jez Noyce, of Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team, said: "Following a detailed investigation, we have consulted with the Crown Prosecution Service, which authorised the charge.

"Our thoughts remain with the victim's family during this extremely difficult time and we will continue to support them.

"It is important to stress - as is typical in such circumstances - that it would be entirely inappropriate for Dorset Police to comment further ahead of the trial. It is vital that the justice system is allowed to follow its course.

"I would like to remind the public that this matter is now the subject of active court proceedings and the individual charged in connection with this investigation has a right to a fair trial. It is important that there should be no commentary or sharing of information online or on social media that could potentially prejudice these proceedings."
