# Appeal after theft of four bicycles in Shaftesbury

19 September 2018

* * *

Officers investigating the theft of four bicycles in Shaftesbury are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward.

On Monday 10 September 2018, Dorset Police received a report of a burglary to a shed at a property in the area of St Lawrence Crescent. It is believed the padlock had been forced sometime overnight and four bicycles - worth between £1,500 and £4,500 each - had been stolen.

The victim - a man aged in his 40s - was due to use one of the bikes during the Weymouth Ironman event on Sunday 23 September 2018. He has since been able to borrow a replacement.

The bicycles include a black and green Specialized Stumpjumper, a black and white Cervelo road bike, a green Specialized Enduro and a white Frome hybrid.

Police Constable Rob Hammond, of North Dorset police, said: "I would appeal to anyone who has seen any of the bicycles for sale in suspicious circumstances to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would also remind residents to ensure their properties remain secure and to implement some basic crime prevention steps. This includes ensuring bicycles are tagged, that floor bolts and locks in garages are used and alarms and CCTV is installed."
