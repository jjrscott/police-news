# Dorset Police ask; "could your enquiry be answered by NED?"

18 January 2018

* * *

Do you have issues with parking? Noisy neighbours? Concerned with an animal's welfare? Not sure who to contactâ€¦ Then AskNED - the non-emergency directory.

Dorset Police has launched a new online knowledgebase designed to help the public find answers to common enquiries and guide them to the right agencies.

AskNED offers help and advice around a whole host of topics such as civil matters including landlord and tenant disputes, as well as criminal matters including burglary and assault. AskNED provides advice and information about what you should do and who can help.

The online service is quick and easy to use. It is an alphabetical list of topics the police commonly receive enquiries about, along with details of the agencies who can help you.

Head of Contact Management for Dorset Police, Superintendent Steve Lyne said: "Ask NED is a useful resource for the public, providing information on topics we are most commonly asked about.

"It is an alphabetical list of topics that hold information and signposting details for that subject. "Ultimately, I hope that AskNED will assist the public with questions they may have and divert people away from the 101 non-emergency number which will in turn provide further improvements to our service."

To access the AskNED knowledgebase visit www.dorset.police.uk/askNED. Remember, it is quicker and easier to report online, however the 101 non-emergency service is available should you wish to speak to someone. If a crime is in progress or life in danger always dial 999.
