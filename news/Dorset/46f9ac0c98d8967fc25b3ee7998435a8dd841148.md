# Model trains stolen in North Bournemouth burglary

02 March 2017

* * *

Officers investigating a burglary in North Bournemouth are appealing for anyone with information to come forward - with pictures of some of the stolen items being released.

The incident, in which a shed in Green Lane was broken into, happened between midnight and 12pm on Thursday 16 February 2017.

A number of model cars and railway items were stolen to the approximate value of Â£1000.

Police Constable Jennie Sykes-Martin, of Bournemouth police, said: "This has been a very upsetting incident for the victim as he has owned some of the stolen items since he was five years old - therefore making them of great sentimental value.

"I am now in the position to release pictures of some of the models taken in an effort to unite them with their rightful owner.

"Anyone with information about where the stolen items may be or who is responsible for the burglary should contact police as soon as possible."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170025821. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
