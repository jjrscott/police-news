A woman is assisting officers with their enquiries in relation to the reported theft of gin from a shop in Poole.

At around 4.25pm on Monday 3 December 2018 a woman entered the John Lewis store on Poole Retail Park and allegedly put a bottle of gin in a bag before making off without paying.

Following a CCTV appeal issued earlier today, a woman has been identified and is assisting officers with their investigation.
