At 10.50am on Sunday 24 July 2016 officers were called to the incident at Spetisbury involving a red and black Suzuki motorcycle and a silver Honda Civic car.

The motorcyclist, 30-year-old Fabio Jose Paixao from Poole, was taken by air ambulance to Southampton with very serious head injuries but sadly later died in hospital. His family are being supported by specially trained officers.

The driver of the Honda Civic, a woman in her thirties and from the Blandford area, was uninjured.

Fabio's partner, Mitzi Hurley, has today, Wednesday 27 July 2016, issued the following statement: "Fabio was a loving, caring do anything for anyone kind of man. Family man, business man, great friend!

"He loved his bikes and cars! He loved to help anyone, even strangers. He'd talk to anyone, such an open honest person. That is what we loved about Fabio!

"Fabio who was a dad, son and brother lived for his family - unconditional love for all those close to him! His son, Leo, says 'his daddy is the bestest daddy in the world' and will miss him so much.

"We all will miss him so much. Such a shock and devastating thing has happened to an amazing man. Love you Fabio, always and forever."
