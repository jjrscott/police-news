# Renewed appeal after serious road traffic collision in Weymouth

28 February 2021

* * *

Officers are continuing to investigate a serious road traffic collision in Weymouth and are renewing their appeal for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Following extensive enquiries, it would appear that the incident occurred at approximately 10.18am on Saturday 27 February 2021 on Rodwell Road, close to the Kingswood Hotel.

Eyewitnesses have reported that the involved cyclist had been riding up the hill on Rodwell Road in the direction of Buxton Road when he fell into the carriageway, before potentially being struck by a passing vehicle.

The cyclist, a 54-year-old man from the Weymouth area, remains at Southampton General Hospital in a critical condition.

Police Sergeant Rhys Griffiths, of the traffic unit, said: "Due to the reports we received, I am understandably keen to identify that vehicle and its role in the incident.

"Our CCTV enquiries point to a number of vehicles passing that location at the relevant time and I would again urge any motorists who did so to please make contact with us.

"I'm particularly keen to speak with the occupants of a number of specific vehicles, including a dark coloured Ford Mondeo, a white car derived van with roof bars, a dark Citroen Berlingo with a roof box and a motorcycle with a pillion passenger.

"All of these vehicles were travelling along Rodwell Road in the direction of Buxton Road and I believe may hold useful information to assist us with our enquiries. Therefore, I urge them to please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at scit@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210033067. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
