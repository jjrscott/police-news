# Update â€“ man due in court in connection with reported fail-to-stop collision in Weymouth

28 May 2019

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with a reported fail-to-stop collision in Weymouth.

The collision occurred at around 4pm on Tuesday 29 January 2019 on Queen Street and involved a Sym Jet4 moped and another vehicle, which reportedly failed to stop at the scene.

The rider of the moped, a 17-year-old local girl, sustained cuts and bruises and concussion. Her moped was also damaged.

Following a thorough and extensive investigation, a 30-year-old Dorchester man has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 4 June 2019 for offences of driving without due care and attention, failing to stop after an accident, failing to report an accident and using a motor vehicle without valid insurance.
