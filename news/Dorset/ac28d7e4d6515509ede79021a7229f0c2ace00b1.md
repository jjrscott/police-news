# Burglary in Bournemouth - witness appeal

20 September 2017

* * *

Officers in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses after a burglary.

The incident happened at around 8.20am on Tuesday 19 September 2017, at a house along Ensbury Park Road.

The victim - a man aged in his 20s - heard a noise in an upstairs bedroom. He went to investigate and discovered another man in his house.

After being challenged, the offender jumped out of the window onto a flat roof below and climbed down to the ground before making off on a bicycle.

It is not known at this stage if anything was stolen.

The offender is described by the victim as tanned, aged in his late 30s, around five feet eight inches tall and of medium build. He was wearing a black jacket, dark Adidas trousers with three white stripes down the legs, dark blue Nike Huarache trainers, black woollen gloves, a dark denim peaked flat cap and was carrying a plain black shopping bag.

Police Constable Lee Harrison, of Bournemouth police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or saw anyone matching the description of the offender in the area at the time to please contact police."
