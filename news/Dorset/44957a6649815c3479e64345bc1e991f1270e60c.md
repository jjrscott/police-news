# Cyber Security Challenge set to support Safer Internet Day

06 February 2017

* * *

Dorset Police introduces a Cyber Security Challenge in an effort to promote the safe, responsible and positive use of digital technology for children and young people as part of this year's Safer Internet Day.

Safer Internet Day 2017 will be celebrated globally on Tuesday 7 February with the slogan 'Be the change: Unite for a better internet'.

In support of this day of action, a cyber security challenge has been created, aimed at developing young people's skills and knowledge online in a safe and controlled environment.

The challenge is an opportunity for those who are interested in this area of online coding and hacking, to nurture their interests and find a safe and secure way of developing their skills.

The prize offered will be a day with the Dorset Police Cyber-crime Unit, seeing what they do and how cyber-crime is affecting Dorset. This will be an opportunity to gain experience and an insight into an ever growing area of online security.

Dorset Police Cyber-crime Officer, Jake Moore said; "This is an opportunity to steer people down the right path when it comes to computer hacking and coding, skills of which are in high demand among large companies and organisations looking to protect themselves against malware and other cyber related crimes.

"The challenge opens Monday 6 February and will close at midday on Monday 20 February 2017. The winner will be selected at random from all of the correct answers."

As part of the day, the Safe Schools & Communities Team (SSCT), who educate children and young people in an effort to help keep them safe in a digital world, will be offering a series of workshops and presentations highlighting the positive uses of technology and exploring the role we all play in helping to create a better and safer online community.

Safer Internet Day is celebrated in over a hundred countries, coordinated by the joint Insafe/INHOPE network, with the support of the European Commission, and national Safer Internet Centres across Europe.

With the theme; 'Be the change: Unite for a better internet', parents are also encouraged to use Safer Internet Day to become aware of the risks of being online, and help children and young people enjoy the internet safely and responsibly.
