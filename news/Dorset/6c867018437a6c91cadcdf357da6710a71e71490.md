# Witness appeal following fatal collision near Corfe Mullen

12 April 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a fatal collision near Corfe Mullen.

At around 1.20pm today, Wednesday 12 April 2017, Dorset Police was called to reports of a serious injury collision on the A31 near to the Coventry Arms pub involving a grey Vauxhall Astra and a grey Nissan Juke.

Sadly the driver of the Astra, a 68-year-old man from Bournemouth, died at the scene. His next of kin have been informed and the coroner notified.

The driver of the Nissan Juke - a 49-year-old woman from Waterlooville in Hampshire - suffered serious injuries and was airlifted to Southampton General Hospital. Her condition is not life-threatening.

Three men who were also travelling in the Juke sustained serious but not life-threatening injuries and were taken to Poole Hospital for treatment.

The A31 remains closed while collision investigators examine the scene. Closures are in place between the Roundhouse and Lake Gates roundabouts and at the turnings to Broadstone and Corfe Mullen and Candy's Lane.

Police Sergeant Mark Scammell, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident and has yet to speak to officers to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would like to thank motorists for their patience during the road closures which are necessary to allow emergency services to deal with the incident."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 12:223. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestopeers-uk.org.
