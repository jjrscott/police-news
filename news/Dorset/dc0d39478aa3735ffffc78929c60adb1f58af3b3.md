# Murder investigation in Bournemouth - woman named

10 July 2018

* * *

A woman who was found dead with stab wounds in Bournemouth has today, Tuesday 10 July 2018, been named by detectives.

At 5am on Sunday 8 July 2018 Dorset Police was called by the ambulance service to the area of Richmond Hill to reports that a man had been found with stab wounds to his leg.

Officers attended the location and following a number of enquiries found the body of a woman in a flat at Richmond Gardens. A knife was also recovered from the scene.

She has now been named by detectives as 34-year-old Venezuelan national Stela Marisabel Domador-Kuzma. Formal identification will take place in due course.

Her family is aware and is being supported by specially-trained officers. They have requested privacy at this deeply traumatic time.

The injured man, who is 20 years old and from Bournemouth, has been arrested on suspicion of murder, but was taken to hospital. It is understood that he was known to Stela.

A full investigation is underway led by detectives from Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT).

Detective Inspector Richard Dixey, of the MCIT, said: "A full and detailed investigation remains ongoing to establish the circumstances around Stela's death and our thoughts are with her family at this extremely difficult time.

"Following our initial enquiries, the timings that we are focussing on in particular are between 7.30pm on Saturday evening and 5am on Sunday morning in the area of Richmond Hill, Richmond Gardens and Dalkeith Lane steps. We would like anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious or out of the ordinary to get in touch.

"If you have any information that could assist the investigation, please contact Dorset Police urgently.

"The public can expect to see a continued increased police presence in the area and officers from the neighbourhood policing team can be approached with any concerns."

A cordon remains in place at Richmond Gardens while crime scene investigators continue to examine the scene.

Officers are also carrying out house-to-house visits and making CCTV enquiries.
