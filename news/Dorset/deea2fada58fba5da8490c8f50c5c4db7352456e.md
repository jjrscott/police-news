# Update â€“ appeal following report of indecent exposure in Bournemouth

19 October 2020

* * *

A man has been interviewed by officers in relation to a report of indecent exposure in Bournemouth.

It was reported that shortly after 3pm on Saturday 19 September 2020 a man was seen sitting on a bench without any clothes on in the yard of St James Church in Christchurch Road.

He was then allegedly seen a short time later with his clothes on, but it is believed he may have been performing a lewd act under his clothing.

Following an image appeal, a Bournemouth man aged in his 60s has attended for a voluntary police interview and is assisting officers with their investigation. No arrests have been made.
