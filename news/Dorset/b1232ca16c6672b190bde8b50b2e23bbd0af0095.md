# Update â€“ reported assault in Christchurch

27 January 2021

* * *

A woman has come forward following an image appeal in relation to a reported assault in Christchurch.

At around 3.25pm on Tuesday 12 January 2021 the victim - a local man aged in his 40s - was playing football with his son in Winkton playing fields on Salisbury Road when a woman shouted at the victim to pick his ball up.

It is reported that the victim turned around and saw a grey or black French Bulldog running toward his son who was holding the football, so he shouted to the woman that her dog should be on a lead.

It is alleged that a verbal altercation occurred, before the woman walked over to the victim while waving her arms and a ball throwing stick that she was holding.

The woman reportedly pushed the ball throwing stick into the victim's face. He sustained reddening to his cheekbone that did not require hospital treatment.

Following an image appeal, a woman has now come forward and is helping officers with her enquiries. No arrests have been made.
