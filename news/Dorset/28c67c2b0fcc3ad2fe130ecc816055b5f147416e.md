Detectives are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward after a man sustained a fractured jaw during an assault in Bournemouth.

At around 2.15pm on Friday 19 March 2021 the victim, a local man aged in his 20s, was driving along Holdenhurst Road when he noticed flashing headlights coming from the car behind him.

The victim stopped his car just passed the junction with Lytton Road and saw the car turn into Lytton Road and go out of view. He left his car and walked into Lytton Road to see if he could find the driver.

He was approached by the suspect who shouted at the victim and punched him several times to the face. The suspect walked back to his car, which is described as a white Volkswagen or Polo.

The suspect is described as white, approximately six feet two inches tall, of stocky build and was wearing blue jeans and a black jumper or jacket.

The victim attended hospital where is was discovered that he had sustained a fractured jaw in three places. He underwent emergency surgery and is now recovering.

Detective Constable Phil Riggs, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed this incident to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who was travelling along Holdenhurst Road or Lytton Road and may have captured the incident on dashcam."
