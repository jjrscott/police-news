11 September 2016

* * *

Detectives investigating an alleged assault in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward - with three men being arrested.

It was reported that a 23-year-old Weymouth man had been assaulted just after 2pm on Saturday 10 September 2016 in King Street.

The victim was taken to Dorset County Hospital. He had sustained a fractured eye socket.

Detective Sergeant Nicky Jenkins, of Weymouth CID, said: "Even though arrests have been made, I am appealing for any witnesses to the incident, who have not yet spoken with police, to come forward to enable us to find out exactly what happened."

A 44-year-old man and two 19-year-old men, all from Weymouth, have been arrested on suspicion of assault and are helping officers with their enquiries.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 10:263. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
