# Update â€“ man arrested in connection with reported distraction burglary in Bournemouth

07 May 2019

* * *

A man has been arrested in connection with a reported distraction burglary in Bournemouth.

It was reported that at around midday on Sunday 10 March 2019 a man knocked on the door of an address in Redbreast Road and told the elderly female resident that he had been on the roof of an adjoining property and claimed he had noticed a loose tile on her roof.

The victim told the man that she did not have any money and would need to go to the bank to get some cash out.

The man allegedly offered to go to the local Co-Op to get out cash for her and left with her bank card but failed to return.

Following enquiries, a 45-year-old Bournemouth man has been arrested on suspicion of burglary and has been released on police bail as detectives continue their investigation.
