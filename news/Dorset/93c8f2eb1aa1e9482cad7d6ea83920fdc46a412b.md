# Appeal for witnesses following serious injury collision in Bovington

25 July 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a serious injury collision in Bovington are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

Dorset Police was called at 6.20am on Saturday 25 July 2020 to a report that a grey BMW 320d left the road and was in collision with a hedge on King George V Road near to the entrance to Bovington Camp.

Officers attended, assisted by the fire and ambulance services.

The front passenger of the vehicle, a local man aged in his 20s, was flown by air ambulance to Southampton General Hospital. His condition is described as serious and his family has been informed.

A second local man aged in his 20s who was also a passenger in the vehicle was taken to Poole Hospital in a serious condition. His family has also been informed.

The road was closed to allow emergency services to treat the injured people and for an examination of the scene to be carried out. It has since been reopened.

A 27-year-old man from the Wareham area has been arrested on suspicion of driving offences and is currently assisting officers with their enquiries.

Police Sergeant Mark Scammel, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the injured men and their families at this time.

"We are continuing to investigate the circumstances of this collision and I would urge any witnesses or anyone who was driving in the area at the time and may have relevant dashcam footage to please contact us.

"Finally, I would like to thank members of their public for their patience and understanding while the road closure was in place."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 25:120. Alternatively, or alternatively to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
