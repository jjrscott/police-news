# New Deputy Chief Constable in position at Dorset Police

17 April 2018

* * *

Dorset Police's new Deputy Chief Constable David Lewis says he looks forward to maintaining the Force's high standards.

David took up his new position on Saturday 7 April 2018, when his predecessor James Vaughan was promoted to Chief Constable.

He said: "Dorset is a very high performing force and I want to help maintain those high standards and continue to provide an excellent service to the public.

"I am delighted and proud to be back as DCC in Dorset after my spell as South West Regional Assistant Chief Constable. During my five years as a Dorset officer I have come to respect and admire the Force and its people and to really enjoy being a member of the Dorset Police family. I am looking forward to working with old colleagues again and getting to know new faces.

"The great thing about Dorset Police is that it is full of talented, high quality people whose focus is on making a difference for the people of Dorset."

The role will see David act as Chief Operating Officer for the strategic alliance between Dorset Police and Devon & Cornwall Police.

He said: "I have enjoyed working closely with Devon & Cornwall in the past and I know it's also an excellent force with great people. But whilst I have worked alongside it and know many people there, I have got lots to learn. My emphasis will be on getting around to meet as many people as possible and to understand all the issues.

"The proposed merger between the two forces is an exciting opportunity and I will be working hard to make that a success.

"I look forward to assisting Chief Constable James Vaughan in improving the wellbeing of our staff, supporting and equipping people to do their jobs.

"I will also have a role to play in managing demand across the two forces and putting the right resources in place to deal with that demand."

David began his policing career as a constable in Bristol in 1990 and transferred to Thames Valley Police in 1993.

He worked in a range of roles across the Force, including Commander for Berkshire East and Head of Neighbourhood Policing and Partnerships.

In 2012 David was seconded to the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), where he fulfilled the role of Chief of Staff.

David joined Dorset Police as Assistant Chief Constable in July 2013, becoming operational lead for policing across Dorset.

In May 2016 he became the Regional Assistant Chief Constable for the South West, covering serious and organised crime, forensics and counter terrorism across five police forces.

He is married to Jayne and has four children.
