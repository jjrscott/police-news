# Update – appeal following theft of cash at supermarket in Gillingham

02 February 2018

* * *

A man has admitted taking cash that was left by a woman at a self-service checkout at a supermarket in Gillingham.

Dorset Police received a report at around 1.30pm on Saturday 23 December 2017 from a local woman aged in her 60s, who had requested £50 cashback at a self-service checkout at Asda in Station Road but forgot to take it. When she returned a short time later the money had gone.

Following a CCTV appeal and further police enquiries, a man who took the money has now been identified and has admitted the theft.

A community resolution has now been agreed, with the support of the victim, which has involved the man paying back the £50.
