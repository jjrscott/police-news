# Dorset Road Safe launches new road safety website

09 March 2018

* * *

Public services that work together across Dorset to improve safety on our roads have launched a new website - available at: www.dorsetroadsafe.org.uk

Dorset Road Safe brings together the police, fire service, health and local authorities to work in partnership to reduce the number of people killed and seriously injured on our roads through education, enforcement and engineering.

Members of the public can also share information on dangerous drivers, highlight areas where they are concerned about excess speed, find out more information on educational courses they can take part in, road safety operations Dorset Police is running as well as where fixed cameras and mobile speed enforcement vans are for the coming weeks.

The site hosts the latest road safety news updates from the partnership, upcoming events that members of the public can get involved in as well as updates from local authorities on new engineering schemes, traffic calming measures and other initiatives.

Julie Fielding, Assistant Chief Constable of Dorset Police and Chair of the Dorset Strategic Road Safety Partnership, said: "This website joins up all the road safety work that is taking place within Dorset and provides a one-stop-shop for members of the public with road safety enquiries or feedback.

"Visitors to the site can also take a look at historic road traffic collision data reported to us over the last few years and look at the circumstances of the collision, road conditions and resulting casualties.

"We would encourage members of the public to get in touch about how they find using the site along with any further improvements that can be made."

Martyn Underhill, Dorset Police and Crime Commissioner, committed to launching a new Dorset Road Safe website during his re-election campaign. He said: "In Dorset, road safety is a top concern for many of the residents I represent. Fantastic partnership work is taking place every day to prevent road tragedies from occurring, but few are aware of the many courses that are available.

"Meeting my pledge to transform the Dorset Road Safe website into a centre of excellence for road safety is just one step towards raising awareness of the various schemes that can help keep you and your family safe on Dorset roads."
