It is reported that at around 2pm on Saturday 25 January 2020 a man was seen to enter a restricted area of the nature reserve and steal two remote wildlife cameras that were in place for wild otter preservation and protection.

Following a CCTV appeal to identify someone officers would like to speak to, a man aged in his 40s has come forward and is assisting officers with their enquiries. No arrests have been made.
