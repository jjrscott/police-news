# Two due in court in connection with reported assault in Poole

04 January 2021

* * *

A 17-year-old boy and 19-year-old man are due to appear in court in connection with a reported assault in the Canford Cliffs area of Poole.

At around 8.45pm on Saturday 18 July 2020 a security guard was completing his regular patrol of Canford Cliffs seafront in his work vehicle when he came across a large group of teenagers. It is reported one of the group dropped something in front of his vehicle, causing the victim to stop, and another leant into his vehicle and ruffled his hair.

The victim got out of his vehicle and challenged the group. During the altercation it is reported the victim was hit with a bottle, punched and kicked by three members of the group.

A 17-year-old boy from Bournemouth and a 19-year-old man from Christchurch have been issued with postal requisition notices to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 15 January 2021 for an offence of assault by beating.
