Detectives are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward after a report of a rape on Weymouth beach.

The incident occurred on Sunday 27 May 2018.

The victim - a local woman aged in her 20s - had attended Actors nightclub on Maiden Street.

Sometime between 12.30am and 2am she was stood outside the club when she was approached by a man. The man pulled her away and led her onto Weymouth beach where she was raped.

The offender is described as white, aged in his early 20s and around five feet eight inches tall. He was of muscular build with very short dark brown hair, with a large nose and hands and was wearing a T-shirt and jeans.

Detective Constable Andy Stitfall, of Weymouth CID, said: "We have dedicated and specially-trained officers who are currently supporting the victim of this traumatic incident and a detailed investigation is now underway.

"It is believed there would have been a number of people outside the bar at the time and I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed what happened or who has any information that could assist with the investigation to please come forward.

"We are currently assessing the CCTV available to us to establish further lines of enquiry. I would also ask any drivers - particularly taxi drivers - who may have been in the area of The Esplanade at the time and have a dash cam to contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180080655. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
