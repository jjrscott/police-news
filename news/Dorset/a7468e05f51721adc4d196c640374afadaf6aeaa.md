A man arrested on suspicion of murder following the death of a man in Bournemouth has been sectioned under mental health legislation.

Dorset Police was called by the ambulance service at 2.20am on Friday 19 June 2020 in relation to reports that a 46-year-old man had sustained stab wounds at an address in Eldon Place in the Westbourne area of the town. He sadly died at the scene.

A woman aged in her 40s and a teenage boy, both from Bournemouth, were taken to hospital for treatment to injuries that were not life-threatening.

A 31-year-old Bournemouth man was arrested on suspicion of murder, but was also taken to hospital. He was discharged from hospital on the evening of Monday 22 June 2020 and taken into police custody.

Following an assessment by mental health professionals, he has now been detained under section two of the Mental Health Act and will remain in the care of the mental health services for an initial 28-day period.

A post-mortem examination carried out on the afternoon of Friday 19 June 2020 concluded that the victim died of stab wounds to the head and trunk.

"Our investigation remains ongoing and I would continue to urge anyone with information who has not already spoken to police to please come forward.
