# Appeal for information after indecent exposure in Corfe Castle

27 October 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward after an incident of indecent exposure in Corfe Castle. The incident happened at around 1am today, Saturday 27 October 2018 on East Street.

The victim - a woman aged in her 60s - was in the kitchen at the rear of her address, when she heard a tapping noise on her window.

She looked up and saw a figure standing at the kitchen door with their arm propped against the wall. She assumed it was a neighbour so unlocked and opened the door and at this point was confronted by a man she did not recognise indecently exposing himself.

The victim called out to her husband who was upstairs and the offender made off.

The offender is described as white, of large build and around six feet tall. He was wearing a balaclava-type mask, a green and white rugby-style long-sleeved top with horizontal stripes and light-coloured trousers.

Detective Constable Holly Spillman, of Weymouth CID, said: "This was a particularly traumatic experience for the victim and we are determined to identify the offender.

"Officers are conducting a detailed investigation and residents can expect an increased police presence while we carry out house-to-house enquiries and conduct increased patrols.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed a man acting suspiciously last night or the early hours of this morning in the Corfe Castle area to please come forward. "The neighbourhood policing team can be contacted with any concerns." Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180173862. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
