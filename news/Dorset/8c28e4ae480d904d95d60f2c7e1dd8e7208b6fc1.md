# Witness appeal following criminal damage to tug boat in Poole

03 February 2021

* * *

Officers investigating criminal damage to a tug boat in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At 9.11pm on Friday 29 January 2021 it was reported that a tug boat, which had been set loose, was stuck under the Poole Lifting Bridge.

Following enquiries, it is believed that four young people breached the security fence at Poole Quay and released 'Rough Rider' - a Poole Harbour Commissioner tug boat - from its moorings.

The heavy vessel floated into the channel, colliding with the RNLI launch and coming to rest under the lifting bridge.

The rising tide caused damage to the bridge. The boat sustained substantial damage, including to its radar equipment that will require costly repairs.

Police Sergeant Sophie Williams, of the Poole South Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "We are making a number of enquiries, including looking at CCTV.

"I would encourage anyone who witnessed the incident or has information about those responsible to please contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210018340. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
