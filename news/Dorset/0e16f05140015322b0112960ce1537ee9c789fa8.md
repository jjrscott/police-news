# Update â€“ men arrested in connection with reported assault in Bournemouth

30 July 2019

* * *

Detectives investigating a reported assault in Bournemouth have made two arrests.

Dorset Police received a report at 4.52pm on Saturday 27 July 2019 of an altercation involving three men at an address in Exeter Park Road.

One of the men sustained a stab wound to his shoulder, which was not believed to be life-threatening. The other two men reportedly left the location before officers attended.

Following enquiries, a 28-year-old Bournemouth man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. He has been released on police bail as the investigation continues.

A 38-year-old Bournemouth man has also been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and is assisting detectives with their enquiries.

As previously reported, detectives have also charged a man with attempted murder and assault occasioning actual bodily harm in connection with an unrelated incident in Wimborne Road on Sunday 28 July 2019 where a man reportedly sustained stab wounds.

Dorset Police Assistant Chief Constable Julie Fielding said: "I would like to reassure our local communities and our summer visitors that although any incident of this nature is of concern, these were not believed to be random acts and all reports are being actively investigated.

"We take all reports of knife crime very seriously and monitor these on a daily basis, in line with our plan to tackle knife-related crimes.

"The number of reported crimes remains in line with previous years and are relatively low in comparison to other areas and all such crimes are thoroughly investigated.

"Whilst I understand the concern that such incidents cause, these are thankfully rare and Dorset remains a safe place to live, work and visit. We continue to appeal for information about such offences and information relating to those suspected of carrying knives. "
