A man is due in court in connection with an alleged assault in Bournemouth.

Officers received a report that at around 3.30pm on Friday 16 June 2017 a 42-year-old local man was assaulted while walking over the bridge on the approach to the Kings Park Academy on Ashley Road.

He suffered a head injury and was given first aid by staff at the school, before going to hospital later that day, where he received stitches.

A 20-year-old man, of no fixed abode, has been charged with assault and is due to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 21 July 2017.
