A young schoolboy has died following a road traffic collision in Poole and officers are renewing their appeal for witnesses to come forward.

The incident happened at around 8.09am today, Wednesday 12 October 2016, in Sherborn Crescent in the Canford Heath area.

"Officers are continuing to liaise with local schools to give reassurances and to offer assistance at this difficult time.

"There were a number of people in the area at the time of the collision and I am appealing for anyone who witnessed what happened, and has not yet spoken to police, to please contact us as soon as possible."
