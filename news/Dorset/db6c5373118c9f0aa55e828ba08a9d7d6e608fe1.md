# Arrest made following Xanax drug warrant in Dorchester

16 November 2018

* * *

Police have made an arrest following a drug warrant in Dorchester regarding the suspected supply of the drug Xanax.

Officers from Dorchester and Weymouth Neighbourhood Policing Teams (NPT) executed the warrant under the Misuse of Drugs Act at an address in the Fordington area, today, Friday 16 November 2018.

A quantity of what is believed to be Xanax tablets, cannabis and a white powder suspected to be an illegal substance was seized.

A 16-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply a class A drug and is currently assisting police with enquiries.

Xanax, the brand name for the drug alprazolam, is a benzodiazepine - a controlled medicate used in some parts of the world to treat anxiety. It is not available in the UK on the NHS and is a class C controlled drug.

Xanax causes cardiac or respiratory difficulties, slow down reactions and can make a person feel drowsy, lethargic and forgetful. These drugs can also lead to problems concentrating, headaches, vertigo and are very addictive. When taken with or even without alcohol they can slow the heart rate down to dangerous levels.

Police Sergeant Ged Want, of the NPT, said: "The warrant was executed as a result of community-provided intelligence and I would like to thank the public for their continued assistance in relation to reporting suspected drug dealing or misuse.

"There are considerable risks associated with taking substances that have not been specifically prescribed. The consequences can be very serious and even fatal.

"You can never be sure what a tablet contains when it has not been properly prescribed or the potential effect it can have on you.

"I hope this warrant will also serve as a warning that we will act on information and are committed to protecting young people in our communities."

Anyone who wants to report alleged drug dealing in their community is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
