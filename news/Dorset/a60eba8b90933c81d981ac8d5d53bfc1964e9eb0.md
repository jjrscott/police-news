Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following a road traffic collision in Poole.

At around 5.30pm on Friday 22 January 2021 a collision occurred at the roundabout between Mount Pleasant Road and Parkstone Road involving a white Citroen C1 and a cyclist.

The cyclist - a local woman aged in her 50s - sustained an injury to her left shoulder that required medical treatment.

Police Constable Adam Carr, of Poole police, said: "I am carrying out an investigation into the circumstances surrounding this collision and would ask any witnesses to please get in touch.

"I would also like to ask any motorists who were in the area and have dashcam fitted to their vehicles to please check their footage for anything relevant to assist my enquiries."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210014577.
