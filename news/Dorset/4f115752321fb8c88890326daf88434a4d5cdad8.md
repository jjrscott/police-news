Detectives investigating an aggravated burglary in Bournemouth are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

It was reported that at around 6.30am on Thursday 2 November 2017 a man entered a property in Charminster Road holding an axe and demanded money. The man then picked up a laptop and television before leaving the address.

He was seen to go down an alleyway heading toward St Alban's Crescent.

Detective Constable Amy Burbidge, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was a very frightening ordeal for the victim and we are making every effort to locate the man involved. We have also taken steps to safeguard the victim.

"We have made a number of enquiries into this incident and I would ask any witnesses or anyone with information that can assist our investigation to contact police."
