# Appeal for witnesses after alleged street robbery in Bournemouth

02 May 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to an alleged street robbery on an elderly woman in Bournemouth.

The incident was reported to have occurred at around 1.25pm on Tuesday 1 May 2018 at the Texaco petrol station on Holdenhurst Road.

An 84-year-old woman was pushing her three-wheeled walking aid along the forecourt and onto the pavement when she was reportedly approached by a woman.

It is then alleged the woman took the victim's purse causing her to fall to the ground in the process.

The elderly woman sustained injuries to her hands and face and a number of potential witnesses came to her aid.

A 19-year-old woman was arrested nearby and has been charged with robbery. She is due to appear before Poole Magistrates' Court today, Wednesday 2 May 2018.

Detective Constable Luke Davis, of Bournemouth CID, said: "The reported incident occurred at a very busy time of the day and I believe there are a number of potential witnesses who are yet to speak to police.

"In particular, I am keen to trace a possible crucial witness who is described as a white man aged in his 30s who was wearing a yellow tabard and is thought to be a bus driver who may have been off duty.

"I would also like to thank those members of the public who came to the elderly woman's aid.

"Anyone with information regarding this investigation is asked to please contact Dorset Police urgently or call Crimestoppers anonymously."
