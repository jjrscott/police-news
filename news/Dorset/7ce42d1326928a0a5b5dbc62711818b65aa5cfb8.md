Officers investigating an assault in Bournemouth have issued an appeal for information.

The incident happened at around 6am today, Friday 2 June 2017, in Wellington Road.

It was reported that the victim, a Poole woman in her 30s, was near a bench between the bridge and Charminster Road when she was approached by a man who was known to her and punched to the head, causing her to fall to the ground.

A man passing by in a blue car stopped to assist the woman and offered to call the police.

The woman did not require hospital treatment for any injuries.

She was wearing a distinctive tartan pleated skirt at the time of the incident and officers are keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the assault.

Police Constable Phil Prentice, of Dorset Police, said: "I am particularly keen to speak to the man who stopped and offered to assist the woman but would also urge anyone who witnessed this incident to please contact police."
