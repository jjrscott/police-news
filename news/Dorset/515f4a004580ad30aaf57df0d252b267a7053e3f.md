# Witness appeal following assault outside Poole store

11 November 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward after a man was assaulted outside a Poole store.

At around 10.30am on Monday 9 November 2020 the victim, a local man aged in his 40s, was waiting outside Iceland in Adastral Square for his mother to finish shopping when the suspect asked him what he was looking at, before he hit the victim in the face. The victim fell to the floor and sustained an injury to his ankle. He was taken to hospital for treatment where it was discovered he had dislocated his ankle and sustained three fractures.

The suspect is described as white, aged around 20 years old, six feet tall and of slim build. He had brown hair and was wearing black tracksuit bottoms, a white Nike hooded top and a dark-coloured body warmer.

Police Constable Cara Bradley, of Poole police, said: "We are carrying out a number of enquiries in relation to this incident, including looking for any available CCTV.

"I would ask anyone who was in the area of the Iceland store at the relevant time and either witnessed the incident or knows who was responsible to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200168722. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
