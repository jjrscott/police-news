# Appeal for information following incident involving dog in Bournemouth

21 December 2020

* * *

Officers investigating an incident where a woman was attacked by a dog in Bournemouth are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

At around 3.15pm on Monday 30 November 2020 the victim, a woman aged in her 50s, was on Westover Road - near to the Cote Brasserie - when a woman walked past with a dog.

The dog got hold of the woman's coat in its mouth and dragged the woman to the ground. The victim sustained bruising as a result.

The dog is described as a grey bulldog-type and it was with a woman who is white, around five feet seven inches tall and of slim build with long blonde hair. She was with two men, one of whom was riding on a Beryl Bike.

Police Constable Jennie Sykes-Martin, of Dorset Police, said: "We are carrying out enquiries into this matter and I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or has any information about the dog and owner involved to please get in touch.

"I would also urge the dog owner to do the right thing and come forward so we can take your account."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200180181. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
