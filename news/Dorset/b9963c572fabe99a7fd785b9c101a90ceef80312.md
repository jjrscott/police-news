# Fatal collision near Weymouth - witness appeal

17 May 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses after a fatal collision on the B3157 Coast Road near Weymouth.

Police were called at 8.34am today, Wednesday 17 May 2017, to reports of a serious road traffic collision between a grey BMW 530d and a black Hyundai I30 near to Rodden Lane.

The driver of the Hyundai - a 37-year-old Portishead man - was sadly pronounced dead at the scene. His next of kin have been informed.

The driver of the BMW - a 23-year-old man from the Weymouth area - was taken to Dorset County Hospital with serious injuries and was later transferred to Southampton General Hospital for treatment. His condition is not believed to be life-threatening.

A road closure was put in place between Fleet roundabout and Portesham and the road remains closed at this time.

Police Acting Inspector Joe Pardey, of Dorset Police's traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or the manner of driving of either vehicle prior to the incident to come forward.

"I would like to thank motorists for their continued patience while the road is closed. This is to allow emergency services to deal with the incident and collision investigators to examine the scene."
