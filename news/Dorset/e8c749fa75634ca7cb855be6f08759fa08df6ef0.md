# Update â€“ man charged in connection with reported robbery in Poole

10 February 2021

* * *

A man has been charged and is due to appear in court in connection with a reported knifepoint robbery in Poole.

The victim, a 14-year-old local boy, had just withdrawn a quantity of cash from the ATM outside Co-op in Blandford Road, Hamworthy, at around 10pm on Monday 8 February 2021 when he was approached by a man he recognised.

It was reported that the man was holding a Stanley knife and demanded money from the victim before stealing his phone, cash and bank card. The victim made off on a scooter along Hamilton Road.

Following enquiries, an 18-year-old Bournemouth man was arrested and he has now been charged with robbery and possessing a knife or bladed article in a public place. He is due to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 10 February 2021.

Officers are continuing to appeal for witnesses or anyone with information about the incident to come forward. They are particularly keen to speak to a woman who the victim approached in Hamilton Road shortly after the robbery and asked if he could use their phone.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210023452.
