# Appeal for information following serious collision in West Dorset

01 September 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward following a serious injury road traffic collision on the B3157 Coast Road in West Dorset.

Dorset Police received a report at 2.03pm on Sunday 1 September 2019 of a collision involving a silver Honda motorcycle travelling east and a black BMW 1 Series travelling in the opposite direction between Abbotsbury and Swyre, near to the junction with Clay Lane.

Officers attended, along with the fire and ambulance services. The motorcyclist, a man aged in his 40s from Wiltshire, was airlifted to Southampton General Hospital with serious injuries. He is believed to be in a critical condition.

His family has been informed and is being supported by specially-trained officers.

The occupants of the BMW did not sustain any serious injuries.

Road closures were put in place while emergency services dealt with the incident and carried out an examination of the collision scene.

Police Sergeant Sarah Jones, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the family of the man involved at this time and we are carrying out a full investigation so we can establish the circumstances of this collision.

"I would urge any witnesses who have not already spoken to police to contact us and would also encourage anyone who was driving in the area at the time and has dashcam fitted to their vehicle to please check their footage for anything relevant.

"Finally, I appreciate the road closures will have caused disruption for members of the public and would like to thank them for their patience and understanding as these were absolutely necessary to allow the emergency services to respond to the incident and for us to carry out a thorough examination of the scene."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 1:242. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
