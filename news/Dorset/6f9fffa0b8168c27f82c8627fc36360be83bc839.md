# Warning as two people taken ill after taking substance

04 March 2018

Police are warning the public of the dangers of a pill known as 'Blue Punisher' after two people were taken ill after using the substance.

Dorset Police received information from the South Western Ambulance Service that two people had been treated in Bournemouth town centre for serious side-effects after taking what was believed to be an ecstasy based drug over the weekend.

Both later confirmed they had taken a pill known as 'Blue Punisher', a blue pill with a skull logo that has a strong aniseed or chemical smell.

One of the people treated by the ambulance service was suffering from convulsions and experiencing psychosis and the other was said to be very ill and vomiting. Both were taken to hospital for treatment.

Detective Inspector Scott Johnson, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We would strongly advise people thinking of taking substances such as this to think again and want to make them aware of this particular batch of drugs.

"You can never be sure what you are taking when you use illegal substances and the side-effects are unpredictable and potentially life-threatening.

"If anyone has any information with regards to the sale of illegal drugs please contact police to report it."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
