# Community reassurance following fatal collision in Poole

14 October 2016

* * *

Police are offering reassurances to the community following the tragic death of a schoolboy after a road traffic collision in Poole.

The incident happened at around 8.09am on Wednesday 12 October 2016 in Sherborn Crescent in the Canford Heath area.

Seven-year-old Toby was walking to school at the time of the collision. He was taken to Poole Hospital with critical injuries but sadly he passed away later that afternoon. His family continue to be supported by specially trained officers.

Inspector Matt Butler, of Dorset Police's Road Policing Team, said: "Every road death is a tragedy. Officers work very closely with bereaved families following a fatal collision and know first-hand the devastation it causes to loved ones.

"The collision on Wednesday is particularly poignant because it has had such a huge impact on the entire community. Everyone is shocked and saddened at the death of little Toby and understandably want to know how it happened.

"We are gathering witness testimony and analysing the data that we collected at the scene. The full circumstances of the collision will be heard in due course by Her Majesty's Coroner but I am able to inform you that there is no evidence to suggest that excess speed was a factor in this collision.

"Dorset Police will continue to work with the local authority and schools to support the children and families who have been affected by this sad incident.

"Toby's family would like to say thank you to the emergency services and for the support they have received.

"Our thoughts remain with Toby's family at this extremely traumatic time."

The car involved was a silver Peugeot 107 being driven by a woman aged in her 50s. The driver has been assisting police with the investigation and no arrests have been made. No one else was injured in the incident.
