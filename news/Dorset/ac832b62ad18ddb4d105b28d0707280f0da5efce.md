# Update in relation to report of person impersonating police officer in Bournemouth

20 August 2019

* * *

A teenage boy is due to appear in court in connection with a report of someone impersonating a police officer in Bournemouth.

At 5.36pm on Wednesday 6 March 2019 Dorset Police received a call from a woman in Wellington Road reporting that a suspicious man had attended her address claiming to be a police officer and wanting to search her home. He was not in uniform. The woman asked to see his ID but he allegedly did not show her.

It was reported that the woman let him into a communal area but then told him she was calling police, at which point he left.

At 6.17pm on Thursday 7 March 2019 officers were called to reports that someone had stolen a uniform from the ambulance station in Portchester Road in Bournemouth.

A 17-year-old boy from Oxfordshire was arrested and has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Youth Court today, Tuesday 20 August 2019, for offences of theft and impersonating a police constable.
