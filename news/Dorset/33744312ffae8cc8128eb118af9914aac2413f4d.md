# New Dorset Police boat takes to the water

30 September 2020

* * *

Dorset Police has unveiled its new police boat - 'Buccaneer' at a small launch event attended by the Chief Constable and Police and Crime Commissioner.

The new 11m rigid inflatable boat is used by the Force Support Group - a small team of specially trained marine police officers to patrol Dorset's 98 miles of coastline.

Weighing in a 5.5 tons and carrying 600 litres of fuel, it can travel up to 200 miles on a full tank at a top speed of 50 knots with a maximum of eight people onboard.

It has the capability to be out in all weathers, day or night and is used to tackle criminality on the water alongside our partners including Border Force, Maritime and Coastguard Agency, HM Coastguard, Royal Navy, RNLI, Marine Management Organisation and the Southern Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority.

Another key role for the vessel is in search and rescue when people have gone missing along our coastline as well as locating people in the sea who sadly may have died.

Chief Constable James Vaughan, said: "Buccaneer represents a significant investment by Dorset Police and the Police and Crime Commissioner, enhancing our specialist capabilities in policing our coastal waters and marine communities.

"The boat is three years in the making to get to launch; from design requirements, building, sea trials and finally unveiling the new specialist equipment. It includes brand new features and the latest marine navigation technology and search and rescue equipment.

"This will greatly enhance the service we're able to provide to our marine communities and I would like to thank all those involved for making it happen."

Dorset Police and Crime Commissioner Martyn Underhill, said: "I'm delighted to see Buccaneer in action - it's a very impressive boat and is a much needed addition to the Marine Unit.

"I'm proud to have been able to help provide the funds for such an essential piece of equipment which will ensure that the Marine Unit are able to carry on protecting both our coast and our coastal communities".
