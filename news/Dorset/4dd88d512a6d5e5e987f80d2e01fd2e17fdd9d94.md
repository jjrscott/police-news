# Appeal following dog bite incident in Poole

14 August 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a dog bite incident in Poole.

At around 7am on Sunday 9 August 2020 the victim - a man aged in his 30s and from Saffron Walden in Essex - was running through Ham Common and had just reached the beach heading to Lake Pier when a group of five dogs on leads appeared.

As the victim ran past, one of the dogs jumped up and bit the victim on the arm.

The dog's owners are described as both aged in their 40s. The man is around six feet two inches tall, of heavy build and the woman is described as of average build and with long dark hair. The dog was a white or yellow Husky or Golden Retriever type dog called Simba.

Police Constable Jennie Sykes-Martin, of Dorset Police, said: "The owners of the dog did speak to the victim and offered to give their details but the victim did not have anything to take them down with.

"I would ask the owners to please get in contact with me so I can establish what happened. I would also like to hear from anyone else who was in the area and witnessed the incident."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200117938. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
