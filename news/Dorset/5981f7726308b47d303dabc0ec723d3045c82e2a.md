Officers investigating a serious injury collision near Puddletown are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

Dorset Police was called at 12.30pm on Saturday 21 September 2019 to a report of a collision involving a tractor and a red Ducati motorcycle on Long Lane near Puddletown, by the junction with Druce Lane.

The motorcyclist, a man aged in his 40s from the Dorchester area, sustained serious injuries and was taken by air ambulance to Southampton General Hospital. His condition is believed to be life threatening. His next of kin have been informed and are being supported by officers.

The driver of the tractor was uninjured.

Road closures have been put in place to allow the emergency services deal with the incident and for an examination of the scene to take place.

Sergeant Mark Scammell, of the traffic unit, said: "We are carrying out a detailed investigation into the circumstances of this collision and I would urge any witnesses who have not already spoken to police to contact us.

"I would also appeal to any motorists who were travelling in the area at the time and have dashcam fitted to their vehicle to please check their footage for anything relevant.

"I would like to thank members of the public for their patience and understanding as the road closures are in place. These are absolutely necessary to allow the emergency services to respond and for us to carry out an examination of the collision scene."
