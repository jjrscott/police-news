Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a road related incident in Christchurch.

The driver of the Mazda, a man aged in his 80s from Christchurch, was uninjured.

Police Constable Mark Palmer, of the traffic police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident and has not yet spoken to police to come forward.
