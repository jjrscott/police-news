# Witness appeal following attempted robbery in Weymouth

02 January 2020

* * *

Officers investigating an attempted robbery in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

It was reported that between 11.15pm and 11.30pm on Sunday 29 December 2019 a woman aged in her 20s was cycling home from Weymouth town centre when three men approached her and attempted to steal her bicycle.

She rode over Westham Bridge and then through the subways near to Abbotsbury Road in the direction of the Wessex Water building.

She was then approached by a group of three men. One of the men punched the victim in the face, which caused pain and bruising to her left cheekbone, while another man took hold of one of her bike handles.

The men then let go and ran off in the direction of the subways.

They are described as relatively tall, skinny and wearing dark clothing.

Police Constable Kim Williams, of Weymouth Police, said: "The victim was understandably shaken by this incident and we are carrying out number of enquiries to locate the offenders.

"I would urge anyone who was in the area during the relevant time and has some information that could assist us to please come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190203278. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
