# Update â€“ man due in court in connection with collision in Sturminster Newton

11 December 2018

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with a collision in Sturminster Newton.

At around 7.20pm on Thursday 5 July 2018 Dorset Police was called to reports of a collision on Manston Road, at the junction with Green Close, involving a green Mini and a silver Chevrolet Kalos.

The driver of the Mini - a local 19-year-old man - sustained a very serious head injury and was taken to Dorset County Hospital for treatment. He has since been released from hospital.

The driver of the Kalos reportedly failed to stop at the scene and the vehicle was located unattended nearby.

A 21-year-old Shaftesbury man has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 18 December 2018 for failing to stop at the scene of an accident, driving without due care and attention and other driving offences.
