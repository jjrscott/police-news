# Renewed appeal following reported fail-to-stop collision in Dorchester

28 December 2017

* * *

Officers are renewing their appeal for witnesses or anyone with information after a reported fail-to-stop fatal collision in Dorchester.

Police were called at 7.46pm yesterday, Wednesday 27 December 2017, to reports of a collision between a pedestrian and a car on The Grove.

The 39-year-old female pedestrian from Dorchester was taken to Dorset County Hospital, but she sadly died from the injuries sustained. Her next of kin have been informed and the coroner notified.

The road remains closed between Top O'Town roundabout and Miller's Close to allow investigators to examine the scene.

A 24-year-old man from Dorchester, 36-year-old man from Piddlehinton and a 43-year-old man from Bristol have been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and failing to stop at the scene of a collision and are currently assisting police with enquiries.

Inspector Joe Pardey, of Dorset Police's traffic unit, said: "A full investigation into the circumstances of the collision is underway and we are still trying to establish exactly what happened.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or to any motorists who were travelling along The Grove between 7pm and 8pm yesterday evening to contact Dorset Police.

"I would also request anyone who may have been in the area at the relevant time and may have dashcam footage in their vehicles to please get in touch.

"We have specially-trained officers supporting the woman's family at this very difficult time."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 27:349. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
