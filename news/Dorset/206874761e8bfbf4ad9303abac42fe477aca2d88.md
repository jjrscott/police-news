A man is due to appear in court in connection with a reported dangerous driving incident in Weymouth.

At around 5.35pm on Monday 8 April 2019 officers attempted to stop a silver Vauxhall Vectra in the area of Spa Road. It was reported the vehicle made off from officers and was then alleged to have been driven dangerously along Dorchester Road.

A 37-year-old man, of no fixed abode, was arrested in connection with the incident and has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Monday 21 October 2019. He will appear in connection with offences of dangerous driving, driving a motor vehicle otherwise than in accordance with a licence, failing to stop when required by a constable or traffic warden, possessing a class B drug and using a motor vehicle on a road or public place without valid insurance.
