# Two men arrested in connection with drugs warrant near Dorchester

09 January 2019

* * *

Two men have been arrested after officers executed a drugs warrant near Dorchester.

At around 8.55am today, Wednesday 9 January 2019, officers from the Neighbourhood Policing Team with support from other colleagues carried out the warrant at two properties in the Wardon Hill area.

Inside four lorry containers officers found what they believed to be cannabis plants being grown.

Two men, aged 48 and 62 and from the Dorchester area, have been arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of a class B drug and are assisting officers with their enquiries.

Neighbourhood Inspector Darren Stanton, of Dorchester police, said: "This warrant was carried out in response to intelligence received from the local community and has resulted in a significant number of what are believed to be cannabis plants being recovered.

"We are committed to tackling the suspected supply and production of drugs in our area and are indebted to members of the public for providing information that helps to build an intelligence picture.

"I would urge any residents with information or concerns in relation to alleged drug-related activity to contact us."
