A man has come forward following a CCTV appeal in relation to alleged fraudulent activity and the theft of a parcel in Corfe Mullen.

The victim - a woman from Blandford aged in her 30s - ordered a Smeg blender to be collected from the Co-op in Wareham Road. It is reported that when she went to collect it on Saturday 19 December 2020 she was advised that it had already been picked up.

Enquiries revealed that a man allegedly went into the Co-op at around 9.50am on Friday 18 December 2020 and gave the surname of the victim and showed a collection e-mail. When questioned why the name on the parcel was for a woman, the man stated that it was his wife who was pregnant and was in the car.

Following a CCTV appeal, a man has come forward and is assisting officers with their enquiries. No arrests have been made.
