# Image appeal following burglary at caravan business in East Dorset

13 November 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a break-in at a caravan business in East Dorset are appealing for witnesses and issuing an image of one of the stolen items.

At around 12.30am on Saturday 31 October 2020 Dorset Police was called to reports of a break-in at Camping and Leisure World in the grounds of John Browns Garden Centre on Ringwood Road in Three Legged Cross.

Three caravan awnings - a Kampa Dometic Club AIR Pro 330, Kampa Dometic Rally Grande 390 and Kampa Dometic Rally Ace AIR 400 - were stolen.

Police Constable Matt Brennan, of East Dorset police, said: "We are carrying out enquiries in relation to this incident and I would urge anyone with information as to who was responsible to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am issuing an image of one of the awnings and would ask anyone who has seen it, or the other items described, sold locally in suspicious circumstances to please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200163939. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
