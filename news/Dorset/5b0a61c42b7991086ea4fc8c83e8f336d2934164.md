# Appeal for information in relation to alleged road safety offences near Sherborne

15 October 2019

* * *

Officers investigating reports of road safety offences near Sherborne are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage to come forward.

At around 10.30am on Saturday 12 October 2019 Dorset Police received reports of horses and hounds from a local hunt causing a hazard to road users on the A352 in the area of Holnest.

Inspector Simon Perry, of North Dorset police, said: "We are carrying out a proportionate and objective investigation into these reports and I am appealing for any witnesses who have not already spoken to police to contact us.

"While I understand there can be strong opinions surrounding issues relating to hunting, I would like to remind members of the public that this matter is now subject to an investigation. I would therefore urge people to exercise caution and refrain from making any comments, particularly on social media, that could prejudice or undermine this ongoing investigation.

"I would also encourage anyone with any video footage in relation to this matter to contact police rather than post it on social media as it could form evidence as part of the case."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190161246. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
