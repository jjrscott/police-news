# Renewed witness appeal following serious injury road traffic collision in North Dorset

30 July 2018

* * *

Officers investigating a serious injury road traffic collision in North Dorset are renewing their appeal for witnesses to come forward.

Shortly before 12noon on Saturday 28 July 2018 a green Vauxhall Astra collided with a wall outside the Milton Farm caravan site at Milton on Stour near Gillingham. No other vehicles were involved.

The driver, an 18-year-old man from Mere in Wiltshire, was airlifted to Southampton Hospital. He remains in hospital in a serious condition.

A rear seat female passenger, aged 21 and from Warminster in Wiltshire, was taken by air ambulance to hospital in Bristol. She is also still in hospital in a serious condition.

The front seat passenger, a 16-year-old girl, was taken to Yeovil District Hospital with what were believed to be minor injuries. The fourth occupant of the vehicle, a 20-year-old man, was treated at the scene for what were believed to be minor injuries.

Police Sergeant Mark Scammell, of the traffic unit, said: "The next of kin of those injured have been informed and we remain in contact with them.

"We are still trying to establish exactly what happened and are continuing to appeal for anyone who witnessed the incident, or the manner of driving of the vehicle immediately prior to the collision, to contact us.

"We are also asking for anyone who was in the area at the time and has dashcam fitted to their vehicle to review their footage to see if they have captured anything that could assist our investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 28:211. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
