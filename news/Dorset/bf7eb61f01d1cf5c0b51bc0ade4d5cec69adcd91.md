# Man bitten by dog near Christchurch - public appeal

06 April 2020

* * *

Officers investigating an incident where a man was bitten by a dog near Christchurch are appealing for information to help identify the owner of the animal involved.

A man aged in his 70s had been for a run through Leigh Woods near Burton at around 6.20pm on Saturday 4 April 2020 and was heading back onto Hawthorn Road when he was approached by a man and woman walking several dogs.

The woman had a black Labrador-type dog with her and the man had at least two dogs that resembled Irish Wolfhounds.

One of the man's dogs came out of a hedge and bit the victim on the lower leg, causing a puncture wound. The man apologised, saying the dog could be like this with runners and made reference to it being a puppy, although the victim said it appeared fully grown. He did not take the man's details.

The man with the dog is described as white, aged in his 40s and with brushed back hair and glasses.

Police Constable Jennie Sykes, of Dorset Police, said: "We are carrying out enquiries to identify the owner of the dog involved and I would appeal for anyone who has any information to please contact us.

"I would also urge the owner to come forward and give their account so we can establish the full circumstances of this incident."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200048870. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
