# Man charged following reported robberies in Christchurch

20 March 2017

* * *

A man is due to appear in court charged in connection with three reported robberies in Christchurch.

Officers were called at 5.30pm on Saturday 18 March 2017 to reports that a man armed with a gun had entered the Co-Op Food store in Fairmile Road and stole some items of food. No threats were made and no-one was physically injured.

It is reported the man left the store, got into a white Ford Fiesta and drove into the Fairmile Service Station next door.

It is alleged the man got out of the Fiesta, walked into the petrol station shop with a gun, selected some wine and cigarettes and left without paying. No one was physically injured.

A short time later it is reported that a man entered Fairmile Convenience Store on Fairmile Road and stole some food and cigarettes. It is alleged a man and a woman were assaulted.

As the man got back into the Fiesta and drove away, it is reported the car was in collision with another vehicle.

A 23-year-old man from London has today, Monday 20 March 2017, been charged with robbery, assault, possession of a firearm without a certificate, theft and possession of cannabis and is due to appear before Poole Magistrates' Court tomorrow, Tuesday 21 March 2017.
