# Witness appeal after assault in Bournemouth

20 June 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses after a man was assaulted in Bournemouth.

At around 3.30pm on Friday 16 June 2017 the victim, a 42-year-old Bournemouth man, was walking with his 69-year-old mother over the bridge on the approach to Kings Park Academy on Ashley Road when they came across three teenage boys with bikes who were being obstructive to other pedestrians.

The boys started being abusive toward them and when the man's mother asked one 'who he thought he was' they grabbed her and pushed her to the ground.

The man then stepped in and was assaulted by the boys. He suffered a head injury and was given first aid by staff at the school before going to hospital later that day, where he received stitches.

The three teenagers, aged around 15, headed in the direction of Kings Park after the assault.

Police Constable Joshua Benoke, of Bournemouth police, said: "The scene of this assault would have been busy at that time of day and I would urge anyone who saw anything to contact police.

"I am keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed this incident or who has any information that can assist with our investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170090441. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
