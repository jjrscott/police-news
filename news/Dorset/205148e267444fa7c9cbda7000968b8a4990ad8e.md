Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a collision in Bournemouth that left a woman with life-threatening injuries.

At 7.02pm on Wednesday 12 February 2020 Dorset Police received a report of a collision involving a blue BMW 318 and a pedestrian in Charminster Road, near to the Broadway roundabout. It was reported that the pedestrian, a woman aged in her 90s and from New Milton, had been a passenger in a blue Vauxhall Astra and had got out of the vehicle shortly before the collision.

The woman sustained serious injuries and was taken by air ambulance to Southampton Hospital, where she remains in a critical condition. Her family has been informed.

The driver of the BMW, a Bournemouth man aged in his 50s, was arrested on suspicion of driving offences and has been released under investigation as enquiries continue.

Inspector Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the injured woman and her family at this time and we are continuing our investigation to establish the full circumstances of this collision.

"I would urge any witnesses who have not already spoken to police to please contact us."
