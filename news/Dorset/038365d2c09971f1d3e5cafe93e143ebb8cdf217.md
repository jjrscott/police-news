# Update â€“ boy due in court in connection with alleged stabbing in Bournemouth

19 December 2017

* * *

A boy is due to appear in court today in connection with an alleged stabbing in Bournemouth.

At approximately 8.30pm on Saturday 16 December 2017 a group of boys and girls, all aged 16, were sitting on a bench at the Pelhams Park area on Millhams Road. It was reported that the group was approached by two teenage boys on bicycles before one of them began shining a torch at a girl in the group, who asked him to stop. It is alleged that he then pulled a knife out of his pocket.

It was further reported that an altercation took place between one of the suspects and a boy from the group, who sustained serious injuries to his chest and face. He was taken to hospital to receive treatment. His condition is not life-threatening.

A 15-year-old boy from Bournemouth has been charged with wounding with intent and possession of a knife blade/pointed article in a public place and is due to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court today, Tuesday 19 December 2017.

A 13-year-old boy from Bournemouth who was arrested on suspicion of assault has been released under investigation.
