# Witness appeal after fail-to-stop collision on Portland

16 May 2018

* * *

Officers investigating an incident where a vehicle collided with a parked car and did not stop at the scene are appealing for witnesses.

The victim had parked her black Volkswagen Golf on the road in Chiswell yesterday evening, Tuesday 15 May 2018.

At around 9.30pm occupants of nearby houses reported hearing a loud bang and when they went out to investigate they found the Golf had been shunted forward and its nearside wheel was now up on the pavement. There was extensive damage to the offside of the vehicle.

The offending vehicle was not seen.

Police Constable Caroline Orchard, of Weymouth police, said: "We are carrying out a number of enquiries to identify the offending vehicle and I am appealing for any witnesses to this incident to contact police.

"It is likely that the other vehicle involved will also have sustained significant damage in the collision so I would also like to hear from anyone who saw a damaged vehicle in the area around the time of the incident."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180073749. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
