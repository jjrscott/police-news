A second man has been arrested in connection with a reported serious assault in Dorchester.

At around 3.30am on Wednesday 30 January 2019 Dorset Police received a report of a disturbance involving a group of men and women near to the Shell petrol station in London Road.

It was reported that two men were assaulted with a bladed weapon during the altercation.

One man, aged in his 30s, was taken to hospital for treatment to an arm injury that required surgery. The other victim, also aged in his 30s, suffered superficial cuts to his arm and attended hospital as a precaution.

A 22-year-old Weymouth man was previously arrested on suspicion of wounding with intent and possessing an offensive weapon in a public place and was released under investigation.

A 19-year-old man of no fixed abode has now been arrested on suspicion of wounding with intent and has also been released under investigation as detectives continue to make enquiries.
