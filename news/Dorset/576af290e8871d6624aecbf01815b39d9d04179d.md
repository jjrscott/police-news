# Witness appeal following robbery in Bournemouth

08 May 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating a robbery in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 11.30pm on Sunday 6 May 2018 the victim, an 18-year-old woman, was sitting on a bench on Meyrick Road with a friend when they were approached by a man on a bike who asked for some tobacco. They gave him some and he cycled away.

Shortly afterwards the two women separated and the victim walked down Grove Road, where she saw the same man.

As she walked past him he grabbed hold of her bag and, despite the victim shouting at him and attempting to keep hold of it, managed to take it from her. He then rode off toward Meyrick Road.

The victim did not sustain any serious injuries as a result of the incident.

The offender is described as being of Middle Eastern appearance with tanned skin, aged in his 30s and of slim build with brown hair. He was wearing dark clothing, carrying a Tesco carrier bag and was riding a dark-coloured mountain bike.

Detective Constable Steph Ashworth, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This must have been a very frightening ordeal for the victim and we are carrying out a detailed investigation to identify the man responsible.

"We have carried out a number of enquiries, including exploring CCTV opportunities in the area.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed this incident, or a man matching the description given in the area around the relevant time, to contact police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180068136. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
