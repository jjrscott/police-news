Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a head-on collision in Winfrith in which a woman sustained life-threatening injuries.

At approximately 3.50pm today, Monday 8 August 2016, a two vehicle collision occurred on the A352 adjacent to the picnic site between Winfrith and East Knighton.

The collision involved a red Ford Fiesta being driven by a 72-year-old woman from Swanage and a blue Honda Accord driven by a 55-year-old man from the Dorchester area.

The road was closed as police, fire and paramedics attended the incident and specialist collision investigators examined the scene.

The woman was flown by air ambulance to Southampton General Hospital with life-threatening injuries.

The driver of the Honda sustained minor injuries and was taken to Dorset County Hospital as a precaution.

Police Sergeant Mark Farrow, of Dorset Police's Road Traffic Unit, said: "I would like to thank the public for their patience during the road closure which was necessary to allow us to investigate the incident.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or the manner of driving of either vehicle prior to the incident to please contact Dorset Police."
