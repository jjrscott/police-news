# Witness appeal following fail-to-stop collision in West Moors

05 October 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses after a car failed to stop following a collision with a 12-year-old cyclist in West Moors.

At around 8.50pm on Tuesday 3 October 2017 the boy was riding along Station Road near to the Tesco Express store when he was knocked off his pedal cycle by a vehicle. He did not sustain serious injuries.

The vehicle, which like the cyclist was travelling toward Ferndown, did not stop at the scene to check on the welfare of the boy, who was left lying on the ground.

Police Constable Austin Kinnane, of East Dorset police, said: "Fortunately the victim only suffered minor injuries and, with help from a member of the public, was able to make his way home.

"We are making a number of enquiries into this incident, including a trawl of CCTV footage in the area.

"I am appealing for any witnesses to the incident or anyone with information that can assist with our investigation to please contact police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170154610. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
