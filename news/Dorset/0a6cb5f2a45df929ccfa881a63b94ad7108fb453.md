# Update â€“ appeal after man reportedly bitten by dog in Shaftesbury

06 May 2020

* * *

A woman has come forward following an appeal after a man was reportedly bitten by a dog in Shaftesbury.

At around 6.45am on Friday 24 April 2020 the victim - a man aged in his 50s - was walking down Breach Lane when a dog, which was off its lead, allegedly approached the man in an aggressive manner before biting him on the leg. It is reported that the dog's owner apologised and also stayed with the victim a while to check he was all right, but the victim did not think to take her details at the time.

The victim then attended hospital to have the wound dressed.

Following an appeal, a local woman has come forward and is helping officers to establish the full circumstances of the incident. No arrests have been made.
