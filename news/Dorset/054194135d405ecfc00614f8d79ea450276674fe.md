A teenage boy arrested in connection with reports of someone impersonating a police officer in Bournemouth has been released under investigation.

At 5.36pm on Wednesday 6 March 2019 Dorset Police received a report from a woman in Wellington Road reporting that a suspicious man had attended her address claiming to be a police officer and wanting to search her home. He was not in uniform. The woman asked to see his ID but he allegedly did not show her.

It is reported the woman let him into a communal area but then told him she was calling police, at which point he left.

At 6.17pm on Thursday 7 March 2019 officers were called to reports that someone had stolen a uniform from the ambulance station in Portchester Road in Bournemouth.

A 17-year-old boy from Bournemouth who was arrested on suspicion of impersonating a police constable and theft has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.
