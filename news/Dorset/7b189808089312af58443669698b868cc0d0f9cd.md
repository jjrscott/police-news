# Renewed appeal following fatal road traffic collision on Portland

29 June 2017

* * *

Officers are renewing their appeal after a man died following a collision on the Portland Beach Road.

Dorset Police was informed of the incident at 11.25pm on Wednesday 28 June 2017.

The collision involved a blue BMW, being driven by a 49-year-old man, and a grey Peugeot 2008, containing the 67-year-old male driver and his 72-year-old male passenger - with all three men from the local area.

Police Sergeant Nikki Burt, of the traffic unit, said: "Sadly this afternoon the 72-year-old Peugeot passenger, who had sustained life-threatening injuries, has died.

"Our thoughts are with his family at this very difficult time and they will be supported by specifically trained officers.

"Following the collision the road was closed in both directions for some time to enable our teams to investigate the scene. Our enquiries are ongoing to establish why and how the collision occurred.

"However, we still need to hear from anyone who witnessed the collision or the manner of driving of either vehicle prior to the incident. If you have not been in contact with us yet, please call."
