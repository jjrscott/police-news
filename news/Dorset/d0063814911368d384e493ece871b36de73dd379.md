# Appeal following attempted bag theft and assault in Poole

14 December 2020

* * *

Officers investigating an attempted bag theft and assault in Poole are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

At around 2.10pm on Friday 27 November 2020 the victim - a local woman aged in her 20s - was walking along Alexandra Road when she was approached by two men.

As one of the men walked past her, the second grabbed the strap of her bag. The victim attempted to punch the suspect, but missed. The suspect then punched the woman in the stomach causing her to double over in pain. The two men then walked off toward Bournemouth Road. The suspect failed to take the victim's bag.

The suspect is described as white, aged in his mid-30s, five feet eight inches tall, of skinny build and with facial stubble and dirty blond scruffy hair. He wore a plain black padded coat with a hood and baggy dark blue jeans.

His accomplice is described as white, also aged in his mid-30s and wore a long style light brown beige coat, with fluffy lining in the hood, and dark-coloured trousers. He was taller than the suspect.

Police Constable Steven Beck, of Poole police, said: "We have carried out a number of enquiries in relation to this incident, including CCTV checks and house-to-house visits but these have not been successful.

"We were still in national Tier 4 restrictions when this offence occurred and I would urge anyone who witnessed the incident, saw the men described or captured anything of relevance on dashcam to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200178875. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
