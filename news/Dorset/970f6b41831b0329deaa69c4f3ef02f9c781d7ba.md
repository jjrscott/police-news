Detectives investigating an attempted rape offence in Bournemouth say a significant witness they were trying to trace has come forward.

Sometime between 1.45am and 2.30am on Saturday 13 January 2018 an attempted rape occurred in an address in Wimborne Road in Winton. The victim - a woman aged her 20s - was assaulted by an unknown man who was among a group of people she had met that evening. She is being supported by specially-trained officers.

An investigation remains ongoing, led by detectives from the Serious Sexual Offences Team.

On 19 March 2018 officers issued a CCTV image of a woman they wished to identify and she has now come forward.

Detective Constable Stef Belton, of the Serious Sexual Offences Team, said: "I am grateful to this woman for coming forward.

"My investigation into this offence continues and I would ask anyone with information to please contact Dorset Police."
