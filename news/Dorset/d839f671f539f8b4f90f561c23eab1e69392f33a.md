# Witness appeal following serious injury collision in Bournemouth

06 July 2016

* * *

Police investigating a serious injury collision in Bournemouth believe a number of people witnessed the incident and officers are urging them to get in touch.

At approximately 6pm on Saturday 25 June 2016 a single vehicle road traffic collision occurred on Charminster Avenue when a red BMW convertible left the road and struck a tree.

A 25-year-old local woman, who was travelling in the front passenger seat, suffered serious injuries to her arm and head and was taken to Poole Hospital. She has undergone surgery to repair a serious fracture to her arm and is still receiving ongoing treatment.

The driver was uninjured.

Police Sergeant Mark Farrow, of Dorset Police's Traffic Unit, said: "This collision occurred close to the Fiveways pub and I know a number of people were outside in the smoking area at the time.

"I am keen to hear from anyone who saw either the collision or the manner of driving of the car immediately before the incident. If you did see something that evening, please contact Dorset Police."
