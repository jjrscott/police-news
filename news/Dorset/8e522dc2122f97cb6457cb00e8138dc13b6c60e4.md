# Appeal following sexual assault in Poole

07 August 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses and information from the public after a teenage girl was sexually assaulted in Poole.

The 13-year-old victim was walking with her friend over Seldown Bridge at around 4.55pm on Tuesday 1 August 2017. They were pushing their bicycles as one had suffered a puncture.

They saw a man walking from the Newfoundland Drive direction on the opposite side of the road and he called out to them. They crossed over and he asked them for the time before engaging the girls in conversation.

The victim said she was uncomfortable at the way the man was looking at her and when she said she had to go he grabbed her arm above the wrist.

The man then let go and apologised before he sexually touched her.

The girl's friend then got her mobile phone out and the man walked off in the direction of Newfoundland Drive.

The man is described as white, tanned, around five feet ten inches tall and approximately 50 years old with large bulging eyes and brown and grey short hair swept to one side. He was wearing a navy blue knitted jumper and pointy shoes.

Police Constable Kelly Stronach, of Poole police, said: "This was a distressing incident for the girl involved and we are making every effort to locate the offender.

"I am appealing to any witnesses, or anyone who saw a man matching the description given in the area around the time of the incident, to please contact police.

"We are also carrying out patrols in the area to offer reassurance to the local community."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170119043. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
