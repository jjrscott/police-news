# Update â€“ pair due in court in connection with reported theft in Christchurch

23 March 2020

* * *

Two men are due to appear in court in connection with a reported theft in Christchurch.

At around 2.15pm on Monday 4 November 2019 it was reported that two men entered the driveway of Volsen LTD on Barrack Road and allegedly stole a roll of white roofing fleece that had just been delivered.

The roofing fleece was reportedly found abandoned a short distance away.

Following enquiries by officers, two men - both aged 25 and from Bournemouth - were arrested and they have now been issued with postal requisitions to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 27 March 2020 for an offence of theft.
