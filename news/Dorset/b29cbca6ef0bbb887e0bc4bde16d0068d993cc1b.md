# Appeal for witnesses following assaults in Bournemouth

09 July 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating a disturbance in Bournemouth town centre during which three men were assaulted are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 9.20pm on Saturday 7 July 2018 an altercation took place in the Lower Gardens, near to the toilet block by The Square. It involved a large group of young people and a smaller group of men.

During the incident, three members of the smaller group were assaulted.

One of the victims, a man aged in his 20s, sustained a large cut to his head and ear and another man, also aged in his 20s, suffered a deep cut to his lip and had two teeth knocked out. The third victim sustained a suspected broken nose.

Shortly after this incident there was another disturbance next to the ice cream stall near Gervis Place and detectives believe the two incidents could be linked.

Detective Constable Kat Rawlings, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We have carried out a number of enquiries into this incident, including viewing town centre CCTV, as we try and establish exactly what happened and how these men came to sustain their injuries.

"I am appealing for any witnesses to the altercation or anyone with information about the incident to contact police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180106477. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
