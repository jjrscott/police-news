Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a fail-to-stop collision in Poole.

At 2.49pm today, Wednesday 18 April 2018, Dorset Police was called to reports of a road traffic collision at traffic lights on the Hunger Hill roundabout involving a red Ducati Panigale motorcycle and a car.

The car - believed to be a silver Mercedes - failed to stop at the scene.

The motorcyclist - a 37-year-old man from the Wareham area - sustained serious injuries and was taken to Poole Hospital for treatment. His condition is not described as life-threatening.

Police Sergeant Mark Scammell, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or saw a silver Mercedes in the area at the time to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who was travelling in the area with dashcam fitted and may have captured all or part of the incident on camera."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 18:222. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
