27 November 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following an attempted burglary in Corfe Mullen.

Sometime between 7.50am and 11.30am on Wednesday 25 November 2020 a window of a property was smashed on Highfield Road. The inside panel of glass did not smash and entry was not gained.

It is reported that the offender was a man of slim build and between five feet six and five feet eight inches tall. He was described as wearing an orange high-visibility jacket, a black beanie hat, a black face mask, gloves and dark-coloured trousers.

Police Constable Chris Maidment, of East Dorset police, said: "An investigation is underway into the incident and officers have been carrying out enquiries in the area.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity and has not already spoken to police to please get in touch.

"I am particularly keen to hear from any residents who have home CCTV systems fitted and may have captured any relevant footage."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200177513. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
