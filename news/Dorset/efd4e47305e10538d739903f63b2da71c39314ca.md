At 5.11pm on Tuesday 21 May 2019 Dorset Police received a report of a serious assault at an address in Ridgeway.

Officers attended together with the ambulance service. The victim, a local man in his 70s, was taken to hospital by air ambulance, where sadly he later died. His next of kin has been informed and is being supported by specially trained officers.

A 36-year-old man from Sherborne has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is helping officers with their enquiries.

"Residents will see officers conducting house-to-house enquiries. However if anyone has any information relating to the incident, I would ask that they contact Dorset Police quoting incident number 21:349.

"Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team will be carrying out high visibility patrols in the area over the coming days to offer reassurance to the community and can be contacted with any concerns."
