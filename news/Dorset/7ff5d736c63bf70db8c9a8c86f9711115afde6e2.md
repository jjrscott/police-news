# Serious collision in Milton Abbas â€“ witness appeal

16 January 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a serious injury collision in Milton Abbas.

At around 4.20pm on Friday 13 January 2017 a serious injury road traffic collision occurred just outside the village on the road heading toward Milborne St Andrew.

A Peugeot 307, being driven by a 19-year-old local man, left the road on a bend, mounted the pavement and was in collision with a woman who was walking with a pushchair.

The 33-year-old woman was thrown into a tree following the impact and the pushchair containing her five-month-old baby continued down the embankment. The woman was treated at the scene by paramedics and taken to Dorset County Hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries. Fortunately, the baby boy sustained only minor injuries and was treated at the scene before being taken to hospital for a check-up.

The driver of the Peugeot was uninjured.

Police Constable Mark Palmer, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or the manner of driving of the Peugeot immediately before or at the time of the collision to please contact Dorset Police.

"The road was closed for a short time to allow emergency services to deal with the incident and I would like to thank motorists for their patience during the road closures."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 13:281. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
