# Appeal following burglary at home in Poole

12 June 2019

* * *

Detectives are appealing for two motorists to come forward following a burglary at an address in Poole.

At 9.50pm on Saturday 8 June 2019 offenders smashed the patio door of a property in Bury Road and carried out an untidy search. A number of Louis Vuitton handbags and purses were stolen.

The owners, who were away at the time, are still establishing whether anything else was taken.

Detective Constable Jo Regan, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This burglary has had a significant impact on the victims.

"We believe three offenders were involved in this burglary and I am appealing to anyone who was in the Bury Road area at the relevant time and saw or heard anything suspicious to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly keen to hear from the drivers of two cars who were seen on CCTV travelling along Bury Road immediately before and after the incident.

"Finally, if anyone has seen Louis Vuitton handbags or purses for sale locally in unusual circumstances please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk, or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190086860. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
