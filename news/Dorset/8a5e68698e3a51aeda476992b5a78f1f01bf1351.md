Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after an elderly woman was injured following a fail-to-stop collision in Poole.

At 5.30pm on Friday 20 November 2020 the victim, a local woman aged in her 70s, was walking outside Daniels Fish and Chips takeaway shop on Lower Blandford Road when she was struck by a vehicle as it was being reversed.

The car was said to be black or a dark colour and was being driven by a woman. No other details were obtained.

The victim was left shaken and sustained bruising.

Police Constable James Crocker, of Poole police, said: "We are investigating this reported collision and have been carrying out enquiries, including looking for any available CCTV footage.

"I am aware that there were two men in the area who witnessed the collision and banged on the window of the car involved. I would specifically ask for these two men to come forward so we can take an account from them.

"I would directly appeal to the driver involved in this incident to make contact with Dorset Police so we can establish what happened."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200175569.
