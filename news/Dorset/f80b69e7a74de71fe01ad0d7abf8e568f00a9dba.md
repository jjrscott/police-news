# Appeal after woman found with serious injuries on Bournemouth road

08 November 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward after a woman was found in the middle of a Bournemouth road with serious injuries.

Dorset Police was called at 9.12am this morning, Thursday 8 November 2018, to reports of a concern for the welfare of a woman in the westbound carriageway of the Wessex Way prior to the Cambridge Road roundabout.

The woman - aged in her 30s - was found at the side of the road with head injuries. It is believed she was in a moving vehicle immediately prior to being located.

She was taken to hospital for treatment to serious injuries that are not thought to be life-threatening.

An investigation is underway to establish how she sustained her injuries and came to be at the side of the road.

Following enquiries, a man aged in his 30s was arrested on suspicion of assault and is assisting officers with enquiries. A vehicle has also been recovered.

Detective Inspector Kim Goodenough, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We have launched an investigation into what happened and I am appealing to anyone who saw the incident, or witnessed anything suspicious immediately prior, to please contact Dorset Police.

"In particular, I would urge any motorists with a dashcam fitted who were travelling along the Wessex Way around the time to review their recordings and report anything that could be relevant to us. You may have vital footage that could assist with the investigation.

"I would also like to thank motorists for their patience during the road closures, which were entirely necessary to allow us to investigate what has happened."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 8:82. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
