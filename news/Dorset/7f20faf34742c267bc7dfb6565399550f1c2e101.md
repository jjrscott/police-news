18 September 2018

* * *

Officers investigating a reported burglary in Bournemouth have charged two men.

Sometime between 10.20am and 10.45am on Monday 3 September 2018 it is alleged access was gained at an address in Wheaton Road after the owner had gone out for a short period.

As she returned home, she reportedly disturbed the alleged offenders and they quickly escaped from the property. It was reported that that a debit card had been stolen from a wallet left on the kitchen table.

The bank card was subsequently alleged to have been used in five different stores on Christchurch Road and Wimborne Road in the town.

A 43-year-old Bournemouth man and a 26-year-old man of no fixed abode have been charged with burglary and fraud. They are next due to appear at Bournemouth Crown Court on 18 October 2018.

Officers would like to thank members of the public that contacted Dorset Police following the CCTV witness appeal.
