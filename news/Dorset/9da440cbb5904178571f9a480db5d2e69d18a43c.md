# Man due to appear in court in connection with alleged hate crime on Portland

08 September 2020

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with an alleged hate crime on Portland.

It was reported that at around 8.20pm on Tuesday 28 January 2020 the driver of the number 1 First bus stopped at Victoria Square to allow passengers on. A man boarded the bus and went to sit down without paying for a ticket.

When the driver asked the man to pay his fare, he allegedly refused and became aggressive, using racially abusive language toward the driver. He also reportedly made threats to kill him before trying to grab the victim's face and hands.

The driver, a man aged in his 60s, did not suffer any injuries as a result of the alleged assault.

An earlier incident occurred in the area of St Thomas Street in Weymouth at around 9am on Tuesday 28 January where a woman was allegedly assaulted and subjected to verbal abuse.

A 29-year-old man from Southampton has been charged with racially or religiously aggravated common assault and two counts of assault by beating. He is due to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Friday 11 September 2020.
