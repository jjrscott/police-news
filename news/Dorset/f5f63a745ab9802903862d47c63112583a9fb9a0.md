# Update – CCTV appeal following theft of pushchair at Poole store

15 February 2019

* * *

Officers investigating the theft of a pushchair from a store in Poole say a woman has made herself known to police.

A CCTV appeal was issued to identify a woman officers wanted to speak to in connection with the theft of a navy Bugaboo Donkey Classic pushchair, valued at more than £1,000, from Mothercare at Redlands at around 1.20pm on Monday 4 January 2019.

Following the appeal, the woman has now made herself known to police and is assisting officers with their investigation.
