# Witness appeal following attempted robbery of blind woman in Bournemouth

13 November 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for any witnesses to come forward after an attempted robbery of a blind woman in Bournemouth.

Shortly before 2.45pm today, Tuesday 13 November 2018, the victim - a woman aged in her 40s - was walking in Pilot Hight Road in West Howe when she heard someone behind her, possibly on a bicycle.

She was pushed over and dragged along the ground with the offender attempting to grab her handbag.

The victim was able to keep hold of her handbag and the offender made off. The handbag appears to have been cut with a knife or bladed article and the woman sustained a number of cuts and bruises. She was taken to hospital for treatment.

Detective Constable Kevin Lloyd, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was a despicable attack on a blind woman in broad daylight by an offender believed to be in possession of a knife and we have launched a full investigation to identify the culprit.

"Our enquiries have included house to house, crime scene examinations and a review of any CCTV footage in the area.

"Given this incident happened in the middle of the street in the afternoon, I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed it or seen any suspicious activity in the area of Pilot Hight Road around the relevant time to contact us. I would also urge anyone who may have been driving in the area and has dashcam fitted to their vehicles to check their footage.

"Local officers from the neighbourhood policing team can be approached by members of the community with any concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 13:218. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
