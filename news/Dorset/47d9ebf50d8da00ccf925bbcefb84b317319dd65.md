# Renewed public appeal to find missing man

09 April 2017

* * *

Officers are renewing their appeal for the public's help to find man who is believed to be missing in Dorset.

Michael Asher, aged 82 and from Maidenhead in Berkshire, was last seen at around lunchtime on Friday 31 March 2017 when he boarded a train, having bought a ticket to Poole.

Michael is described as white, six feet tall, of slim build and bald.

Thames Valley Police launched a missing person investigation to find Michael, which has now been taken over by Dorset Police.

Subsequent enquiries have established that Michael arrived in Poole and has been travelling around the county on buses since that date, in particular Bournemouth, Poole and Swanage.

He has connections with people in the Dorset area but has not made contact with them.

Inspector Geoff Hicks, of Dorset Police, said: "We know Michael has been upset recently and we are becoming increasingly concerned for his welfare. It is very out of character for him to go missing like this.

"I would urge anyone who believes they have seen Michael to please contact Dorset Police.

"Finally, if Michael sees this appeal I would ask him to call us. We are all very worried about you and just want to make sure you are safe."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170050035. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
