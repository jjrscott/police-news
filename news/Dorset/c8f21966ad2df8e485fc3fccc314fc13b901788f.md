# Policing in Dorset over the bank holiday weekend

07 May 2020

* * *

Dorset's communities are being reminded to stay at home while they celebrate the bank holiday weekend.

Chief Constable James Vaughan said: "I'm fully aware that VE Day and the bank holiday weekend is very special to so many of you.

"Unfortunately we are not going to be able to celebrate the way we all expected to and instead we are going to have to come up with different ways of marking this historic event. Please do celebrate from your home or back garden with your loved ones - I certainly will be raising a toast with my family."

Officers, special constables and members of staff will continue to patrol the county's main roads across the weekend to ensure people are only making essential journeys. Anyone found flouting the Government's regulations about non-essential travel could face being fined.

Between Friday 27 March and Wednesday 6 May 2020 Dorset Police issued 377 fixed penalty notices to people who have allegedly breached the COVID-19 (coronavirus) restrictions.

Chief Constable James Vaughan continued: "As sad as it is, Dorset and our tourism hotspots are closed for business for now.

"We will be turning people around if they are found to be travelling here from elsewhere for no good reason and some of those people could also risk being fined.

"If you are unsure about what the restrictions do or don't permit, I'd like to remind you all of our excellent FAQ section at dorset.police.uk."

Martyn Underhill, Dorset Police & Crime Commissioner, said: "I know how important Friday's VE Day celebrations are to so many people, but it would be the ultimate tribute to the heroes of the Second World War generation if we could all stay at home and ensure they remain safe.

"Remember, the lockdown restrictions will continue to remain in place over the bank holiday weekend, so please continue to stay indoors, protect the NHS and save lives. Dorset remains closed to visitors, so don't attempt to drive here to visit our beaches or beauty spots."
