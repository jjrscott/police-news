* * *

Detectives investigating a reported assault in Bridport town centre are appealing for witnesses to the incident to come forward.

Officers were called to West Street at around 11pm on Monday 5 June 2017 and found an injured man lying in the road in the vicinity of Sunny Days Nursery.

Members of the public were also at the scene trying to help the man.

The injured man, a Bridport man in his 30s, sustained an injury to his eye and bruising to his face and was taken to hospital.

Another man wearing a light coloured, possibly grey, top was seen by witnesses to walk off toward the alleyway alongside the Waitrose store.

A 22-year-old Bridport man has been arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm and has been released under investigation.

Detective Constable Richard Evans, of Weymouth CID, said: "We are continuing our investigations and I am keen to hear from anyone who witnessed this incident and has not already spoken to officers."
