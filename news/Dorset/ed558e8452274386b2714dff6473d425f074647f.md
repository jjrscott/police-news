Officers investigating an altercation in Bournemouth are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 8.25pm on Saturday 22 December 2018 Dorset Police received reports of a fight involving two separate groups of four to five people on Westover Road.

Officers attended and found one man with a laceration to his forehead and another sustained swelling to his cheek and bruising to his elbows after they were reportedly assaulted.

Three other people reported also being assaulted but did not require medical treatment.

Two local men, aged 22 and 23, were arrested on suspicion of assault and have been released under investigation as officers continue their enquiries.

Police Constable Adam Steeves, of Bournemouth police, said: "We are carrying out a number of enquiries into this incident and I am appealing for any witnesses who have not already spoken to police to come forward.

"I would also urge anyone who was in the area at the time and may have captured the altercation on their dashcam or mobile phone footage to contact us."
