# Appeal for witnesses following reported suspicious incident in Wimborne

31 January 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses following reports of a suspicious incident in Wimborne.

A local woman aged in her 20s was walking in School Lane at around 4.40pm on Monday 22 January 2018 with her 18-month-old child in a pushchair and two other children.

It was reported that a man approached her, asked if she smoked and then asked if she needed any help. She refused but the man reportedly barged into her and grabbed hold of the pushchair handle, which the woman’s handbag was strapped to. The woman was able to hold onto the pushchair and the man let go before walking off.

The man was described as black, aged in his late thirties, around five feet four inches tall and of stocky build. He was wearing a blue jumper, blue tracksuit bottoms and black trainers.

Police Constable Michelle Yarrow, of Wimborne police, said: “Officers have carried out a number of enquiries into this incident and have identified the man involved, who has given an account and is assisting with our investigation.

“We have also carried out CCTV enquiries in the area, but it does not appear that the reported incident was captured by any cameras.

“It may be that this was a completely innocent incident that was misinterpreted but we are keen to speak to anyone who witnessed it so we can establish the full circumstances.

“Although there is nothing at this stage to suggest any wider cause for concern, local officers have been offering reassurance to the local community in the area and we have been liaising with the nearby school.”

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk, or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180011371. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
