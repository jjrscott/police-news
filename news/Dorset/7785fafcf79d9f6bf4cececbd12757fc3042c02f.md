# Residents evacuated following incident in North Bournemouth

17 August 2017

* * *

Residents have been evacuated from a building in North Bournemouth following the discovery of unknown items.

Dorset Police was called at 12.50am today, Thursday 17 August 2017, to reports of a disturbance at a block of flats where a man was setting fire to items in the garden in Gillam Road in Bournemouth.

Officers are at the scene, along with Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service and the South Western Ambulance Service.

During a search of one of the flats unknown items have been found.

A cordon has been put in place in the immediate area and, as a precaution, all residents in the flats have been evacuated for their own safety. It is thought this has affected between 20-30 people. Some have sought alternative accommodation while others are in the process of being moved to a temporary location which is being provided by Bournemouth Borough Council.

The Military Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) team have been called to the scene to assess the unknown items.

A 42-year-old man from Bournemouth and a woman have been arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life and are currently assisting officers with enquiries.

Detective Chief Superintendent Mark Callaghan, of Dorset Police, said: "We are working together with the Military Explosive Ordnance Disposal and partner agencies at the scene to assess the items.

"I would like to thank residents for their patience and co-operation during this time. We will provide an update once our searches have concluded."
