# Appeal to locate wanted man from Bournemouth

09 December 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for help from the public to locate a man wanted in connection with breaching the conditions of his licence.

Damien Stephen Cable, 35 and of Bournemouth, is wanted for prison recall after reportedly breaching the terms of his licence having been released on Monday 9 November 2020 after serving part of a two-and-a-half-year prison term for drug offences.

He is described as white, around five feet nine inches tall and of medium build with dark brown hair.

Inspector Greg Tansill, of Dorset Police, said: "We have made a number of efforts to locate Damien Cable in connection with this matter, but have so far been unable to find him.

"I am appealing to anyone with information or knowledge as to his whereabouts, or who sees a man matching the description given, to please contact us.

"We believe that Damien may be with a woman and could have travelled in the last week to Watford.

"While we do not have any information to suggest Damien presents a risk to the public, anyone who sees him is urged not to approach him but instead dial 999 immediately."

If you see Damien Cable you should dial 999 immediately. Anyone with other information should call 101, quoting occurrence 55200176917 or Crimestoppers in confidence in 0800 555 111.
