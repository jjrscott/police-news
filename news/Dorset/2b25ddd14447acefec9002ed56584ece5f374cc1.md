# Update â€“ teenager arrested in connection with reported robbery in Bournemouth

08 July 2020

* * *

A teenage boy has been arrested in connection with a reported robbery in Bournemouth.

The incident occurred at around 1.20am on Saturday 23 May 2020. It was reported that the victim, a boy aged in his late teens, was walking through an alleyway between High Howe Lane and Ringwood Road when he was approached by another teenage boy, who lifted his top to display a knife tucked into the waistband of his trousers.

They reportedly demanded the victim hand over his phone and threatened to stab him if he tried to run away. It was also reported that demands were made for cash and the victim was allegedly forced to go to a nearby cash machine to withdraw money, which was then handed over.

Following enquiries by detectives from Bournemouth CID, a 17-year-old Bournemouth boy has been arrested on suspicion of robbery and is assisting officers with their enquiries.

A 16-year-old boy from Bournemouth previously arrested in connection with the incident has been released from the investigation and will face no further police action.
