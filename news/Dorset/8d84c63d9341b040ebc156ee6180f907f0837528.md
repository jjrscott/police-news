# Motorists warned of road closures in Shaftesbury area

13 April 2017

* * *

Motorists are being warned of road closures on routes between Shaftesbury and Blandford this afternoon, Thursday 13 April 2017.

The A350 is currently closed for the recovery of a crane following a fire, which was reported at 6.20pm yesterday, Wednesday 12 April 2017.

The fire is not being treated as suspicious.

The road is closed between the Royal Chase Roundabout and Foot's Hill and is expected to reopen later this afternoon following the recovery of the crane.

Road closures are also currently in place on the C13 at Spread Eagle Hill following a collision involving two lorries at around 1pm today.

It is not believed that anyone was seriously injured in the collision and recovery is currently being arranged for the vehicles.

The road closures mean there is currently no direct road access between Shaftesbury and Blandford.

Motorists are being advised to avoid the area.
