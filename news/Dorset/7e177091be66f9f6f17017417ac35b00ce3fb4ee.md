Officers are appealing for witnesses after a woman sustained potentially life-changing injuries following a collision in West Moors.

At 2.11pm today, Sunday 10 June 2018, Dorset Police was called to reports of a collision in a car park off Station Road involving a blue Daewoo Matiz, being driven by an 80-year-old woman from West Moors, and a parked and unattended blue Ford B-Max.

As a result of the collision, the Ford was forced into a bench. A local woman aged 61 who was sat on the bench was trapped by her legs by the vehicle and had to be freed by firefighters.

She was taken to Poole General Hospital for treatment to injuries, which are described as potentially life-changing.

No one else was injured.
