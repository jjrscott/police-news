# Appeal after theft of car in Charmouth

18 July 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a car containing a quantity of jewellery was stolen from a car park in Charmouth.

The black diesel BMW 1 Series was parked in the grassed overflow car park outside the Charmouth Heritage Coast Centre when it was taken between 3.30pm and 4pm on Saturday 8 July 2017.

Inside the vehicle was a quantity of small silver jewellery items.

Officers are releasing images of jewellery similar to those that were stolen in the hope that somebody may recognise them.

Police Constable Kirsti Frecknall, of Bridport police, said: "We have made enquiries in an attempt to locate the vehicle and we are also keen to hear from anyone who comes across items of jewellery similar to those pictured in suspicious circumstances.

"We would also like to remind people not to leave valuables unattended in their cars."
