# Witness appeal following theft in Wimborne

13 February 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a theft in Wimborne are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

Between Wednesday 5 February and Wednesday 12 February 2020 a Citroen motorhome had its awning cassette stolen from the Leigh Road area. It is a 3.7 metre-long Fiamma F65S, worth approximately Â£800.

Police Sergeant Richard Barnett, of Dorset Police, said: "I am making a number of enquiries into this theft and would like to hear from anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area over the past week.

"Two people would have been required to remove the awning and they would have needed steps or a ladder to do so, along with a vehicle to take it away. It is possible that people passed by when the theft was in progress but did not think anything criminal was happening.

"I would also urge anyone who may have seen an awning cassette matching the description given for sale in unusual circumstances to please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200022312. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
