# Dorset Police welcomes first inspector through the Direct Entry programme

31 October 2017

* * *

Today, 31 October 2017, Dorset Police welcomes Julie Howe, the first person to join the Force through the Direct Entry programme.

The programme allows candidates from outside policing to join the service at certain ranks and offers the opportunity to widen the talent pool and bring in people from a diverse range of backgrounds.

Prior to starting with Dorset Police Julie was a qualified social worker, working for the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS) for almost seven years.

Julie will now begin a 24 month training programme to develop her into a highly competent uniformed inspector. Her training will fast track her through the ranks from constable to inspector under the guidance of an experienced work based coach.

Julie Howe said: “The main factor that influenced my decision to join the Direct Entry programme was the incredible opportunity it presented for someone with existing leadership skills to join the police service.”

Dorset Police and Crime Commissioner, Martyn Underhill, said: “Direct Entry is a fantastic opportunity for talented individuals with several years of experience in other sectors to use their skills to help policing continue to innovate and adapt to new challenges."

“I have been involved in policing for forty years, and I have never seen the service and the landscape it operates in change so dramatically in such a short period. Future-proofing policing is a top priority and I am confident that the scheme will attract leaders who can bring fresh perspectives to the police service. I look forward to meeting Julie and watching her journey.”

Dorset Police Chief Constable, Debbie Simpson, said: “Dorset Police delivers policing which is professional, efficient and capable of dealing with the growing demand in our county. We also recognise that the nature of crime is changing and we need to adapt and recruit to tackle new challenges."

“Direct Entry supports the National Policing Vision to attract existing exceptional leaders into the police service, who can bring new perspectives, skills and life experiences to enhance our leadership capability, and make an immediate impact on culture, efficiency and effectiveness."

Upon starting the role, Julie Howe said: “It is a great honour to be Dorset Police’s first Direct Entry inspector. I look forward to working with police officers and staff to compliment the work being done to keep communities safe.”
