# Update to incident in Bournemouth

06 February 2018

* * *

A man who was arrested following an incident in Bournemouth has been released under investigation.

At 7.22am on Saturday 3 February 2018 Dorset Police was called to reports that a woman was being held hostage at an address in Parley Road by a man allegedly armed with a gun.

Specialist firearm officers attended and established the woman was no longer inside the address. She was uninjured.

The man remained in the address and a cordon was put in place to allow officers to deal with the situation and to make enquiries while keeping the public safe.

Later that day, at 1.06pm, a 42-year-old local man was arrested on suspicion of possession of an imitation firearm, affray and false imprisonment. He has been released under investigation while enquiries continue. The people affected by this incident are receiving the appropriate support from Dorset Police and other agencies.

A loaded crossbow and two weapons, believed to be imitation firearms, were seized by officers.
