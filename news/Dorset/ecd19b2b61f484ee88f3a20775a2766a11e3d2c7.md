# Witness appeal following reports of a rape on Weymouth beach

06 July 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating reports of a rape on Weymouth beach are appealing for a potential witness to come forward.

At around 4.15am on Tuesday 4 July 2017, officers were called to The Esplanade following the report of a sexual assault on a local woman aged in her 40s.

A 32-year-old Weymouth man was arrested on suspicion of rape and has since been released under investigation.

Police are now trying to trace a man who initially called police reporting that he had heard a woman in distress on the beach in the early hours that morning.

Detective Constable Sarah Desmond, of Weymouth CID, said: "This man contacted police, but did not disclose his full personal details, so we are trying to trace him as he may hold valuable information that can assist with this investigation.

"I would ask him to please contact Dorset Police urgently.

"Anyone else who may have seen or heard something suspicious in the area around the time of the incident please get in touch with us or call Crimestoppers anonymously."

Officers have been carrying out forensic work at the scene of the incident and investigations are continuing.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170100864. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
