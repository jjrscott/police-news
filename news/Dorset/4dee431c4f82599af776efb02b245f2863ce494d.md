# Appeal for witnesses following theft of sheep in East Dorset

23 April 2018

* * *

Officers investigating the theft of ewes and lambs from a field in East Dorset are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police received a report that between 12noon on Saturday 21 April and 1.15pm on Sunday 22 April 2018 32 Suffolk ewes and 62 lambs were taken from a field in the area of Mill Lane near Wimborne.

It was also reported that there were tyre tracks in the grass leading from the scene.

The theft follows a previous incident where 50 pregnant ewes were taken from a field in the area of Hayward's Lane near Child Okeford in North Dorset overnight from Tuesday 17 April 2018 to Wednesday 18 April 2018.

Police Constable Maddy Dysterre-Clark, of East Dorset police, said: "While at this stage we cannot confirm that the two incidents are linked, this is the second occasion in a short space of time where a large number of sheep have been stolen and is understandably likely to cause concern in the rural community.

"We are carrying out a number of enquiries into this incident and have been investigating CCTV opportunities.

"I am appealing to anyone who has any information or who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area over the weekend, such as any 4x4 or trailer movements at night, to please contact us.

"We would also urge farmers and members of the rural community to be vigilant and report any suspicious vehicle movements they encounter.
