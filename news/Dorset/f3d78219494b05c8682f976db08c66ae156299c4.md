# Public appeal following burglary in Weymouth

13 March 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a burglary at a flat in Weymouth are appealing for the public's help.

The burglary occurred sometime between 5.30pm and 7.30pm on Monday 11 February 2019 at an address off Abbotsbury Road. Offenders gained access to the flat and carried out an untidy search.

While the burglary was immediately reported to Dorset Police by a local resident, the owner was away on holiday and only returned home last week. She has since discovered that a Louis Vuitton bag worth more than Â£1,000 was stolen. It is described as brown with the classic Louis Vuitton design and with long carry string handles at either end.

A full investigation is underway and officers have already carried out house-to-house enquiries and looked for any available CCTV.

Police Sergeant Richard Barnett, of Weymouth police, said: "This incident has had a significant impact on the victim, who was away visiting family when the offence occurred. She has spent many hours putting her home back together and has now discovered this expensive bag is missing.

"I would ask anyone with information as to who was responsible for the offences to please contact Dorset Police. I am also keen to hear from anyone who may have seen or heard of a Louis Vuitton bag being offered for sale in unusual circumstances to please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190022196. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
