Detectives are appealing for witnesses following an alleged assault in Bournemouth.

The incident happened at around 10.45pm on Thursday 3 August 2017 along Old Christchurch Road near to Superdry.

The victim - a 21-year-old Poole man - was with a group of friends when it is alleged they got into a verbal altercation with the occupants of a passing car.

It is reported that a man and a woman got out of the vehicle and the victim was hit on the head with a pint glass.

The victim was treated at hospital for a cut to his face.

A man and a woman, both aged 20 and from Northampton, were arrested on suspicion of assault and have been released under investigation.

Detective Constable Matthew Loader, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident to contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly keen to hear from two passers-by who may have witnessed the incident and helped the woman return to her car - a white-coloured Ford Fiesta."
