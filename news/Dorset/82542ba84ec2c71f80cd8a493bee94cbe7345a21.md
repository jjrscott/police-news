# Witness appeal following criminal damage to house near Blandford

28 September 2018

* * *

Officers investigating an incident of criminal damage at a house near Blandford are appealing for witnesses.

We were called at 7.55am on Thursday 27 September 2018 to reports that house bricks had been thrown at the windows of a property on A350 High Street at Spetisbury. Two windows were damaged in the incident.

Police Constable Glen Caddy, of North Dorset police, said: "This incident happened at a busy time of the day and I believe a number of people may have been in the area. I would urge anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious to please contact me.

"I am also keen to hear from any motorists who were travelling along High Street at the relevant time and may have captured the incident or offender on dashcam."
