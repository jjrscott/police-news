# Burglary in North Dorset â€“ witness appeal

11 June 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after jewellery was stolen during a burglary in North Dorset.

Sometime between 5pm and 7.30pm on Wednesday 5 June 2019 offenders gained access to an address in the Chapel Lane area of Yetminster via a side window.

Items of jewellery, including a ruby and diamond ring and a sapphire and diamond ring with gold band, as well as a blue and red leather ladies purse containing various bank cards were stolen.

A man was seen in the area at the time and he has been described as white, aged between 30 and 50 years old, five feet seven inches tall and with a sharp haggard face. He was wearing combat trousers, trainers and a heavy coat.

Police Constable Simon Rogers, of Dorchester police, said: "The victims have been left very upset that someone broke into their home and stole items that were of great sentimental value. I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the relevant time and saw or heard anything suspicious, or a man matching the description given, to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would also like to hear from any motorists who may have captured this man on dashcam or any local residents or businesses who have any relevant CCTV."
