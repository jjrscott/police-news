# Witness appeal following assault in Bournemouthâ€™s Lower Gardens

23 December 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a man was assaulted as he walked through Bournemouth's Lower Gardens.

At around 11.45pm on Friday 18 December 2020 the victim - a local man aged in his 30s - went for a walk along on Bournemouth beach, pushing his bicycle and drinking alcohol.

He then walked from the beach into the Lower Gardens using the central path. As he reached the public toilets, the victim was approached by three men. One of the men hit the victim in his left eye, causing significant swelling that required him to be taken to hospital.

Police Constable Ran Hartman-Turner, of Bournemouth police, said: "The victim cannot remember anything about why he was assaulted or any detail of his attacker. We have been carrying out enquiries into this incident, including looking through CCTV footage from the evening.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the relevant time and either witnessed the incident or has any information about who was involved to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200190613. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
