Police investigating a suspicious fire in Poole are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At around 1am on Saturday 3 September 2016, Dorset and Wiltshire Fire Service received reports that a number of cars were alight at English Ford in Yarrow Road.

Firefighters and police officers attended and discovered seven vehicles alight, including a white Ford Focus, a black Mercedes Benz, a red Vauxhall Movano and a silver Volkswagen Golf.

Police Constable Jamie Spry, of Poole police, said: "From our initial investigation it would appear that one car was set alight and the fire then spread to a further six vehicles.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed someone setting this fire, or saw suspicious activity in the area of the garage at the relevant time, to please contact Dorset Police."
