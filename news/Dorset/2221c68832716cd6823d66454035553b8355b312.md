# Photo appeal after theft of Harley Davidson near Wareham

17 October 2016

* * *

Police are releasing a photo of a Harley Davidson motorcycle that was stolen near Wareham and are appealing for information as to its whereabouts.

The bike was taken from a property in Morden sometime between Sunday 2 October and Wednesday 5 October 2016.

It is black with a custom painting of the owner's dog on the side.

Police Constable Jon Kuspert, of Wareham police, said: "The bike holds great sentimental value with the victim and I am issuing an image of the bike in the hope that someone knows its location.

"It is a very distinctive Harley Davidson so I would ask that anyone who has been offered the bike or has seen the bike for sale contacts police.

"I would also appeal to anyone who may have witnessed anything suspicious in the area at the relevant times to come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55160150880\. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
