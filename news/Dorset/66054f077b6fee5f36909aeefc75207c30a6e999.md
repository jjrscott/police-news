# Renewed appeal following sexual assault in Bournemouth

25 November 2016

* * *

Detectives have renewed their appeal for witnesses following a sexual assault in the Ensbury Park area of Bournemouth.

At 9.40pm yesterday, Thursday 24 November 2016, officers were called to reports that a woman had been sexually assaulted in Boundary Road.

The victim - a local woman aged in her 20s - was walking down the pedestrian footpath which sits alongside Boundary Road when she was approached by an unknown man, pushed to the ground and assaulted.

A member of the public was in the area and went to the victim's aid.

The victim is being supported by specially-trained officers.

The offender is described as white, approximately five feet seven inches tall, of slight to medium build and aged in his late 20s or early 30s. He has pale skin, short dark hair and was wearing a black thigh-length coat and dark trousers. He was riding a dark-coloured mountain bike with silver handle bars and made off toward Columbia Road.

A cordon remains in place to allow crime scene investigators to carry out their examinations.

Officers are considering whether this incident is linked to two attempted sexual assaults which happened in Boundary Road on Tuesday 13 September and a wooded area at Slades Farm on Wednesday 14 September 2016.

An investigation is now underway, led by officers from Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT).

Detective Chief Inspector Sarah Derbyshire, of MCIT, said: "It is possible that the offender could have been in the area of Bournemouth University, Boundary Road and the access road adjacent to it from around 9pm last night.

"If you saw a man matching the description given, please come forward.

"I would also like to hear from any motorists who travelled along Boundary Road at the relevant time and have a dashcam fitted in their vehicles. It is possible you may have captured the offender and this footage could prove vital to our investigation."

North Bournemouth Deputy Neighbourhood Inspector Jon Wasey said: "Officers from the local Neighbourhood Policing Team will be stepping up patrols in the area to offer reassurance to the public. We would remind people to remain vigilant and if you see a man matching the description given, please contact us immediately."
