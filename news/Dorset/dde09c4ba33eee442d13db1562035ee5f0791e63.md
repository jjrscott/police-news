# Family tribute following fatal collision in Poole

22 January 2019

* * *

The family of a woman who died in a fatal road traffic collision in Poole have issued a tribute.

Police were called at 11.07pm on Friday 18 January 2019 to reports of a collision between a pedestrian and a car on Poole Road in Branksome.

The 71-year-old female pedestrian - named by her family as Jackie Bradnick - was taken to Poole Hospital but very sadly died from her injuries.

Her family said in a statement: "Jackie - an amazing mum; nan; great grandma; sister and friend, she was adored by all those who knew her - a shining star.

"She will be remembered for being so funny, always up for a laugh, so full of energy, she loved playing around with the children and also was great at making fun.

"She loved Elvis Presley, and took a trip to Graceland, always dancing around to his music.

"We are heartbroken that she's been taken from us too soon, when she still had so much to give, she will be deeply missed."

Specially-trained officers are continuing to support the family and an investigation into the collision is ongoing.

Following detailed enquiries, officers from the traffic unit have now identified all of the vehicles involved in the collision and it has been established that no vehicle failed to stop at the scene, despite initial reports made to police.

Officers are still keen to hear from any witnesses who have not spoken to police or anyone who may have relevant dashcam footage.
