Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a reported assault in Bournemouth.

At 6.20pm on Saturday 20 July 2019 a report was received of a fight involving four people on Charminster Road near to the Coral shop.

A man who was in the area nearby walked over to the group to intervene in the alleged altercation.

The man was reportedly knocked to the floor and kicked a number of times to his left arm. He attended hospital for treatment to a broken arm.

A 40-year-old Bournemouth man has been arrested on suspicion of affray and released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Detective Constable Neil Causebrook, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am continuing to make enquiries into this incident and I understand there were a number of people in the area at the time.

"I would urge any witnesses who have not already spoken to police to please get in touch.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who may have been driving past and has relevant dashcam footage to assist my investigation."
