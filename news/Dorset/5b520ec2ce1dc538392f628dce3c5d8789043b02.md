# Update - serious collision in Christchurch

23 March 2018

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with a serious injury collision in Christchurch.

Just after 3pm on Thursday 17 August 2017 a serious road traffic collision occurred on Barrack Road close to Christchurch police station.

A silver BMW 5 Series travelling from the Fountain roundabout toward Bournemouth was in collision with a pedestrian who was crossing Barrack Road.

The pedestrian - a local man aged in his 50s - sustained serious injuries and was taken by air ambulance to Southampton General Hospital. He sustained a serious head injury and fractured pelvis.

The driver of the BMW was not injured.

A 50-year-old man from Christchurch has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 27 March 2018 for an offence of driving without due care and attention.
