# Serious injury collision â€“ witness appeal

27 October 2016

* * *

Police in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a serious injury collision in the town.

At around 8.20am on Saturday 15 October 2016 a road traffic collision occurred on Westham Road at the junction with Great George Street involving a pedestrian and a blue Ford Titanium C-Max.

The pedestrian - a Romanian woman living locally and aged in her 50s - was crossing the road at the time of the collision. She sustained a leg injury and has undergone surgery. She is expected to spend a number of weeks in hospital.

Police Constable Hayley Brown, of Weymouth police, said: "Following enquiries I believe that a number of people were in the area at the time and may have spoken to the victim and her family. I am appealing to those members of the public and anyone else who witnessed the incident to please contact Dorset Police."
