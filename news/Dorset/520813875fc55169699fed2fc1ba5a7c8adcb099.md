Detectives continuing to investigate two reported aggravated burglaries and an alleged attempted robbery in Christchurch have made a further arrest.

Dorset Police was called at 2.22am on Saturday 27 June 2020 to a report that a male was demanding money on Nelson Drive.

It was reported that the suspect banged on the door of two properties in the area and threatened the elderly occupants with a knife. A quantity of cash was taken during the incident.

Further similar incidents were reported on the evening of Sunday 5 July 2020 in Cunningham Close.

Following enquiries, a 30-year-old Christchurch man has been arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary and attempted robbery and he has been released on police bail as the investigation continues.

A 15-year-old boy from Bournemouth and a 19-year-old man from Christchurch were previously arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary and were released under investigation. Both have now been released from the investigation and will face no further police action.
