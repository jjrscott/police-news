A man is due to appear in court in connection with an alleged animal cruelty incident in Bournemouth.

It was reported that at around 6.55pm on Sunday 14 April 2019 a man was seen to physically abuse a dog in the beer garden of the Buffalo Bar off Holdenhurst Road.

A CCTV appeal was issued on Wednesday 22 May 2019.

A 39-year-old man from Bournemouth has been charged with causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal and is due to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 9 August 2019.

We would like to remind the public that criminal proceedings are active and the individual charged in connection with this investigation has a right to a fair trial. It is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.
