# Appeal after suspicious incident in Gillingham

18 November 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a suspicious incident in Gillingham in which a teenage girl was approached by a man are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At 3.45pm on Saturday 16 November 2019 a 15-year-old local girl was walking along a footpath off Rolls Bridge Way when she was approached by a man who spread his arms and asked her to come to him.

This girl turned and ran back along Rolls Bridge Way and Cemetery Road before going to Gillingham police station to report the matter.

The incident happened in daylight and would have been seen from the main road, Rolls Bridge Way.

The man is described as having tanned or light brown skin, about six feet tall, of large build and aged between 18 and 30 years. He has short black hair and may have some stubble. His eyes are quite close together and of a dark brown colour.

He was wearing a full grey tracksuit with long sleeves and a hood. During the incident the hood was up, but did not fully cover his head.

Police Constable Geraint Graig, of Gillingham police, said: "The man did not follow the girl after she turned away and made her way to Rolls Bridge Way and it is not clear what his intentions were.

"I am appealing for anyone who was in the area at the time and might have seen any suspicious activity or the man described to please come forward."
