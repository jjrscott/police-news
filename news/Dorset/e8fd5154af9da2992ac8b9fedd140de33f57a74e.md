# Witness appeal after assault in Gillingham

01 June 2017

* * *

Officers investigating an assault in Gillingham are appealing for any witnesses to the incident to come forward.

The victim, a local man in his 40s, was walking his dog with his wife in the area of Chantry Fields to the rear of the town's Waitrose store at around 5.45pm on Tuesday 30 May 2017.

A large, fluffy white Alsatian type dog came running up to them and, to protect his own dog, the man stood between the two animals.

The victim shouted over to another man, who he believed to be the owner of the Alsatian type dog, and said his animal was causing a nuisance.

The man responded by being verbally abusive and went to try and headbutt the victim.

He was able to move out of the way but was then punched in the face, causing a laceration to his bottom lip.

The offender is described as white, of slim build, around six feet tall and around 45 years old.

He had short, balding hair with tinges of red and grey and was wearing blue denim jeans and a dark cardigan.

Police Constable Simon Rogers, of North Dorset police, said: "This was understandably a distressing incident for the victim and I am keen to hear from anyone who has any information that can help our investigation.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident, or who recognises the description given of the man and his dog, to please contact police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170080183. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
