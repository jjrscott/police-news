06 October 2017

* * *

A man arrested in relation to an alleged fail-to-stop fatal collision in Bournemouth has been released under investigation.

At around 10.39pm on Tuesday 3 October 2017 it was reported that a collision involving a cyclist had occurred on the A338 Spur Road southbound around one mile from the Ashley Heath roundabout. It is alleged the driver of the vehicle that struck the cyclist failed to stop at the scene.

Sadly, the cyclist - 30-year-old Christopher Gibbs from Poole - was pronounced dead at the scene.

A 57-year-old man from Southampton was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and failing to stop at the scene of a collision. He has been released under investigation.

A 57-year-old Southampton woman who was arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender had previously been released under investigation.

Officers are still appealing for anyone who was in the area of Verwood, the A31 or the A338 between 9.30pm and 10.40pm on Tuesday night and may have seen a cyclist to contact police.
