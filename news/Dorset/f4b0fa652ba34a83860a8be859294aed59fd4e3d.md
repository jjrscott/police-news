# Appeal for witnesses following reported collision in Weymouth

06 July 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a reported road traffic collision in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward - with one man arrested.

Dorset Police received a report at around 5.10pm on Sunday 5 July 2020 that a silver Citroen C3 was being driven dangerously on Dorchester Road.

It was further alleged that the car was in collision with the central reservation near to the BP garage.

Officers attended and located the vehicle. A 37-year-old man from Weymouth was arrested on suspicion of a driving offence and has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Police Constable Susan Tagg, of Weymouth Volume Crime Team, said: "I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the incident to please get in contact.

"I am also keen to hear from any motorists who were travelling in the nearby area and may have captured any relevant dashcam footage of the alleged vehicle involved either before or during the collision."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200097366. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
