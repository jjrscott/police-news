# Witness appeal after aggravated burglary in Kinson

25 June 2016

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses after an alleged aggravated burglary in Kinson, during which a man was stabbed.

Dorset Police was called by the ambulance service to an address in Wavell Road at 12:15pm today (Saturday 25 June) after they attended to treat a man in his 30s for a stab injury to his leg, which happened during the alleged burglary.

The suspect had left the scene and a search of the nearby area has been taking place. Armed response officers and the National Police Air Service have assisted the search.

The suspect is described as a white man in his late-20s or early-30s, who is quite tall and of slim build. Distinctively, he is reported as having missing teeth, short gingery hair and beard, and a pale complexion.

Detective Sergeant Scott Johnson of Bournemouth CID said: "Our enquiries to locate the suspect are ongoing. While we are treating this as a serious incident, we have reason to believe that the individuals are known to each other and there is no wider threat to the public.

"However, if anyone sees a man matching this distinctive description, please call 999 rather than approaching him. We would also ask anyone who saw a man matching this description near Wavell Road at lunchtime today to get in contact."

The victim is currently receiving hospital treatment and his injury is not believed to be life-threatening.

Potential witnesses to the incident or anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police online at www.dorset.police.uk, by emailing 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101. If you see a man matching the description of the suspect, please call 999 quoting incident number 25:188. Alternatively, you can call the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimstoppers-uk.org.
