# Witness appeal following fatal collision on A35 near Bere Regis

11 March 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a fatal collision on the A35 near Bere Regis.

At around 8.39am today, Sunday 11 March 2018, a two vehicle collision occurred two miles from Bere Regis toward Poole involving a silver Vauxhall Astra and a silver Peugeot people carrier.

Very sadly the driver of the Astra - a 35-year-old woman from Bournemouth - died at the scene. Her family has been informed and the coroner notified.

Five people travelling in the Peugeot were trapped in the vehicle and had to be freed by firefighters from Dorset & Wiltshire Fire and Rescue. The driver - a 55-year man from Poole - sustained serious injuries and was taken by air ambulance to Southampton General Hospital for treatment.

Four other passengers sustained serious injuries and were also taken to hospital for treatment by ambulance.

The A35 remains closed between Morden Park Corner and Woodbury Cross while emergency services deal with the incident.

Police Sergeant Craig Tatton, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or saw the manner of driving of either vehicle immediately prior to the incident to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would like to thank the public for their patience during the road closures, which have been absolutely necessary to allow us to treat the injured casualties and establish the circumstances of the collision."
