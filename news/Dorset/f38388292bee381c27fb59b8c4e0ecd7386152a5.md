# Witness appeal after attempted street robberies in Weymouth

09 March 2017

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward after two attempted robberies in Weymouth.

Both offences occurred in Ranleigh Road and officers believe the same man may have been responsible.

The first incident took place at around 8pm yesterday, Wednesday 8 March 2017, as the victim - a local man aged in his 60s - was walking along the road. He was approached by an unknown man who asked for a cigarette, then one pound before he demanded money and pushed himself into the victim. The offender stole the victim's glasses case and ran off. He discarded the case a short time later. No weapon was used.

The offender is described as white, aged in his 30s, five feet 10 inches tall, of average build and with short hair. He spoke with a local accent.

The second incident occurred just before 1.30am today, Thursday 9 March 2017, in the same section of Ranleigh Road as the first incident. The victim - a local man aged in his 30s - was walking along the road when he was approached by a man.

The offender pulled out a black handled kitchen knife and demanded the victim's money. The victim ran away from the scene and raised the alarm. Nothing was taken.

He described the offender as white, aged in his late 30s, of large build, with dark messy hair and spoke with a local accent.

Detective Constable Sean Garrett, of Weymouth CID, said: "This was a frightening incident for both victims and I would urge anyone who was in the Ranleigh Road area at the relevant time, or saw a man matching the descriptions given, to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would like to reassure members of the public that officers from the local neighbourhood policing team will be carrying out high-visibility patrols in the area over the coming days."
