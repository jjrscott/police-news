* * *

A man has been charged in connection with an alleged attempted robbery at a sandwich shop in Bournemouth.

At around 8.30pm on Friday 31 March 2017 a man reportedly entered the Subway store in Southbourne Grove and handed a note to a member of staff, stating that he had a knife and for them to put cash in a bag.

He kept his hand in his pockets and no knife was actually seen.

It was reported that the man left the store empty handed when three members of the public entered the premises.

Nobody was physically injured in the incident.

A 36-year-old man, of no fixed abode, has been charged with attempted robbery and is due to appear at Bournemouth Crown Court on Thursday 13 July 2017.
