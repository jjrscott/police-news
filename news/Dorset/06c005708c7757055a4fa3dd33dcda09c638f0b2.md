# Appeal for witnesses following reported robbery in Weymouth

30 May 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating a reported robbery in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

A 15-year-old boy reported to police that he was with friends in St Mary Street near to the Trespass store at around 8.15pm on Friday 25 May 2018 when the incident occurred.

He was reportedly approached by an unknown teenage boy, who was holding a black-handled kitchen knife, and asked him 'what have you got for me?' before proceeding to rummage through the 15-year-old boy's pockets and taking a £20 note as well as £2.50 in coins.

The alleged offender is described as being around 16 years old and five feet four inches tall. He was wearing a hooded top with the hood up and a 'Nike Air' top underneath with red sleeves and a white front.

A 16-year-old boy from Poole has been arrested on suspicion of robbery and has been released under investigation as detectives continue to make enquiries.

Detective Constable Lynda Soutine, of Weymouth CID, said: "We are continuing to investigate this incident and I am appealing for anyone with information to contact us.

"I understand there were a number of young people in the area at the time and I would like to hear from any witnesses who have not already spoken to police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180079835. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
