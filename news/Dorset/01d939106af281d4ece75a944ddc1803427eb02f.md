# Witness appeal following fatal collision in Bournemouth

14 August 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a fatal collision in Bournemouth.

At 8.34am today, Tuesday 14 August 2018, officers were called by the ambulance service to reports of a serious injury road traffic collision on the eastbound carriageway of the A338 Wessex Way between the Bournemouth West roundabout and the Richmond Hill roundabout involving a black Yamaha motorcycle.

Very sadly the rider of the motorcycle - a 29-year-old woman from Bournemouth - sustained serious injuries and died at the scene. Her family have been informed and the coroner has been notified.

The Wessex Way was closed between the Bournemouth West roundabout and St Pauls roundabout while collision investigators examined the scene and to allow the air ambulance to land safely.

Police Sergeant Mark Scammell, of the traffic unit, said: "An investigation is underway into the circumstances of this collision and I am appealing to anyone who was travelling along the Wessex Way at the time and witnessed the incident to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am also keen to hear from any motorists who may have captured the incident on dash cam to please get in touch.

"Finally, I fully understand the road closures would have caused inconvenience to motorists but I would like to reassure them that they were entirely necessary to allow emergency services to deal with the incident and establish what happened."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at scit@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 14:79. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
