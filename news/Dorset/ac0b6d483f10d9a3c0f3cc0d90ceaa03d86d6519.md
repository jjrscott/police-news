# Warning to public after series of incidents involving cashpoints in Poole and Bournemouth

28 July 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a series of reported incidents where cashpoints have been tampered with in Poole and Bournemouth are appealing for information and warning members of the public to be vigilant.

Dorset Police has received five reports in the conurbation between Wednesday 15 July and Thursday 23 July 2020 where devices have been place on ATM machines that have retained the victim's bank card. The card has then been recovered by the offender and used at other locations a short time later.

The incidents have occurred at ATM machines in Sandbanks Road, Oakdale Road, Blandford Road and Wimborne Road in Poole as well as Christchurch Road in Bournemouth.

Detective Constable Jo Regan, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We are continuing to investigate these incidents and I am appealing to anyone with information that might assist our enquiries to please contact us.

"I would also urge members of the public to be vigilant when using cash machines in the area and if you see anything about a machine that looks suspicious, do not use it and report it to police and the relevant bank.

"I would also advise people to always make sure they cover their PIN when entering it at an ATM machine."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200107179. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
