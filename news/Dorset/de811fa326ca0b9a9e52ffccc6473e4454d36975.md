# Witness appeal following burglary at phone store in Poole

28 September 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward after burglars stole mobile phones from the EE store in Poole.

We were called at 3.36am today, Friday 28 September 2018, to reports of a break to the Falkland Square store. A number of mobile phones are believed to have been stolen.

Officers attended and were informed a car had left the scene.

A short time later an Audi estate car failed to stop for officers and it was followed from Poole to Verwood. A search of the area was carried out with the assistance of the NPAS helicopter and dog section to locate the suspects but this was unsuccessful.

The Audi was found abandoned at the junction of Moorlands Road and Edmondsham Road in Verwood. A number of mobile phones have been recovered.

Detective Constable Sara Freestone, of Bournemouth CID, said: "A full investigation is underway to identify the suspects involving CCTV enquiries and forensic tests.

"I would appeal to anyone who was in the area of Falkland Square in Poole or Edmondsham Road in Verwood in the early hours of this morning and saw or heard anything suspicious to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180157173. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
