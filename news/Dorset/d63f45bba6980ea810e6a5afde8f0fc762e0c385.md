Officers are appealing for anyone with information to come forward following two fires in Weymouth that are believed to have been started deliberately.

At around 12.15am on Tuesday 21 July 2020 officers attended two fires near to each other on the heathland behind Kestrel View. The fires damaged approximately 10 metres by 50 metres of land.

Nobody was injured during the incident.

Police Sergeant Shaz Cuff, of Weymouth police, said: "We have been liaising with the fire service and are making a number of enquiries in relation to this incident.

"It is believed the fires were started deliberately and I would urge anyone with information about who is responsible, or who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area around the time of the fires, to please contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200106675. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
