05 April 2018

* * *

A man has been arrested in connection with a reported attempted knifepoint robbery at a convenience store in Christchurch.

At 8.35pm on Monday 15 January 2018 it was reported that a man entered the Nisa store in Marlow Drive and demanded money from the till. He allegedly produced a large silver knife.

Two members of staff working in the shop at the time left the store and contacted the police.

Nobody was injured during the incident and nothing was taken from the store.

A 31-year-old man, of no fixed abode, has been arrested on suspicion of robbery and has been released under investigation as police enquiries continue.
