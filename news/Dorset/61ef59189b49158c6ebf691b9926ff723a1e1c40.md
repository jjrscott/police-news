Officers investigating commercial burglaries in Poole are appealing for witnesses and urging businesses in the area to remain vigilant.

A shed was stolen from the Canford Magna Garden Centre at around 11.30pm on Thursday 25 July 2019. It is believed to have been loaded onto a vehicle by the offenders before they made off.

On the night of Wednesday 24 July 2019 a catering van was also broken into at the Canford Park Arena. Cash was stolen as well as stock and a catering-sized Slush Puppy machine.

Police Constable Phil Prentice, of Poole police, said: "We are carrying out investigations into these incidents and I am appealing to anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area, particularly involving large vehicles, at the relevant times to please contact me.

"I would also urge businesses in the Magna Road area to take the time to review their security measures and do all they can to help protect their property from thieves."
