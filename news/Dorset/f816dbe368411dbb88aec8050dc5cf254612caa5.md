A man has been arrested following an alleged attempted robbery in Poole.

The incident happened at around 8pm on Friday 18 November 2016 when the victim - a 50-year-old Poole man - exited the newsagent on the junction of Poole Road and Bourne Valley Road.

It was reported that the victim was approached by a man demanding money.

The alleged offender reportedly grabbed the victim by his fleece and pulled it over his head before hitting him. It is alleged he then threw the victim into the road where he was hit by oncoming cars.

As a result of the incident, the victim sustained a fractured ankle. Nothing was stolen.

A 28-year-old Poole man has been arrested on suspicion of robbery and is currently on police bail pending further enquiries until the end of December 2016.
