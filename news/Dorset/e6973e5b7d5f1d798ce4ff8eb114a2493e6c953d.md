# Witness appeal following arson in Bournemouth

24 June 2016

* * *

Police are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following an arson attack in Bournemouth.

At 5.50pm on Friday 17 June 2016, police were called to reports of a bin fire inside a wooden bin store in Nutley Way in the Kinson area of the town.

Damage was caused to a nearby parked car.

Police Constable Phil Riggs, of Bournemouth police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who saw anything suspicious in the Nutley Way area at the time of the incident to please contact Dorset Police.

"We believe people were in the area at the time and I would ask them to come forward as they may have vital information.

"I would also urge anyone who knows who is responsible for this fire to please contact us."

Station Manager Stuart Granger, of Dorset & Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service, said: "Any fire in or near to a domestic dwelling has the potential to endanger life. All too often we have seen fires spread rapidly from bin stores to homes, and it is very fortunate that this didn't happen on this occasion."

No arrests have been made.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 17:352. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
