# Dorset Police asks: How secure is your home this winter?

18 November 2016

* * *

The Force is encouraging residents to complete a home security self-assessment and consider measures to make their properties more secure.

Trends show that dwelling burglary is declining in the county. Dorset Police is asking for the public's help to continue to reduce the number of victims of the crime and keep neighbourhoods secure.

Detective Inspector Neil Wright, of the Dorset Police Priority Crime Team, said: "So far this year, I am pleased to say the number of reported incidents of dwelling burglary has decreased compared to the same time last year.

"This is without doubt partly due to the enhanced vigilance of Dorset's residents. I would like to thank them for their assistance in keeping crime down, and encourage them to continue following our prevention advice."

As the holiday season approaches, households typically have an increased number of valuable items in their properties in the form of presents, and are more regularly unoccupied as people visit family and friends in the lead up to the Christmas period.

This coupled with shorter days means that the winter months pose specific risks for home security.
In response, the Force has released a self-assessment form, designed to help residents identify gaps in their home security.

Dorset Police Crime Prevention and Design Advisor John Green works as part of the UK Police 'Secured by Design' initiative. The scheme focuses on crime prevention for homes and commercial premises and promotes the use of security standards for a wide range of applications and products.

John said: "Most of us would say that we take reasonable precautions to keep our homes safe, but it is not often that we actually take the time to fully assess the security of our properties.

"Completing the self-assessment form should only take around ten minutes and will help to expose areas of your home that require some attention.

"You can find more information about home security of the Dorset Police website and at www.securedbydesign.com.

"If you have any specific queries after completing the form, contact your local Neighbourhood Policing Team via the Dorset Police website. They will refer any questions they cannot answer to the crime prevention and design advisors."
