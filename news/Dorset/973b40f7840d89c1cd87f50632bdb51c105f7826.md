# Public appeal following burglary in Bournemouth

28 September 2016

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses after a burglary at an elderly woman's home in Bournemouth.

At around 3.20pm on Sunday 25 September 2016, a woman aged in her 80s was in her home in the Fernheath Road area when an unknown man opened her unlocked front door and walked inside.

The offender spoke to the victim and she asked him what he wanted. He replied that he wanted a glass of water before he walked past her and into her bedroom.

The victim picked up a plastic shoe horn and her phone and began to call the police. As the offender returned from the bedroom, the victim hit the man with the shoe horn. He pushed the victim onto the sofa before picking up her handbag and leaving via the front door.

The victim was not physically injured.

The offender is described as white, five feet 10 inches tall and with dark hair. He was wearing dark trousers, a dark long sleeved top with a T-shirt underneath. The victim's handbag is described as a large black shoulder bag.

Detective Constable Symon Clarke, of Dorset Police's Priority Crime Team, said: "I am appealing to anyone who saw someone matching the description given in the Fernheath Road area at the relevant time to please get in touch.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who has discovered a black handbag discarded in the nearby area. If you do, please do not pick it up but instead contact Dorset Police.

"Finally, I would like to remind residents to ensure they keep their doors locked and secure even if they are at home to prevent their home from being targeted."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55160145434. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
