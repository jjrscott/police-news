# Further arrest made after second Xanax drug warrant in Dorchester

22 November 2018

* * *

Dorset Police has arrested a second man following a further drug warrant in Dorchester regarding the suspected supply of the drug Xanax.

Officers from Dorchester and Weymouth Neighbourhood Policing Teams (NPT) executed the warrant under the Misuse of Drugs Act at a second address in the Fordington area today, Thursday 22 November 2018.

A quantity of what is believed to be Xanax tablets and cannabis was seized.

A 22-year-old man from Dorchester was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply a class B and class C drug and is currently assisting officers with enquiries.

This is the second warrant in the space of a week that has been carried out in relation to the suspected supply of the drug Xanax.

On Friday 16 November a warrant in Dorchester saw the arrest of a 16-year-old boy on suspicion of drug supply offences. He has since been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Police Sergeant Ged Want, of the NPT, said: "I hope this second warrant shows to the community that we are taking action over the suspected supply of drugs in the town.

"Again, the warrant was carried out thanks to community-provided intelligence. I would continue to urge the public to report suspected drug dealing or misuse to us so that we can investigate.

"I would like to reiterate that there are considerable risks associated with taking substances that have not been specifically prescribed. The consequences can be very serious and even fatal. We are aware of incidents where people have mixed Xanax with other drugs and this can significantly increase the risk of harm.

"You can never be sure what a tablet contains when it has not been properly prescribed or the potential effect it can have on you."

Xanax, the brand name for the drug alprazolam, is a benzodiazepine - a controlled medicate used in some parts of the world to treat anxiety. It is not available in the UK on the NHS and is a class C controlled drug.

Xanax causes cardiac or respiratory difficulties, slow down reactions and can make a person feel drowsy, lethargic and forgetful. These drugs can also lead to problems concentrating, headaches, vertigo and are very addictive. When taken with or even without alcohol they can slow the heart rate down to dangerous levels.

Anyone who wants to report alleged drug dealing in their community is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
