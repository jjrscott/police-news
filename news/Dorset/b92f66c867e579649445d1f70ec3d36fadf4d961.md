# Dorset Police unveils its renewed commitment to its communities

04 December 2020

* * *

Dorset Police is unveiling its renewed commitment to ensure local officers engage and communicate with their communities.

A series of plans under the Neighbourhood Engagement Contract (NEC) initiative are being published over the coming weeks on the relevant neighbourhood policing pages of www.dorset.police.uk.

The NEC sets out eight minimum standards and common objectives that each neighbourhood policing team aim to achieve within their area. The contract, and the neighbourhood plans that flow from it, aims to outline how local policing teams will engage with their community through meetings, partnerships and social media feeds, as well as linking in with partner agencies to share best practice and good ideas.

The series of plans cover separate areas across Dorset and have been developed by their respective local policing inspector.

This is the second year the plans have been drawn-up and they coincide with the launch of the second phase of the Your Dorset. Your Police. Your View survey, which asks the public how they would prefer to contact the Force.

Chief Constable James Vaughan said: “Neighbourhood policing is at the heart of everything we do and building trust and confidence with our local communities is vital in helping us to prevent crime, keep people safe and bring offenders to justice.

“Our local policing teams have worked hard on these plans, which provide a two-way approach to communication with local communities, working towards long-term sustainable solutions to reduce crime and understand the issues of residents’ concern.

“It is vital that our communities have a voice, especially after one of the most difficult years in recent times. The way in which we engage with our communities changed dramatically overnight due to the coronavirus pandemic. Unfortunately our face-to-face engagement has been paused, but we have worked hard to find alternative ways to remain connected with the public such as virtual calls and greater use of social media and Dorset Alert.”

Martyn Underhill, Dorset Police and Crime Commissioner, said: “The coronavirus pandemic has emphasised how important it is that the police continue to have close links with the communities they serve.

“It’s good to see that Dorset’s community teams have worked so hard throughout the pandemic to build and maintain these links with our neighbourhoods, and I hope residents across the county will find the time to look at these plans over the coming weeks.”
