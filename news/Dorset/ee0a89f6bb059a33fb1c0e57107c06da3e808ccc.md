# Robbery at shop in Poole - witness appeal

06 November 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating a robbery at a shop in Poole are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

The incident happened at around 11.20am today, Tuesday 6 November 2018, at St Mary's News on St Mary's Road.

It was reported that two men wearing scarfs around their faces entered the store and threatened members of staff with a weapon, believed to be a hand gun. It is not known if it was real or a replica.

The men then took a quantity of cigarettes, cash and a phone before making off in a black Vauxhall Corsa or similar vehicle.

No one sustained any physical injuries.

Officers attended and a search of the area was carried out. Attempts to identify those responsible remain ongoing.

Detective Constable Tom Alsford, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was obviously a very distressing incident for the members of staff and public who were in the store at the time and we are determined to identify those responsible.

"I am appealing for any witnesses to the incident or who saw any suspicious activity in the area before or afterwards to please come forward, particularly if you were driving in the area and have relevant dashcam footage."
