Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward following an indecent exposure incident in Bournemouth.

At around 5.15pm on Wednesday 18 November 2020 two women were walking along East Overcliff Drive when a man in a vehicle pulled up beside them and exposed himself.

The vehicle is described as a small red car.

Police Constable Heidi Nielsen, of Bournemouth police, said: "This incident was extremely distressing for the women and I am carrying out a number of enquiries to try and locate the offender.

"I am keen to hear from anyone who saw any suspicious activity in the area or may have information to assist my investigation.

"I am particularly keen to speak to any motorists who were travelling along East Overcliff Drive around the time of the incident and may have captured any relevant dashcam footage."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200174057. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
