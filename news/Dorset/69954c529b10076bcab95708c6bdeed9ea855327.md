24 February 2021

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a man was searched for allegedly being in possession of drugs in Bournemouth.

At around 11am on Saturday 20 February 2021 officers were approached by a member of the public reporting that a man was acting suspiciously on Richmond Park Avenue.

Officers stopped the man and he was detained for a search under the Misuse of Drugs Act.

A quantity of suspected cannabis was located in the driveway of a nearby property and seized.

The man, aged 37 and from Bournemouth, was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply a controlled drug of class B. He has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Police Constable David Thompson, of the Volume Crime Team, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the area of Richmond Park Avenue and witnessed what happened to please get in touch.

"I am particularly keen to hear from the member of the public who initially approached officers at the incident. We unfortunately were unable to take your details at the time and would like to speak to you to find out more information."
