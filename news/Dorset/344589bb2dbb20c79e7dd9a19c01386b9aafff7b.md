Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a reported serious assault in Bournemouth town centre.

At around 1.50am on Sunday 18 March 2018 it is reported that an altercation occurred in Bar So on Exeter Road between the victim and a group of people. Door staff intervened and the argument continued out on the street.

Shortly afterwards it is alleged the victim - a 27-year-old man from Andover in Hampshire - was assaulted.

Police officers who were nearby attended and called for an ambulance. He was taken to hospital where he was treated for a fractured skull.

A 24-year-old man of Poole has been arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm and has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Detectives have been carrying out a number of enquiries, including looking at CCTV footage from the area.

Detective Constable Nicky Sharpe, of Bournemouth CID, said: "The victim has been treated for a very serious injury and is very upset. I am keen to trace any witnesses and would ask anyone who saw the reported altercation either inside Bar So or outside on Exeter Road to please contact Dorset Police."
