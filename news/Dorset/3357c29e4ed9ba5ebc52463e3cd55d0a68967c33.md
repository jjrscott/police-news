# Witness appeal following serious road traffic collision near Wool

23 December 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses following a serious road traffic collision near Wool.

At 3.42am today, Saturday 23 December 2017, Dorset Police was called to a report of a collision near to the Coombe Keynes junction on the B3071 between Wool and Lulworth.

The collision involved a blue Volkswagen Caddy van and a pedestrian.

The pedestrian, a 17-year-old local boy, sustained life-threatening injuries and was taken to Southampton General Hospital. His family are with him and are being supported by officers.

The driver of the Volkswagen Caddy, a man in his 70s from Sherborne, was uninjured.

The road was closed to allow the emergency services to deal with the incident and to allow for vital examination of the collision scene.

Sergeant Craig Tatton, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing for anyone who may have been travelling in that area around the relevant time and saw either the vehicle involved or the pedestrian, to contact police as soon as possible.

"I would also appeal to anyone who was in the area at the time and may have in-car CCTV or dashcam footage to come forward so we can gather as much information as we can about the circumstances that led up to this collision.

"I would like to thank motorists and anyone affected for their patience during the road closures, which I can assure members of the public are absolutely necessary to allow the emergency services to carry out their work and for a detailed examination of the collision scene to take place."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at scit@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 23:79. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
