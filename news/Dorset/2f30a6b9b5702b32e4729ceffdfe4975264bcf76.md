# Appeal following reports of an incident in Bournemouth

14 December 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following reports of an incident involving a child in Bournemouth.

At around 6pm on Wednesday 12 December 2018 two 10-year-old boys were riding their scooters along Fernheath Road in the West Howe area when one fell off.

As he got up, a man grabbed the boy by his jacket and spoke to him. The pair exchanged words before the man got into a dark blue-coloured car, possibly a Hyundai and drove away.

It is reported the car may have been involved in a collision with another vehicle immediately after.

Police Sergeant Sophie Williams, of Bournemouth police, said: "We are investigating the circumstances surrounding this incident and are keen to speak to the man involved. It may be that his intentions were not malicious but we need to speak to him to establish what happened.

"I would ask the man involved, or anyone who was in the area at the relevant time and witnessed the incident, to please contact Dorset Police."

Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team are available to address any community concerns.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180199441. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
