# Update â€“ man due in court in connection with serious injury collision in Weymouth

19 July 2019

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with a serious injury collision in Weymouth.

Dorset Police was called at 1.48am on Saturday 11 May 2019 by the ambulance service to reports of a single vehicle collision on the A353 between Preston and Osmington, close to the White Horse Garage. It was reported that a white Vauxhall Corsa had left the road and gone into the hedge.

The driver of the Corsa, a 19-year-old man from Runcorn in Cheshire, sustained serious injuries and was taken to hospital for treatment. Nobody else was in the vehicle.

He has now been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Friday 26 July 2019 for an offence of driving with excess alcohol.
