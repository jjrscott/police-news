# Reported dog stolen from West Parley â€“ two men arrested

22 September 2020

* * *

Officers investigating reports a dog was stolen from West Parley say two men have been arrested and the dog has been reunited with its owners.

On the morning of Friday 18 September 2020 the dog's owner was cutting the grass at an address on Longfield Drive while Cookie the Cockapoo was in an unlocked Volkswagen Transporter van, which was parked on the corner of New Road and Longfield Drive. At around midday they discovered Cookie was missing.

It is reported that Cookie was seen on CCTV at around 11.50am getting out of the van and walking toward someone who was hidden from view.

As a result of enquiries, a 32-year-old man from Poole and a 36-year-old man from Wimborne have been arrested on suspicion of theft and are assisting officers with their enquiries.

Cookie has been returned to her owners.
