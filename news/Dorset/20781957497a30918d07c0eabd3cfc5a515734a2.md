Detectives are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward after an assault in Bournemouth.

The incident occurred at McDonalds on Old Christchurch Road at approximately 11.07pm on Friday 14 October 2016.

A male member of staff was manning the door to facilitate customers leaving and preventing others from entering as the restaurant was closing.
