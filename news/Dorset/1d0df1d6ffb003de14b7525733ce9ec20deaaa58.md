# Introducing Dorset Police People

31 March 2017

* * *

Dorset Police is presenting staff and officers to the public as part of a new campaign to introduce what the Force do on the front line and behind the scenes.

Today, 31 March 2017, Dorset Police is launching a project entitled 'Dorset Police People'. Each week a new member of the Dorset Police family will appear in a short video, explaining their role and what they do on a day to day basis, in an effort to raise the public profile of the less visible Dorset Police departments.

As an organisation, Dorset Police employs people in a huge variety of roles. While members of the public may consider themselves familiar with some roles within the Force, there are a large number of services people may not even know are supplied.

The diversity of roles within the organisation reflects the rapidly changing nature of policing and the commitment Dorset Police have made to providing bespoke services. Policing is not just about 'bobbies on the beat'. Modern policing is multilevel and complex and the Force is equipped to deal with these challenges.

The most recent Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) inspections show that Dorset Police are delivering a service to be proud of.

Assistant Chief Constable Mark Cooper, said: "From experience, we know that the public engage positively when we present the Force on a more personal and individual level.

"People are generally interested in the work that we do, and we are committed to educating them further.

"This is an opportunity for us to show our communities the good work we do and how committed we are to keeping them safe."

Each Friday afternoon, a person profile video will be released on to the Dorset Police website and shared on the Force's social media platforms. As part of the project we have created the hashtag #DPPeople which will be featured in and alongside each video.

Please follow the campaign on our website, www.dorset.police.uk and on our social media accounts, Twitter - @dorsetpolice, Facebook - Dorset Police, YouTube - DorsetPoliceHQ, and Instagram - dorset_police, using the hashtag #DPPeople.
