# Stolen vehicle investigation â€“ public appeal

17 July 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for the public's help to locate a vehicle which was stolen in Ferndown.

Sometime between 1.30pm and 3pm on Tuesday 27 June 2017 a blue Rover 25 with the registration X336 JEL was stolen from the Penny Lodge car park on Library Road.

It is believed the victim - a local woman aged in her 90s - may have dropped her car keys as she rushed from the car to the hairdressers in the rain at around 1.30pm.

The vehicle was seen being driven by a man in a dangerous manner in Holloway Avenue in the Kinson area of Bournemouth at around 3pm the same day.

Police Constable Simon Shaw, of Dorset Police, said: "We have carried out a number of investigations into this offence including CCTV enquiries but we have not been able to locate the vehicle.

"The victim had owned the car for 12 years and is understandably devastated by the loss. She says that the offender has not only stolen her car but more importantly her independence. She is now considering never driving again and this will prove to be a major upheaval in her lifestyle.

"I am releasing details of the car in the hope that someone may have seen it being driven or parked in the area and I would ask anyone with information about its whereabouts to please contact Dorset Police."
