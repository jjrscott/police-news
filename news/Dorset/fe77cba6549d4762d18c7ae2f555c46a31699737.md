# Woman due in court in connection with reported criminal damage in Swanage

05 January 2021

* * *

A woman is due to appear in court in connection with a reported criminal damage incident in Swanage.

It was reported that at around 9.45am on Sunday 10 May 2020 the victim - a woman aged in her 30s - was waiting in a queue outside the Co-Op on Kings Road West when a woman, who appeared to be intoxicated, began pushing a man around the car park in a shopping trolley near to the victim's car. The victim asked them to move away, however the woman became verbally abusive and pushed the trolley twice into the victim's car, causing damage.

A 51-year-old local woman has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Thursday 14 January 2021 for causing criminal damage to property and using threatening, abusive words or behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress.
