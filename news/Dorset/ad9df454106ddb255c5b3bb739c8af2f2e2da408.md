# Witness appeal after reported second hand car scam in East Dorset

20 February 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses after a reported scam involving second hand cars in East Dorset.

Police received a call at 8.29pm on Sunday 12 February 2017 reporting criminal damage to a car at an address in St Ives near Ringwood.

It is alleged that three men attended the address in order to buy a second hand car that was for sale on Gumtree.

The men are reported to have distracted the seller, while one of them poured oil into the coolant system. They are then alleged to have pointed out a fault to the seller and offered to buy the car for a reduced amount despite there being nothing wrong with the car.

Police Sergeant Gareth Blaken, of the traffic unit, said: "Fortunately the seller in this case was wise to what was going on and when the alleged scammers left the address he informed the police. Officers were then able to stop a car on the A35 near Dorchester and arrest three men in relation to the incident.

"I would like to hear from anyone who has put a car up for sale or sold a vehicle recently where the buyers have acted in a similar way, particularly in the Poole, Bournemouth and Purbeck areas.

"I would also advise anyone selling or planning to sell their car to be aware of anyone operating as described and to report anything suspicious to police."

Three men aged 19, 23 and 24 and all from the London area, have been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and possessing an article for use in fraud and are currently on police bail until the middle of April 2017 pending further enquiries.
