A teenage boy is assisting detectives with their investigation into a reported attempted robbery in Christchurch.

At around 7.55pm on Tuesday 31 October 2017 it was reported that a man walked into the Honeymoon Chinese takeaway in Lymington Road, Highcliffe, and demanded money from a member of staff. No weapons were seen and no threats were made. No money was handed over and the suspect left the scene on a bicycle which had been left outside the shop.

As part of the investigation officers issued two CCTV images.

Detective Constable Neil Jones, of Bournemouth CID, said: "Following our media appeals, I can confirm that officers have identified and spoken to a 15-year-old boy who is assisting us with our investigations. No arrests have been made."
