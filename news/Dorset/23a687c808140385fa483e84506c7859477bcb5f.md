# Appeal for witnesses following racially aggravated public order incident in Weymouth

27 July 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a racially aggravated public order incident in Weymouth are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

At around 6.30pm on Sunday 12 July 2020 a man and woman went to visit their boat that was at the water's edge near to Fleet Road. When they arrived they found a woman sitting in the boat with dogs jumping in and out of it. She was accompanied by a man who was leaning against a post nearby.

They reportedly asked the woman to leave the boat. The man who was leaning on the post became aggressive and was threatening to damage their boat. He also racially abused the female victim.

The man is described as white, middle aged and with black curly hair that was receding and balding in the middle. He was wearing a blue T-shirt and brown shorts. The woman who was in the boat had blond hair.

They also had six dogs with them - four were similar to Irish Setters and the other two were described as Airedale Terriers.

Police Sergeant Shaz Cuff, of Weymouth police, said: "This incident has caused considerable upset for the victims and a full investigation is underway to identify those responsible.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the incident, or who recognises the man and woman from the description given, to please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200101759. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
