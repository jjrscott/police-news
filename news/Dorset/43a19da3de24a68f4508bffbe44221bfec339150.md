A man is due to appear in court in connection with a reported fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth.

Dorset Police was called to a report of a collision involving a car and a pedestrian in Richmond Park Road at 12.17am on Wednesday 1 August 2018.

The male pedestrian was taken to Southampton General Hospital with serious leg and head injuries.

A short while later a man came forward and was arrested on suspicion of driving offences.

The 21-year-old man, from Woking in Surrey, has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 1 March 2019 for offences of failing to stop after an accident and driving a motor vehicle with a proportion of a specified controlled drug above the specified limit.
