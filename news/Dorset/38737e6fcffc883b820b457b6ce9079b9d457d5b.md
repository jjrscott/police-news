# Appeal for Good Samaritan to come forward following serious collision near Blandford

02 June 2017

* * *

Police are appealing for a Good Samaritan to come forward after a serious road traffic collision near Blandford.

The collision occurred at around 6.30pm on Thursday 18 May 2017 on an unnamed road between Bulbarrow Hill and Winterborne Houghton between a stationary Mini Cooper and a cyclist.

The male cyclist - a local man aged in his 40s - collided with the car that had pulled over to the side of the road, causing the rider to dismount and fall heavily on the ground.

He suffered severe injuries to his face that required surgery.

Police Constable Matt Weldon, of North Dorset police, said: "A Good Samaritan stopped before the arrival of police and ambulance and took the injured cyclist's bike to his house for storage until he was released from hospital.

"The cyclist wrote this person's details down and put the note in his pocket, but unfortunately at hospital his clothes were cut off and disposed of.

"I would ask this man to please make himself known to police so we can re-unite the man with his bike."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170073182.
