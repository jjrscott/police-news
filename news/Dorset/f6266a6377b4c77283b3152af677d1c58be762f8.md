# Witness appeal following serious road traffic collision near Sherborne

25 April 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a serious injury road traffic collision near Sherborne are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

Dorset Police received a report shortly before 4am today, Thursday 25 April 2019, that a black Nissan Juke had left the carriageway and was in a hedge off the A30 near Sherborne, close to the turning to Purse Caundle. It is not believed any other vehicles were involved in the collision.

Emergency services attended and the female occupant of the Nissan, a woman aged in her 30s from Somerset, was taken to Yeovil District Hospital for treatment to serious injuries that are believed to be potentially life-changing.

Road closures were put in place to allow police and the ambulance service to deal with the incident and for an investigation of the scene to take place.

Police Sergeant Phil Lee, of the traffic unit, said: "We are carrying out an investigation to establish the circumstances of the collision and I would urge any witnesses to the incident, or the manner of driving of the vehicle prior to it, to contact us.

"I would also ask anyone who was travelling along the A30 near Sherborne at the relevant time and has dashcam fitted to their vehicle to check their footage for anything relevant.

"Finally, I would like to thank motorists and members of the public for their patience during the road closures, which were absolutely necessary to allow the emergency services to respond and for an examination of the scene to be carried out."
