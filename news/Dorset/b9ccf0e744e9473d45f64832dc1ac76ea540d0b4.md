# Appeal to locate possible elderly victim of assault in Ferndown

18 September 2020

* * *

Officers investigating reports of an assault in Ferndown are appealing for a potential further victim to come forward.

At around 7.50am on Wednesday 9 September 2020 a woman was cycling along the A348 Ringwood Road toward Ferndown. As she approached the M&S Foodhall she witnessed two teenage boys push an elderly woman.

The cyclist - a local woman aged in her 30s - stopped and confronted the boys. One of them then pushed her, causing her to fall to the ground and into a bush. She sustained minor scratches to her face and hand. The boys, who were wearing school uniform, ran away.

The cyclist checked on the elderly victim, who said she was going to report it.

Police Constable James Prowse, of Dorset Police, said: "I have now been able to speak to the cyclist to gain a full report of what happened.

"Following enquiries I have established that the elderly victim of this assault has not reported the matter and I would appeal to her to please make contact so we can establish that she is OK and ascertain an account from her.

"I would also appeal to anyone who was in the area at the time of the incident and either saw what happened or captured any relevant footage on private CCTV or dashcam to please contact Dorset Police.

"Enquiries are ongoing including speaking to the local school and CCTV searches."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200135575. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
