# Witness appeal following aggravated burglary in Poole

24 August 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating an aggravated burglary in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Yesterday afternoon, Wednesday 23 August 2017, the victim had been in the garage at her home in Gibson Road for about 30 minutes and when she returned to the house at around 4.15pm she heard a noise of something being dropped and saw a man coming down the stairs. The man had a knife in his left hand.

When the victim, a woman aged in her 40s, questioned what he was doing the man shouted something in an unknown language. Two other men came down the stairs and they ran out of the house, leaving in the direction of Adastral Road.

It is not yet clear whether anything was taken by the men.

The first man is described as Asian, aged in his 20s, around five feet six inches tall and of slim build. He was wearing a white waterproof jacket with the hood up, grey tracksuit bottoms and trainers with red stripes.

The victim did not see the other two men well, but they were said to be around the same height as the other man and were both wearing grey tracksuits.

Detective Constable Amy Burbidge, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was a very frightening experience for the victim involved and we are making every effort to trace the offenders responsible.

"We have made a number of enquiries into this incident, including crime scene examination, house to house enquiries and a trawl of CCTV footage in the area and I would urge anyone with information that can help our investigation to contact me."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 23:372. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
