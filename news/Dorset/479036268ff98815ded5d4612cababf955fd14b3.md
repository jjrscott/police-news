# Appeal after teenage boy bitten by dog in Poole

01 July 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for the public's help to identify the owner of a dog that bit a teenage boy in Poole.

At around 8.15pm on Thursday 13 June 2019 a 15-year-old local boy was riding his scooter along Sherborn Crescent near to Uplyme Close when he approached a Rottweiler-type dog that was being walked on the lead by a woman.

As he rode passed, the dog bit the boy on the leg.

The dog's owner is described as aged around 40 years old, around five feet five inches tall, of medium build and with shoulder-length dark hair. She was wearing blue jeans, a grey jumper and had sunglasses resting on her forehead.

Police Community Support Investigator Matt Cast, of Poole police, said: "I have now been in a position to speak to the child to establish what happened.

"As part of my investigation I am appealing to anyone who either witnessed the incident or knows the identity of the dog owner to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190089866. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
