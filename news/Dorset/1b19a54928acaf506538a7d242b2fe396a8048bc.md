# Dorset Police launch Community Road Safe evenings

13 September 2016

* * *

In conjunction with SafeWise, Dorset & Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service and Kwik Fit, Dorset Police is providing free Community Road Safe evenings for the public in an attempt to improve road safety across the county.

There are yearly fluctuations in the numbers of people killed and seriously injured on our roads, and it is the careless driver behaviour behind these statistics that the Community Road Safe evenings aim to address.

In line with Force priorities, the workshops form part of Dorset Police's proactive efforts to 'reduce the number of people seriously harmed' across Dorset. The innovative Community Road Safe evenings will be funded directly from Driver Awareness Scheme course payments paid by motorists who break the law and compromise the safety of all road users.

The sessions will cover general road user information, the 'Fatal Five' causes of collisions and what you can do to reduce the likelihood of being involved yourself.

There will be an opportunity to speak with your local Neighbourhood Policing Team and Community Speed Watch Liaison Officer about what is available to keep you and your family safe on Dorset roads. A Kwik Fit representative will also be on hand to assist with basic car safety checks and hand out car goody bags and vouchers.

Inspector Matt Butler of the Alliance Roads Policing Team, said: "It doesn't matter whether you're a new driver wanting to increase your confidence on the roads or an older driver who hasn't had any additional training since the day you passed your test, all motorists can benefit from refresher sessions.

"It isn't always reckless drivers that cause collisions. Any driver can cause serious injury to themselves or others if they are not paying attention.

"Educating those who have broken the law is very important, but this initiative will provide motorists with the skills and information they need to prevent them from breaking the law or being involved in a collision in the first place."

Dorset Police and Crime Commissioner, Martyn Underhill, said: "Between 2010 and 2015, road death statistics in Dorset have varied year on year from 17 to 26 fatalities. The unpredictable nature of collisions underlines the importance of ensuring all road users get refresher education to reduce the likelihood of being involved in such tragedies.

"In my election campaign, I committed to working with local charities to raise awareness of road safety to the general driving population and this new partnership is an excellent example of that.

"One simple, careless mistake can significantly change not only your own life, but the lives of others and I would encourage as many people as possible to take part in these innovative education events."

The free workshops will run from 6pm to 8.30pm in locations across the county:
• Thursday 29 September - SafeWise, Bournemouth
• Tuesday 4 October - SafeWise, Weymouth
• Wednesday 12 October - Blandford Fire Station
• Thursday 20 October - Bridport Fire Station
• Tuesday 1 November - Shaftesbury Fire Station
