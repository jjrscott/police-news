# Witness appeal following robbery in Westbourne

30 January 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a robbery in Westbourne are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 12pm on Thursday 30 January 2020, it is reported that a man approached a woman aged in her 70s as she walked under the bridge near to the Milburn Road car park. He forcibly pulled her handbag from her, causing her to fall into a puddle in the road.

It is believed the offender made off on a bicycle in the direction of Surrey Road.

A passer-by helped the victim to her feet and accompanied her to the bank to cancel her cards.

The victim sustained bruising in the incident, but did not require hospital treatment.

Police Constable Joel Brooks, of Bournemouth police, said: "This was an understandably distressing experience for the victim and she could have been injured by passing traffic as she lay in the road.

"I would urge anyone with information or who witnessed the incident to please come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk, or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200015190. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
