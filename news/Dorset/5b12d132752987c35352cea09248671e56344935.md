* * *

A local man has been charged in relation to a reported fail-to-stop road traffic collision in Bournemouth.

At around 4.47am on Thursday 27 October 2016 a collision occurred in Poole Road at the junction of Queens Road involving a gold Vauxhall Tigra and a cyclist.

It was reported that the Tigra failed to stop at the scene and was found abandoned nearby a short time later.

The cyclist - a local man aged in his 30s - sustained serious injuries and was taken to Poole Hospital for treatment. His condition is not believed to be life-threatening.

A 19-year-old Bournemouth man, who had been arrested in relation to the collision, has now been charged with seven offences - causing serious injury by dangerous driving, failing to stop and failing to report a collision, failing to stop for police, fuel bilking and document offences. He is due to appear at Bournemouth Magistrates' Court tomorrow, Tuesday 1 November 2016.
