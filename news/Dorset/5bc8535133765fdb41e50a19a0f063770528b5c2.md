# Witness appeal following break to sheds in Wimborne

03 November 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a number of sheds were broken into at allotments in Wimborne.

At 8.44pm yesterday, Thursday 2 November 2017, Dorset Police was called to reports that a number of sheds in The Leaze allotments off Julians Road had been broken into overnight between Tuesday 31 October and Wednesday 1 November.

It is understood that offenders have broken the padlocks on a number of sheds and gained access.

While Dorset Police has not currently received any reports that anything has been stolen, enquiries are underway to establish if this is the case.

Police Sergeant Tim Travers, of Wimborne police, said: “This incident has affected a large number of people and has caused them a great deal of inconvenience.

“A full investigation is underway to establish who was responsible for these offences and I am appealing to anyone who was in the area of Julians Road at the relevant time and saw any suspicious activity to please contact Dorset Police.

“I would also ask that anyone who has been affected by these break-ins and has not yet spoken to officers to please contact us.

“Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team will be carrying out high visibility patrols in the coming days to offer reassurance and can be approached with any community concerns. We are also consulting with the allotment association, other local community groups and Wimborne Business Improvement District.”

Following investigations by officers it has now been established that up to nine sheds had their padlocks broken and three or four others, which were unlocked, were also entered. Two pedal cycles were taken from one shed. It is not believed anything was taken from any of the other sheds.

Further enquiries have also revealed two men, around five feet seven inches tall, were seen at the allotments at around 9.10pm on the night in question and officers are appealing for anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity around that time to contact them.

Any members of the public who have not yet been contacted or would like crime prevention advice are urged to visit www.dorset.police.uk.

Anyone with information about the shed break-ins is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170171627. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
