# Our cyber challenge has been hacked

02 March 2017

* * *

A winner has been selected following the first cyber challenge that was created by Dorset Police Cyber-Crime Unit in support of Safer Internet Day 2017.

In support of Safer Internet Day, a cyber security challenge was issued, aimed at developing young people's skills and knowledge online in a safe and controlled environment.

The security challenge was a two part challenge. The first part was a crossword containing challenging clues relating to all things cyber. Once the grid was completed it revealed a series of letters for the participant to decipher. The second part was a decoding exercise.

In total, 41 correct answers were submitted at part one of the challenge. Of those, 39 successfully completed the challenge.

Jake Moore, Dorset Cyber-Crime Prevention Officer, said; "The cyber security challenge was an opportunity to support Safer Internet Day and express the importance of staying safe online. Hopefully this challenge has made more people think about their security online.

"It was also a chance for people who are interested in the area of online coding and hacking, to gain experience in this fast growing area of online security.

"I am so happy that we received so many responses and would like to take this opportunity to congratulate everyone who took the time to participate in the challenge."

The winner, a 17 year-old male from Dorchester, will be spending the day in the Cyber Crime Unit later on this month.
