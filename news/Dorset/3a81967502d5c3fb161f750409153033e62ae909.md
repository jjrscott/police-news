# Update â€“ man due in court in connection with reported public order incident in Poole

02 January 2019

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with a reported public order incident in Poole.

At around 3pm on Friday 31 August 2018 it was reported that a minor collision occurred in the car park behind the Canford Cliffs Library where people had gathered to watch the Red Arrows.

Following the collision one of the motorists involved allegedly approached the victim, a woman aged in her 30s who was not directly involved in the incident, and subjected her to verbal abuse.

A 47-year-old Poole man has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 4 January 2019 for an offence of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour to cause harassment, alarm or distress.
