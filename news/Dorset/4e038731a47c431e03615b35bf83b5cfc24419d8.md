# Appeal for information after man bitten by dog in Ferndown

22 July 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for information after an elderly man was bitten by a dog in Ferndown.

At around 2pm on Saturday 11 July 2020 the victim - a man aged in his 70s - was walking along Dane Drive when two boys with two dogs were walking in the opposite direction. He moved aside to give them room and as they passed one of the dogs turned and bit him on the knee.

The victim sustained piercing to his skin as well as bruising and attended hospital for treatment.

The boys are described as white and one was aged around nine years old and the other was approximately 15 years old. The offending dog is described as similar to a Scottish Terrior with off-white coloured fur and big floppy ears.

On Monday 20 July 2020 it is reported that the dogs were sighted in the local area being walked by a man who is described as tall and of slim build.

Police Constable Jennie Sykes-Martin, of Dorset Police, said: "We are carrying out enquiries into this incident and I am appealing to anyone who was in the area and remembers witnessing the incident to please get in touch.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who may have information to help me identify the owner of the two dogs."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200100997. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
