# Update â€“ man due in court in connection with fatal collision in Christchurch

02 December 2019

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with a fatal road traffic collision in Christchurch.

At 3.15pm on Monday 18 March 2019 Dorset Police received a report of a collision involving a pedestrian and a blue Ford Focus on Somerford Road.

Very sadly, the pedestrian - named by her family as 82-year-old Joy Norman from Christchurch - was pronounced dead at the scene.

A 54-year-old Poole man was arrested in connection with the incident and, following an investigation by the traffic unit, he has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 6 December 2019 for an offence of causing death by careless driving.
