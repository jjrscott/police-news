# Witness appeal following theft of bike in Weymouth

14 March 2017

* * *

Police are appealing for witnesses after a bicycle was stolen from outside a shop in Weymouth.

Officers have released an image of the bike, which was taken from outside the Pets at Home store on the Jubilee Retail Park at around 12.30pm on Sunday 12 March 2017.

The victim, a 15-year-old boy, had left the bike outside the store for a short period of time. It had not been secured.

The bike is described as a black Carrera Sulcata with orange markings, orange front suspension forks and brake discs at the front and rear.
A man was seen taking the bike and walking off towards Jubilee Close.

The offender is described as having a scruffy appearance, of skinny build and aged in his 30s.

He had facial stubble and was wearing a black beanie hat.

The man had a large ginger or brown dog with him and was carrying a large rucksack.

Police Sergeant Steve Hughes, of Weymouth police, said: "I would appeal for any witnesses to come forward or for anyone with information which would lead to the recovery of the bike or identification of the man seen taking it to contact me.

"I would also urge anyone who comes across a bike matching the description of the stolen bicycle for sale to contact police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 12:223. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
