Officers in Weymouth and Portland are appealing for information after a series of motorcycle thefts in the area.

There have been at least three reported thefts of motorbikes in Weymouth since Thursday 6 April 2017 and a further three on Portland.

Two of the bikes stolen on Portland have been recovered but were damaged beyond repair.

Officers are now appealing for anyone with information to contact them and are also encouraging motorcyclists to make sure their vehicles are properly secured.

Police Sergeant Jane Moore, of the Weymouth Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "I would urge anyone who sees people behaving suspiciously around motorcycles or has any information about stolen motorbikes to please contact us.

"I would also like to advise motorcycle owners to ensure their vehicles are secured at all times when unattended and, if possible, parked in a garage or secure area overnight."
