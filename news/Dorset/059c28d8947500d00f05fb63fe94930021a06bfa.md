Detectives investigating an assault at a pub in Corfe Mullen are asking for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward.

At around 9.30pm on Saturday 7 July 2018 officers were called to reports of a fight involving about 10 people at The Dorset Soldier in Wareham Road. Officers attended but the fight had dispersed and no offences were disclosed.

Approximately 30 minutes later it was reported that a man had knocked a 49-year-old man from Corfe Mullen unconscious in the pub car park before leaving the scene.

The victim was taken to hospital. It is believed that he sustained serious head and neck injuries.

No arrests have been made.

Detective Inspector Andy Roberts, of Bournemouth CID, said: "There is an indication that the initial fight and the assault 30 minutes later are linked. A man has been left with serious injuries in hospital.

"I am appealing for any witnesses to the fight in the pub as well as the subsequent incident in the car park or anyone with information to come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180106475. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
