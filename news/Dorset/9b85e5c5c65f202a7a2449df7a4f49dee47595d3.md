# Fatal collision in Purbeck â€“ witness appeal

22 September 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward as they investigate a fatal road traffic collision in Purbeck.

Dorset Police received a report at around 6pm on Saturday 21 September 2019 of a collision near Rempstone on the B3351 between Corfe Castle and Studland.

The collision involved a black Royal Enfield Himalayan motorbike and a white Peugeot Boxer caravan.

Officers attended the scene, along with the fire and ambulance services.

Very sadly the motorcyclist, a man aged in his 30s and from Poole, was pronounced dead at the scene. His family has been informed and is being supported by specially-trained officers.

Road closures were put in place to allow emergency services to respond to the incident and for an examination of the collision scene to be carried out.

Sergeant Mark Scammell, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the family of the motorcyclist at this time and we are determined to carry out a detailed investigation to establish the full circumstances of this collision.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision and has not already spoken to police, or anyone who may have captured it on dashcam, to please contact us.

"As ever, I would like to thank members of the public for their patience and understanding during the road closures, which are vital to allow the emergency services to respond and for an investigation of the scene to be carried out."
