Officers are appealing for witnesses after a fatal collision on the A35 near Dorchester.

The collision occurred to the west of Winterbourne Abbas just before 3.30pm today, Wednesday 27 December 2017 between two cars - a blue Ford Fiesta and a red Volkswagen High Up.

Sadly, the 95-year-old male driver of the Volkswagen was pronounced dead at the scene. An 87-year-old female passenger sustained life-threatening injuries and was taken to Dorset County Hospital. They were both from the Wimborne area.

The 70-year-old driver of the Fiesta from Lyme Regis was taken to Dorset County Hospital for treatment to injuries not believed to be life-threatening.

Road closures were put in place on the A35 between Dorchester and Bridport. The road re-opened at around 9.20pm.

Police Inspector Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "My thoughts are with the families of those involved in what is a very difficult time.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or the driving of either vehicle immediately prior to the incident to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would like to thank everyone for their patience while road was closed. It was absolutely necessary to allow us to tend to those involved and investigate this collision thoroughly."
