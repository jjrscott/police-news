# Appeal after criminal damage to pavilion in Bournemouth

09 August 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for anyone with information to come forward after fire damage was caused at a pavilion in Bournemouth.

It was reported at 8.25am on Monday 7 August 2017 that damage had been caused to Pavilion A at Slades Farm. It is believed the offence occurred during the previous night.

A fire exit door had been set alight and a two-foot hole had been burnt in the top section of the door, which had only recently been boarded up after previous damage.

Another wooden door also appeared to have been forced open and several notes were left inside stating that the fire had been discovered and a fire extinguisher and buckets of water had been used to put it out.

Whoever wrote the notes said they did not contact the emergency services because they feared they would be in trouble.

Police Constable Joy Lee, of Bournemouth police, said: "This property has been subjected to various incidents of criminal damage and anti-social behaviour recently but this incident is the most severe.

"It is concerning that the people who have seen the fire broke into the building and tackled the fire without calling the emergency services.

"We have been making various enquiries into this incident and I would urge anyone who witnessed it or who has any information that can assist our investigation to contact me."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170121139. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
