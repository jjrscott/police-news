Detectives investigating reported suspicious incidents in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At 4.59pm on Tuesday 6 March 2018 Dorset Police received information which reported possible voyeurism offences taking place in the public toilets in St Catherine's Road in the Southbourne area.

An investigation is now underway.

A 69-year-old man from Glastonbury has been arrested on suspicion of voyeurism and is currently assisting officers with their enquiries.

Detective Inspector Andrew Bell, of Dorset Police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who has witnessed any suspicious activity in the area of these public toilets and has yet to speak to officers to please come forward.

"I would like to reassure members of the community that a thorough investigation is now underway and officers from the local neighbourhood policing team will be carrying out increased patrols over the coming days and can be approached with any concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180034913. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 55511 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
