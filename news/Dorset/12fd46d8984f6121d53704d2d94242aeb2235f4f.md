# Drink Driver? You’ll be named this summer by Dorset Police

01 June 2018

* * *

Dorset Police is today, Friday 1 June, launching its summer drink driving campaign which is set to run until Monday 16 July to coincide with the World Cup.

Those caught will appear in court before being publicly named by the Force and have their images shared on Dorset Police social media accounts later this summer.

The consequences of driving under the influence of alcohol can be devastating. During 2017, four people were killed and 88 people were injured in collisions involving someone being under the influence.

Throughout the six-week operation, officers will be requesting breath tests from all drivers involved in road traffic collisions, irrespective of whether or not they suspect an offence.

Drivers can expect to be tested during routine stop checks and if they are stopped for an offence.

During 2017, 924 people were arrested for testing positive for alcohol, refusing to provide a breath test or failing their test by blowing over the legal limit.

Police Constable Heidi Moxam, Dorset Police’s Casualty Reduction Officer, said: “With the summer weather and the approaching World Cup football tournament, we’re at a time when drivers are more likely to risk drink driving after socialising. I would ask those planning to go out for a few drinks to consider how you’re going to get home beforehand.

“Last summer we publicly named and issued the images of 32 drivers as part of the campaign with very positive feedback from the public about the approach.

“Too many people fail to consider the untold devastation that drink driving can cause. Alcohol impairs many of the functions necessary for safe driving - reaction times go up and spatial awareness is significantly reduced. You don’t have to be drunk to be a drink driver. The resultant effect of a drink driving ban can bigger than you think including loss of jobs, friends & family and even life. A mate doesn’t let a mate drink drive”.

Chief Inspector Adrian Leisk, Head of the Alliance Roads Policing team across Devon & Cornwall Police and Dorset Police, said: “People convicted of drink driving can expect to be banned from driving for at least 12 months, receive a fine of up to £5,000 and/or six months in prison.

“When someone dies as a result of a collision involving a drink driver, sentences can carry a penalty of up to 10 years in prison. Don’t risk it, it’s never worth it.”

Dorset Police is launching the campaign in Bournemouth Square today, Friday 1 June, between 10am to 3pm, joined by South West Ambulance Service and Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service.

You can follow the campaign on social media using the hashtag #DontRiskIt.

Martyn Underhill, Dorset Police and Crime Commissioner, said: ‘’This Summer, I would urge every driver to think twice about their ‘choice’ to drive after drinking alcohol. It is just that, ‘a choice’ and one that could ruin lives. It is just safer not to gamble, and have a designated driver, walk or booking a taxi.

“In the recent survey conducted by my office, the people of Dorset gave their overwhelming support to the drink drive limit being lowered, removing the ‘Russian roulette’ concept of drinking ‘just one or two’ before getting behind the wheel.”

If you suspect someone of drink driving, please call police immediately on 999 with the vehicle registration number and direction of travel.
