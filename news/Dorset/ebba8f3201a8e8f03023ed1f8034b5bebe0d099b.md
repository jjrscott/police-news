# Witness appeal after street robbery in Poole

24 March 2017

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses after a street robbery on an elderly woman in Poole.

The incident happened at around 12.45pm today, Friday 24 March 2017, along Station Road in Ashley Cross.

The victim - a woman aged in her 80s - was walking up the road in the direction of Parkstone train station, when she was approached by the offender.

The offender grabbed her handbag, but the victim tried to hold onto it. He then used force to pull the victim to the ground, before taking her purse and running toward the Sandbanks Road area.

The victim suffered cuts and bruises.

The offender is described as a white man, around six feet one inch tall and of slim build. He was wearing a dark hooded top.

Detective Sergeant Andy Haworth, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was a very distressing incident for the victim that occurred in the middle of the day in a very busy area of the town.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or saw a man acting suspiciously in the area around the time of the offence to please contact me.

"I would also ask residents in the area to check their gardens, yards or bins as we believe the offender may have discarded the purse locally. I would ask that anyone who spots such an item does not touch it, but reports it to police immediately."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170043122. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
