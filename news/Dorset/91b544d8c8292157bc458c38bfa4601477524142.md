* * *

Detectives investigating an alleged assault on Portland are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police was called by the ambulance service at around 5.50am on Sunday 7 February 2021 to an address in Castletown following a report a man had sustained head injuries.

It is reported that the victim - a man aged in his 40s - was assaulted earlier that day near to Coronation Road.
The victim sustained serious injuries to his head and face and was taken to hospital for treatment. His condition is not described as life-threatening.

Officers attended and a cordon was put in place on Coronation Road while officers carried out their enquiries.

A 41-year-old man from Portland has been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. He has been released on police bail pending further enquiries.

Detective Constable Dave Pearce, of Weymouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed what may have happened between Castletown and Coronation Road to please get in touch.

"I would like to appeal for residents in that area who have home CCTV systems to please check their footage for anything relevant to assist my enquiries."
