# Update - witness appeal following fatal collision in Weymouth

17 July 2017

* * *

An 89-year-old man being treated for life-threatening injuries following a collision in Weymouth has sadly died.

At around 5.40pm on Thursday 13 July 2017 a serious injury road traffic collision occurred at the junction of Preston Beach Road and Bowleaze Coveway involving a pedestrian and a silver Vauxhall Astra.

The pedestrian - a local 89-year-old man - sustained life-threatening injuries and was taken to Dorset County Hospital where he sadly passed away on Friday 14 July 2017 as a result of his injuries. His family have been informed and the coroner has been notified. Our thoughts are with his family at this difficult time.

The road was closed while emergency services dealt with the incident. It reopened at 9.40pm.

The driver of the car - a 28-year-old man from Weymouth - and his front seat passenger were uninjured.

Police Constable Jay Griffin, of the traffic unit, said: "I am still appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision and has yet to speak to officers to please contact Dorset Police."
