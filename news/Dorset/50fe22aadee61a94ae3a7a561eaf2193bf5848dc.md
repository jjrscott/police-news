02 March 2018

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with an alleged burglary in Bournemouth.

It was reported that between 4.30am and 7.10am on Saturday 29 July 2017 a wallet containing bank cards was stolen from a flat in West Hill Road. A Macbook laptop was also taken.

It is alleged that the victim's bank cards were then used to carry out a number of contactless transactions that morning.

A 22-year-old man, of Bracknell in Berkshire, was arrested in connection with the incident and has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 9 March 2018 for seven offences of fraud by false representation and an offence of handling stolen goods.
