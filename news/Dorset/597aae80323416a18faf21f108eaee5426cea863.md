# Dorset Police response to London attacks

04 June 2017

* * *

On behalf of Dorset Police and Devon and Cornwall Police, Assistant Chief Constable Sharon Taylor said: "As details emerge from this Metropolitan-led investigation, our thoughts are with all those affected from these incidents and to all our colleagues in the emergency services who bravely responded.

"The threat level remains the same at 'severe' and we continue to monitor the intelligence picture and keep all policing under review to ensure the appropriate security is in place.

"I would like to reassure the public that there is no intelligence or information that suggests a specific risk to Dorset, Devon, Cornwall or the Isles of Scilly.

"I would urge people to keep alert but not alarmed and if anyone sees anything suspicious relating to terrorism, they can report this to the Anti-Terrorist Hotline on 0800 789 321 or 999 in an emergency.

"Those who are concerned about loved ones can contact the Casualty Bureau on 0800 0961 233."
