# Witness appeal after reported fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth

01 August 2018

* * *

Officers investigating a reported fail-to-stop road traffic collision in Bournemouth between a pedestrian and a car are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward - with one man being arrested.

Dorset Police was called to the incident in Richmond Park Road at 12.17am this morning, Wednesday 1 August 2018.

The male pedestrian was taken to Southampton hospital with serious leg and head injuries.

A short while later a man came forward and was arrested in relation to the incident.

There are road closures in place at the Bennet Road and the Charminster Road junctions to allow officers to investigate the scene.

Police Sergeant Phil Lee, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing for any witnesses to the collision, who have not yet spoken with officers, to come forward.

"Also I would like to hear from anyone who may have dashcam footage of the incident.

"We are aware that this is a busy road and the closure has a big impact on traffic in the area. However, I would like to ask motorists for their patience while this closure is in place to allow us to deal with the scene safely as we need to conduct a thorough examination of the area."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at scit@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 1:005. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
