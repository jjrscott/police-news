# Insight into policing Weymouth as part of #DorsetPoliceLIVE social media campaign

27 September 2018

* * *

This Saturday from 6pm, Dorset Police will be offering its social media followers a front row seat to a demanding shift in Weymouth, as we share updates on the work of a busy frontline response unit.

The Force is expecting it to be a busy payday weekend, with the updates to social media (on Saturday 29 September 2018) aimed at educating members of the public about the challenges and demands faced by officers in policing a busy seaside town.

You'll be able to follow the work of PC Neil Hawkes and PC Tim Beckwith via the hashtag #DorsetPoliceLIVE on Twitter (@DorsetPolice), Facebook (Dorset Police) and Instagram (Dorset_Police).

Chief Superintendent Mark Callaghan, Head of Territorial Policing, said: "Many people may never come into contact with policing services, but it is important that our residents understand the demands faced by officers across the county.

"Following our success of running the #DorsetPoliceLIVE initiative in Bournemouth a few weeks ago, we received hundreds of positive comments from members of the public, who were keen to learn more about our work and the pressures officers experience, so we have decided to roll the campaign out to Weymouth.

"At a time when we're highlighting the demands we face, we recognise our partners face similar resourcing challenges, so it is important that members of the public consider other ways to contact us for non-urgent enquiries - and ensure they contact the right service to help them particularly over the upcoming busy period. Our website hosts a variety of functions including the ability to report crime, request a call back, provide intelligence or feedback.

"I'm very proud of the work performed by our dedicated officers and staff, and I hope members of the public will find this an interesting insight and I look forward to seeing your feedback on our social media accounts."

Follow updates throughout the night on social media using the hashtag #DorsetPoliceLIVE from 6pm.
