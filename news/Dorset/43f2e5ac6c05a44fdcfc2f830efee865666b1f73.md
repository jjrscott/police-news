# Appeal after alleged assault in Weymouth

16 December 2016

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses after an alleged assault in Weymouth - with one man being arrested.

Police received reports that a man had been assaulted in St Albans Street at around 3.20am on Friday 16 December 2016, following an altercation between a group of people in Actors Bar on New Street.

It is alleged that the victim - a local man aged in his 20s - was punched and hit on the head with a glass bottle during the incident.

The victim suffered a cut to his ear that required stitches and a swollen eye.

A 33-year-old man from Portland has been arrested on suspicion of assault and is on police bail until early February 2017 pending further enquiries.

Detective Constable Lucy Cummings, of Weymouth CID, said: "I believe there was a number of people in the area at the time of the incident and I would appeal for them to come forward.

"Anyone with information that could help with my investigation should contact police or call Crimestoppers anonymously."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55160187812. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
