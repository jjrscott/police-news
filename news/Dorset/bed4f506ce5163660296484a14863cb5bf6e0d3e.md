# Update â€“ cyclist injured after falling from bike in Studland

29 August 2017

* * *

Officers investigating reports that a woman was injured after falling from her bike in Studland have been assisted by witnesses coming forward.

At around 10.40pm on Saturday 12 August 2017 it was reported that a cyclist had fallen off her bike on Ferry Road near to the Knoll House Hotel.

The female cyclist, aged 23, was taken to Southampton General Hospital by the Coastguard helicopter. Her injuries were initially feared to be serious but this later proved not to be the case.

It has now been established that there were no other vehicles involved and the woman fell from her bike following an accidental collision with a pedestrian, who was uninjured.

No further action is being taken.

Police Sergeant Fern Graham, of the traffic unit, said: "I would like to thank the witnesses who came forward in relation to this incident.

"The woman's injuries could have been far more serious if she was not wearing a cycle helmet, which I hope sends an important message to other cyclists using the county's roads."
