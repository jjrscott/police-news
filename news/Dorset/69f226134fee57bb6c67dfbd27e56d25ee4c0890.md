# Appeal after child bitten by dog in Bournemouth

09 March 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for the public's help to identify the owner of a dog that bit a three-year-old girl in Bournemouth.

At 11.20am on Tuesday 18 February 2020 the girl was walking with her mother, brother and a friend on Redhill Common. A woman was walking nearby with five dogs, including two Cocker Spaniels, a brown Labrador, a small white, fluffy dog and a Bulldog-type breed.

The Bulldog ran toward the victim and closed its mouth around her thigh. The girl's mother quickly picked her up before the dog's teeth broke her skin.

The dog walker - a woman described as aged in her 50s with long blonde hair - immediately rushed over, scolded the dog and put it on a lead. She then ran off without apologising before calling the other dogs to her, getting into a white car and driving away.

Police Constable Jennifer Sykes-Martin, of Bournemouth police, said: "The young victim was understandably frightened and upset by this incident.

"As part of my investigation I am appealing to anyone who either witnessed what happened or knows the identity of the dog owner to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200026683. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
