# Witness appeal following reported serious assault in Bournemouth

16 July 2019

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a reported serious assault in Bournemouth.

At 1.02pm yesterday, Monday 15 July 2019, we received a report of two boys aged 16 and 17 who had suffered stab wounds in Boscombe Spa Road.

It was reported that they had been assaulted by male offenders who had made off from the scene.

The victims were treated by the ambulance service and taken to hospital. Their condition is not described as life-threatening.

Officers, including armed officers, attended and carried out searches to identify the suspects.

A 17-year-old boy from London, a 25-year-old man also from London and a 26-year-old man of no fixed abode have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and have been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Detective Sergeant Mark White, of Bournemouth CID, said: "Enquiries are ongoing and a cordon has been put in place at the scene to allow investigations to take place.

"I am appealing to any witnesses who were in the area at the time, and have not yet spoken to police, to come forward.

"There will be an increased police presence in the area while enquiries are ongoing and officers from the local neighbourhood policing team can be approached with any community concerns."
