Police are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward after a fatal road traffic collision in Bournemouth.

Officers were called at 12.54am this morning, Sunday 21 August 2016, to Southbourne Road junction with Parkwood Road following reports of a collision between a blue Honda Jazz and a Polish registered Mercedes minibus. Fire and ambulance also attended.

Sadly one passenger from the minibus - a 31-year-old man from Poland - was pronounced dead at the scene. The next of kin has been informed and the coroner has been notified.

Three other men aged 21, 26 and 54 who were inside the minibus suffered minor injuries and were treated at the scene by paramedics.

The driver of the Honda car - a 44-year-old man from the Bournemouth area - was taken to Bournemouth Hospital with minor injuries.

Two men aged 21 and 26 and both from Poland have been arrested on suspicion of driving offences and are currently assisting officers with enquiries.

A road closure was put in place for several hours to allow collision investigators to examine the scene.

Police Sergeant Mark Scammell, of Dorset Police's Traffic Unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or saw the manner of driving of either vehicle prior to the collision to contact police."
