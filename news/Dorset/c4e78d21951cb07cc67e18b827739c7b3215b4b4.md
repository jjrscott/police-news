# Appeal after woman sustained injuries during incident with dog in Bournemouth

06 October 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for anyone with information to come forward after a woman was injured during an incident with a dog in Bournemouth.

Sometime between 9am and 10am on Saturday 5 September 2020 the victim, who lives locally and is aged in her 80s, was walking along High Howe Lane in the Bearwood area when a woman walked toward her with a young boy aged around three and a dog on a lead.

When they approached, the dog is said to have lunged toward the victim growling and baring its teeth. As she stepped back to get away from the dog, she fell to the ground. The little boy attempted to walk toward the victim, but the woman called him back and walked off.

Two passing motorists stopped to help the victim to her feet and one, a man, kindly took her home.

The victim is still suffering from swelling and pain in her legs.

The dog is described as white with oval medium-sized brown patches, short hair and large. The woman is described as white, aged around 20 years old, around five feet six inches tall, of slim build and with straight shoulder-length hair.

Police Constable Jennie Sykes-Martin, of Dorset Police, said: "This incident has left the victim very shaken and in a lot of pain, even a month later.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or who knows who the dog owner is to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200139892. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
