# Man charged with fraud offence

17 March 2017

* * *

A man has been charged with fraud by false representation in Bournemouth.

It was reported that at around 2pm on Monday 15 August 2016 an elderly man received a phone call from a fraudster purporting to be a police officer from the fraud squad in London. He allegedly told him to withdraw money from his bank to assist with an investigation.

A man is then alleged to have attended the victim's address in Bournemouth claiming to be the fraud squad's courier. It is then reported the victim handed over a quantity of cash.

A 22-year-old from London is due to appear before Poole Magistrates' Court today, Friday 17 March 2017.
