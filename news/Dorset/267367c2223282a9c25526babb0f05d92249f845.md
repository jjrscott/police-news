# A message from T/Assistant Chief Constable Mark Callaghan: Dorset Police show support for UK’s first Race Equality Week

03 February 2021

* * *

**“The UK’s first Race Equality Week began on Monday 1 February, this UK-wide initiative, launched by Race Equality Matters, aims to unite organisations and individuals to address racial inequality affecting members of the workforce who are of a Black, Asian or ethnically diverse background.**

“This important week champions “Silence is no longer an option”, and that only meaningful action will make a difference. We are 100 per cent behind this cause and as a Force we continue to work to stamp out racism, bias and discrimination.

“We understand there is always more that can be done to tackle inequality and facilitate positive change for our communities and for our workforce. The theme for this Race Equality Week is Transparency and action, which play such an important role and influences so much that we do in Dorset Police.

“Never has it been so important for us to tackle racial inequality in our organisation, this past year has highlighted to us that we need to do more. Black Lives Matter, George Floyd, protests and the disproportionate impact of COVID19 has shown us all that racial inequality continues to exist in our communities and we can and must do something to change this.

“We will always act meaningfully and thoroughly to better our organisation and we will never be silent to inequality.”
