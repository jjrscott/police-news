# CCTV appeal following reported assault in Bournemouth

17 March 2021

* * *

Officers are issuing CCTV images of a number of people they would like to speak to as they continue to investigate a reported assault on a foreign language student in Bournemouth.

The victim, aged 17 who was from Germany and living in Poole as part of a foreign exchange, was allegedly assaulted by a group of people in the Lower Gardens at around 7.45pm on Friday 18 December 2020.

He was reportedly punched and kicked several times and stamped on. The victim did not sustain serious injuries.

Following enquiries four teenagers - two boys aged 15 and 16 from Bournemouth, a 17-year-old girl from Bournemouth and a 17-year-old girl from Poole - were arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and have been released under investigation.

An 18-year-old Christchurch man has also attended for a voluntary police interview and has also been released under investigation.

Police Constable Evelyn Hoslett, of Dorset Police, said: "We are continuing to investigate this matter and there are still a number of people we have identified from CCTV enquiries who we are keen to speak to.

"I appreciate this incident was some time ago and some of the images are not great quality, but we owe it to the victim to explore every line of enquiry available to us and I would urge anyone with information as to the identity of any of the individuals pictured to please contact us."
