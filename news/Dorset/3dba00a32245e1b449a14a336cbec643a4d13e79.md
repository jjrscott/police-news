# Witness appeal following road traffic collision in Christchurch

08 September 2016

* * *

Officers investigating a fail-to-stop road traffic collision in Christchurch are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward.

The incident happened just after 1pm today, Thursday 8 September 2016, at the junction of Christchurch Road and Blackwater.

It was reported that a white and blue motorcycle forced an unmarked police motorbike into the pole and barrier of a pedestrian crossing before driving off. The police officer sustained injuries to his arm and leg.

Chief Inspector Ben Hargreaves, of Dorset Police, said: "The police bike was using its blue light at the time of the incident.

"I am appealing for any witnesses to the collision and anyone with information about the rider of the white and blue motorcycle to come forward.

"We believe that the registration of the offending vehicle is similar to E589CGN.

"A number of people were at the pedestrian crossing at the time and I would ask them to contact us as they may have information that could assist with our investigation.

"We would also like to hear from anyone with dashcam footage of the incident."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 8:207. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
