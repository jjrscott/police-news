# Appeal for information following robbery in Bournemouth

25 September 2020

* * *

Detectives investigating a report of robbery in Bournemouth are appealing for any witnesses to come forward and are also trying to trace a potential victim.

Dorset Police received a report from a member of the public at 6.58pm on Thursday 24 September 2020 who stated they had just witnessed a robbery in Bennet Road.

They reported three men had got out of a vehicle and assaulted another man, who was riding a Beryl Bike, before they got back into the vehicle - described as a silver car, possibly a Ford Focus - and drove off in the direction of Richmond Park Road.

The victim did not remain at the scene and cycled off in the direction of Ascham Road.

Detective Sergeant Karen Penn, of Dorset Police's Priority Crime Team, said: "We are making enquiries into this incident and I would urge anyone who witnessed the robbery and has not already spoken to police to please contact us.

"We have also yet to identify the victim. It was reported they may have sustained facial injuries so we are keen to locate them to make sure they are all right and take their account."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200144368. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
