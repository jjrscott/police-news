# Vehicles and property damaged in Weymouth â€“ public appeal

12 October 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a spate of damage to vehicles and a property in Weymouth are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police was called on the morning of Saturday 10 October 2020 to reports that seven vehicles and six front doors had been damaged along Great George Street. The offenders had slashed the tyres of the vehicles and glued the lock of the front doors.

The damage is said to have occurred sometime between 5.30pm on Friday 9 October and 8.30am on Saturday 10 October.

Police Constable Tom Arnold, of Weymouth police, said: "This damage has caused the victims a great deal of expense and inconvenience. Damaging vehicle tyres like this is also extremely reckless. I am aware similar incidents occurred in Westerhall Road in the town and I am keeping an open mind as to whether these are linked.

"I would urge anyone who has any information about these incidents to please come forward.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who may have captured anything on dashcam or home CCTV cameras that may be useful for my investigation.

"Finally, I would ask anyone who experienced similar damage overnight on Friday 9 October and Saturday 10 October and has yet to contact Dorset Police to please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200152591. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
