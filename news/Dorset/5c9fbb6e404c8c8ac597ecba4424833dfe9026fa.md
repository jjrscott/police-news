# Update â€“ man arrested in relation to reported assault in Ferndown

06 September 2018

* * *

A man has been arrested following a photo appeal in relation to an alleged assault in Ferndown.

It was reported that a local woman aged in her 70s was walking her dog along Church Road near to the Village Hall when the incident occurred at around 1.40pm on Tuesday 4 September 2018.

A man riding a bicycle along the footpath said something to her and she challenged him about cycling on the pavement. He then reportedly stopped, got off his bike and shouted at the woman before he pushed her to the chest.

It was alleged that the man then grabbed her by the throat and started pushing her backwards.

Following a photo appeal issued by police, a 34-year-old man from Ferndown has been arrested on suspicion of assault and is assisting officers with their enquiries.
