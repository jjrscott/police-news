# A big thank you to our Special Constables and volunteers

01 June 2020

* * *

Force celebrates Volunteers' Week with a big thank you to its amazing Special Constables and police support volunteers.

Monday 1 June 2020 marks the start of Volunteers' Week and National Specials Weekend.
Dorset Police's 136 police support volunteers cover 42 different roles and have given up over 9,000 hours of their time since April 2019. Our volunteers support our Force in a broad variety of capacities, ranging from animal welfare to neighbourhood engagement and CCTV operatives to victim support.

In the same period, the Force's 126 Special Constables have contributed in excess of 24,000 hours helping tackle crime in their local area, supporting regular officers by going out on patrol and engaging with the communities.

Assistant Chief Constable Julie Fielding said "It is a great privilege to recognise and thank all volunteers for their endless energy and unwavering commitment that they give without any thought of personal recognition.

"I know you will all join me in expressing our gratitude to our volunteers and special constables for their incredible efforts, which help us engage and represent the community that we serve. As a mark of our thanks we would like to encourage you all to 'cheer for our volunteers' on Thursday 4 June in recognition of their continuous support and contributions to the Dorset Police family."

A large part of the work our police support volunteers are involved in is around engaging within the diverse communities making up our county. This includes running our police cadet groups across Dorset. We are currently looking to expand our capability to offer this and as such are looking for more people to take up this responsibility. For more information about becoming a cadet leader please visit the following page. https://www.dorset.pcc.police.uk/get-involved/dorset-police-cadets/.

For more information about joining our Force as a Special Constable and to express an interest ahead of the next campaign please see the following webpage. https://www.dorset.police.uk/recruitment/special-constabulary/.

We are currently taking expressions of interest to join our Force as a police support volunteer once recruitment reopens. Please visit our designated volunteer page for more information. https://www.dorset.police.uk/recruitment/volunteers/.
