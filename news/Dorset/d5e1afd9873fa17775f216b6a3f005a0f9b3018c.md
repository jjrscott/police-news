# Update â€“ man charged in connection with reported theft of handbag in Christchurch

17 August 2018

* * *

A man has been charged in connection with the reported theft of an elderly woman's handbag in Christchurch.

It was reported that at around 4.25pm on Thursday 21 June 2018 a handbag belonging to a local woman aged in her 70s was stolen from her chair as she sat in Christchurch Library on High Street completing a jigsaw.

The bag contained bank cards, keys, a mobile phone, glasses and cash.

The victim's cards were also reportedly used later that same day to carry out two transactions at the BP service station and one at Lidl on Somerford Road.

A 58-year-old Southampton man has been arrested and charged with theft and three counts of fraud by false representation. He is due to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 31 August 2018.
