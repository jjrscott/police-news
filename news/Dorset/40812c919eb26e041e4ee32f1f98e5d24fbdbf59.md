A woman is due to appear in court in connection with the theft of a dog in Bournemouth.

Police issued a CCTV appeal on Thursday 8 December 2016 appealing for anyone with knowledge of the dog's whereabouts to come forward after it was alleged it had been stolen on 27 November 2016 at around 11.30pm in The Moon in the Square pub on Exeter Road.

Following the appeal officers received a number of responses from the public.

A Cockapoo was found on Friday 9 December 2016 left on its own outside Hamworthy Library on Blandford Road in Poole. The dog had been micro-chipped and was confirmed to be the missing dog called Sophie.

A 53-year-old woman from Poole has received a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 27 October 2017 for an offence of theft.
