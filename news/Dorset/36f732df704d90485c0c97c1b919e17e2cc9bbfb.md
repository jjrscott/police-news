# Witness appeal following road traffic collision in Poole

29 November 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for any witnesses to a road traffic collision in Poole to come forward.

At around 7.10pm on Friday 24 November 2017 a group of motorcyclists was travelling westbound along the Dorset Way when two of them, a blue Suzuki and a blue Yamaha were involved in a collision.

The rider of the Yamaha, a woman aged in her 20s, and a pillion passenger on the Suzuki, a man aged in his 30s, were taken to hospital for treatment for injuries that were serious but not life-changing or life-threatening.

Immediately after the collision involving the motorcyclists, there was also a collision involving a white BMW and a purple Renault Modus at the same location. Both vehicles then pulled over to the side of the road but the driver of the BMW reportedly drove off without exchanging details.

Police Constable Gemma Savage, of Dorset Police, said: "I would ask any witnesses to this collision to contact me and I am particularly keen to speak to the driver or the white BMW and a small blue car, which was travelling directly in front of the motorcyclists and may have information that can assist.

"I would also appeal to anyone with dashcam footage covering the incident to please contact police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170183474. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
