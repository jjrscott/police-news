# Photo appeal following theft of bikes in Ferndown

01 February 2019

* * *

Officers investigating the theft of three mountain bikes in Ferndown are appealing for information and issuing photos of the bikes.

They were stolen from the garage of a home in Bramley Road at around 9.30pm on Wednesday 30 January 2019, with the offender cutting the bike locks before removing them from the property.

The bikes taken were a grey and blue Diamond Back Ranger electric bike, a silver and black Cube 140HPA bike with red writing and yellow wheels and a white Scott Aspect bike with black and red writing.

The total value of the three bikes is more than Â£5,000.

Police Constable Amy Bowkis, of Ferndown police, said: "This must have been very upsetting for the victim to have someone break into their property and steal these three valuable bikes.

"I am appealing for anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area of Bramley Road in Ferndown around the time of the offence to contact us.

"These bikes are quite distinctive and I would also like to hear from anyone who comes across them or sees them being advertised for sale."
