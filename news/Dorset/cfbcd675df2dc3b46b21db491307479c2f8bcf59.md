Detectives investigating an alleged aggravated burglary in Christchurch are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police was called at 2.22am on Saturday 27 June 2020 to a report of a male teenager demanding money on Nelson Drive.

It is reported that a male teenager banged on the door of two properties in the area and threatened the occupants with a knife. A quantity of cash was allegedly taken during the incident.

Officers attended and carried out a search of the area.

A 15-year-old boy from Bournemouth and 19-year-old man from Christchurch have been arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary. They are currently assisting officers with their enquiries.

Detective Inspector Mark Holmes, of Bournemouth CID, said: "A full investigation is underway into the incident and officers have been carrying out a thorough examination of the scene.

"The victims thankfully did not sustain any physical injuries, but were understandably left feeling very shocked.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the incident or seen or heard any suspicious activity in the area at the relevant time to please get in touch.

"Local officers will be patrolling the area and can be approached with any community concerns."
