# Appeal for witnesses after break-ins at building site

07 August 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for any witnesses to come forward after a building site in Weymouth was broken into on two nights in a row.

Police received a report on the morning of Tuesday 1 August 2017 that an industrial unit at Link Park in Chickerell, which is still under construction and around 80 per cent complete, had been broken into on consecutive nights and extensive damage had been caused.

The offenders had got in through the perimeter fencing around the site and caused damage to machinery and tools as well as the walls of the unit, glazing panels, tiles and fittings. Fire extinguishers were also let off and paint tins were opened and the contents thrown around.

Some of the damage was believed to have been caused on the night of Sunday 30 July 2017 but the majority occurred on the night of Monday 31 July 2017.

While the full extent of the damage is yet to be established, it is estimated that the clear-up and repair operation alone is likely to cost the building firm several thousand pounds.

Security has since been increased on the site and officers have been making a number of enquiries, including visiting local businesses, as part of their investigations.

Police Constable Ryan Lloyd, of Weymouth police, said: "These mindless acts of vandalism will cost the firm involved a considerable amount of money and caused a major inconvenience.

"I would urge any witnesses to the incident, or anyone who has seen any suspicious activity around the site on the nights in question, to please contact me."
