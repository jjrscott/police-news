Police in Lyme Regis are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an assault at a pub in the town.

Just before midnight on Saturday 4 June 2016 an assault took place in the beer garden of the Royal Standard Public House in Marine Parade.

A 22-year-old local woman was punched in the face by a man. She went to hospital the following day when it was discovered she had sustained a broken nose.

The victim and offender were known to each other.

Police Constable Simon Anderson, of Bridport police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the pub at the time and witnessed the incident, or has any information that may assist me with my investigation, to please contact Dorset Police."

No arrests have been made.

Witnesses and anyone with information should call Dorset Police in confidence on 101, quoting incident number 5:140. Alternatively, call the free and anonymous Crimestoppers line on 0800 555 111, where mobile phone tariffs may apply.
