# Witness appeal following burglaries in Bournemouth

22 September 2020

* * *

Detectives investigating a series of burglaries in the Talbot Wood area of Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Four break-ins were reported to have occurred at addresses on Dulsie Road, Alyth Road and Roslin Road South between Wednesday 16 September and Monday 21 September 2020.

Some of the stolen items include cash, jewellery and watches.

It is reported that on each occasion the occupants of the properties may have previously been visited by male cold callers.

Two of the men are described as white, aged between 30 and 60 years old and of stocky build.

A third man is described as white with pale skin, aged in his 30s, approximately five feet ten inches tall and of skinny build. He was wearing a black baseball cap, dark skinny jeans, a dark-coloured shiny windbreaker jacket, a disposable blue face covering, black leather gloves and Nike VaporMax trainers.

Detective Sergeant Karen Penn, of Dorset Police's Priority Crime Team, said: "I would like to reassure residents that a thorough investigation is underway into each of these reported burglaries.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have seen any suspicious activity in the area over the past week or who may have captured relevant dashcam or home CCTV footage to please get in touch.

"I would also urge anyone else in the Talbot Wood area who has been approached by cold callers matching the description given to please contact Dorset Police as you may have important information to assist my enquiries."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 22:147. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
