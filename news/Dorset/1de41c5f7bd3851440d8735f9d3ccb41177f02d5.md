# The routes you can take to become a Police Officer are changing

01 November 2019

On Monday 30 September, Dorset Police welcomed the first wave of entrants via the Police Constable Degree Apprenticeship (PCDA). The introduction of the PCDA provides a new entry route for those who wish to join Dorset Police as a Police Officer but are not in possession of a degree-level qualification. After approximately 34 weeks of initial training and 1 to 1 tutoring these new recruits will reach independent patrol status. They will then go on to complete on the job learning leading to a degree in Professional Policing Practice at the end of the 3 years. We've worked in partnership with the University of South Wales to develop and deliver the course which is accredited by the College of Policing. The university fees will be paid for by the Force and trainees will be paid Police Officers from day one. The scheme is open to anyone between the ages of 18 and 55 and welcomes applicants from a broad range of backgrounds. ACC Julie Fielding said "I am delighted to welcome the first ever Dorset Police degree apprentices to join the Dorset Police Family. "The Police Constable Degree Apprenticeship is the perfect opportunity to 'earn while you learn', and will give you all of the tools to deal with increasingly sophisticated criminal activity. "We are looking for a broad range of people, who can make a real difference to the diverse communities we serve in Dorset, and become positive role models in our society. Creating a diverse and inclusive workforce is vital to meet our policing vision for the future. As policing grows more complex and demands on our services increase we need people with the right skills and experiences to meet these challenging requirements. We strive to create this environment where everyone is valued for their unique contribution. "Policing is a highly rewarding career and this is a fantastic opportunity to pursue a varied role while simultaneously being trained and supported to gain a recognised qualification" Professor Peter Vaughan, Director of Strategic Projects: Policing and Security at the University of South Wales, said: "It's great to welcome the first group of officers into Dorset Police, who will be completing the Police Constable Degree Apprenticeship with us. The degree will be delivered locally by experienced professionals in partnership with the police force. We are working together to enhance the various entry options available into the police, in line with the Policing Education Qualification Framework. "This is one of five police forces that we are working with across England and Wales, in partnership with the College of Policing. As a former Chief Constable myself, I believe this new offer will help to further professionalise the police service and we are looking forward to working together over the next few years."
