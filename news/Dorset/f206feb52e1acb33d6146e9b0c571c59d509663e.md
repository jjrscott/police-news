Detectives are appealing for witnesses after a robbery at a Bournemouth petrol station.

The incident happened at 11.25pm yesterday, Monday 13 March 2017, at the Esso Service Station on Charminster Road when two men - one armed with a claw hammer and another with a knife - entered the rear of the store and threatened a member of staff while making demands for money.

The member of staff sustained injuries to his chest, back and armpit during the incident. He was taken to hospital for treatment. His condition is not life-threatening.

A small quantity of cash was taken.

The first offender wore a black shiny quilted jacket and black jogging bottoms. The second offender wore a waterproof jacket with grey across the shoulders and grey arms down to the sleeves and smart shoes.

A search of the area was carried out following the incident. No arrests have been made.
