A man is due to appear in court in connection with an alleged shoplifting incident in Broadstone.

On Thursday 21 March 2019 it is reported a man entered Marks and Spencer Food in Lower Blandford Road on three occasions between 5.15pm and 5.42pm and selected bottles of Champagne to the total value of £362\. It is alleged he left the store without any attempts to pay.

A CCTV appeal was issued by officers in April.

A 52-year-old man from Poole has been issued with a postal requisition for an offence of theft and is due to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 25 June 2019.
