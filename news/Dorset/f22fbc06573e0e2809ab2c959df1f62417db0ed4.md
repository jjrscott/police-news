# Witness appeal following fatal collision in Weymouth

23 August 2018

* * *

Officers investigating a fatal collision in Weymouth are appealing for any witnesses to come forward.

At 10.05am yesterday, Wednesday 22 August 2018, Dorset Police received a report of a collision involving a red Citroen C4 Picasso and a pedestrian outside Weymouth Community Hospital in Melcombe Avenue.

The pedestrian, an 89-year-old local woman, was treated for injuries that were initially not believed to be life-threatening and was taken to Dorset County Hospital. However, very sadly her condition deteriorated and she died late yesterday afternoon. Her family have been informed and are being supported by specially-trained officers.

The driver of the Citroen, a 48-year-old woman from Lincolnshire, and her passenger were uninjured.

Inspector Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "We are very sad to learn the pedestrian involved in this collision has died and our thoughts are with her family.

"We are carrying out a thorough investigation into this incident and I would ask for any witnesses who have not already spoken to police to contact us.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who may have captured the incident on dashcam."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at scit@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180135636. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
