Detectives are appealing for witnesses after a man was assaulted at an event in Poole.

The incident occurred at around midnight between Friday 7 July and Saturday 8 July 2017 at the Sand Polo event on Sandbanks beach.

The victim - a 19-year-old Bournemouth man - was in the Coco Loco tent bar when a fight broke out near to where he was standing.

As the victim tried to move out of the way he was hit in the face, resulting in a broken jaw. He attended Poole Hospital where he underwent surgery to have a metal plate fitted.

He reported the incident to Dorset Police on Saturday 15 July 2017.

Detectives have been making a number of enquiries since the report, including checking for the availability of CCTV, and are now appealing for witnesses to the incident to come forward.

Detective Sergeant Andy Haworth, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was a very busy event with a large number of people in the area at the time and therefore I want to speak to anyone who has information about the assault or who can provide an account about what happened.

"If you do have any details that could assist with the investigation please contact Dorset Police. You can also report it to Crimestoppers anonymously."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170107994. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
