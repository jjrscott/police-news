Detectives investigating reported assaults on police officers in Weymouth town centre are appealing for any witnesses to come forward.

At around 4pm on Sunday 23 June 2019 Dorset Police received a report of a man attempting to gain access to an address on The Esplanade.

Officers attended and the man was located in the vicinity. As officers went to detain him it is reported that he assaulted two of them. Both officers suffered bruising and swelling as a result of the alleged assault.

A 27-year-old Portland man was arrested and has been charged with two offences of assaulting an emergency worker. He is due to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court today, Tuesday 25 June 2019.

Detective Sergeant Andy Marsh, of Weymouth CID, said: "We are continuing to make enquiries into this incident and I understand there were a number of people in the area at the time.

"I would urge any witnesses who have not already spoken to police to please contact us. I would also be keen to hear from anyone who may have dashcam or mobile phone footage of the incident."

Inspector Barry Gosling, of Weymouth police, said the officers involved had been patrolling the town centre as part of the local neighbourhood policing team's 100 Days of Summer campaign.

These patrols will continue and local officers can be approached by members of the community with any concerns.
