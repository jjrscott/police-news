# Witness appeal following serious assault in Weymouth

28 December 2018

* * *

Officers investigating a serious assault in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 2am on Christmas Day, Tuesday 25 December 2018, a man aged in his 50s was walking on Dorchester Road between the Marks and Spencer garage and the Manor Roundabout when he was almost involved in a collision with a grey or silver car that did not have its headlights on.

The pedestrian gestured at the vehicle and a few minutes later when he was walking up the road he was assaulted from behind with a blunt weapon. He suffered lacerations to his head as well as bruising and swelling and was taken to hospital for treatment.

The male offender is described as white, aged in his late teens or early 20s and was wearing a hooded top, which was possibly light grey in colour.

Investigations officer Adam Carter, of Weymouth CID, said: "This was a violent assault and we believe it may be linked to the victim's encounter with the vehicle shortly before.

"We are carrying out a detailed investigation into this incident and I am appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information to contact us.

"I would also urge anyone who may have been driving in the area at the relevant time and has dashcam fitted to their vehicle to check their footage."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180205917. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
