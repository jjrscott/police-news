Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a man aged in his 80s was assaulted in Dorchester.

At around 7.25pm yesterday, Thursday 4 January 2018, the victim was in St John Way near to Poundbury playing fields when he was hit on the head by an unknown hard object. He sustained a small cut on his left temple.

The victim did not see the offenders but he did witness two people running away shortly after the incident.

Police Constable Hayley Brown, of Dorchester police, said: "This was an unprovoked assault and it is fortunate that the victim did not sustain more serious injuries.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident, or who may know the individuals responsible, to please contact Dorset Police."
