Police are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward after breaks at two beach huts in Weymouth.

At 8.41am on Saturday 14 May 2016, a member of public contacted Dorset Police to report that two beach huts had been broken into at Greenhill.
The doors of one beach hut had been ripped off and another had been broken into and some contents was damaged.

It is reported that six young adults were seen to leave one of the beach huts and walk along The Esplanade toward the town centre.

One man was wearing a white hooded top and a second was wearing a grey hooded top and was carrying a black and grey backpack with a reflector on it.

A woman was wearing a green Parka-style coat with blue jeans, white trainers and a yellow backpack. The remaining three people were all wearing dark clothing.

Police Constable Shane How, of Weymouth police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area of the Greenhill beach huts on that morning to please call me.

"I am especially keen to hear from anyone who saw a group of six young adults at the relevant time as they might be able to assist with my investigation."

**Witnesses and anyone with information should call Dorset Police in confidence on 101 quoting incident number 14:105. Alternatively, call the free and anonymous Crimestoppers line on 0800 555 111 where mobile phone tariffs may apply.
