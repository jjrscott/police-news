# Appeal following rogue trader incident near Wareham

07 June 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after an elderly man was conned into paying for work he had not requested.

At around 10am on Monday 3 June 2019 two men arrived at an address in Keysworth Drive in Sandford and began trimming the hedge.

They had not asked for permission so the victim - aged in his 80s - challenged them. The offenders convinced the victim to allow the work to continue.

After 45 minutes the men told the victim he owed £340 for the work. The victim only had £320 so he handed this over and the pair left.

One of the offenders is described as white, approximately five feet eight inches tall, aged in his 30s, of stocky build and with short dark hair. He was unshaven and had a tanned complexion.

The offenders were travelling in a white flatbed-type van with green writing on the side.

Police Constable Dan Lander, of Purbeck police, said: "This appears to be a targeted incident toward an elderly resident, which has left him feeling extremely frightened and vulnerable in his own home. I would like to reassure him and members of the community that we are carrying out a full investigation to identify the offenders.

"I am appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information that could assist our investigation to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk, or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190085033. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
