# Witness appeal following robbery in Bournemouth

03 October 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a robbery in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The incident happened at 3.30pm on Wednesday 30 September 2020 on a footpath leading from Richmond Park Road to Avon Road, where a man approached the victim, a 56-year-old local man, engaging him in conversation before threatening him and demanding money.

The offender indicated that he had a knife, but did not show it to the victim. He stole Â£20 from the victim and a Beryl bike before making off in the direction of Holdenhurst Road.

The offender has been described as white, aged in his late 20s to early 30s, five feet six inches tall and of lean build. He had short dark hair and was clean shaven. He was wearing a dark blue zipped-up hooded top, dark blue jeans and possibly dark coloured trainers. He was carrying a carrier bag that had a pair of blue and white trainers inside, which he had offered the victim for sale before making threats.

Police Constable Karl Moores, of Bournemouth Police, said: "I have made a number of enquiries into the incident, but have so far been unable to identify the offender.

"I am hoping that somebody witnessed the incident, saw the offender leaving the area or has any information about him."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200147327. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
