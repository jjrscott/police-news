# Witness appeal following reported assault in Weymouth

03 September 2020

* * *

Officers investigating an alleged assault in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 2pm on Tuesday 1 September 2020 it is reported that a woman was standing outside of her vehicle that was parked on Frederick Place when she was approached by two men.

It is alleged that one of the men grabbed her arm and shouted abuse toward the victim, as well as a man that she was with at the time of the incident.

The second man reportedly punched the driver's side window of the car, but it did not break.

Following enquiries, a 30-year-old local man was arrested on suspicion of assault and using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause fear of or provoke unlawful violence. He has been released on police bail pending further enquiries.

A 31-year-old man from Weymouth attended for a voluntary interview.

The victim and arrested man are known to each other.

Detective Constable Siobhan Lovering, of Weymouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the area and may have witnessed the incident to please get in touch.

"I am particularly keen to hear from a woman who crossed the road near to where the incident occurred wearing a baseball cap as she may have important information to assist my investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200131124. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
