Detectives working with the fire service to investigate a large forest fire near Wareham have confirmed that the cause of the fire is not believed to be malicious.

Dorset Police received a report from the fire service at 1.11pm on Monday 18 May 2020 in relation to a large forest fire in the area of Sugar Hill.

Officers attended to assist and put road closures in place. The fire caused damage to around 150 hectares of forest and heathland

Fire crews remain on the scene monitoring the situation and road closures continue to be in place along Bere Road and Sugar Hill.

An appeal was issued for anyone with information in relation to how the fire started or anyone with dashcam footage from the area on the morning of Monday 18 May 2020 to come forward.

Detective Inspector Scott Johnson, of Weymouth CID, said: "We have received a number of responses to the appeal and I would like to thank everyone who has come forward with information to assist our investigation in relation to this incident.

"After conducting a number of enquiries and liaising with the fire service, we can confirm that there is no information to indicate that the cause of the fire is deliberate or suspicious. Investigation work continues to establish the exact cause but it is believed to be accidental.

"I would like to stress again our thanks to the firefighters and all those supporting the multi-agency response to this incident in recent days for their tireless efforts to tackle the fire and protect members of the public.
