Officers investigating a serious injury collision in Lyme Regis are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

At 8.50am on Friday 28 August 2020 a report was received of a collision involving a blue Ford Fiesta and a pedestrian on Kings Way.

Officers attended the scene, along with the ambulance service.

The pedestrian - a man aged in his 40s - sustained serious injuries and was taken to hospital for treatment. His condition is not life-threatening.

The road was closed to allow for an examination of the scene to be carried out.

"I would like to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the collision and has not already spoken to police.

"I am also appealing for any motorists who were in the area and may have captured the incident on dashcam footage to please get in touch."
