# 'Legal high' warning after boy found unconscious in Poole

16 May 2016

* * *

Police are warning the public of the dangers of a drug called 'Spice' after a 15-year-old boy was found unconscious in Poole.

Officers were called to the High Street at around 7.10pm on Saturday 14 May 2016 to reports that a boy had stopped breathing.

The boy was taken to hospital and has since been discharged.

It is believed the boy had taken a drug known as 'Spice', a New Psychoactive Substance.

A blanket ban on the sale of psychoactive substances will come into force on Thursday 26 May 2016, outlawing the trade in so-called 'legal highs'.

Detective Inspector Garry Knight, of Bournemouth CID, said: "It is suspected that the drug may have been supplied to the boy and his friend by a man in Poole town centre, but ongoing enquiries have not yet identified him. Anyone who has information should contact police on 101.

"This incident highlights that individuals taking such drugs could be putting their health and even their life in danger.

"Just because something sold in shops or on the internet is described as 'legal', it does not mean it really is legal or safe. The drug may contain other illegal substances or uncontrolled substances with unknown or unpredictable side-effects.

"I would strongly advise those thinking of taking 'Spice' or any other psychoactive substance to think again. You can't be sure what you're taking, and the side-effects are unpredictable and potentially nasty."

Dorset Police works alongside Trading Standards to disrupt the supply of psychoactive substances.

Where Trading Standards are made aware of the sale of 'legal highs', they will take action to prevent the supply of unsafe products.

If anyone has any information with regard to the sale of New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) or 'legal highs' please do not hesitate to report it to Trading Standards on 03454 040506.
