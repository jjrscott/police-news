# Investigation launched following the death of a man in Bournemouth

16 September 2020

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with the death of a man following an alleged serious assault in Bournemouth.

At around 10pm on Sunday 13 September 2020 officers received a report of an assault at the entrance to The Avenue car park at the junction of Avenue Road and Norwich Avenue.

A local man - named by detectives as 59-year-old Stephen Jeffries - sustained a serious head injury and was taken to hospital for treatment.

Very sadly, Mr Jeffries died in hospital on Tuesday 15 September 2020. His next of kin has been informed and the coroner has been notified.

Following enquiries, 32-year-old Carl Stuart Woolley, of no fixed abode, was arrested and he has now been charged with murder. He is due to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 16 September 2020.

Detective Chief Inspector Jez Noyce, of the Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT), said: "Our thoughts are with the family of Stephen Jeffries and a detailed investigation is underway to establish what happened on the night of the incident.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the area and may have important information to assist my investigation to please get in touch.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who was driving in the area and has dashcam fitted to their vehicle to please check it for any relevant footage."
