# Witness appeal following assault in Bournemouth

07 July 2020

* * *

Detectives investigating an assault in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 8.10pm on Saturday 4 July 2020 the victim - a man aged in his 20s - was walking along Meyrick Road with another man when an altercation occurred involving a group of teenagers.

During the incident the victim was punched, causing him to fall to the ground. He was initially taken to hospital by the ambulance service but discharged as his injuries were not thought to be serious.

The following day the victim became unwell and went to hospital. It was established that he sustained a bleed on the brain that required surgery. His injuries are not described as life-threatening.

The group are described as white teenagers, two male and one female, aged between 15 and 17 years old. The two male teenagers were wearing dark-coloured clothing, with one of them wearing a black top with a white design on the front. The female is described as having long blonde hair and was wearing a red Puffa-style jacket with two distinctive white lines on the back in a 'V' shape.

Detective Constable Frances Howard, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This incident left the victim with significant serious injuries and an investigation is underway to identify those responsible.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the assault to please get in touch.

"I would also urge any member of the public who may have information to help identify the offenders to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200096938. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
