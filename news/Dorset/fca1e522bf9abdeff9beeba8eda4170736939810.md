# Update â€“ arrests following reported commercial burglaries in Weymouth

13 April 2018

* * *

A man and a woman have been arrested in connection with reported break-ins at two commercial premises in Weymouth.

Dorset Police received a report at around 7.30pm on Sunday 11 March 2018 of a break-in at the Fun Factory on the Granby Industrial Estate.

It is alleged that entry was gained to the premises by the offenders smashing the reception window, activating an alarm. An untidy search was reportedly carried out inside and damage was caused to a till and lollypop machine.

It was also reported that at around 8.25pm on the same day entry was forced to Wessex Locksmiths in Abbotsbury Road, with the front door smashed. Nothing was taken from the premises.

Following investigations by officers, a 30-year-old Weymouth man and a 21-year-old woman from Dorchester have been arrested on suspicion of burglary. They have both been released under investigation as police enquiries continue.

Anyone with information about the incidents is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180037013. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
