# Appeal for information following bike theft in Poole

18 December 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following the theft of a bicycle in Poole.

The white Raleigh bicycle, with a black metal basket, had been secured to a bike rack by the walkway from Falkland Square to the train station before it was taken some time between around 6.30pm and 8pm on Monday 16 December 2019.

Sergeant Phil Lee, of Poole police, said: "This bike was of great sentimental value to the victim as it was a gift from her late husband and we are extremely keen to recover it for her.

"I would urge anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area at the time of the theft or who has come across a bike matching the description given to please contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190197470. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
