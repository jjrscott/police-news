# CCTV appeal following fraudulent use of bank card in Bournemouth

06 January 2021

Officers investigating the fraudulent use of a bank card in Bournemouth are issuing a CCTV image of the suspect.

At 1.37pm on Thursday 24 December 2020 the victim used his bank card at Tesco Express on Charminster Road, but had failed to collect his card from the machine.

At approximately 2pm the same day the card was used to make contactless payments by an unknown man on four occasions at local stores.

Police Sergeant Gareth Bridger, of Dorset Police, said: "As part of our enquiries we have obtained a CCTV image of the suspect and I would ask anyone who recognises him to please contact Dorset Police."
