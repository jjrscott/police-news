A man involved in a serious road traffic collision in Bournemouth has sadly died from his injuries.

Dorset Police was called at 8.36am on Sunday 26 May 2019 to reports of a collision in West Cliff Road.

It was reported that a green Volkswagen Sharan collided with a blue Yamaha motorcycle and the motorcycle then collided with a green Peugeot 307.

The motorcyclist, a 54-year-old man from Bournemouth, was taken to hospital with critical injuries. Very sadly, he passed away in hospital yesterday, Sunday 14 July 2019. His family are aware and are being supported by specially-trained officers.

A 25-year-old man from Nuneaton in Warwickshire was arrested on suspicion of driving offences and has been released under investigation as officers continue to make enquiries into the collision.

Police Sergeant Nikki Burt, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the family at this difficult time.

"We are continuing to investigate this collision to establish the full circumstances of what happened and I would appeal to any witnesses, or anyone with dashcam footage, who have not already spoken to police to please come forward."
