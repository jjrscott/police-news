Five men arrested in connection with reported shots fired in Bournemouth have been released under investigation.

At 12.30am on Sunday 20 August 2017 Dorset Police received a report that two men attended a property on Wimborne Road and woke up the occupants by throwing stones at the window. When the occupants got up to look, it was then reported that gun shots were fired at a window.

The men were then reported to have left the scene in a car. No one was injured.

Officers attended and carried out a search of the area, assisted by the NPAS helicopter.

Two men aged 24, two men aged 22 and a 23-year-old man, all from the Liverpool area, have been arrested on suspicion of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life. One of the 24-year-old men was further arrested on suspicion of threats to kill. All five men have now been released under investigation.

Detective Inspector Kate Lill, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am still appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident, or who has any information which may help me with my investigation, to please get in touch immediately."
