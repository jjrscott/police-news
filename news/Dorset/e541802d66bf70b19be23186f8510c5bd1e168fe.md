09 December 2016

* * *

A woman is due to appear in court this month charged with a drink driving offence as part of Dorset Police's Christmas drink and drug drive campaign.

The 57-year-old of Blandford has been charged with driving a motor vehicle when alcohol level above limit and is due to appear before Weymouth Magistrates' Court on 23 December 2016.

A total of seven people have been charged with drink or drug driving-related offences since the campaign - which runs between Thursday 1 December 2016 and Sunday 1 January 2017 - began.

You can follow Dorset Police's Christmas campaign on social media. Together, let's get Christmas safety #AllWrappedUp.
