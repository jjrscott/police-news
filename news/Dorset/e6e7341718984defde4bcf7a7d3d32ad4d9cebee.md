It was reported that access had been gained to a safe and a quantity of cash had been stolen.

Police Constable Billy Forster, of Dorset Police, said: "We are continuing to make enquiries into this burglary and we have obtained CCTV images of the suspect.

"His clothing is particularly distinctive and I would urge anyone with information regarding his identity to please contact us."
