A man is due to appear in court in connection with a serious injury road traffic collision near Bridport.

A collision occurred at around 9.40am on Sunday 15 November 2020 on the B3157 Coast Road, near to the junction of Cogden Beach car park. It involved a Citroen Berlingo and a Ford Focus.

A passenger in the Citroen, a woman aged in her 70s, and the two occupants of the Ford - both Weymouth women aged in their 20s - were taken to hospital with serious injuries. The driver of the Citroen was also treated for minor injuries.

Following enquiries, a 70-year-old man from Axminster has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 16 February 2021 for an offence of driving without due care and attention.
