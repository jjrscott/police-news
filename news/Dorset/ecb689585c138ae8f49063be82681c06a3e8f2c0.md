# Wife sadly dies after collision in Blandford

07 April 2017

* * *

A motorcycle passenger being treated for serious injuries following a collision in Blandford, which claimed the life of her husband, has sadly died.

Barbara Samways, aged 71 and of Blandford, was travelling as a pillion passenger alongside her husband Sid on their black Kawazaki motorcycle, when the pair were involved in a collision along Shaftesbury Road near Compton Abbas airfield.

The incident happened at around 3.40pm on Sunday 2 April 2017 between the motorcycle and a green Ford Escort being driven by a 24-year-old man from the Shaftesbury area.

Sadly 74-year-old motorcycle rider Sid was pronounced dead at the scene. Barbara was airlifted to Southampton General Hospital with serious injuries.

In a statement, Sid and Barbara's family said: "After a very short but brave battle, we are devastated to say that Barbara died at Southampton General Hospital as a result of her injuries.

"To lose both Sid and Barbara is heartbreaking. We wish to give our thanks for all the expressions of sympathy and kindness we have been shown. We would ask that our previous request for complete privacy continues while we come to terms with what has happened."

Traffic officers are appealing for any witnesses to the incident or manner of driving of either vehicle prior to the collision to contact police.

A 24-year-old man from the Shaftesbury area arrested on suspicion of driving offences is currently on police bail until the end of June 2017 pending further enquiries.
