* * *

Detectives investigating a serious assault on a man in Weymouth have made two further arrests.

Dorset Police was called at 10.31am on Saturday 4 August 2018 to a report that a man had been assaulted at an address in Bath Street in Weymouth and the offenders had left the scene.

The victim - a local man aged in his 40s - was taken to hospital for treatment to a stab wound. His injury is not life-threatening and he has since been released from hospital.

Officers attended and a search of the area was carried out, involving armed officers and the NPAS helicopter. A 16-year-old boy from London, a 20-year-old man of no fixed abode and a 21-year-old man from Hayes in Middlesex were arrested a short time later on suspicion of wounding with intent and were released under investigation.

Two teenage boys aged 16 and 17 and both from London have subsequently been arrested on suspicion of wounding with intent. The 17-year-old has been released on police bail and the 16-year-old has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

The injured man and arrested men are known to each other.

Detective Inspector Nicky Jenkins, of Weymouth CID, said: "We are conducting a full investigation into this incident and as a result we have arrested five people in total.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have seen or heard anything in the Bath Street area at the relevant time to please contact Dorset Police."

Weymouth and Portland Neighbourhood Inspector Steve Yeoman, said: "A detailed investigation is underway into the incident, led by detectives in Weymouth CID.

"We fully understand the concern in the community due to the large police presence in the area at the time, which was entirely necessary to investigate what occurred.

"I'd like to praise our officers for their swift and professional response.

"We are very grateful for the public's support and those who have assisted with the police investigation and I would ask anyone who has any information about the incident to contact Dorset Police.
