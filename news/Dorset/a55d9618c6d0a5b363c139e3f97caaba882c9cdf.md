Detectives investigating a reported assault in Bournemouth town centre are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 11.40pm on Friday 7 February 2020 it is reported that two teenage girls approached three women on a bridge in the Lower Gardens and alleged they had been threatened by another teenage girl with a knife. It is also reported one of the girls was assaulted.

Following searches by officers, a 16-year-old girl from Bournemouth has been arrested on suspicion of an assault and possession of a knife in a public place. She is currently assisting detectives with their enquiries.

Detective Constable Eleanor Jones, of Bournemouth CID, said: "A full and thorough investigation is underway.

I am appealing directly to them to please make contact with detectives as they may have vital information to assist my investigation.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time and may have witnessed the incident."
