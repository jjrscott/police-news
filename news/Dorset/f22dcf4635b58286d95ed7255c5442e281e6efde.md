# Witness appeal following fatal road traffic collision in Highcliffe

10 July 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam to come forward as they investigate a fatal road traffic collision in Highcliffe.

Dorset Police received a report at 10.26am on Friday 10 July 2020 of a collision on Wharncliffe Road, near to the junction with Lymington Road, involving a red Honda Jazz and a pedestrian.

Officers attended, along with the ambulance service, and the pedestrian - a 73-year woman from the local area - was taken to Southampton General Hospital, but has sadly died from her injuries.

Road closures were put in place to allow the emergency services to respond to the incident and were lifted at 4.10pm.

Sergeant Craig Tatton, of the traffic unit, said: "All our thoughts are with the friends and family of the lady. We will continue to make enquiries to establish the full circumstances of this collision and I would urge anyone who witnessed the incident and has not already spoken to police to please contact us.

"Also, I would like to hear from anyone who may have captured anything relevant on dashcam footage.

"I would like to thank motorists and members of the public for their patience and understanding while the road closures were in place."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 10:133. Alternatively, or alternatively to stay 100% anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
