# Witness appeal following reported assault in Poole

11 March 2020

* * *

Officers investigating an alleged assault in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 12pm on Wednesday 11 March 2020 it was reported that a man and woman entered Sainsbury's on Pitwines Close, attempted to take three bottles of whisky from the store and leave without paying. The man allegedly struck a security guard over the head with one of the bottles after being challenged by him.

The man and woman then reportedly proceeded to hit and kick the victim, with the man also producing a knife and attempting to stab the victim, but was restrained by the woman.

The victim sustained injuries and attended hospital for treatment.

Following enquiries, a 25-year-old woman and a 26-year-old man, both from Poole, were arrested on suspicion of assault. The man has also been arrested on suspicion of theft and possession of an offensive weapon in a public place. They are currently assisting officers with their enquiries.

Police Constable Hannah Gryba, of Poole police, said: "A full and thorough investigation is underway and I am keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed what happened."
