# Dog found following CCTV appeal

09 December 2016

* * *

Officers in Bournemouth investigating the theft of a dog are delighted to report it has been found safe and well.

Police issued a CCTV appeal yesterday, Thursday 8 December 2016, appealing for anyone with knowledge of the dog's whereabouts to come forward after it had been stolen on 27 November 2016 at around 11.30pm in The Moon in the Square pub on Exeter Road.

Following the appeal officers received a number of leads from the public.

A Cockapoo was found this afternoon left on its own outside Hamworthy Library on Blandford Road in Poole. The dog had been micro-chipped and was confirmed to be missing dog Sophie.

No arrests have been made, however enquiries are continuing.

Police Constable Steve Lea, of Bournemouth police, said: "I would like to pass on my thanks, along with those of the owner, to everyone who has contacted us about this case.

"The public's response to my appeal has been overwhelming and all the help we have received is very much appreciated.

"Without the public's help it would not have been possible to reunite the dog with its owner.

"It's great to know that Sophie will be spending Christmas at home with her family."
