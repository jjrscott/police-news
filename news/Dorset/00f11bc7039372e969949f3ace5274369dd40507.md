# Court update - serious collision near Weymouth

26 October 2018

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with a serious road traffic collision on the A354 Weymouth relief road.

At around 9.08am on Wednesday 24 January 2018 a collision occurred at the top of the Ridgeway involving a white Ford Transit van and a blue Vauxhall Zafira.

The driver of the Zafira - a 36-year-old woman from Weymouth - suffered minor injuries. She was taken to hospital as a precaution and was later discharged. A 54-year-old Weymouth woman - who was the front seat passenger - suffered serious injuries. The rear seat passenger - a 55-year-old man from Weymouth - also sustained very serious injuries.

The driver of the Transit van - a 29-year-old man from Bournemouth - was taken to Dorset County Hospital as a precaution.

A 30-year-old man from Bournemouth has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Monday 29 October 2018 for two counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.
