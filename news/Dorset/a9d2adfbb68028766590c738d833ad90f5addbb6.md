# Long term partnership project to improve services for rape and serious sexual assault victims

05 February 2021

* * *

This week organisations across the country have been raising awareness of sexual abuse and sexual violence and the services that exist to help victims come forward and get help. The national campaign has the hashtag #ItsNotOK Dorset Police is also taking the opportunity to highlight a long-term partnership project aimed at improving services offered to those who report rape and other serious sexual assaults. Developed in partnership with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and neighbouring Hampshire Constabulary and Wiltshire Police, the Wessex Tri-force Action Plan includes the introduction of a range of measures designed to increase victim confidence in the criminal justice system, and to ensure that victims receive the best possible support and care whilst investigations and prosecutions take place. The aim is to improve the outcomes for victims of rape and serious sexual assaults in both in terms of justice and of well-being. Dorset Police's Chief Constable James Vaughan has welcomed this improvement plan. He said: "We appreciate that it can be the hardest thing in the world for someone to come forward and disclose rape, abuse or historic offences. Dorset Police supports victims and works toward the very best outcome for them, but the Action Plan provides an opportunity to work with partners and internally to improve those processes and remove perceived barriers to reporting. "Our aim is to improve the experience for those who engage with the service at every point in their journey through the system, respecting their privacy and safeguarding them from further abuse at every step." Information about the support services for victims of sexual and sexual abuse can be found here: www.dorset.police.uk/rape-sexual-assault
