Officers investigating a fatal road traffic collision in Ferndown are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

At 3.40pm on Tuesday 22 September 2020 Dorset Police received a report of a collision involving a blue Honda Jazz, a black Ford Focus, a blue Citroen C3 and a pedestrian.

The pedestrian, a man aged in his 70s from Bicester in Oxfordshire, sustained serious injuries and was very sadly pronounced dead at the scene. His family has been informed.

The driver of the Citroen, a local man aged in his 70s, was taken to hospital as a precaution.

The occupants of the other vehicles did not sustain any serious injuries.

Road closures were put in place to allow the emergency services to deal with the incident.

Sergeant Mark Scammell, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the family and loved ones of the man who sadly died and we are carrying out a full investigation to establish the circumstances of this collision.

"I would urge any witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage who has not already spoken to police to please contact us.

"I would also like to thank members of the public for their patience and understanding during the road closures, which were put in place to allow the emergency services to respond to this incident and for an examination of the scene to be carried out safely."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 22:285. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
