Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a series of burglaries in the Weymouth and Dorchester area.

The first burglary occurred at around 5.40am on Sunday 25 October 2020 at Broadway Village Stores on Dorchester Road in Weymouth. The offenders gained entry by smashing a glass panel. Nothing was stolen.

At 5.12am on Tuesday 27 October 2020 Dorset Police was alerted to an alarm activation at the Co-op store in Crossways. A quantity of cigarettes was stolen. A Volvo car missing the registration plate was used by the offenders.

The third incident occurred at 4.05am on Wednesday 28 October 2020 when offenders gained entry to Corner House Stores in Broadmayne and stole a quantity of cigarettes and alcohol. A grey Volvo car was used by the offenders to transport the stolen items.

At 6.30am on Wednesday 28 October 2020 officers were called to reports of a car fire involving a grey Volvo with the registration OE55 YYZ in Greenway Road in Weymouth. The car was completely destroyed in the blaze.

Detective Constable Lucy Johnson, of Weymouth CID, said: "I am keen to hear from anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity at the times of these offences.

"I would also ask anyone who was travelling in the area of these incidents or on nearby back roads to check their dashcam footage to see if they may have captured suspicious activity or the grey Volvo. If you find anything that may be relevant please get in touch."
