# Witness appeal following alleged burglary in Dorchester

11 December 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating a reported burglary in Dorchester are appealing for the public's help.

Sometime between midnight and 2.40am on Sunday 3 December 2017 it was reported that a burglary occurred at an address in Prospect Road. Three coats and a shoulder bag were stolen. These items were found discarded nearby but a credit card and small amount of cash was not recovered. The card was allegedly used at a takeaway restaurant at 2.40am the same day.

An 18-year-old man and a 19-year-old woman - both from Weymouth - have been arrested on suspicion of burglary and have been released under investigation.

Detective Constable Siobhan Lovering, of Weymouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who saw suspicious activity in the area of Prospect Road at the relevant time to please contact Dorset Police.

"Following enquiries we have located a CD, sat nav and holder, which we believe were stolen from a car in the Dorchester area sometime between the evening of Saturday 2 December and the morning of Sunday 3 December 2017. I am keen to hear from anyone who had their car broken into and these items stolen as we would like to return them."
