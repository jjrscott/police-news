# Tribute to woman who died in fatal collision in Christchurch

25 March 2019

* * *

The family of a woman who died in a fatal collision in Christchurch has named and paid tribute to her.

Joy Norman, 82 and of Christchurch, died following a road traffic collision on Somerford Road at around 3.15pm on Monday 18 March 2019. The incident happened as she was walking along the pavement and involved a blue Ford Focus. Very sadly, and despite the best efforts of emergency services, Joy died at the scene.

The driver of the Ford, a 54-year-old man from Christchurch, was arrested on suspicion of driving offences. He has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

An inquest into her death was opened today, Monday 25 March 2019. A full inquest will be held at a later date.

In a statement, Joy's family said: "The family of Joy Norman would like to thank the local community for their flowers and tributes, especially those who tried so hard to save her life.

"A big thank you also to the emergency services and the police family support officers who have been there for us during this sad time.

"We miss Joy so much already. She was a loving sister, aunt and friend. Our family get-togethers will never be the same without her sense of fun and slightly fey character.

"Joy cared for children all her working life and for family, friends and neighbours during her retirement.

"She is and will be greatly missed."

Police Constable Jay Griffin, of the Serious Collision investigation Team, said: "An investigation into the collision remains ongoing and I am appealing to any witnesses, who have not already spoken to police, or anyone who may have captured the incident on dashcam to please contact me."
