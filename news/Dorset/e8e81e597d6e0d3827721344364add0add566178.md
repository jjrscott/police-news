# Tributes paid to much-loved serving Dorset Police Constable

Dorset Police Chief Constable James Vaughan is paying tribute to serving Police Constable Mandy Berrystone who has sadly suddenly died.

The ambulance service was called to Mandy's home in Poole on the evening of Wednesday 30 September 2020 following reports of a medical emergency. Mandy, 34, was taken to hospital, but very sadly died a short time later. She had been off work since Thursday 27 August 2020 after sustaining a fracture to her ankle. There is no indication at this time that her death is COVID-19 related. Her death is not being treated as suspicious and the coroner has been informed.

The officer, who was known out of work under her married name of Mandy Fairweather, leaves behind her husband Andrew and two young children - James, six, and nine-year-old Faith.

Chief Constable James Vaughan said: "It is with the greatest of sadness and the heaviest of hearts that I have to inform you of the death of Mandy.

"We are all devastated to have lost a member of our police family. Our thoughts remain with her family, friends and very many colleagues at this extremely difficult time.

"Mandy joined Dorset Police on 20 November 2006 and was a valued member of A squad at Poole patrol. She dedicated almost 14 years to serving the people of Dorset and was a much-loved friend and colleague."

Police Sergeant Suzie Corsie-Mackay, who was Mandy's close friend and sergeant, has said: "Mandy was part of the furniture at Poole having served there since joining the police. She welcomed everyone with open arms and completed all of her work with diligence, charm and a great sense of humour. An all-round top girl who wore her heart on her sleeve and mischievous grin on her face. Nothing was too much trouble for her and she looked after us all.

"She was a fiercely loyal woman who loved her husband and children more than anything in the world. Loved by so many, her northern tenacity and raucous laugh will never ever be forgotten."

Poole and Purbeck Patrol Inspector Jess Pearcey added: "Mandy was a joy to have in the station, she was full of laughter and had an amazing upbeat attitude. She was incredibly welcoming to me when I joined the section and I will always remember her enthusiasm for the job, her team and the section. She will be greatly missed."
