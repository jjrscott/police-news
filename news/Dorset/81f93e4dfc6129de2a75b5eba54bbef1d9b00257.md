# Missing man from Poole - public appeal

21 December 2018

* * *

Officers searching for a missing Poole man are appealing for help from the public to find him.

Mark Keadell, 50 and of Kimmeridge Avenue, was reported missing at 1.38pm on Wednesday 19 December 2018.

Mark is white, five feet seven inches tall and of average to slim build. He has short grey hair and grey blue eyes.

Chief Inspector Steve Yeoman, of Dorset Police, said: "We are becoming increasingly concerned for Mark's welfare as he has not been seen by his family for around a week now, which is unusual and out of character.

"Also, we believe he will not have vital medication with him. Therefore, we need to find him as soon as possible to ensure he is all right."

Anyone with information or knowledge as to Mark's whereabouts is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 19:200.
