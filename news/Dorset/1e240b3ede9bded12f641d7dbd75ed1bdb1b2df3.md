# Witness appeal following suspicious incident in Bournemouth

17 August 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating a suspicious incident in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with any information to come forward.

At 5.20pm yesterday, Wednesday 16 August 2017, a 14-year-old girl was approached by an unknown man in Stoke Wood Road in the Charminster area.

The man put his hand on the girl and tried to prevent her walking away. He asked for the girl's number and asked to arrange a meeting with her in the future.

He did not touch the girl sexually and no threats were made and the man left the scene in the direction of De Lisle Road, apparently after he became aware a member of the public was watching what was going on.

The man is described as being of Arabic appearance, in his late teens, around five feet six inches tall and of slim build. He had short dark hair, a full beard and was wearing square-rimmed sunglasses.

He was wearing cream trousers and a beige bomber style jacket and had a dark blue backpack on with a brown leather base.

Detectives have made a number of enquiries in an attempt to locate the man, including house to house enquiries in the local area and a trawl of CCTV footage.

Detective Constable Luke Davis, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to the public in the hope that someone may have witnessed the incident, or recognise the man involved from the description given.

"I am particularly keen to speak to a female passer-by who spoke to the girl immediately after the incident took place."

Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team have been made aware of the incident and can be contacted with any concerns.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170127015. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
