# Burglary at phone shop in Christchurch

21 September 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for the public's help after burglars stole iPhones and iPads from a store in Christchurch.

At around 5.10am on Thursday 20 September 2018 offenders smashed a glass pane to gain access to the O2 mobile phone shop on High Street.

Once inside they forced entry to a store room and removed a large number of new generation iPhones and iPads.

Enquiries are underway to identify those responsible for this offence, including a review of CCTV footage.

Police Constable Jim Perks, of Christchurch police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the area of the High Street during the relevant time and saw or heard anything suspicious to please contact Dorset Police.

"We believe the offenders used a white saloon car during the burglary and I would appeal to anyone who saw it parked outside the George pub or travelling at speed in the area to please get in touch. We would also welcome any relevant dash cam footage.

"Finally, I would urge anyone who has been offered a new generation iPhone or iPad for sale locally in suspicious circumstances to please contact me."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180152402. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
