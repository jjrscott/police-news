# Dorset Police launch summer drink and drug driving campaign

09 June 2016

* * *

Dorset Police is launching their 2016 summer drink and drug driving campaign tomorrow, Friday 10 June 2016 that will run until Sunday 10 July 2016. This will coincide with the 2016 UEFA European Championship taking place in France.

Drivers are being reminded that the consequences of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs can be devastating. With the Euro 2016 football competition starting on 10 June, police expect more people than usual will be out enjoying a drink.

Throughout the month-long summer drink and drug operation, officers will be requesting breath tests from all drivers involved in road traffic collisions, irrespective of whether or not they suspect an offence.

Drivers can expect to be tested during routine stop checks and if they are stopped for an offence. Field Impairment Tests (FIT) will be conducted on drivers suspected of being unfit to drive through drugs.

This is the first of two campaigns this year, following on from the 2015 Christmas drink and drug driving campaign when 110,226 motorists were breathalysed with 5,543 (5.02 per cent) either testing positive, refusing to provide a breath test or failing their test by blowing over the legal limit. There were also 1,888 drug screening device tests administered, 931 of which (49.31 per cent) were positive.

Inspector Matt Butler from the Alliance Road Policing team, said: "With nice summer evenings and Euro 2016 starting tomorrow, I would ask those planning to go out for a few drinks to consider how you're going to get home beforehand.

"Drink driving can be devastating. Alcohol impairs many of the functions necessary for safe driving; reaction times go up and spatial awareness is significantly reduced.

"It is important to note that many matches kick off at 8pm, including two of England's group matches. Motorists may still be over the limit the next morning. Remember, you don't have to be drunk to be a drink driver."

Chief Inspector Adrian Leisk, Head of the Alliance Roads Policing team across Devon & Cornwall Police and Dorset Police, said: "People convicted of drink or drug driving can expect to be banned from driving for at least 12 months, receive a fine of up to Â£5,000 and/or six months in prison.

"When someone dies as a result of a collision involving a drink or drug driver, sentences can carry a penalty of up to ten years in prison. Don't risk it, it's never worth it."

As in previous campaigns, anyone charged with a drink or drug driving-related offence during the campaign will have their name and court appearance details released to the media. Custody images of those convicted could also be issued.
