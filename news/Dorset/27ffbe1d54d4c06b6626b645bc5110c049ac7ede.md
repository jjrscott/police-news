03 October 2020

* * *

Officers searching for the owner of a note found on Canford Cliffs beach in Poole say they have been identified and found to be safe.

The discovery was made by a member of public shortly before 11.19am on Saturday 3 October 2020 underneath a rock at the bottom of Flaghead Chine.

The letter was dated Wednesday 30 September 2020 and spoke about the author taking their own life.

Following our earlier appeal, we have located the individual and established they are safe and receiving the appropriate care.

We would like to thank everyone who responded to our appeal.
