# Witness appeal following fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth

27 October 2016

* * *

Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a fail-to-stop road traffic collision in Bournemouth.

At around 4.47am today, Thursday 27 October 2016, a collision occurred in Poole Road at the junction of Queens Road involving a gold Vauxhall Tigra and a cyclist. The Tigra failed to stop at the scene and was found abandoned nearby a short time later. It has been recovered by officers.

The cyclist, a local man aged in his 30s, sustained serious injuries and was taken to Poole Hospital for treatment. His condition is not believed to be life-threatening.

Poole Road was closed while collision investigators examined the scene. It was reopened just after 10am.

Police Constable Craig Tatton, of Dorset Police's Traffic Unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision and has not yet spoken to officers to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who saw the Tigra being driven in the Bournemouth area prior to the incident or immediately after.

"Finally, I would appeal to the driver of the Tigra or anyone who may have been in the vehicle to come forward."
