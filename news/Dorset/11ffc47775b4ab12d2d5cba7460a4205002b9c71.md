# Witness appeal following serious injury fail-to-stop collision in Weymouth

05 February 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a serious injury fail-to-stop collision in Weymouth are appealing for the driver of the vehicle or any witnesses to come forward.

At around 4pm on Sunday 19 January 2020 a collision occurred on Radipole Lane at the junction with Hereford Road involving a car and a motorbike. The car failed to stop at the scene.

The motorcyclist - a man aged in his 50s and from Portland - sustained a break to his collarbone that required surgery.

Police Constable Laura Mounce, of Weymouth police, said: "We have been carrying out a number of enquiries so far to try and locate the offending vehicle, including house-to-house visits, but these have so far proved unsuccessful.

"I would like to appeal directly to the driver of the car to please do the right thing and come forward.

"I understand that a number of people in the area came to the aid of the victim and I am appealing to any of them who have not already spoken to police to please get in touch.

"I am also really keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the collision or have any relevant CCTV or dashcam footage to assist my investigation."
