Officers are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following a burglary at a farm in Weymouth.

Sometime between 5pm on Friday 13 January 2017 and 8am on Monday 16 January 2017, offenders gained entry to a shed in the Chickerell area.

Offenders cut the padlocks on the shed and stole two STIHL HS45 orange hedge trimmers, a STIHL MS180 orange chainsaw and a steel leaf blower.

Police Constable Nathan Harvey, of Weymouth police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious in the area during the relevant time to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who has seen or been offered the stolen items described for sale in unusual circumstances since the time of the incident.

"Finally, I would like to remind residents to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity to Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170007530. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
