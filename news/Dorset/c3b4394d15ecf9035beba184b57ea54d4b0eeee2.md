# Witness appeal after burglary in Bournemouth

05 September 2016

* * *

Police in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following a burglary at a toy shop.

At approximately 10.30pm on Sunday 4 September 2016, offenders broke into the Build-a-bear workshop on Commercial Road.

Entry was gained via the rooftop of the building but nothing was stolen from the property.

Detective Constable Christian Bryant, of Bournemouth police, said: "It is highly likely that the offenders would have climbed onto other neighbouring commercial properties in the area.

"I believe that there was an attempt to gain access to the adjacent building where Warren James jewellers are located.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed suspicious activity in or around the area at the time of the incident to come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 4:370. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
