# Renewed photo appeal following robbery in Bournemouth

04 July 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating a robbery on a teenage boy in Bournemouth are issuing new photos of the stolen bike.

At around 6.35pm on Friday 15 June 2018 a 14-year-old boy was riding his black mountain bike along the cycle path that runs between the A338 and Queens Park near Cooper Dean roundabout when he was approached by two male teenagers who stood in his way to prevent him from carrying on.

One of the offenders pushed the victim in the chest and grabbed him by the neck before threatening to stab him, but no knife was seen. They then pushed him off the bike and one of them cycled off with it while the other one ran next to it.

The stolen bike is a Cube Stereo 160, with white forks, Fox suspension and a black saddle.

Both offenders have been described as white, between 16 and 19 years old, about five feet 10 inches tall and of medium build. One of them had gapped teeth and was wearing a black baseball cap and a dark and light grey hooded top.

Detective Constable Honor McAdam, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We have been making a number of enquiries into this incident and I am now in a position to issue photos of the stolen bike in the hope that someone may know of its whereabouts or have seen it offered for sale locally.

"Again I would appeal for any witnesses to the incident or anyone with information about those responsible to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180092389. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
