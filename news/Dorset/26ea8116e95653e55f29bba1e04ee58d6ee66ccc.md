# Update - CCTV appeal following reported theft of handbag in Weymouth

10 December 2018

Officers investigating a reported theft of a handbag and subsequent debit card use in Weymouth say a man has come forward.

Between 2am and 2.30am on Saturday 3 November 2018 it was reported a handbag was stolen from a table at the Lazy Lizard on The Esplanade and that the victim's debit card was subsequently used to pay for a taxi.

Following an earlier media appeal, a 46-year-old local man has contacted Dorset Police and is assisting with the investigation. No arrests have been made.
