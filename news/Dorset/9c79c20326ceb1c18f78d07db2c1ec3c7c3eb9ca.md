# Witness appeal following assault in Weymouth

28 January 2020

* * *

Officers investigating an unprovoked assault on an 18-year-old man in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 5.45pm on Monday 20 January 2020 the victim was walking through an alleyway between Lorton Lane and Court Road when he was confronted by a man.

The victim attempted to step to the side to let the man through, but he blocked his path.

The man then kicked the victim on his knee and punched him in the face, causing him to fall to the ground. He sustained cuts and bruises.

The offender is described as around five feet 10 inches tall and of skinny build. He was wearing dark clothing, including a black hooded top with the hood up.

Police Constable Will Harris, of Weymouth police, said: "This was an unprovoked assault and I am carrying out a number of enquiries in a bid to locate the offender.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the relevant time and may have witnessed the incident, or a man matching the description given, to please get in touch.

"We would urge members of the public to remain vigilant when walking alone at night and stick to well-lit areas where possible."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200009953. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
