Officers investigating a serious road traffic collision in Bournemouth are asking witnesses and anyone with information to come forward.

At 7pm on Sunday 2 July 2017 a serious injury road traffic collision occurred on the A347 Wimborne Road at the junction with the B3064 Lansdowne Road at Cemetery Junction.

A silver Vauxhall Astra, being driven toward the Lansdowne Road direction, reportedly failed to comply with a red traffic light and collided with a black BMW 7 Series, which was being driven across the junction from the Richmond Hill direction toward Charminster.

As a consequence of the collision, the Astra then collided with metal railings, causing serious injuries to two 16-year-old German student pedestrians.

The driver of the Astra immediately left the scene on foot and remains to be traced despite a number of enquiries by officers.
