* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with a reported burglary in Weymouth.

It was reported that between 1am and 6am on Thursday 16 August 2018 a burglary occurred at a property in Brownlow Street while the occupants were asleep upstairs.

Entry was reportedly gained through an insecure ground floor window and an Acer laptop and keys were taken.

A 46-year-old Bournemouth man has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Monday 13 May 2019 for an offence of burglary.

Three other people arrested in connection with the incident, a 30-year-old Weymouth woman and two local men aged 36 and 41, will face no further police action.
