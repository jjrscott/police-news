# Appeal to locate owner of suspected stolen silverware

16 August 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for the public's help to locate the owner of suspected items of stolen silverware that have been found in Shaftesbury.

At around 9.20am on Sunday 13 August 2017 a member of the public contacted Dorset Police to report that a Tesco Bag for Life had been found hidden inside a plant pot outside The Potting Shed off High Street. The bag contained items of silverware including spoons of various sizes, a small box, a cigarette case and a hip flask.

Police Constable Glen Caddy, of North Dorset police, said: "Some of the items are engraved and are therefore particularly distinctive.

"We are keen to trace the owners of these items as it is possible they may have been stolen. I am releasing photos of the items in the hope that someone might recognise them. If you do, please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170124874. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
