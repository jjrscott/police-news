# Witness appeal following reported attempted robbery in Weymouth

21 January 2019

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a reported attempted robbery in Weymouth.

At 12.37pm on Saturday 19 January 2019 a local woman in her 50s was walking along The Esplanade near to the junction with Gloucester Street when it is alleged a man bumped into her and tried to take her handbag from her. A struggle is said to have occurred, causing the strap of the handbag to snap.

It is reported members of the public then intervened and the man walked away in the direction of the Jubilee Clock. Nothing was stolen.

He is described as white, of slight build and with long, light brown hair. He was wearing a grey hooded top with the hood up, a black jacket over the top and a dark scarf over his face.

A 34-year-old man from Blandford was arrested and has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Detective Constable Jacqui Gravenor, of Weymouth CID, said: "I have already spoken to several people but I would appeal to anyone who witnessed the incident and has not yet spoken to officers to please call Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190009801. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
