# Update â€“ man due in court in connection with reported assaults in Weymouth

11 April 2019

* * *

A man is due to appear at court in connection with reports of assaults on two people in Weymouth.

Dorset Police received a report at around 1.15am on Saturday 27 October 2018 of an incident in the rear car parks of The Richmoor and Mon Ami hotels on The Esplanade in Weymouth.

It was alleged that two holidaymakers - a man aged in his 30s and a woman aged in her 40s - were assaulted and two parked motor vehicles in the area were damaged.

The male victim sustained two bite wounds and was taken to hospital for treatment. The woman did not sustain any injuries that required medical treatment.

A 24-year-old Weymouth man was arrested in connection with the incident and has now been issued with a postal requisition to appear before Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Thursday 18 April 2019 for offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, assault and criminal damage.

A 23-year-old Weymouth woman who was arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning actual bodily harm remains released under investigation.
