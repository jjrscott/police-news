# Witness appeal following serious sexual assault in Weymouth

18 May 2019

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward as they investigate a serious sexual assault in Weymouth town centre.

The victim, a local 18-year-old woman, had left Actors Club in Maiden Street at around 4.15am today, Saturday 18 May 2019, and was approached by a man in St Mary Street, who walked with her until they got to Frederick Place, where the assault occurred in the entrance area to an address.

A neighbour heard the victim screaming and arrived at the scene, at which point the offender ran off.

The man is described as black, of athletic build and aged in his late teens to early 20s with short shaved black hair and facial hair. He was wearing a dark-coloured top and light-coloured jeans as well as a black scarf. He told the victim that he was from Bournemouth.

Detective Sergeant Dave Horn, of Weymouth CID, said: "We have launched a full investigation into this incident and are continuing to support the victim.

"We are carrying out a number of enquiries, including a review of CCTV footage in the area, and a cordon has been put in place to allow for an examination of the scene.

"I am appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information about this incident to please contact us."

Chief Inspector Steve Yeoman, of Dorset Police, said: "I would like to reassure the local community that a full investigation is underway to identify the man responsible for this offence.

"There will be an increased police presence in the area as this investigation continues and officers can be approached by residents with any concerns."
