# Update â€“ man due in court in connection with reported stabbing in Boscombe

13 May 2018

* * *

A man has been charged and is due to appear in court in connection with an alleged stabbing in Boscombe.

Dorset Police was called by the ambulance service just before 8pm on Wednesday 2 May 2018 to Windsor Road following reports that a man had sustained stab wounds to his upper body. The alleged stabbing is reported to have occurred in nearby Cecil Road.

The injured man, who is aged in his 20s, was taken to Southampton General Hospital by air ambulance for emergency treatment. His condition was initially described as potentially life-threatening but he has since been released from hospital.

A 23-year-old Christchurch man has been charged with wounding with intent and is due to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court tomorrow, Monday 14 May 2018.

Two Bournemouth men, aged 25 and 21, previously arrested on suspicion of attempted murder remain released under investigation.
