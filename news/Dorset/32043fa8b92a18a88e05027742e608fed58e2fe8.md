# Witness appeal following collision involving teenage cyclist in Bournemouth

18 December 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a teenage boy was injured in a collision in Bournemouth.

At around 4.10pm on Thursday 3 December 2020 a collision occurred on Ringwood Road. A local teenage boy was cycling home from school toward the Mountbatten roundabout when he crossed Ringwood Road. As he cycled across the second part of the dual carriageway from a pedestrian refuse island, he was involved in a collision with a red Vauxhall Corsa.

The boy was treated at the scene before being taken to hospital. He sustained an injury to his eye, cuts and bruises.

Police Constable Justyna Nicholas, of North Bournemouth police, said: "Following enquiries I understand there were a number of other motorists who were travelling along this road at the time of the collision and may have seen what happened. I am keen to speak to these motorists, as well as anyone else who may have captured anything of relevance on dashcam."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200182670. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
