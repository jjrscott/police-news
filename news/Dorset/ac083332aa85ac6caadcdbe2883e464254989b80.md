# Fatal road traffic collision near Dorchester â€“ witness appeal

25 March 2021

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward following a fatal road traffic collision near Dorchester.

Dorset Police was called at 12.32pm on Thursday 25 March 2021 to a report of a collision involving a brown Honda Jazz on Long Street in Cerne Abbas.

It is reported that the car was involved in a collision with a wall.

Officers attended with the ambulance and fire services and very sadly the driver - a local man aged in his 90s - was pronounced dead at the scene. His family has been informed and the coroner has been notified.

A road closure was put in place to allow emergency services to respond to the incident.

Police Sergeant Lee Savage, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the family and loved ones of the man who sadly died.

"We are carrying out a thorough investigation into the circumstances of the collision and I would like to hear from any witnesses who have not spoken with police yet or anyone with relevant dashcam footage."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 25:318. Alternatively, or alternatively to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
