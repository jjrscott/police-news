# Witness appeal following fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth

24 December 2018

* * *

Officers investigating a fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 9.50pm on Friday 21 December 2018 a collision occurred on Wimborne Road in Kinson, near to the junction with Durdells Avenue. It involved a green Vauxhall Viva and another vehicle, described as a white Ford Transit style van with a registration number beginning H, which failed to stop at the scene. The van had no windows but two doors at the back.

The driver is described as white, aged between 40 and 50 years old, had stubble and wore a black beanie hat, a black jumper and a black body warmer. The van would have sustained damage to the front.

The driver of the Vauxhall, a man aged in his 70s, did not require any medical attention as a result of the collision.

Police Constable Chloe Chapman, of Bournemouth police, said: "We are carrying out enquiries into this incident and I am appealing for any witnesses or anyone who may have captured it on dashcam to contact us.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who may have come across a van matching the description given that has sustained damage in unexplained circumstances."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180204551. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
