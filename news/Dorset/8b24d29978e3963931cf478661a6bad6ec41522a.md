# Update â€“ man due in court for reportedly carrying a knife in Bournemouth

29 November 2019

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with a reported incident involving someone carrying a knife into a fast food restaurant in Bournemouth.

At around 9.55pm on Friday 13 September 2019 it was reported a man walked into McDonalds in Christchurch Road, Boscombe, with a kitchen-style knife handle sticking out of his trouser pocket.

It was alleged that a member of security staff approached the man, removed the knife from his pocket and asked him to leave. There were no reports of any threats made with the weapon.

Following a CCTV appeal, a 44-year-old Bournemouth man came forward and was interviewed by officers.

He has now been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 3 December 2019 for an offence of possessing a knife blade or sharp pointed article in a public place.
