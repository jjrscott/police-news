# Witness appeal following fail-to-stop collision in Poole

27 October 2016

* * *

Police investigating a fail-to-stop collision involving a car with a 'fluffy' steering wheel are appealing for the public's help to trace the driver.

The incident happened at around 10.40am on Tuesday 11 October 2016 at the pedestrian crossing on Alder Road next to the roundabout at Sainsburys.

The victim - a local woman aged in her 60s - was walking across the pedestrian crossing that was on red for drivers when she was hit by a small black car being driven by a woman. The victim describes the vehicle as having a fluffy steering wheel.

The driver mouthed "are you ok?" before driving away.

The victim was left with bruising and a minor injury to her leg which has caused her to walk with a limp.

Police Constable Matt Batter, of Poole police, said: "It is very lucky the victim was not seriously injured although she has been left shaken by the incident.

"I am only now in a position to issue the witness appeal as we have only recently been able to speak to the victim and establish the full details.

"Perhaps you know someone who drives a small black car with a fluffy steering wheel? If you do, please contact police. I am also aware there may have been a number of people in the area at the time who may have witnessed the incident and I would ask them to come forward.

"Finally, I would appeal directly to the driver to please contact me."
