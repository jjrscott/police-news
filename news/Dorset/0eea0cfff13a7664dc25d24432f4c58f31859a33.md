# Appeal for information following suspicious fire at Poole nature reserve

27 May 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for anyone with information to come forward following a fire at a Poole nature reserve that it is believed may have been started deliberately.

Dorset Police was contacted by the fire service at around 4.45pm on Tuesday 26 May 2020 in relation to a fire at the north end of the Bourne Valley Nature Reserve, near to the Turbary Close entrance.

Thanks to the efforts of firefighters, the fire only caused damage to a small area of bushes measuring around 10 metres by five metres.

It is the second suspicious fire at the reserve this month, with officers still appealing for anyone to come forward in relation to a fire that occurred on the evening of Saturday 9 May 2020 near the Bloxworth Road entrance at the south end of the reserve.

Police Constable Matthew Batter, of Poole police, said: "It is obviously concerning that this is the second incident at the reserve in a matter of weeks and we have seen elsewhere in the county the severe damage that can be caused by this kind of fire.

"I am appealing for anyone who has witnessed any suspicious activity in the area of the Bourne Valley Nature Reserve around the relevant times or who has any information as to the cause of these incidents to please contact police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200074361. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
