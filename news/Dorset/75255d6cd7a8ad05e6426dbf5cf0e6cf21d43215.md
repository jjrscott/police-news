# Man stabbed in Bournemouth â€“ renewed appeal

01 October 2016

* * *

Detectives are renewing their appeal for the public's help after a man was stabbed in a Bournemouth street.

At around 5.13pm yesterday, Friday 30 September 2016, a man was found with serious injuries in Regent Drive in the Littledown area of the town.

The victim - a local man aged in his 20s - sustained a stab wound to his chest and was taken to hospital for treatment. He underwent surgery overnight and his condition is described as no longer life-threatening.

It is believed the offender - described by a witness as a man of mixed race and aged in his late teens or early 20s - left the scene in a silver Vauxhall Astra. A similar car was found in Linwood Road a short time later and detectives believe this may be connected to the incident.

Officers, assisted by the NPAS helicopter, attended and a search of the area was carried out. An investigation is underway, led by detectives from Bournemouth CID.

Early enquiries have indicated that the victim and offender are believed to have known each other.

No arrests have been made.

Detective Inspector Dawn Barrett, of Bournemouth CID, said: "Searches have been carried out in the nearby area overnight and this morning but we are yet to recover the weapon used in this incident.

"I would urge anyone who lives in the Regent Drive or Linwood Road area to check their gardens and outside property areas. If you find a knife, please do not touch it but call Dorset Police immediately.

"I would still like to hear from anyone who was in the Regent Drive or Linwood Road area at around 5pm yesterday and witnessed the incident or saw a man or silver Astra in suspicious circumstances to please come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 30:357. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
