Officers are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following a serious injury road traffic collision in Weymouth.

The incident happened at around 10.10am today, Monday 31 October 2016 on the A354 Weymouth relief road between the Jurassic roundabout and Veasta roundabout.

"I would also like to thank motorists for their patience while the road was closed."
