# Witness appeal following assault on bus driver in Bournemouth

23 July 2020

* * *

Officers investigating an assault on a bus driver in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The incident occurred at around 4pm on Wednesday 22 July 2020 at a bus stop on Charminster Road, near to Shelbourne Road.

A man attempted to get on the bus who was not wearing a face mask and when the driver refused to let him on he became verbally aggressive. He then forced his way onto the bus and sat down.

When the driver went to remove the man the offender hit him to the head with a beer can he was holding and pushed him to the floor. The driver was also kicked when on the floor. He sustained a cut to his head and went to hospital for treatment.

Officers attended and carried out a search for the offender - described as being aged in his late 30s to early 40s, of scruffy appearance and wearing a rusty-coloured open top shirt - but he was not located.

Police Constable Kate Brew, of Bournemouth police, said: "We are investigating this assault and I am appealing to anyone with information that might assist our enquiries to please come forward.

"I understand there were a number of people on the bus and at the bus stop at the time, some of whom have not spoken to police and I would ask them to please make contact with us.

"This was a nasty attack on a bus driver who was just doing his job and we are determined to identify the man responsible."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200107793. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
