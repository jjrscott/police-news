# Robbery on delivery driver in Bournemouth â€“ witness appeal

26 January 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating a robbery on a food delivery driver in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At around 10pm yesterday, Thursday 25 January 2018, officers were called to reports of a robbery in Shelbourne Road.

The victim had just made a fast food delivery to an address when he was confronted by three men wearing dark clothes with their hoods up. They demanded money.

One of the offenders then punched the victim in the face before he grabbed hold of the victim's bag and ran down Shelbourne Road toward Bennett Road.

The victim - a local man aged in his 40s - sustained a bruised eye. He did not require hospital treatment.

The stolen bag is described as a large black heated bag used to transport food.

Detective Sergeant Ian Allen, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed this incident or who saw three men acting suspiciously in the area at the relevant time to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would also ask residents to please check their gardens in the event a similar bag has been discarded."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk, or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180013271. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
