# Death of man off Portland - update

11 September 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating the death of a man who was pulled from the sea off Portland have issued an update.

At 12.45pm yesterday, Sunday 10 September 2017, Dorset Police was contacted by HM Coastguard following reports that they had rescued a man from the water near Pulpit Rock.

The man, who is aged in his 30s, was found to be in a life-threatening condition and was taken to hospital for emergency treatment. Sadly he was pronounced dead just after 1.30pm. The death is not being treated as suspicious. His next of kin have been informed and the coroner has been notified.

Detective Sergeant James Mullen, of Weymouth CID, said: "Enquiries are ongoing into the incident but at this time we believe that the man died as a result of a tragic accident.

"We would like to thank members of the public who have already come forward to assist our appeal. I am still keen to hear from any witnesses who saw the man enter the water and have not yet spoken to police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 10:223. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
