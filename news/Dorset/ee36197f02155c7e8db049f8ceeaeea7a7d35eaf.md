Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a fatal road traffic collision in Owermoigne near Dorchester.

Dorset Police was informed of the incident outside Galton Garden Centre on the A352 Wareham Road at 3.56pm today, Friday 1 December 2017.

The fire service, ambulance service and air ambulance also attended and the road was closed between Warmwell Cross and Owermoigne to allow emergency services to deal with the scene.

The collision involved a red Nissan Micra and a green Daewoo Matiz. Sadly, the driver of the Micra, a 87-year-old local woman, died as a result of the collision. The driver of the Matiz, a 57-year-old man from Poole, was seriously injured and taken to hospital.

Police Sergeant Mark Scammell, of the traffic unit, said: "This was a tragic incident and our thoughts are with the family and friends of the lady who sadly died.

"We have examined the scene thoroughly and our investigation is continuing. I am appealing for any witnesses to the collision or the manner of driving of either vehicle prior to the collision to please come forward.

"We are very grateful for motorists' patience during the road closure, which was necessary to enable all emergency services to deal with the scene safely."
