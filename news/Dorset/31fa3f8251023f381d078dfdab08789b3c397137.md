# Dorset Police joins in displays of unity at One World Festival

08 August 2016

* * *

On Saturday 6 August, Dorset Police took part in the Dorset One World Festival in Dorchester, joining in the celebrations that brought people of all cultures together.

Officers from the Dorchester Neighbourhood Policing Team and three Equality Champions joined in the festivities as part of the Force's ongoing effort to demonstrate that hate crime will never be tolerated.

Officers raised awareness of hate crime reporting options available to any victims, including the pioneering Hate Crime App, which helps the most vulnerable members of society to report promptly and in the privacy of their own safe environment.

Sergeant Ged Want of the Dorchester Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "The festival demonstrated community togetherness at its best. For local officers, it provided a great opportunity to speak with residents, offer advice and support and get a feel for any issues facing local people."

Karen Duke-Glover, who leads Dorset Police's People, Confidence and Equality team, said: "Engagement forms an integral part of our efforts to give the public the confidence to come forward and report hate crime to us.

"We will also continue to work closely with the Prejudice Free Dorset partnership, which acts as an additional listening tool to ensure that we are fully informed of any community tensions, should they arise.

"The most important thing victims or witnesses of hate crime can do is come forward. Hate crime is known to be widely under-reported. If you have concerns about notifying the police, there are other places and people you can report to."

Superintendent Nicky Searle, Dorset Police and South West regional hate crime lead, said: "We are fully committed to working with communities to demonstrate that crimes of this nature are unacceptable in any circumstances.

"Our diverse communities bring great strengths to Dorset and that is why it is so important to engage with local communities and provide reassurance that victims of crime will be supported and perpetrators of such crimes will be brought to justice where possible."

If you think you may have experienced or witnessed hate crime, report it by using the Dorset Police 'Do it Online' function (www.dorset.police.uk), contact Crimestoppers or use the True Vision website (report-it.org.uk), where you can also find advice about staying safe. In an emergency, always dial 999.
