# Witness appeal following altercation in Bournemouth

21 May 2019

* * *

Detectives investigating an altercation in Bournemouth town centre that left a man with a broken leg are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 6.50pm on Tuesday 14 May 2019 a group of five young black men were walking up the pathway from Bournemouth Pier toward East Cliff and behind the Bath Road South car park.

They found their path blocked by a group of four men, described as mixed race or black, who threatened them.

As the victims ran back toward the car park, two of them were tripped by members of the other group. One of the men broke his leg as a result and the other sustained a minor head injury caused by his head being stamped on. Both were taken to hospital for treatment.

Detective Constable Paul Priestley, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This is believed to have been an unprovoked attack that left one of the victims with a nasty injury.

"We have been carrying out a number of enquiries to identify the men involved, including a review of CCTV in the area.

"I would urge any witnesses to the incident, or anyone with information that can assist our investigation, to contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190072662. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
