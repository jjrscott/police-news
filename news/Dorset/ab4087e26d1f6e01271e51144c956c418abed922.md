# Indecent exposure incident in Poole - witness appeal

28 September 2016

* * *

Officers investigating an indecent exposure incident in Poole are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At approximately 10.30pm on Saturday 24 September 2016 a man and a woman were walking along an alleyway which runs between Ringwood Road and Dorchester Road when a man indecently exposed himself.

The offender is described as white, approximately 35 years old, five feet nine inches tall, of medium build and with short dark-coloured hair that was receding on the front and light stubble on his face. He was wearing blue jeans and a blue jumper with the sleeves rolled up.

Police Constable Craig Tiernan, of Poole police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who saw a man matching the description given acting suspiciously in the area to please contact Dorset Police urgently.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who has any other information which may help me with my investigation.

"We do not believe this incident is linked to a previous indecent exposure which took place on Monday 19 September in the town."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 26:229. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
