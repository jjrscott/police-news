Officers investigating a fatal road traffic collision in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At 10.35am on Monday 26 February 2018 Dorset Police received a report of a collision involving a black Ford Fiesta and a pedestrian on Littlemoor Road, near to the junction with Chelwood Close.

The pedestrian, a woman in her 80s from Weymouth, was taken to Dorset County Hospital and then later transferred to Southampton. Her injuries were not initially believed to be life-threatening. However, very sadly the woman died on the evening of Wednesday 7 March 2018.

The driver of the Fiesta was uninjured.

Police Sergeant Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: “We were very sad to learn that the pedestrian involved in this collision has died and our thoughts are with her family.

“We are continuing to investigate this incident and I would ask any witnesses who have not already spoken to police to contact us.

“I would also appeal to anyone who was driving along Littlemoor Road around the relevant time and has any dascham footage of the incident to get in touch.”
