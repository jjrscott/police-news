# Update - theft of bike in Bournemouth

26 April 2019

* * *

Officers investigating the theft of a child's bicycle from outside a Bournemouth shop have arrested a man.

At around 6pm on Tuesday 26 March 2019 a local 12-year-old boy left his Apollo racer bike insecure outside the Co-op on Wimborne Road in Moordown. He returned to discover it had been reportedly stolen.

A CCTV appeal was issued by officers on Friday 18 April 2019.

A 29-year-old local man has been arrested on suspicion of theft and is assisting officers with their enquiries.

The bike has been recovered but is reported to have been damaged.

We would like to thank all those members of public who responded to our appeal.
