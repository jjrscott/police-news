# Update â€“ further arrests following reported robbery at shop in Poole

08 November 2018

* * *

Detectives have made two further arrests in connection with an alleged robbery at a shop in Poole.

The incident happened at around 11.20am on Tuesday 6 November 2018 at St Mary's News on St Mary's Road.

It was reported that two men wearing scarfs around their faces entered the store and threatened members of staff with a weapon, believed to be a hand gun. It is not known if it was real or a replica.

The men then reportedly took a quantity of cigarettes, cash and a phone before making off in a black Vauxhall Corsa or similar vehicle.
No one sustained any physical injuries.

Following an extensive investigation by detectives, a 28-year-old Poole man and a 27-year-old Bournemouth man have been arrested on suspicion of robbery and are assisting police with their enquiries.

Detectives are still appealing for anyone with information about the incident who has not already spoken to police to come forward. They are also keen to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time of the incident and may have relevant dashcam footage.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180179441. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
