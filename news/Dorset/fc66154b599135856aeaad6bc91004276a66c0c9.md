# Renewed appeal in relation to reported sexual assaults in Bournemouth

29 April 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a series of reported sexual assaults in Bournemouth are appealing for a woman to come forward.

It is reported that two separate women were sexually assaulted just after 5.21pm on Saturday 13 April 2019 at the Co-op petrol station on Castle Lane West. Two further similar incidents were reported to have taken place in the Castlepoint area a short time later. It is alleged the offender smacked or touched the bottoms of the women.

As part of their enquiries officers are keen to speak to a woman who was in the lower car park underneath Sainsbury's at Castlepoint at around 5.30pm that day and may have been approached by a man in similar circumstances.

Police Constable Justyna Nicholas, of Bournemouth police, said: "I would appeal to this woman or anyone else with information to please contact me."

A 33-year-old man from Bournemouth who was arrested on suspicion of sexual assault remains released on police bail pending further enquiries.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190055852. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
