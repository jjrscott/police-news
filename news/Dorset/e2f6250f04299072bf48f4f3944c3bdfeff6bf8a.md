Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a man was assaulted in Bournemouth.

Sometime between 1.45am and 2am on Sunday 16 October 2016, a 19-year-old local man was walking along Talbot Drive in the Wallisdown area when he was approached by two men and two women who had come from the direction of the Kings Arms pub on Wallisdown Road.

The group were verbally abusive and aggressive toward the victim before one approached him and punched him in the face.

The victim suffered concussion, bruises and cuts to his head and was taken to Poole Hospital for treatment.

The male suspects are described as white and aged 19 or 20. One was tall, of average build and was wearing a blue or grey hooded top. The second was shorter and of slim build, with buck teeth and dark hair. He was wearing a dark blue hooded top.

One of the women is described as white, short, of large build with a mole on her top lip. There is no description for the second woman. They were both wearing hooded tops with the hood up.

Police Constable Liz Renshaw, of Poole police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the relevant time and either witnessed the incident or knows who was responsible to please contact Dorset Police."
