# Message regarding Manchester concert attack

23 May 2017

* * *

Superintendent Mike Rogers, of Dorset Police, said: "Our thoughts are with everyone who has been affected by the events in Manchester and our deepest condolences are with the families and friends of those who tragically lost their lives.

"Dorset Police stand with Greater Manchester Police and other forces across the country. Public safety is our priority and we have a variety of established operational tactics that are regularly used to ensure that our local communities and businesses are both well prepared and protected.

"Our aim is to reduce the risk to the public and maximise public awareness. As is normal practice, we are in touch with national anti-terrorism coordinators.

"A this time there has been no change to the threat level in the UK but this is reviewed on a national basis and Dorset Police will, if necessary, respond accordingly. We regularly review intelligence and information and would like to reassure the public that at this time there is no specific threat to Dorset. The public should be alert but not alarmed.

"The advice remains the same - members of the public should always remain alert to the danger of terrorism and report any suspicious activity to police on 999 or the anti-terrorist hotline 0800 789 321."
