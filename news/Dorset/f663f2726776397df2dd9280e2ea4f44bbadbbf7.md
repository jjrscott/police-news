Detectives investigating an attempted robbery in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The incident happened sometime between 12pm and 1pm on Monday 27 November 2017 in Argyll Road in Boscombe.

The victim - a 39-year-old local man - was approached by a woman who asked if she could use his mobile phone. As the victim was about to hand over his phone a man who was with the woman tried to take it from him. This man then hit the victim over the head with a brick. The phone was damaged as it fell on the ground and both the man and woman ran off.

The female offender is described as white, aged in her 30s, with mousey brown hair and ponytail. She is around five feet five inches tall and of large build.

The male offender is described as black, aged in his 30s and around six feet four inches tall and of large build. He was wearing a black hooded top and bottoms.

The victim sustained a head injury which is not believed to be serious and was taken to hospital as a precaution.

Detective Constable Garry Weston, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We have already made a number of enquiries and are continuing to investigate this incident and why this victim was targeted.

"I am appealing for any witnesses, or anyone who saw any suspicious activity in the area around the time of the incident, to please contact police."
