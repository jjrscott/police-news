# Public help sought to identify owner of recovered bicycle

22 June 2016

* * *

Detectives are appealing for the public's help to identify the owner of a bicycle that has been recovered in Wimborne.

On Friday 10 June 2016, officers seized a red specialised Rockhopper bike from an address in the town.

Detective Inspector Andrew Dilworth, of Dorset Police's Priority Crime Team, said: "To date efforts to identify the owner has not been successful.

"I am issuing an image of the recovered bicycle in the hope that someone recognises it as we would like to reunite it with its owner. If this is your bicycle or you know who it belongs to, please contact Dorset Police."

A 21-year-old man from Bournemouth has been arrested on suspicion of theft and has been released on police bail pending further enquiries until the end of July 2016.
