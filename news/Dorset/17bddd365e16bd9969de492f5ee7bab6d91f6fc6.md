# Update: Appeal following theft of cash from Gillingham supermarket

28 March 2017

* * *

A man has come forward following a police appeal over the theft of cash from a supermarket in Gillingham.

Police issued a CCTV appeal after a local woman aged in her 40s used a self-service checkout at Asda in Station Road on Wednesday 1 February and requested £50 cashback but forgot to collect it from the machine.

A man was seen on CCTV to collect the money and leave the store.

Officers have now been contacted by the man, a 58-year-old from Gillingham, who has been dealt with by a community resolution order with the £50 returned to the victim.
