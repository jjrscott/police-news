# Appeal for information following suspicious fire in Poole

11 May 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a fire at a nature reserve in Poole that is believed to have been started deliberately are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police received a report from the fire service at around 6pm on Saturday 9 May 2020 in relation to a fire at the Bourne Valley Nature Reserve.

The fire is believed to have started near the entrance at the Bloxworth Road end of the reserve and a witness reported seeing a teenager emerging from bushes in the area shortly before it started.

The boy was described as white, aged around 15 or 16 and about five feet nine inches tall. He was wearing a baseball cap and navy blue tracksuit with 'EA7' on the front.

A significant area of heathland was damaged by the fire.

Police Constable Matthew Batter, of Poole police, said: "We have been liaising with the fire service and are continuing to investigate this incident.

"We are treating it as a suspected arson and I would urge anyone with information about who is responsible, or who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area around the time of the incident, to please contact us.

"I would also like to take this opportunity to remind parents to make sure they know where there children are, especially in light of the current COVID-19 (coronavirus) restrictions."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200065675. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
