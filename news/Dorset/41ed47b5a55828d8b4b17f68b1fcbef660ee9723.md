A man is due to appear in court in connection with a reported robbery in Weymouth.

At around 12.30am on Sunday 7 April 2019 officers were called to St Nicholas Street following reports that an altercation had broken out between a local woman aged in her 20s and a man.

It is alleged the man forcibly removed money from the victim's hand before he walked off along Lower St Alban Street.

The woman and man are reportedly known to each other.

A 23-year-old local man has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Monday 2 September 2019 for an offence of robbery.
