Officers investigating a road traffic collision in Blandford are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 10.25am yesterday, Sunday 8 October 2017, a collision occurred on the approach to the roundabout between the C13 Higher Shaftesbury Road and the A350 involving a silver Vauxhall Astra and a green Peugeot 307.

Nobody was injured as a result of the collision. However, the drivers of the cars were involved in a verbal altercation following the incident.

Police Constable Dan Johnson, of North Dorset police, said: "We are keen to speak to any drivers in the area who may have witnessed the collision or have dash cam footage of the incident.

"We would also like to hear from anyone who witnessed the manner of driving of either vehicle prior to the collision and are keen to identify the drivers of a dark blue saloon, possibly a BMW, which was in the vicinity and a 4x4 that was flagged down by one of the drivers."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170157090. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
