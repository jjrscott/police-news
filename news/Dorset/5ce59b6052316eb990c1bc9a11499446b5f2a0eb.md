# Witness appeal following fatal collision near Hurn

20 January 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses and anyone with dashcam footage to come forward following a fatal collision near Hurn.

Dorset Police was called just after 8pm on Monday 20 January 2020 to reports that a Ford Focus had left the road and come to rest in a hedge off Matchams Lane near to the Snowtrax centre.

Very sadly the driver of the Focus - a 69-year-old local man - died at the scene. His next of kin has been informed and the coroner notified.

Matchams Lane was closed between Matchams Close and Avon Causeway while emergency services dealt with the incident. It reopened at 10.10pm.

Police Sergeant Sarah Jones, of the traffic unit, said: "From our initial enquiries we believe no other vehicle was involved and it is possible the driver may have suffered a medical episode. Our thoughts are with his family at this very difficult time.

"We are carrying out a full investigation into this circumstances surrounding the collision and I would appeal to anyone who witnessed the incident or was travelling along Matchams Lane at the relevant time and may have captured it on dashcam to please contact me."
