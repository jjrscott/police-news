# Update â€“ appeal after woman found with serious injuries on Bournemouth road

09 November 2018

* * *

A man arrested following an incident where a woman was found in the middle of a Bournemouth road with serious injuries has been released under investigation.

Dorset Police was called at 9.12am on Thursday 8 November 2018 to reports of a concern for the welfare of a woman in the westbound carriageway of the Wessex Way prior to the Cambridge Road roundabout.

The woman - aged in her 30s - was found at the side of the road with head injuries. It is believed she was in a moving vehicle immediately prior to being located.

She was taken to hospital for treatment to serious injuries that are not thought to be life-threatening.

An investigation is underway to establish how she sustained her injuries and came to be at the side of the road.

A 32-year-old Bournemouth man who was arrested has now been released under investigation as enquiries continue.

Detectives are continuing to appeal for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.
