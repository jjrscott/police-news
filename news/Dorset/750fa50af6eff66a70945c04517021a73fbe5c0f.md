# Appeal following reported fight in Bournemouth

14 June 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating a reported fight between a group of men in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At around 5.40pm on Tuesday 12 June 2018 Dorset Police was called to reports of a fight near to Belvedere Road in the Charminster area involving men armed with weapons. The incident is reported to have then moved to an alleyway leading to Tesco, before spilling out onto Charminster Road toward the junction of Shelbourne Road.

Officers attended and three local men aged 21, 35 and 45 were arrested on suspicion of affray. They have been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

After the incident it is reported that a group of men armed with various weapons entered the International Supermarket. A disturbance took place and again the incident spilled out onto Charminster Road. It is believed the two disturbances are related.

One man received a cut to his head but his injuries are not serious.

Detective Constable Neil Causebrook, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This incident happened at a busy time of the day and would have been seen by a number of people.

"I would ask anyone who witnessed the incident or has any information that may assist my investigation to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would like to reassure the community that a full investigation is underway to establish the circumstances behind the incident. Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team are available to address any concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180090360. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
