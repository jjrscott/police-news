# Witness appeal following reported fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth

16 May 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following a reported fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth.

At about 9.05am today, Tuesday 16 May 2017, it was reported that a collision occurred between a blue Citroen Berlingo van and an electric-assisted bicycle, which looks similar to a moped, on Christchurch Road at the junction of Derby Road.

The van reportedly failed to stop at the scene and was located a short time later nearby.

The bicycle rider, a 63-year-old Bournemouth man, sustained serious injuries and was taken to Southampton General Hospital. His condition is described as serious but not life-threatening.

Christchurch Road was closed between the junctions of Knyveton Road and St Swithuns Road. Derby Road was closed between Christchurch Road and the junction of Manor Road while officers examined the scene. Both roads have since reopened.

A 44-year-old Bournemouth man has been arrested on suspicion of failing to stop after a road traffic collision and is currently assisting officers with their enquiries.

Police Sergeant Nikki Burt, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision, or the moments leading up to it, and has not yet spoken to officers to please come forward.

"We would like to thank motorists for their patience while the road closure was in place."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 16:87. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
