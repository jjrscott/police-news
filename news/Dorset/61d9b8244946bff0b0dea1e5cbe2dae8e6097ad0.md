# Witness appeal following reported affray in Weymouth

29 June 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage to come forward following an alleged affray in Weymouth.

It is reported that between 4pm and 4.25pm on Friday 26 June 2020 a fight occurred involving two men near to The Wyke Smugglers pub on Portland Road.

The victim - a man aged in his 50s - did not sustain any physical injuries.

Officers attended and a 55-year-old man from Portland was located nearby and arrested on suspicion of affray and assault. He has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Police Constable Don Duchscherer, of Weymouth police, said: "I understand that the road was busy on the day of the incident and I would urge any motorists who may have captured relevant footage on dashcam to please get in touch.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident and has not yet spoken to police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200092423. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
