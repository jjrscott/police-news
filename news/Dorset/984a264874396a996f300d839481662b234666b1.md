# Family tribute to motorcyclist killed in collision near Blandford

03 April 2017

* * *

A motorcyclist who died following a collision near Blandford has today been named by his family.

At 3.40pm yesterday, Sunday 2 April 2017, a two vehicle fatal road traffic collision occurred on the C13 Higher Shaftesbury Road near Compton Abbas Airfield.

It involved a green Ford Escort, driven by a 24-year-old man from the Shaftesbury area, and a black Kawazaki motorcycle.

Sadly as a result of the collision, the motorcycle rider was pronounced dead at the scene.

He has been named today, Monday 3 April 2017, as 74-year-old Sid Samways. His wife, Barbara Samways, aged 71 and of Blandford, was travelling as a pillion passenger and was airlifted to Southampton General Hospital with serious life-threatening injuries.

In a statement, Sid and Barbara's family said: "In relation to yesterday's collision, we have made the brave decision to name Sid.

"His loving wife Barbara, who was also on the motorcycle, is currently fighting for her life in Southampton General Hospital.

"We wish to give our thanks for all the expressions of sympathy and kindness we have been shown. We now request complete privacy at this time."

Traffic officers are appealing for any witnesses to the incident or manner of driving of either vehicle prior to the collision to contact police.

A 24-year-old man from the Shaftesbury area was arrested on suspicion of driving offences and has been released on bail until the end of June 2017 pending further enquiries.
