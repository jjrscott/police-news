# Appeal following incident of harassment in Weymouth

28 June 2017

* * *

Officers investigating a report of harassment in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

They are particularly keen to hear from members of the public who attempted to help the victim during the incident, which occurred in the town centre at around 3pm on Wednesday 7 June 2017.

The victim, a local woman in her 20s, had gone to the town centre by bus on her own when she encountered a man who was known to her in St Mary Street between the Black Dog pub and Marks and Spencer.

The man, also aged in his 20s, reportedly pulled her rucksack off her back and began emptying the contents over the ground.

One member of the public who was in the area helped her to retrieve the items, while another man confronted the alleged offender about his behaviour.

As the woman walked away she was followed by the man as she headed toward Maiden Street and he grabbed her bag again and emptied the contents.

She picked them up and tried to run away but the man grabbed her bag another time, causing it to rip open and her belongings to fall out.

She was followed to the Esplanade, where he grabbed her coat by the hood, ripping the trim from it.

The woman eventually got on a bus at the Kings Statue to make her way home.

Police Constable Mal Dye, of Weymouth police, said: "We have made a number of enquiries into this incident and I am keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed it.

"I would particularly like to speak to any of the members of the public who went to assist the woman or the man who confronted the alleged offender."
