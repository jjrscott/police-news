Detectives have launched an investigation into the death of a man at a farm near Blandford, with two men arrested.

At 8.25pm on Friday 28 September 2018 Dorset Police received a report that a local 25-year-old man had sustained serious injuries following an incident at Hanford Farm.

Two Shaftesbury men, aged 25 and 27, were arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm as paramedics continued to provide medical treatment to the injured man.

Sadly, the man was pronounced dead at the scene at 9.47pm. The coroner has been notified and his family has been informed.

The two Shaftesbury men were subsequently re-arrested on suspicion of murder and are assisting officers with their enquiries.

"This incident occurred in a relatively remote location but I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed anything or who has any information that can assist our investigation to contact us."

A cordon has been put in place around the scene of the incident as officers continue their enquiries.
