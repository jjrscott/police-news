# Witness appeal following serious road traffic collision near Yetminster

15 September 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following a serious road traffic collision between Yetminster and Chetnole.

The incident was reported at 4.51pm on Tuesday 15 September 2020 and involved a grey Isuzu Trooper, driven by a 43-year-old woman from Chetnole, and a cyclist. It happened in the area of Tarks Hill.

The cyclist, a 61-year-old Sherborne man, was airlifted to a hospital in Bristol with possible life-threatening injuries.

The Isuzu driver was taken to Yeovil hospital by land ambulance with a suspected head injury.

Police Sergeant Rhys Griffiths, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing for any witnesses, who have not yet spoken with officers to please come forward.

"Also, I am keen to hear from anyone who may have seen the Isuzu or the cyclist immediately prior to the collision or has captured any relevant footage on dashcam.

"I would like to thank everyone affected by the road being closed for their patience. The closure was necessary to allow emergency services to attend everyone involved and investigators to examine the scene."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 15:331. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
