# Witness appeal following burglary at Bridport petrol station

04 May 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a burglary at a Bridport petrol station. At around 10.49pm yesterday, Wednesday 3 May 2017, officers were called to reports of a till snatch at the Esso garage in East Road. One man entered the area behind the till and stole money from a safe under the counter. He then approached the cashier and grabbed the till tray. A second suspect stood watch by the entrance before the pair left the scene. The till tray, a quantity of cash and a black A4 folder was stolen. No one was physically injured in the incident. The first suspect is described as male, six feet tall, of slim build and was wearing a grey hooded top with three lines down the arms, grey jogging bottoms tucked into white socks and dark-coloured trainers. The second suspect is described as five feet eight inches tall, of slim build and was wearing a dark-coloured hooded top with three white lines on the arms, light blue trainers and was carrying a grey bag with shoulder straps. It is possible this suspect was a woman. Both suspects wore scarves covering their faces. Police Sergeant Jamie Clark, of Bridport police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the area of the petrol station at the relevant time and saw two people acting suspiciously to please contact Dorset police. "I would also like to hear from anyone who has seen a till tray or black A4 folder discarded nearby." Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170064696. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
