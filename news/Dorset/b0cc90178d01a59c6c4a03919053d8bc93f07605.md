# Witness appeal following reported attempted robbery in Weymouth

11 October 2017

* * *

Officers investigating an alleged attempted robbery in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward.

The incident is reported to have occurred at around 10.20pm on Friday 6 October 2017 on Custom House Quay outside Rendezvous.

It is alleged the victim, a 61-year-old local man, was sitting in his parked car in one of the bays when two unknown men approached his vehicle and one got inside. The pair then left the area. Nothing was taken from the man and he was not injured.

Two local men, aged 36 and 42, have been arrested on suspicion of attempted robbery and have been released under investigation.

Detective Sergeant Nicky Jenkins, of Weymouth CID, said: "We have made a number of enquiries in the area and I am appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident and has yet to speak to officers to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly keen to trace two possible witnesses who may have been on the bridge at the time."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 6:496. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
