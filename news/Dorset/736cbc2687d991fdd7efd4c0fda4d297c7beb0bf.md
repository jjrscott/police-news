Dorset Police recognised police officers, staff and volunteers for their exceptional contribution to policing at the annual awards ceremony on Tuesday 26 February 2019.

The ceremony, which took place at Queen Elizabeth School in Wimborne, saw a total of 22 awards presented to the recipients in the company of family and friends.

Following nominations from colleagues within the Force as well as endorsements from partner agencies in the community, the honours were presented by Chief Constable James Vaughan, High Sheriff Jacqueline Swift, Police & Crime Commissioner Martyn Underhill, former chair of the lay custody visitors Kathleen Emery, and previous Dorset Chief Constables, Jane Stichbury and Dirk Aldous.

Superintendent Tracey Baker was given the lifetime achievement award at the event for her consistent high standards, tenacity and support to colleagues. Tracey joined Dorset Police in 2009, transferring from the Metropolitan Police and has held roles in neighbourhood policing, response policing, control room, firearms command, incident command, strategic alliance and territorial policing.

Chief Superintendent Mark Callaghan said: "Alongside an outstanding record in policing, Tracey has battled with significant personal issues outside of work and has managed to balance the two while delivering tirelessly for policing and the people of Dorset. She is a formidable police officer who is truly deserving of this recognition for her service."

Sergeant Christopher Wood and Police Constable Jake Woodbridge were recognised for their support to teenage victims during the investigation and charging process of a man for exposure and outraging public decency. The victims continue to be supported and have praised the officers for their support, which has improved their trust and confidence in Dorset Police.

Building relationships and engagement with the public is a key priority for Dorset Police and PCSO Pete Smith from Bournemouth Neighbourhood Policing Team received an award from the High Sheriff for his work in this area. Pete has outstanding dedication for delivering the highest levels of service, putting the community at the heart of everything he does and building strong relationships with our partners.

Superintendent Jared Parkin said: "Pete is an exceptional officer and a valuable asset to any problem or project he is involved in. Pete's impact within the community is vast and he delivers beyond expectations."

Other awards received included Poole Crime Resolution Team for their work in increasing the number of crime convictions in the town, Karen Craddock for her work in improving the environmental footprint of the Force and Inspector Neil Leat for his leadership within the Alliance Operations Department.

Special Constable of the year went to SC Heidi Speed, police staff member of the year was awarded to Lucianne Pharoah, detective of the year went to DC Rachel Yeoman, detention officer of the year was received by Dave Scagell, PCSO of the year was awarded to Kerrie Burns, community officer went to PC Melissa Rooney with the volunteer of the year being given to Beverley Wright.

Chief Constable James Vaughan said: "It is incredibly humbling to present these awards to our officers, staff, volunteers and partners. Our teams work incredibly hard and it is only right that we recognise them for their efforts in preventing and detecting crime and supporting victims."

PCC Martyn Underhill said: "It is always a privilege to attend these award ceremonies. Not only do they recognise exceptional individuals and teams, they also showcase the huge variety of work undertaken across policing by officers, staff, volunteers, partners and the public. Thank-you to everyone involved, you all made a difference."
