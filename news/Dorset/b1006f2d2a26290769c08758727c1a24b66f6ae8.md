# Boy dies following serious collision in Hamworthy

23 October 2020

* * *

A boy who had been taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries following a road traffic collision in the Hamworthy area of Poole has very sadly died.

At around 10.45pm on Monday 19 October 2020, Dorset Police received a report in relation to the incident involving a teenage boy on a pit bike on the recreation ground between Poole Rugby Football Club and the Turlin Moor estate in the Blandford Road area.

Officers attended, along with the ambulance service. The 16-year-old boy was taken to hospital in a life-threatening condition. Very sadly, he died from his injuries on Friday 23 October 2020 at Southampton hospital. His family is aware.

Police Sergeant Craig Tatton, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are very much with the boy's family and loved ones at this very difficult time."

It was reported that the pit bike was involved in a collision with metal railings. When officers arrived at the scene, the pit bike was not there. It was located on the afternoon of Tuesday 20 October 2020.

Two local boys, aged 13 and 16, were arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice and have been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Sergeant Tatton continued: "I would like to renew our appeal for any witnesses or anyone with information who has not yet spoken to officers to please contact Dorset Police."
