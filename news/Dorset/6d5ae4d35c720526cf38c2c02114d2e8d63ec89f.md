# Appeal for information following serious collision near Dorchester

25 January 2021

* * *

Officers are appealing for information following a serious injury road traffic collision near Dorchester.

Dorset Police received a report at 9.01am on Sunday 24 January 2021 of a single vehicle collision on the westbound carriageway of the A35 Puddletown Bypass, near to the Northbrook junction.

It was reported that the vehicle, a white Toyota Hilux, had collided with a central reservation and a bridge pillar.

The driver, a man aged in his 20s from Southampton, was taken to hospital by air ambulance to Southampton General Hospital, where he remains in a serious condition.

Road closures were put in place as the emergency services dealt with the incident and for an examination of the scene to be carried out, as well as for repair work to the central reservation. The road was reopened at around 7.20pm.

Sergeant Lee Savage, of the traffic unit, said: "We are carrying out an investigation to establish the full circumstances of this collision and I would urge any witnesses to the incident who have not already spoken to police to please come forward.

"I would also urge anyone who was travelling along the Puddletown Bypass around the time of the collision and has dashcam fitted to their vehicle to please check their footage for anything relevant.

"Finally, I appreciate this collision resulted in the closure of a major trunk road for a number of hours and I would like to thank members of the public for their patience and understanding. The closure was necessary to allow the emergency services to safely respond to the incident and to ensure that the road had been made safe before it was reopened."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at scit@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210015152. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
