# Police advise motorists to take extra care in adverse weather

23 January 2017

* * *

Police in Dorset are urging people to take extra precautions when driving in adverse weather conditions after 31 collisions across the county this morning.

The collisions all occurred before 10.30am today, Monday 23 January 2017, as fog and ice caused conditions on the roads to deteriorate, although the exact cause of each collision is still under investigation. On an average weekday, there may be around four or five collisions across the county in the same time period.

Driving conditions are likely to worsen during cold, wet and foggy weather.

Advising motorists, Inspector Matt Butler, of the traffic unit, said: "We saw a significant increase in the number of collisions on Dorset's roads this morning and, with freezing fog and ice again forecast for tonight and tomorrow morning, I would ask motorists to take extra care on the roads.

"If visibility is seriously reduced by fog, use your fog lights but remember to turn them off after. Drive carefully and considerately and keep your distance.

"In low temperatures there may be ice on the road even if the road has been gritted. Give yourself extra time to defrost your car and for the journey itself.

"Take responsibility for your own standard of driving - don't assume that the roads will be gritted and it is safe for you to drive as you normally would.

"If you do lose traction on ice, you are more likely to regain control if you are travelling slowly so keep your speed down and avoid harsh steering.

"Be prepared for the road conditions to change over relatively short distances.

"Listen to travel bulletins and take note of variable message signs that may provide information about weather, road and traffic conditions ahead."
