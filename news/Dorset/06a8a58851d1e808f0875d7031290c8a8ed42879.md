# Witness appeal following serious collision in Studland

23 August 2017

* * *

Officers investigating a serious injury collision in Studland are appealing for any witnesses to come forward.

At around 9.10pm yesterday, Tuesday 22 August 2017, a serious collision occurred on Ferry Road close to the junction at the entrance to the Knoll House Hotel.

The collision involved a black Suzuki motorcycle and a silver Audi S8.

The rider of the motorcycle, a Bournemouth man aged in his 20s, was taken to Poole Hospital for injuries to his leg and head that were not initially believed to be life changing or life threatening.

While in hospital, the man's condition deteriorated and he was transferred to Southampton General Hospital, where he remains in a critical condition.

The rider's pillion passenger, a 17-year-old girl from Austria, was taken to hospital with a fracture to her arm and leg.

Ferry Road was closed while the emergency services dealt with the incident and the Sandbanks chain ferry was suspended. The road was reopened at around 11.50pm.

A 55-year-old Swanage man has been arrested on suspicion of driving offences and is assisting officers with their enquiries.

Police Sergeant Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing for anyone who may have witnessed this collision and has yet to speak to officers to please contact police.

"I would also like to thank members of the public for their patience and understanding during the road closure, which was necessary to allow the emergency services to carry out their work."
