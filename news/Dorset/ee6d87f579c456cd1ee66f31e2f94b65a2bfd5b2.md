* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a fatal road traffic collision near Dorchester.

At 2.42pm on Tuesday 31 July 2018 Dorset Police was called to a report of a collision involving a black Land Rover Discovery and a blue Aprilia motorcycle on Warmwell Road in Crossways.

The collision occurred near to the entrance to the Hybris Business Park.

The rider of the motorcycle, a 51-year-old Weymouth man, sustained serious injuries and was taken to Southampton General Hospital where he sadly died. His family have been informed and are being supported by specially-trained officers.

The driver of the Land Rover, a man aged in his 40s, was uninjured.

The road was closed to allow collision investigators to carry out a full and thorough examination of the scene.

Police Inspector Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or the driving of either the car or the motorcyclist prior to the incident to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would particularly like to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time and may have dashcam footage that could assist with my investigation.

"Also, I wish to thank the public for their patience while the road closure was in place to allow emergency services to deal with the collision."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at scit@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 31:307. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
