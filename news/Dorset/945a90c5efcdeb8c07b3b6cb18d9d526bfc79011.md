Police are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward after a bike was stolen from West Moors.

At around 4.30pm on Friday 13 May 2016, an X Rated Mesh Dirt Jump bike was stolen from the Stour River area near the guide and brownie camp.
It has a grey frame, white handlebars with red grips and white forks. It was missing a back brake.

Police Sergeant Scott McFarland, of East Dorset police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area at the relevant time to please call me on 101.

"I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who has seen a similar bike being offered for sale locally."

Witnesses and anyone with information should call Dorset Police in confidence on 101, quoting occurrence number 55160073457. Alternatively, call the free and anonymous Crimestoppers line on 0800 555 111, where mobile phone tariffs may apply.
