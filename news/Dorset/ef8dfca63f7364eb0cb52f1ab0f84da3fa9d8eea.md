# Appeal for information following reported commercial burglary in Poole

15 January 2021

* * *

Detectives investigating a reported burglary at a Poole store are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police received a report of a break-in at Broadstone News in Lower Blandford Road at around 3.10am on Friday 15 January 2021. It was reported that two people forced entry to the premises and attempted to steal cigarettes from behind the counter but left when they were disturbed.

It was subsequently reported that vape liquids, lighters, light fluids, cigarette papers and stamps had been stolen.

Officers attended and carried out searches of the area. A 29-year-old Poole man was arrested on suspicion of burglary and is assisting detectives with their enquiries.

Detective Sergeant Karen Penn, of Dorset Police's Priority Crime Team, said: "We are continuing to investigate this matter and I am appealing to anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area, or who has any information that might assist our enquiries, to please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210010685. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
