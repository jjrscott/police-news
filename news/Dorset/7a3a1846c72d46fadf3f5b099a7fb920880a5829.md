# Appeal for information following break-in series in Bridport

24 August 2020

* * *

Officers investigating three break-ins at commercial premises in Bridport are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The three incidents occurred on the night of Friday 21 August into the morning of Saturday 22 August 2020.

Some time between 5pm on the Friday evening and 6.30am the next day a workshop in Barrack Street was broken into and a green and yellow Kawasaki motorcycle was stolen.

A further break-in occurred at an industrial unit at Pymore Mills at around 2am on Saturday 22 August 2020. An attempt was made to force entry to a van and a lock to a wood store was cut but it is believed an attempt to get into the main unit was unsuccessful.

The third incident occurred at a workshop in Folly Mill Lane between 4.30pm on Friday 21 August and 7.45am the following morning. Padlocks were cut to force entry and an untidy search took place but it is not clear if anything was taken.

Police Constable Maddie Barber, of Bridport police, said: "We understand the impact these incidents would have had on the business and victims involved and we are carrying out a number of enquiries to try and identify who is responsible.

"I would urge anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the relevant areas on the night of Friday 21 August 2020, or who has any information to assist our investigation, to please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200125824. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
