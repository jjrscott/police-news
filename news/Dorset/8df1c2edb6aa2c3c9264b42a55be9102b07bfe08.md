# Image appeal following reported assault in Bournemouth

04 February 2021

* * *

Officers investigating a reported assault in Bournemouth are issuing an image of a man they would like to speak to.

At around 3pm on Saturday 9 January 2021 officers were called to an alleged disturbance on Somerset Road near to the junction with Christchurch Road.

It is reported that two men - both aged in their 20s and from Bournemouth - were approached by a group of people after they parked their car on the road and allegedly almost hit one of the group's children.

During the incident, it is reported that other members of the public became involved in the altercation and the two men were assaulted. They both sustained injuries to their faces.

A 19-year-old woman and two men, aged 21 and 26, all from Bournemouth have been voluntarily interviewed in relation to an offence of assault. They have been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Police Constable Georgina McKeown, of Bournemouth police, said: "As part of my enquiries I have obtained an image of a man who was not part of the group, but is believed to have been present at the incident. I would ask anyone who recognises him to please get in touch."
