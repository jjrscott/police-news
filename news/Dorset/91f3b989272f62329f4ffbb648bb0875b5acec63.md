# Theft of electric bike in Poole â€“ image appeal

25 November 2020

* * *

Officers are issuing an image of an electric bike that was stolen from an address in Poole in a bid to locate it and identify who was responsible.

Between 5pm and 6pm on Wednesday 18 November 2020 an electric bicycle was stolen from a garden on Kings Avenue. The gate to the garden was locked, but it is believed the offender gained access over the fence.

The bike is described as an orange and yellow Giant E bicycle with the battery missing.

Police Community Support Investigator Paul Bosley, of Poole police, said: "We have been carrying out a number of enquiries into this incident, including carrying out CCTV trawls of the area.

"I am appealing to anyone who has seen a bike similar to the one pictured for sale locally in unusual circumstances to please get in touch.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area or may have information about who is responsible."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200174065. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
