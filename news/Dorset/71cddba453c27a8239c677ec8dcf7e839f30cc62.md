# Murder investigation launched in Christchurch

26 August 2018

* * *

Detectives have launched a murder investigation after a woman's body was found in Christchurch - with one man arrested.

At around 2.45am today, Sunday 26 August 2018, officers were called to an address in Park Gardens following a report that a 37-year-old local woman had sustained serious injuries.

Sadly she was pronounced dead at the scene. Her family have been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers. The coroner has been notified.

Detectives from Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT) are treating her death as suspicious and a murder investigation has been launched.

A 38-year-old Christchurch man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is assisting officers with their enquiries.

The address in Park Gardens has been cordoned off to allow crime scene investigators to carry out their examinations.

Detective Inspector Rich Dixey, of MCIT, said: "Following the discovery of the woman's body early this morning, Dorset Police has launched a murder investigation.

"We are carrying out extensive enquiries to establish exactly what happened at the address in Park Gardens. A cordon has been put in place to allow crime scene investigators to examine the scene and officers are also carrying out house-to-house enquiries in the area.

"I am appealing to anyone with information about this incident, or who may have seen or heard anything suspicious in the Park Gardens area last night or early this morning, to please contact Dorset Police as soon as possible.

"There will be an increased police presence in the area as this investigation continues and local officers can be approached with any concerns."
