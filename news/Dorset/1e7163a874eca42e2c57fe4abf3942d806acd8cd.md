# Further appeal in murder investigation in East Dorset

01 May 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating the murder of 61-year-old Guy Hedger who was shot dead in Ringwood are renewing their appeal for anyone with information to come forward.

At 3.03am on Sunday 30 April 2017 police received reports that at least two intruders had entered a house in Castlewood and Guy Hedger had been shot.

Officers attended the address and Guy was taken to hospital where he was sadly pronounced dead a short time later.

A murder investigation, conducted by Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT), is underway. The address in Castlewood remains cordoned off while crime scene investigators carry out their examinations.

Detective Chief Inspector Sarah Derbyshire, of MCIT, said: "We are still trying to establish a motive for the intruders and why this particular address in Castlewood was targeted.

"We believe there was an element of preplanning involved. Therefore we would urgently like to hear from anyone, who may have seen people or vehicles acting suspiciously in the area directly before or during the days leading up to the incident. This may have involved people in the area in general or paying particular attention to the specific house. Any small detail may help us with our investigation.

"Currently we do not believe the offenders were known to the victim, however we continue to investigate all lines of enquiry.

"I am also appealing for anyone who may have seen somebody making off from the area, maybe in a vehicle possibly driving recklessly, to contact Dorset Police as soon as possible.

"There will be a heavy police presence in the vicinity and officers from the local Neighbourhood Policing Team will be carrying out high visibility patrols to offer reassurance to the community and can be contacted with any concerns."

Guy's next of kin are being supported by specially trained officers and the family has requested privacy at this deeply traumatic time.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 30:53. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
