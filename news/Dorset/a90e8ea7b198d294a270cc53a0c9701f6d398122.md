# Officers carry out day of action on Boscombe roads

07 March 2019

* * *

A total of seven arrests were made during a day of action on roads in Boscombe.

Officers from the traffic unit joined forces with officers targeting suspected county lines networks for a day of intensification in the area on Monday 4 March 2019.

They stopped a total of 34 vehicles, with seven people arrested - six on suspicion of drug driving and one on suspicion of drink driving.

Officers carried out nine roadside drug wipes and seized four vehicles with another two issued with prohibition notices for defects and 11 motorists were reported for traffic offences. The teams also attended two road traffic collisions.

Four of those stopped during the day were targets of the Force's Op Dragoon initiative, which relies on information from the public to identify road users who pose a high risk to themselves and other motorists including those suspected of regularly driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

Inspector Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "This was the latest effort in a series of proactive days of intensification aimed at disrupting the activity of those suspected of being involved in county lines networks as well as taking action against those suspected of committed traffic offences.

"We will continue to carry out this targeted work and are grateful to information from members of the public that helps build an intelligence picture so our resources can be used more efficiently."
