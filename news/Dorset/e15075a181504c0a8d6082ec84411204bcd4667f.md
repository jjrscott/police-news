Officers investigating a serious injury road traffic collision on the A37 north of Dorchester are appealing for witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage to come forward.

At 9.44am today, Monday 5 November 2018, Dorset Police received a report of a collision on the A37 near Grimstone. The collision involved a white Scania lorry and a grey Audi A3.

Officers attended, along with the fire and ambulance services.

The driver of the Audi, a 80-year-old man from the Yeovil area, was taken to Dorset County Hospital with serious injuries. His male passenger, also from the Yeovil area, was also taken to hospital for treatment to chest and head injuries.

The lorry driver, 65-year-old man from Frome, was uninjured .
 Road closures were put in place on the A37 to allow the emergency services to deal with the incident and for an examination of the collision scene to take place. Diversions were put in place during the closures.

Police Sergeant Phil Lee, of the traffic unit, said: "We are carrying out an investigation to establish the full circumstances of this collision.

"I am appealing for any witnesses who have not already spoken to police to contact us. I would also urge anyone who was travelling in the area at the time and has dashcam fitted to their vehicles to check their footage to see if they captured the incident.

"Finally, I would like to thank motorists for their patience and understanding during the road closures, which were necessary to allow the emergency services to respond to the collision and for a detailed examination of the scene to take place."
