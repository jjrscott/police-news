# Witness appeal following reported assault in Poole

22 May 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information in relation to a reported assault in Poole to come forward.

At 10.40pm on Thursday 17 May 2018 officers were called to reports of a group of people fighting in the bar area of the Lighthouse in Kingland Road following an Elvis Presley tribute concert.

During the altercation a man aged in his 50s sustained facial injuries and had to be taken to Poole Hospital for treatment. He suffered severe bruising and cuts, as well as a shoulder injury.

Police attended and four officers were reportedly assaulted when they went to detain those believed to be involved. None of the officers required hospital treatment.

A 55-year-old man from Lytchett Minster was arrested on suspicion of assault, two women - aged 19 and 52 and from Lytchett Minster - were arrested on suspicion of assaulting a police officer and a 19-year-old Bournemouth man was arrested on suspicion of affray and assaulting a police officer. All four have been released under investigation as police enquiries continue.

Investigations Officer Keith Cutler, of Dorset Police, said: "We are continuing to make enquiries into this incident and we are appealing to anyone who was in the bar area and witnessed the reported assault to contact us.

"The bar was busy at the time of the incident and we are also keen to hear from anyone who may have captured it on their mobile phone."
