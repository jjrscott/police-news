10 March 2021

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with a reported armed robbery in Bournemouth.

Dorset Police was called at 2.22pm on Wednesday 18 December 2019 to a report of a robbery at TSB on Old Christchurch Road.

It was reported that a man entered the bank, grabbed an employee from behind around the neck and demanded money from the till, before leaving with a quantity of cash.

It was also alleged that he was in possession of a firearm.

A 49-year-old Bournemouth man was subsequently arrested in connection with the incident and released under investigation. He has now been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 19 March 2021 for offences of robbery and having an imitation firearm with intent to commit an offence.

He has also been issued with a postal requisition in relation to a further reported robbery at Barclays Bank in Old Christchurch Road in Bournemouth on Friday 13 December 2019 and will appear at court on the same date in connection with that offence.
