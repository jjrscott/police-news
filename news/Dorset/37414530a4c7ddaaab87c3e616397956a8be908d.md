# Fatal collision near Bere Regis â€“ renewed witness appeal

24 July 2018

* * *

Officers investigating a fatal collision near Bere Regis are appealing for a motorcycle rider who could be an important witness to come forward.

At 4.40pm on Saturday 14 July 2018 Dorset Police was called to reports of a three-vehicle collision on the westbound lane of the A35 Dorchester bypass near Bere Regis, just before the single carriageway becomes a dual carriageway.

The collision involved a white BMW, a white Land Rover Freelander and a silver Mercedes.

Very sadly the driver of the Freelander - named by his family as 49-year-old David Grant-Jones - sustained serious injuries and died at the scene.

His wife, 59-year-old Heather who was travelling in the front passenger seat of the Freelander, sustained serious injuries and was flown by air ambulance to Southampton General Hospital for treatment.

The driver of the BMW - a 27-year-old man from Bournemouth - sustained serious injuries and was taken to Southampton General Hospital for treatment. A 39-year-old Bournemouth man who was travelling in the BMW sustained a life-threatening head injury and was flown by air ambulance to Southmead Hospital in Bristol. A second passenger - a 26-year-old man - sustained serious injuries and was taken to Poole Hospital for treatment.

No one from the silver Mercedes was injured.

Police Sergeant Fern Graham, of the traffic unit, said: "Following our investigations we believe a blue and white sports motorcycle was in the area at the time of the collision. I would like to identify the rider of this motorcycle as I believe they could have important information that may assist my investigation. I am keen to stress this rider is not a suspect.

"I know the rider was wearing motorcycle leathers and a backpack and they stopped in a layby to adjust their backpack. They were travelling eastbound toward Bere Regis and on arrival at the scene of the collision they turned around and travelled westbound back along the A35 Puddletown bypass."

A 38-year-old man arrested for causing death by dangerous driving and causing serious injury by dangerous driving has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.
