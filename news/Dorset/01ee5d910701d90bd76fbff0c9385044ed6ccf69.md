# CCTV appeal following theft from Dorchester store

23 December 2020

* * *

Officers investigating the theft of mobile phones from a store in Dorchester are issuing CCTV images of the suspects.

At around 4.25pm on Tuesday 22 December 2020 three men entered Currys PC World at the Weymouth Avenue retail park and made off with two mobile phones.

One of the phones, a black iPhone 11 Pro, was recovered from near the store. The other phone was a gold iPhone 12 Pro.

It is believed the same men then attended Currys stores in Taunton and Exeter later that afternoon and attempted to steal phones but were not successful.

Police Constable Melissa Woodsford, of Dorchester police, said: "We are investigating this theft and I am issuing CCTV image of the suspects in the hope that someone might recognise them.

"I would urge anyone with information as to their identity, or anything else that might assist our investigation, to please contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200192507. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
