# Update â€“ woman due to appear in court in connection with fatal collision in Swanage

24 August 2018

* * *

A woman is due to appear in court in connection with a fatal collision in Swanage.

At approximately 8.40am on Monday 2 April 2018 a collision occurred between a beige Vauxhall Zafira and a pedestrian on the beachfront off Institute Road.

Very sadly, the pedestrian - a 70-year-old man from Swanage - was pronounced dead at the scene.

The driver of the Zafira, a local woman aged in her 60s, sustained minor injuries and was taken to hospital as a precaution.

A 68-year-old Swanage woman has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 14 September 2018 for an offence of causing death by careless driving.
