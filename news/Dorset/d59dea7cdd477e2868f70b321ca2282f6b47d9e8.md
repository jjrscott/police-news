# Update â€“ man due in court following reported robbery in Bournemouth

22 May 2018

* * *

A man is due to appear in court charged in connection with a reported robbery on an elderly man in Westbourne.

It is reported that at around 1.15pm on Saturday 19 May 2018 an elderly couple was walking along Poole Road toward Bournemouth and then left into Pine Tree Glen when they were approached from behind by a man on a bike.

It is alleged the man pushed the male victim, who is in his 70s, to the floor and grabbed the bag he was holding.

As a result, the victim sustained a serious injury to his face. In addition, his wife suffered a mild heart attack. Both were taken to hospital.

Detective Sergeant Andy Haworth, of Bournemouth CID, said: "Following enquiries and a detailed investigation, we have charged a 39-year-old man with robbery and he is due to appear before Poole Magistrates' Court today, Tuesday 22 May 2018.

"I would like to thank those members of public who contacted us following our CCTV appeal.

"Finally, we are still trying to locate the victim's handbag, which is described as white leather with two small handles and writing on it. It contained a purse and other personal items, including a gold gun metal box that was of great sentimental value. I would urge anyone who has seen this bag in the area to please contact Dorset Police."
