# Witness appeal following burglary in Wareham

22 January 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a burglary at a Wareham home are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Sometime between 5.20pm and 9.15pm on Monday 21 January 2019 entry was forced to a property in Stour Drive through a ground floor window and an untidy search of the premises was carried out. At this stage it is not clear what, if anything, has been stolen.

Police Constable Rob Duckmanton, of Purbeck police, said: "I am appealing for anyone who saw any suspicious activity in the area of Stour Drive on the evening of Monday 21 January 2019 to contact us.

"I would also urge anyone who was driving in the area and has dashcam fitted to their vehicles to check their footage for anything relevant.

"It is believed the offender may have been searching for jewellery in the home and we would urge anyone with valuable items such as this to make sure they are kept securely.

"Keep a written record of any valuable jewellery pieces and take photographs as this will aid police in returning any stolen property, as well as making it difficult for burglars to sell on items without detection.

"For more information on keeping your home and belongings safe visit www.dorset.police.uk/help-advice-crime-prevention/home-property-belongings/."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190010909. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
