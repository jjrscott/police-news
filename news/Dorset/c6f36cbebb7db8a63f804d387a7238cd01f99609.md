# Witness appeal following robbery in Christchurch

03 February 2020

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward as they investigate a robbery in Christchurch.

It was reported that a 15-year-old boy was walking through the Somerford area with friends at around 8.35pm on Saturday 1 February 2020 when they were approached by a group of around 30 teenagers in Edward Road. The victim was surrounded, had his phone taken from his pocket and was asked for his PIN number.

He attempted to run away and as he did so members of the group grabbed two silver chains he was wearing around his neck and they broke as he pulled away.

The victim ran to Amethyst Road where the group caught up with him and he was punched a number of times. He was threatened with a knife before he eventually gave them his PIN and was also forced to hand over his coat.

The offenders then made off along Coleridge Green toward Somerford Road.

The main offender in the group is described as being aged around 19, black, approximately six feet tall and of medium and athletic build. He was wearing a multi-coloured beanie hat and a dark-coloured top as well as dark-coloured trousers and shoes.

Another member of the group is described as being aged around 16 or 17, white and approximately six feet one inch tall. He was wearing a blue beanie hat and a navy blue jacket.

Detective Constable Laura Smith, of Eastern CID, said: "This must have been a frightening ordeal for the victim, who was subjected to an unprovoked attack by a number of older teenagers, one of whom was reported to be in possession of a knife.

"We are determined to identify those involved in this incident and are carrying out a number of enquiries. I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the robbery or who has any information to assist our investigation to please contact us.

"I would urge residents in the area to check their home CCTV for anything relevant and would also like to hear from anyone who was driving in the vicinity and may have captured the incident on dashcam."

Inspector Richard Bader, of Christchurch police, said: "I understand that residents in the area will be concerned by this kind of violence on their streets and would like to reassure members of the community that they may notice an increased police presence in the area and local officers can be approached with any concerns."
