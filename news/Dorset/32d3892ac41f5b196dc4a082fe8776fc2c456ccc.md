A man has been arrested in connection with an alleged theft from a car in Bournemouth.

It was reported that two bank cards, two mobile phones and a key for another vehicle had been taken from a Nissan Navara parked on Chaminster Road between 6pm on Wednesday 19 September 2018 and 5.45am the following day.

The cards were reportedly then used at a nearby petrol station.

A 24-year-old Bournemouth man has been arrested on suspicion of theft and fraud by false representation. The matters have been added to a schedule of offences to be taken into consideration when he appears at Poole Magistrates' Court in connection with other matters on Thursday 1 November 2018.
