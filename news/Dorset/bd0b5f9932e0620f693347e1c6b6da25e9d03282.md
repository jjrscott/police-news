21 February 2017

Police are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following two burglaries at a salon in Dorchester.

The first incident occurred sometime between 6pm on Thursday 16 February and 9am on Friday 17 February 2017 at Pzazz Hair and Beauty on Great Western Road.

Offenders gained access to the building and stole hair and beauty products from the salon along with a quantity of cash.

The second incident occurred sometime between 5pm on Saturday 18 February and 8am on Monday 20 February 2017 where offenders forced open the front door of the salon.

It is not yet known if anything was stolen during this incident.

Police Constable Andrea Watson, of Dorchester police, said: "These two burglaries have made a huge impact on the business.

"During the first incident it is believed that the offenders may have transported the stolen items out of the building in a towel bin.

"I am appealing to anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious in Great Western Road at the relevant times to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who has been offered any hair or beauty products for sale in unusual circumstances."
