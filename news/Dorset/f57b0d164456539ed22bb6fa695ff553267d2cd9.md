Detectives working with the fire service to investigate a barn fire in North Dorset are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police received a report from Dorset and Wiltshire Fire Service at 8.44pm on Sunday 25 August 2019 that firefighters were at the scene of a barn fire in the area of Crown Road in Marnhull.

Fire crews extinguished the blaze and an investigation into the cause is ongoing.

Detective Sergeant Tom Hall, of Weymouth CID, said: "We are continuing to liaise with the fire service to establish the cause of the fire, which is currently unexplained.

"We are considering the possibility that the fire may have been started deliberately and I am appealing for anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area last night or who has any information that may assist our investigation to please contact Dorset Police."
