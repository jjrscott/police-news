# Man arrested after incident in Wavell Road, Bournemouth

26 June 2016

* * *

A man has been arrested after an incident in Kinson, during which the victim was allegedly stabbed.

Dorset Police was called by the ambulance service to an address in Wavell Road at 12:15pm on Saturday 25 June, after they attended to treat a man in his 30s for a stab injury to his leg.

The suspect had left the scene and a search of the nearby area took place, assisted by armed response officers and the National Police Air Service.

At around 9:30pm that night, a 38-year-old man from Bournemouth was arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm. He remains in police custody.

The victim is still receiving hospital treatment, but his injury is not believed to be life-threatening.

The arrested man and the victim are known to each other.

Detective Constable Aston Starkie of Bournemouth CID said: "We are no longer seeking to locate the suspect, but I am still keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed this incident or its aftermath.

"We need to establish exactly what happened at Wavell Road at Saturday lunchtime. Did you see two men arguing or fighting? Alternatively, did you see the suspect leaving the area - potentially on a pedal cycle - or the victim looking for help?"

Witnesses to the incident or anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police online at www.dorset.police.uk, by emailing 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101 quoting incident number 25:188. You can also call the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimstoppers-uk.org.
