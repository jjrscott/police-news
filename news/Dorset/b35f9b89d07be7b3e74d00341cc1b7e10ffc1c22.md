# Witness appeal following dog bite incident in Bournemouth

18 February 2021

* * *

Officers are appealing for information after a young woman was bitten by a dog in Bournemouth.

The incident occurred at around 1.15pm on Tuesday 16 February 2021 on Glenferness Avenue while the victim was running. It is reported that a chocolate brown Labrador - that was wearing a halti lead - jumped up and bit her on the arm as she ran past it.

The owner of the Labrador gestured to the victim to see if she was all right, but she did not stop at the time as she did not realise she was injured.

The victim later discovered she had sustained a bite on her arm that caused piercing to the skin and bruising.

The owner of the Labrador is described as white, around five feet seven inches tall, aged in his late 50s or early 60s and of stocky build with short grey hair. He was wearing a dark-coloured raincoat and glasses.

Police Constable Jennie Skykes-Martin, of Dorset Police, said: "As the victim did not notice that she was injured until after the incident, she did not get details for the owner of the Labrador at the time.

"I am appealing for anyone who recognises the man from the description given to please get in touch.

"I would also ask the owner of the dog to come forward so that I can establish the full circumstances of what happened."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210027244. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
