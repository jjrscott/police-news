# Appeal after tools stolen from a van in Poole

12 April 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for anyone with information to come forward after theft of tools from a van in Poole.

Sometime between 8pm and 10pm on Friday 31 March 2017 a number of high-value power tools were stolen from a van which was parked on Benjamin Road.

Offenders forced open a lock which was on the back doors of the van in order to gain access.

Some of the items stolen had initials engraved on to them, including: E.U.P, H.P.J, HIVE and MR.B.

The stolen items include a brushless grinder, a combi drill, two impact drivers, a chop saw with cracked plastic casing, a set of telesteps, a reciprocating saw, two DeWalt tool boxes, a jigsaw, a circular skill saw, a 36V SDS drill and pack, which includes two 18V batteries, and a DeWalt 10.8V set with 2,300mm clamps.

Police Constable Liam Sheridan, of Poole police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who may have seen these tools for sale in unusual circumstances since the time of the incident to please get in touch.

"I would urge anyone who knows who is responsible for the theft to contact Dorset Police.

"Motorists are reminded to ensure they don't leave tools or valuable items in their vehicles overnight. Fit a visible alarm system, double lock your van, reduce access to your vehicle by parking against a garage or wall and, if possible, park somewhere well-lit and with CCTV coverage."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170047190. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
