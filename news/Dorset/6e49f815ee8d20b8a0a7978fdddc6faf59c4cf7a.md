# Overall crime continues to drop for Dorset Police

28 October 2020

Dorset Police has seen a 5.1 per cent drop in recorded crime, according to new figures released today, Wednesday 28 October 2020.

Data released by the Office for National Statistics, shows the Force has continued to see a drop in overall crime.

In early 2020 Dorset received a 'Good' grading from HMICFRS for accurate crime recording, which means the reduction by 5.1 per cent during the 12 months to the end of June 2020 is a real reduction and gives us the tenth lowest crime rate in England and Wales.

Deputy Chief Constable Scott Chilton said: "Dorset remains one of the safest counties in the country to live and visit.

"The excellent work done by all our officers and staff to keep our communities safe is reflected in this reduction.

"All crime matters to our communities and we will maintain our focus on providing an outstanding service to the people of Dorset, particularly those who are most vulnerable.

"Reducing crime is important to everyone and I hope this will help to reassure our communities that we are working with them and partners to focus on what matters."

The total number of crimes reduced from 54,677 to 51,908 over the 12-month period, a reduction of 3.6 crimes per 1,000 population.

Dorset Police and Crime Commissioner Martyn Underhill said: "This is great news for Dorset residents, as these figures demonstrate that not only do they live in one of the UK's safest counties, but one in which crime levels are dropping.

"I'd like to praise the dedication of all our officers, staff members and volunteers who have worked so hard through this very difficult period to keep people safe."
