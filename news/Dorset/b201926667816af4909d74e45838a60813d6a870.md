# Man rescued after coming into difficulty in Swanage bay

07 March 2017

A man was rescued from Swanage bay by Dorset Police Marine Section and Swanage Neighbourhood Policing Team after coming into difficulty in the water.

At around 4.30pm on Monday 6 March 2017 a man was spotted in distress in the water by a marine section officer who was on patrol in the area.

The man - aged in his 40s - was clinging to a buoy in the water after becoming exhausted and was unable to swim back to shore.

The marine section officer managed to pull the man into the boat and take him back to land where they were met by the local Neighbourhood Policing Team.

The ambulance service was alerted and the man was taken to Swanage Community hospital where he is expected to make a full recovery.

Police Constable Bruce Murdoch, of the marine section, said: "This incident demonstrated great teamwork between the marine section, Swanage Neighbourhood Policing Team and the ambulance service.

"We were able to quickly bring the man back to land and ensure that he received the required medical treatment.

"I would like to remind people to stay safe and be aware of the dangers in cold water. Check weather conditions before entering the water and don't take any risks.

"If you are swimming in the sea alone, make sure you tell someone where you are going and when you are expected to return home. Ensure that you have someone watching from the shore who is able to call for help if necessary.

"If you see someone in trouble in the water, call 999 immediately and ask for the coastguard."
