# Update â€“ man due to appear in court in connection with drugs warrant near Dorchester

10 February 2020

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in relation to a drugs warrant executed by officers near Dorchester.

At around 8.55am on Wednesday 9 January 2019 officers carried out a warrant at two properties in the Wardon Hill area.

Inside four lorry containers officers found what were suspected to be cannabis plants being grown.

A 49-year-old man from the Dorchester area was arrested in connection with the incident and has now been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Monday 17 February 2020 for an offence of producing a class B drug.

A 63-year-old man from the Dorchester area who was also arrested in connection with the incident has been released from the investigation and will face no further police action.
