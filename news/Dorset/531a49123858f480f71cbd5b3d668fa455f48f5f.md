19 January 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses after a serious road traffic collision in Poole.

Police were called at 11.07pm on Friday 18 January 2019, to reports of a collision between a pedestrian and a car on Poole Road in Branksome.

A female pedestrian aged in her 70s was taken to Poole hospital with serious injuries.

A road closure is in place between Bourne Valley Road and Eagle Road. It is likely to be in place for some time to allow investigators to examine the scene.

Police Sergeant Craig Tatton, of Dorset Police's traffic unit, said: "A full investigation into the exact circumstances of the collision is underway and I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident and has not yet spoken with officers to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am also appealing to any motorists who may have been driving in the area at the time to review their dashcam footage and report anything that may be relevant to us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 18:491. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
