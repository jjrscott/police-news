Dorset Police has charged a man with two sexual offences and is asking members of the public with additional information to come forward.

The 44-year-old from Bournemouth was charged with rape and sexual assault and appeared at Poole Magistrates' Court on Monday 7 August 2017. He is next due to appear before Bournemouth Crown Court on Thursday 7 September 2017.

It is reported the offence took place on Chatsworth Road in Poole in the early hours of Tuesday 1 August 2017 when the victim - a local man aged in his 20s - was approached by a man driving a gold-coloured Ford Focus, who offered him a lift.

Detective Constable Andy Hale, of Dorset Police's Serious Sexual Offences Team, said: "Following our investigation, we have now charged a man in connection with this offence.

"In order to complete our investigation, I am appealing for anyone with information regarding this case to come forward.

"I am also appealing to anyone who saw or heard anything in the Chatsworth Road area to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would like to remind members of the public that court proceedings are now active and I would urge them not to place anything on social media or the internet that could prejudice a further court case."
