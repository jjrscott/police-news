# Witness appeal following serious injury collision in East Dorset

14 August 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a serious injury collision in East Dorset are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

Dorset Police was called at 8.11am on Friday 14 August 2020 to a report of a collision involving a cyclist and a lorry near to the Ashley Heath roundabout on the A31.

Officers attended, along with the ambulance and fire services.

The cyclist - a man aged in his 30s from Wiltshire - was taken to Southampton General Hospital with possible life-changing injuries. His family has been informed.

The driver of the lorry was uninjured.

The road was closed in the area between Ringwood and the junction with the A338 to allow emergency services to deal with the incident. It was reopened at around 11.05am.

Inspector Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision and has not already spoken to police to please get in touch.

"I am also keen to hear from any motorists who were travelling on the A31 and may have captured anything relevant on dashcam footage.

"Finally, I would like to thank the public for their patience while the road closures were in place. These were absolutely necessary to allow for the safety of officers while dealing with the collision, treatment to be given to the injured person and an examination of the scene to be carried out."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 14:123. Alternatively, or alternatively to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
