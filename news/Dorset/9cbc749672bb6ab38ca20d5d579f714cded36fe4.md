# Appeal for information following suspicious fires in Poole

13 May 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following a number of fires in Poole, which are believed to have been started deliberately.

The fire service was called at around 3.20pm on Sunday 5 May 2019 to reports of four seats of fire on scrubland either side of the Sterte Industrial Estate.

The fires were extinguished, with approximately 20 square metres of scrubland damaged.

A similar incident was reported by the fire service in the same area shortly after 2pm on Monday 6 May 2019, with one area of fire extinguished.

Police Constable Ben McSorley, of Poole police, said: "The cause of these fires is believed to be deliberate and I am appealing to anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area on the afternoon of Sunday 5 May or Monday 6 May 2019 to contact us.

"On these occasions it is fortunate that the fire service were on the scene quickly and were able to put out the fires, however, clearly this kind of reckless behaviour can potentially have severe consequences to the local habitat and even endanger lives."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190067714. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
