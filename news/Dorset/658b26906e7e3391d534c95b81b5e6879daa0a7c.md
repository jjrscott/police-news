Detectives have renewed their appeal for witnesses following an alleged robbery at a service station in Poole.

No weapon was seen.

The alleged offender is described as white, five feet six inches tall, of slender build, with ginger hair and was unshaven. He wore a pale blue hooded top with the hood up.

A 44-year-old man arrested on suspicion of robbery has been released on police bail pending further enquiries.

Detective Sergeant Scott Johnson, of Bournemouth CID, said: "An investigation is underway and I am appealing to anyone who was in the Ashley Road area in the early hours of Monday morning and who may have seen anything suspicious, or someone matching the description given, to please call me on 101."

Witnesses and anyone with information should call Dorset Police in confidence on 101 quoting incident number 16:17. Alternatively, call the free and anonymous Crimestoppers line on 0800 555 111 where mobile phone tariffs may apply.
