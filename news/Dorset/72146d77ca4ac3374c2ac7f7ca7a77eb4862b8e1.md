# Witness appeal following serious injury collision on A31 in East Dorset

15 August 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses after a serious injury collision on the A31 in East Dorset.

Dorset Police was called just after 11pm on Wednesday 15 August 2018 following reports of a serious injury collision at Stag Gate, Almer, involving a silver Audi A3, grey Volkswagen Jetta and a blue Ford Fiesta.

The driver of the Volkswagen - a local woman aged in her 30s - sustained serious injuries and was taken to Southampton General Hospital.

As a result of the collision the Audi left the road and came to rest in a field. The driver - a man aged in his 20s and from Hampshire - sustained serious injuries and was taken to Southampton General Hospital for treatment.

None of their injuries are described as life-threatening at this time.

The driver of the Fiesta and two passengers, all from West Sussex, suffered minor injuries and were assessed at the scene before being taken to Poole Hospital.

The A31 remains closed between the Roundhouse roundabout and Bere Regis to allow the emergency services to deal with the incident.

Police Sergeant Craig Tatton, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or the driving of either vehicle prior to the incident to please contact Dorset Police. I'd also request anyone with relevant dashcam footage to get in touch.

"I wish to thank the public for their patience while the road closure is in place. This is necessary to allow emergency services to deal with the collision and for a full examination of the scene to take place."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at scit@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 15:601. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
