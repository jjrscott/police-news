# Appeal following series of burglaries in Poole and Bournemouth area

25 December 2020

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses and urging the public to remain vigilant following a series of burglaries in the Poole and Bournemouth area.

Between Monday 14 December and Tuesday 22 December 2020 six burglaries have been reported to Dorset Police and in most cases the offender or offenders gained access by smashing a window and unlocking the front door by using the keys that have been left in the locks.

It is believed these recent incidents are connected to an ongoing series, which was already under investigation by the Force.

The most recent incident occurred sometime between 4pm and 5.13pm on Tuesday 22 December 2020 at an address in Wedgwood Drive in Poole.

Other incidents occurred at addresses in Linden Road in Poole between 4.30pm and 7pm on Monday 21 December, Dorchester Road in Poole around 5pm on Sunday 20 December and Glenville Gardens in Bournemouth between 9.30am and 6.30pm on Friday 18 December.

They also targeted addresses in Montrose Drive in Bournemouth on Friday 18 December and Knights Road in Poole on Monday 14 December.

Jewellery was taken in a majority of the burglaries.

Detective Sergeant Karen Penn, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We are fully aware of the impact these offences have on victims and I would like to reassure the public that a full investigation is underway to identify the person or people responsible.

"I would appeal to anyone who saw people acting suspiciously in these areas, caught anything of relevant on their home CCTV systems or has seen jewellery being offered for sale locally in unusual circumstances to please contact Dorset Police.

"In the majority of the reports we have received, access has been gained by smashing a window and using the door key that had been left in the lock. I would urge people not to leave keys in any door and put them somewhere out of view. Please don't make life easy for these burglars."
