# Fatal collision in Dorchester – further update

07 January 2018

* * *

A man arrested in connection with a fatal collision in Dorchester has been released under investigation.

Police were called at 7.46pm on Wednesday 27 December 2017 to reports of a collision between a pedestrian and a car on The Grove. It is alleged the driver failed to stop at the scene.

The female pedestrian - 39-year-old Erika Prisacaru from Dorchester - was taken to Dorset County Hospital, but she sadly died from her injuries. She leaves behind her six-year-old son Andrei who is now being cared for by relatives. Erika's distraught family continues to be supported by specially-trained officers.

A 47-year-old local woman was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving, failing to stop at the scene of a collision and perverting the course of justice and has been released under investigation while enquiries continue. A vehicle was also seized.

A 60-year-old Dorchester man was arrested on Saturday 6 January 2018 on suspicion of perverting the course of justice and has now been released under investigation.

Officers investigating the case are continuing to appeal for anyone with information or anyone who saw a dark-coloured convertible Audi A3 in either The Grove or Brewery Square around the time of the collision on Wednesday 27 December 2017 to contact police.

Anyone with information about the collision is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 3:315. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
