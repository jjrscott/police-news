# Witness appeal following fatal road traffic collision near Dorchester

07 October 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a fatal road traffic collision near Dorchester are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

At 2.56pm on Monday 7 October 2019 Dorset Police received a report of a collision on the A37 at Wardon Hill north of Dorchester. The collision involved a black Ford Transit panel van and a white Mercedes lorry.

Officers attended, along with the ambulance and fire services. Very sadly, the driver of the van - a man aged in his 70s from Yeovil - was pronounced dead at the scene.

The man's family has been informed and are being supported by specially-trained officers.

The driver of the lorry, a man aged in his 50s and from Newport in Wales, was taken to hospital for treatment to injuries that are believed to be serious but not life-threatening.

Road closures were put in place to allow the emergency services to respond to the incident and for a detailed examination of the scene to be carried out.

Sergeant Nikki Burt, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the family of the man who died at this difficult time.

"We are carrying out an investigation to establish the circumstances of the collision and I would urge any witnesses who have not already spoken to police to please contact us.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who was travelling in the area at the time of the collision and may have relevant dashcam footage.

"Finally, I would like to thank members of the public for their patience and understanding while the road closures were in place. I appreciate closing this major route would have caused some disruption, but it was absolutely necessary to allow us to deal with the incident and for a thorough examination of the collision scene to take place safely and effectively."
