Officers investigating a serious injury collision in Christchurch are appealing for witnesses and anyone with dashcam footage to come forward.

Just after 3pm yesterday, Thursday 17 August 2017, a serious road traffic collision occurred on Barrack Road close to Christchurch police station.

A silver BMW 5 Series travelling from the Fountain roundabout toward Bournemouth was in collision with a pedestrian who was crossing Barrack Road.

The pedestrian - a local man aged in his 50s - sustained serious injuries and was taken by air ambulance to Southampton General Hospital. His condition is described as life-threatening.

The driver of the BMW was not injured.

The road was closed while emergency services dealt with the incident and for collision investigators to examine the scene. It reopened at 7.30pm.

Police Constable Angus Wilson, of the Serious Collisions Investigation Team, said: "We have already spoken to a number of people who were in the area at the time. I am appealing to anyone else who witnessed the collision and has yet to speak to officers to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly keen to hear from any motorists who were travelling in the area at the time and may have caught the incident on dashcam.

"I would like to thank motorists for their patience during the road closures."
