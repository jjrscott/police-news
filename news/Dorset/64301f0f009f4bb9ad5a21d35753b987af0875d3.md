# Dorset Police commit to connect with communities

31 July 2019

* * *

Dorset Police is introducing a new initiative in a commitment to better connect with local communities.

The Force has developed a series of plans under the Neighbourhood Engagement Contract (NEC) initiative so communities can communicate as effectively as possible with their local police.

The NEC sets out ten minimum standards and common objectives that each Neighbourhood Policing Team aim to achieve within their area. The contract and the neighbourhood plans that flow from it, aim to outline how local policing teams will engage with their local community through community meetings, partnerships and social media feeds as well as share best practice and good ideas.

The series of plans cover separate areas across Dorset and have been developed by their respective local policing Inspector.

Chief Constable James Vaughan of Dorset Police, said: “Neighbourhood Policing is at the heart of everything we do and building trust and confidence with our local communities is vital in helping us to prevent crime and bring offenders to justice.

“Our local policing teams have worked hard on these plans which provide a two-way approach to communication with local communities, working towards long term sustainable solutions to reduce crime and understand the issues of residents’ concern.

“The plans have been developed based on the bespoke local profile and diversity of the communities they serve and the engagement tactics that work best for them.

Chief Constable Vaughan added: “While it’s important we make local communities aware of our priorities, listening and engaging with our stakeholders is critical, so the contracts give my commitment to ensure this happens.

“We will be paying close attention to feedback from the public and the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner, to make the NEC initiative as successful and accessible as possible to all.”

Dorset Police & Crime Commissioner Martyn Underhill said: “Policing is far more complicated than it used to be in decades gone by – with complex crimes tackled by specialists rather than officers patrolling local beats.

“However, it’s essential that the police still need to have close links with the people they serve – that’s why I’ve set ‘Working With Our Communities’ as one of the key priorities at the heart of my Police and Crime Plan.

“I want to see Neighbourhood Policing Teams and other departments of Dorset Police doing consistently excellent work to connect with the public, from face to face engagements to increasing their use of social media.

“The Neighbourhood Engagement Contract isn’t some dry document which will be left on a shelf and forgotten about. It’s a vital piece of work, setting the agenda for how the Force will improve its relationships with our communities and build up stronger connections, while also reflecting on some of the good work that’s already being done and seeing how that can be replicated across the county.

“I am pleased to support this new initiative which provides a strong platform for the future and I will work closely with police colleagues to help ensure that all communities are well connected with the police.”

The full plans are currently being reviewed and will be published in the Autumn.
