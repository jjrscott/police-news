A woman who died at an address in Bournemouth has been named by detectives.

At around 2.40pm yesterday, Sunday 2 October 2016, officers attended an address in Harley Gardens and found that a woman had sustained serious injuries.

Sadly she was pronounced dead at the scene. Her death is being treated as suspicious and a murder investigation is underway, led by detectives from Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT).

She has been named by detectives as 26-year-old Natasha Wake, although formal identification is yet to take place. Her family are being kept updated by specially-trained officers.

A post-mortem examination is due to take place today, Monday 3 October 2016.

A 26-year-old man from Plymouth, Devon, arrested at Hengistbury Head yesterday afternoon on suspicion of murder remains assisting officers with enquiries.

Detective Chief Inspector Sarah Derbyshire, of the MCIT, said: "A major investigation is underway to establish exactly what happened at this address in Harley Gardens.

"From early enquiries it has been established that the victim and arrested man were known to each other.

"A cordon has been put in place at the address while crime scene investigators examine the scene. Officers are also carrying out house-to-house enquiries.

"I am appealing for anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious in the Harley Gardens area between Saturday 1 October and Sunday 2 October to contact Dorset Police as soon as possible."

Chief Inspector Mike Claxton, of Bournemouth police, said: "This is a tragic incident which has deeply saddened and shocked the community.

"I am confident we have the best expert team carrying out this investigation and the suspect was arrested shortly after the discovery of the body.

"There will continue to be a heightened police presence in the area while enquiries take place and our local policing team is there for residents, should they have any concerns.

"I would like to thank the community, at this difficult time, for their assistance and cooperation while officers conduct their investigations."
