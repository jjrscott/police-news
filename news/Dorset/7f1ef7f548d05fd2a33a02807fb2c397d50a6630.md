# Photo appeal following theft of clock from former court in Bournemouth

08 May 2019

* * *

Officers are investigating the theft of a clock from the former coroner's court in Bournemouth.

The building, alongside the former magistrates' court on Stafford Road, is under renovation and the wall clock had pride of place in the judge's retiring room.

It was stolen sometime between 5pm on Monday 11 March and 8am on Thursday 14 March 2019. It was reported to Dorset Police on Monday 18 March 2019.

Police Constable Jamie Davis, of Bournemouth police, said: "The site is currently under renovation and a number of people have access. We have carried out a number of enquiries in a bid to establish who took the clock but these have not proved to be successful.

"I am issuing a photo of the clock in the hope that someone may recognise it being offered for sale locally or know of its whereabouts.

"I would ask anyone with information to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190040931. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
