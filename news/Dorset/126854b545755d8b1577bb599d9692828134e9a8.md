Detectives investigating a reported burglary near Beaminster are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

It was reported that at around 10pm on Monday 3 August 2020 a caravan was broken into in Stoke Abbott and a Stihl 261 chainsaw and bill hook, which the owner uses for their work as a tree surgeon, were stolen.

Following enquiries, a 24-year-old Poole man was arrested on suspicion of burglary and he has been released under investigation.

Detective Constable George Graham, of Western CID, said: "We are continuing to investigate this matter and the property that was reported stolen has not yet been recovered.

"I would urge anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area on the night of Monday 3 August 2020 to please contact us.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who comes across any items matching the description of those reportedly stolen that are being offered for sale locally in unusual circumstances."
