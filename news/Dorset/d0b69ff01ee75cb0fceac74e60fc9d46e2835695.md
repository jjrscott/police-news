Detectives are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward as they investigate a robbery in Bournemouth that left the victim with a serious leg injury.

A man aged in his 40s was walking along Grosvenor Gardens in Boscombe at around 5.30pm on Thursday 13 February 2020 and as he approached Walpole Road two men came up to him. They knocked him to the ground and punched him to the head and body before stealing cash from the victim.

The first offender is described as white, aged in his 40s, with black hair, a black beard and moustache and spoke with an Irish accent. He was wearing a black jacket.

The second offender is described as white, aged in his 30s, with short black hair and slight stubble. He was also wearing a black jacket.

As a result of the robbery, the victim sustained a broken leg and remains in hospital awaiting surgery.
