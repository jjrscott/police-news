Detectives investigating an aggravated burglary in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At 12.35am on Sunday 1 October 2017 Dorset Police received a report of a disturbance at a property in Pottery Lane.

Three men had entered the property and threatened the victim, a woman aged in her 30s, with a knife before rummaging through drawers. The men left the property without taking anything and the victim did not sustain any serious injuries.

One of the men who entered the property is believed to be known to the victim.

The first man is described as white, aged in his late 20s, around five feet four inches tall, of average or slim build with short dark hair and stubble or a beard. He was wearing a dark tracksuit, possibly navy blue and Nike shoes or trainers.

The second man is described as pale-skinned, aged in his early to mid 20s, around five feet ten inches tall and of slim build with blond hair. He was wearing a grey tracksuit with the hood up and a dark coloured bandana across his face.

The third man is described as pale-skinned, aged in his 20s, shorter than five feet four inches tall and of slim build. He was wearing a grey tracksuit with a red bandana across his face.

Detective Sergeant Simon Austin, of Weymouth CID, said: “We are continuing to investigate this incident and have taken steps to provide reassurance and safeguarding for the victim.

“I am appealing for anyone who witnessed this incident or who saw the men matching the descriptions given in the area at the time of the offence to please contact police.”
