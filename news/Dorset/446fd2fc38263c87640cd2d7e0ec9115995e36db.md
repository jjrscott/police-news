Detectives investigating an alleged assault in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward - with one man charged.

It was reported to Dorset Police that at around 5.20pm on Monday 15 August 2016 a man aged in his 70s was assaulted in Great George Street in the town.

He sustained injuries to his face and a fractured hand and was taken to Dorset County Hospital for treatment.

Detective Constable Sarah Desmond, of Weymouth CID, said: "As part of my investigation I am aware that there may have been a number of other people who were in the area at the time of the reported incident and may have important information.

"I would ask these people to please contact Dorset Police urgently."

A 41-year-old man from Weymouth has been charged with assault and is next due to appear at Dorchester Crown Court on Friday 16 September 2016.
