# Witness appeal following sheep worrying incident in Dorchester

25 January 2017

* * *

Police are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following a sheep worrying incident in Dorchester.

At approximately 12.30pm on Monday 23 January 2017 around 300 sheep were chased into a corner by a black spaniel dog in a field near Maiden Castle.

The dog was accompanied by a man who was described as being of large build.

Police Constable Claire Dinsdale, of the Rural Crime team, said: "A member of the public attempted to disturb this incident by shouting at the dog owner.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious in the area at the time to please contact police.

"Sheep worrying is a crime, dogs should be kept on a lead when near livestock. At this time of year ewes are carrying lambs and even the presence of dogs can cause them real distress which could lead to them losing their lambs."

No arrests have been made.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 23:410. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
