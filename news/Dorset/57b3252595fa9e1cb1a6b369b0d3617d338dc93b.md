# Statement following the death of George Floyd

04 June 2020

* * *

Dorset Police's Chief Constable James Vaughan has issued a statement to the county's communities following the death of George Floyd in America.

He said: "The death of George Floyd has left his family, loved ones and friends devastated and heartbroken. Communities in the United States, here in the United Kingdom and across the world are angry and outraged. For some members of our community, those feelings will also be heightened as they perceive they are truly not wanted in the places where they live and raise their families.

"Our experiences here in Dorset during the early stages of COVID-19 saw communities come together to find the positives from tragedy, to reach out to each other and challenge negative behaviour.

"This is a time for communities and individuals to overtly speak out in support of those from Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic communities, to reaffirm our collective rejection of racism and hate.

"Throughout our policing of COVID-19, Dorset Police has stressed the importance of community and working with our partners and individuals to ensure that the legitimacy of policing is maintained. The principles of neighbourhood policing and long standing within Dorset Police and remain a cornerstone in our communities. That is why, collectively as a force, we align ourselves with those who wish to express their feelings in a peaceful but clear manner.

"We should help facilitate that expression of feeling, which occurs at a time of a public health crisis. Dorset Police believes it essential that the core message of standing up against hate and racism should be respected and allowed, while we have the ability to maintain law, order and safety in our communities.

"Racism and all forms of discrimination undermine our common humanity and are not acceptable in any civilised society."
