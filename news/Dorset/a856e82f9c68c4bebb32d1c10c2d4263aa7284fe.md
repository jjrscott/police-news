# Update â€“ appeal following assault on teenage boy in Blandford

26 February 2019

* * *

A teenager has been given a youth caution in connection with an assault on a 17-year-old boy in Blandford.

An appeal was issued following an altercation that occurred at around 9.40pm on Saturday 12 January 2019 near to the Crown and Anchor pub on West Street. It was reported the victim was pushed and repeatedly punched in the face, leaving him with a fractured nose and swelling around his left eye.

A 17-year-old local boy has subsequently attended for a voluntary police interview in connection with the incident and has been given a youth caution. The outcome was supported by the victim.
