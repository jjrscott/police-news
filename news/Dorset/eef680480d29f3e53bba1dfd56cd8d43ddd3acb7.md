# Dorset Police issues advice for Bournemouth Air Festival 2016

18 August 2016

* * *

The Air Festival, which starts today, has been an annual event since 2008 attracting over seven million visitors during its lifetime. The Force is asking the public to follow some 'plane' and simple advice to keep the weekend safe and enjoyable for all.

Chief Inspector Chris Weeks, the Force's operational lead for events, said: "The Bournemouth Air Festival is one of the highlights of the year for residents and visitors to Dorset's coast.

"We work closely with event organisers, other emergency services and a host of other partners to ensure the weekend runs smoothly, but we need the help of the public to prevent people from becoming victims of crime."

The Force is issuing its advice for the weekend, which members of the public are being urged to familiarise themselves with.

Chief Inspector Weeks continued: "Our advice is centred on five 'plane' and simple messages.

"Protect your property: never leave your belongings unattended, keep bags closed and zipped, valuables out of sight as much as possible and never be tempted to leave your valuables in your vehicle.

"Locate event staff, police officers and other emergency service personnel who will be available on each day of the festival. They will be on hand to answer any enquiries or concerns. Also point them out to young children and encourage them to speak to us if they get lost.

"Remain Alert and aware. Vigilance can go a long way to preventing crimes from happening in the first place, from keeping a close eye on your property to reporting any suspicious behaviour or objects to event staff or police.

"The festival has some fantastic Night-time entertainment to offer. If you will be attending in the evenings remember to stay with friends, drink responsibly and never leave drinks unattended.

"Ultimately, we want to encourage event-goers to Enjoy themselves and reassure them that police and partners will be out in force to keep them safe."

More safety information is available on the Dorset Police website, and members of the public can follow the Force on Facebook (Dorset Police) and Twitter (@DorsetPolice) to get updates throughout the festival.
