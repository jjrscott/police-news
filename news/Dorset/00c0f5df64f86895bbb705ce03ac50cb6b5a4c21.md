A man has been charged in connection with a fire that is alleged to have been started deliberately in Dorchester.

Dorset Police was called at 4.07am on Monday 29 June 2020 to a report of a fire at a block of flats on Bitter End.

The surrounding roads were closed to allow emergency services to deal with the incident and reopened at around 7.30am. The building was also evacuated as a precaution. There were no reports of any injuries.

A 27-year-old Dorchester man has been charged with arson with intent to endanger life. He appeared at Poole Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 15 July 2020 and is next due to appear at Bournemouth Crown Court on Thursday 13 August 2020.

A 42-year-old man from Dorchester previously arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life remains on police bail pending further enquiries.
