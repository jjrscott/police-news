# Investigation following death of a man in Bournemouth

29 October 2019

* * *

Detectives investigating the death of a man in Bournemouth are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police was called at 9.37pm on Monday 21 October 2019 to a report of a sudden death of a man aged in his 50s in an address off St Michael's Road.

An initial post-mortem took place on Thursday 24 October 2019, but the cause of death has not yet been established.

At this time, the man's death is being treated as unexplained and enquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances.

His next of kin has been informed and the coroner notified.

Detective Inspector Sarah Gillion, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We are treating this as a suspected drug-related death.

"I would urge anyone who has any information that may assist my investigation, no matter how small, to please come forward.

"I also want to get a message out to anyone involved in the misuse of drugs and make them aware of the risks associated with taking suspected drugs. You can never be sure of the potential effect it may have on you."

Following enquiries, four Bournemouth men, aged 20, 25, 35 and 40, were arrested on suspicion of administering poison with intent to endanger life or inflict grievous bodily harm. The two men aged 20 and 25 have also been arrested on suspicion of supplying a controlled drug of class A, B and C.

All four men have been released under investigation while enquiries continue.
