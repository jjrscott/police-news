# Dorset Police launch Police Constable recruitment campaign

04 July 2016

* * *

From today, Monday 4 July, Dorset Police has opened a recruitment process for the role of Police Constable. Recruitment will run until Friday 15 July 2016.

Whilst final numbers will depend on Force demand, Dorset Police intends to recruit between 80 and 100 new officers to join the Force from March 2017. Details of the campaign are available online.

The Dorset Police website contains all the necessary information for those interested in the post, including a recruitment brochure which outlines the application process in full. In order to advance the best candidates for the role and to handle high levels of demand, applicants must complete an online pre-assessment selection tool before proceeding to the next stage.

Dorset Police needs people form diverse backgrounds with different skills and experiences to help us deliver excellence in local policing across Dorset.

As a Police Constable, you would carry out a huge variety of roles, working closely with the community to tackle crime and disorder at a local level. To be eligible to apply, you must be aged 18 years or over by Friday 9 September 2016.

Chief Constable, Debbie Simpson said: "We are looking for committed, proactive and conscientious individuals to join our Police team. The job is extremely rewarding and I would urge anyone looking for an opportunity to make a difference to individuals and communities in Dorset to visit our website and read more.

"We are expecting a high volume of applicants, considering the desirability of the position and the opportunity to work in one of the country's most picturesque and varied counties.

"I ask prospective applicants to read all the information we have provided, in particular the Police Recruitment Brochure, before trying to contact the Force. This will mean that our teams have the best possible capability to process everyone's applications as efficiently as possible."

Dorset Police and Crime Commissioner, Martyn Underhill said: "Now is a great time to join the policing family. Recruits will learn new skills and make a difference to our communities by helping them to stay safe and feel safe.

"Dorset is a great location, with a real mix of urban and rural locations coupled with our 88 miles of coastline."
