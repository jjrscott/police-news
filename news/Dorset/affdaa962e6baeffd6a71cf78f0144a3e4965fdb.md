# Renewed appeal following fail-to-stop collision near Sherborne

30 December 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a fail-to-stop collision where an elderly man was knocked from his mobility scooter near Sherborne are renewing their appeal for witnesses to come forward.

Just before 2pm on Wednesday 16 December 2020 a local man aged in his 80s was riding his mobility scooter along an unnamed road in the village of Alweston when he was struck by an overtaking silver vehicle as he attempted to turn right.

The mobility scooter was pushed down the road as a result of the collision, before the victim was tipped from the scooter.

The victim fell off the scooter into the road and was taken to hospital for treatment. He sustained a fractured pelvis, as well as nasty cuts to his head and right arm, and was later released to be cared for at home by his family.

The collision was witnessed by another motorist who went to the victim's aid. The driver of the offending vehicle, possibly an estate car, failed to stop at the scene.

Police Constable Mike Burt, of the traffic unit, said: "We have been carrying out a number of initial enquiries into this collision, but have so far been unable to locate the car involved.

"It is believed the car could be a silver BMW estate and I am renewing my appeal for anyone who has seen a silver car with damage locally to please get in touch.

"I am still keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the incident or has relevant dashcam footage to assist my enquiries."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at scit@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200188928. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
