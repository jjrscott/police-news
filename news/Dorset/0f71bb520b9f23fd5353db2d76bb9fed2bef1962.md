# Witness appeal following reported stabbing in Bournemouth

06 December 2017

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a reported stabbing in Bournemouth.

At 6.37am today, Wednesday 6 December 2017, officers were called to a disturbance at an address in Crabton Close Road.

It is reported that a man armed with a knife forced his way into the property and a fight broke out. The man sustained a stab wound to his shoulder and head injuries and was taken to hospital for treatment. A woman who was inside the address was uninjured. A second man who was also inside the address left the scene.

Detective Sergeant Stewart Gates, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the Crabton Close Road area this morning and saw anything suspicious to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly keen to identify the man who was inside the address and left before officers arrived as I believe he may have important information that could assist my investigation. We also need to ensure that he did not sustain any injuries during the incident."

The injured man, a 27-year-old man from Christchurch, has been arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary. A 30-year-old local woman has been arrested on suspicion of wounding with intent. They are both currently assisting officers with their enquiries.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170189223. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
