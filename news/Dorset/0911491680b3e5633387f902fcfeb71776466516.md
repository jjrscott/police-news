# Witness appeal following dog incident in Poole

22 August 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a woman sustained an injury following an incident with a dog in Poole.

At around 3pm on Tuesday 15 August 2017 a woman was walking her West Yorkshire Terrier on the Millfield Estate when a black Alsatian ran up to her, knocked her over and began attacking her dog.

The woman - who is aged in her 70s - sustained an injury to her finger in the incident. Her dog was described as being traumatised but uninjured.

The owner of the Alsatian is described as a woman, of slim build and with dark hair.

Police Constable Phillip Riggs, of Bournemouth police, said: "The victim says this is the second occasion she has experienced a problem with this dog attacking hers. She was left in a lot of pain following the incident.

"I am keen to trace the owner of the dog and I would ask anyone who knows who she is to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170126310. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
