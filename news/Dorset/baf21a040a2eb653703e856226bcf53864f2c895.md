# Witness appeal following dog attack in Bournemouth

01 July 2016

* * *

Police in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a vicious dog attack in the town.

At approximately 6.20pm on Friday 24 June 2016 a woman was walking her Staffordshire Bull Terrier on a lead near to the public toilets on West Cliff Green when they were attacked by a tanned coloured Mastif-type dog, which was with its owner but not on a lead.

The Mastif-type dog viciously bit the victim's dog. It sadly died as a result of the injuries it sustained. The victim - a 46-year-old local woman - also sustained a cut to her head as she tried to rescue her pet.

The owner of the Mastif-type dog is described as a black man, aged 30 to 35 years old, of medium build and wearing a scarf on his head. He was with a white woman and they left the scene in a silver Audi A3.

Police Constable Liz Cook, of Bournemouth police, said: "This was a particularly nasty attack on a dog that was muzzled and on a lead and its owner.

"Enquiries are underway to identify the man and dog. I believe this incident was witnessed by a number of people and would urge anyone who saw what happened, or captured any of it on their mobile phone, to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 24:347. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
