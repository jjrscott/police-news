# Dorset Police asks for the publicâ€™s help in neighming its udderly awesome new crime fighting tractor!

13 June 2017

* * *

A tractor that has been given police branding is set to take to the fields of Dorset over the next year and Dorset Police is calling on the public's help in naming it.

Members of the public are encouraged to put forward name suggestions on the Dorset Police Facebook account or by emailing competitions@dorset.pnn.police.uk - with a winner being chosen by the Force's Rural Crime Team.

The vehicle will be on the moooove at all major rural events this summer, including the Dorset County Show, Gillingham and Shaftesbury Show, Melplash Show, Broadstone Family Fun Day and the Emergency Services Family Fun Day.

The tractor has been loaned to Dorset Police by tractor importer Kioti UK Ltd and dealers MJ Fry Agricultural Engineers, in order to help police encourage members of the public to report crime and engage with rural communities. NFU Mutual has also agreed to insure the vehicle to enable it to support crime prevention activities in other areas of the country.

Police Constable Claire Dinsdale, of the Rural Crime Team, said: "It is vital we explore every opportunity in encouraging members of the public to report rural crime. It is only with this intelligence we can target and disrupt those who operate in the countryside. We're looking forward to seeing a bumper crop of your corny and a-maize-ing suggestions for our tractor!

"If you witness a suspected rural crime in action, call 999 immediately and ask for the police. For all other enquires call Dorset Police on 101 or contact us online. If anyone wishes to report information anonymously, please contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."

Dorset Police's Rural Crime Team works proactively alongside colleagues, partners and volunteers to increase engagement with rural communities, target criminals who offend in our rural areas and provide bespoke crime prevention advice.
