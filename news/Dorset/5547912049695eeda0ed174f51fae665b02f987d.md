# Appeal for witnesses following vehicle stop in Bournemouth

14 September 2017

* * *

Officers investigating a possible incident of impersonating a police officer are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 6.30pm yesterday, Wednesday 13 September 2017, it was reported that a vehicle had been seen driving in Barrack Road in Christchurch with a covert blue light and what appeared to be a camera or speed detection equipment.

A blue BMW 330 was stopped in Riverside Avenue in Bournemouth and a search of the driver revealed what appeared to be a fake warrant card and a covert earpiece.

The vehicle has been seized and the driver, a 21-year-old Christchurch man, is assisting officers with their enquiries.

Police Constable Bill Nightingall, of East Dorset police, said: "We are making further enquiries into this incident.

"I am appealing for anyone who may have been stopped by a man in plain clothes claiming to be a police officer driving a blue BMW in the East Dorset area to contact me."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170143042. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
