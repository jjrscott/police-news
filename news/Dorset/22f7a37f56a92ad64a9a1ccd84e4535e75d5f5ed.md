# Renewed appeal following fatal collision in Bournemouth

18 September 2018

* * *

Officers are renewing their appeal for witnesses to a fatal collision in Bournemouth.

At around 2.30pm on Sunday 9 September 2018, the collision occurred on Ringwood Road outside the Turbary Retail Park involving a green Kawasaki motorcycle and a pedestrian.

Very sadly the pedestrian, a 74-year-old man from Poole, sustained very serious injuries and died at the scene.

The motorcycle had travelled from the Clock roundabout toward Mountbatten roundabout. It is not known how the pedestrian came to be walking in the carriageway.

The rider of the motorcycle - a 50-year-old man from Ferndown - sustained serious injuries and was taken to Poole Hospital for treatment. He has since been discharged.

Ringwood Road was closed while the emergency services attended and dealt with the incident. The air ambulance also landed but was not needed to take any patients to hospital.

Police Sergeant Nikki Burt, of the traffic unit, said: "This was a very busy time of the day but so far we have had very few witnesses come forward so I am renewing our appeal.

"We are looking to find anyone who may have witnessed the collision or the actions of the motorcyclist or the movements of the pedestrian prior to the incident.

"In particular, we are trying to identify a possible witness who stopped at the scene. It is a man who was driving a silver car. From what we know he stopped his car in the outside lane and ran back to help.

"Were you travelling along Ringwood Road around the time and have a dashcam? You could hold vital footage even if you didn't capture the actual collision.

"If you have any information that could assist with the investigation, please come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at scit@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 9:258. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
