# Witness appeal following robbery in Poole

18 July 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating a robbery in a park in Poole are asking for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward.

The incident happened at approximately 5.15pm on Friday 6 July 2018 when a local 14-year-old girl was in Alexandra Park in the area of the zip wire together with two friends. The teenage girl was suddenly pushed to the ground by a man and had her phone, a Samsung S7 Edge in rose gold, stolen. The offender then made off via the Alexandra Road exit toward the direction of Ashley Road.

The man is described as white and six feet tall. He had dark hair and was wearing a long-sleeved fleece jumper with blue or green stripes, grey tracksuit bottoms and trainers.

Detective Constable Kate Rhodes, of Poole and Bournemouth CID, said: "This robbery happened in daylight hours and left the young victim shaken. Fortunately, she was not physically injured.

"We are still conducting a number of enquiries, including whether CCTV is available.

"I am appealing for any witnesses to the incident or anyone who saw a man running away from the location or knows who is responsible for this robbery to come forward.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who has been offered such a phone in unusual circumstances."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180105917. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
