A silver Toyota Corolla, travelling from Wimborne to Blandford, collided with a blue Ford Focus, which was going in the opposite direction.

The rear passenger, an 84-year-old woman, was airlifted to Southampton with life-threatening injuries. All three occupants are from the Trowbridge area.

The three occupants of the Ford - a 75-year-old male driver, a 72-year-old woman and an 89-year-old man - are all from the Blandford area and were taken to Poole hospital with slight injuries.

Fire and ambulance services as well as air ambulance attended the scene.

Police Constable Angus Wilson, of the traffic unit, said: "This was a serious collision and I am appealing for any witnesses to the incident or the manner of driving of either vehicle leading up to the collision to please come forward.

"We are aware that the incident and subsequent road closures have caused great inconvenience to many motorists and I would like to thank everyone for their understanding and patience.

"These measures are necessary to allow the emergency services to safely deal with the scene and collision investigators to find out what happened."
