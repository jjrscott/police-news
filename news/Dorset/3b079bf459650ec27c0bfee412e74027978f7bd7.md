# Man jailed for sexual assault in Bournemouth

24 March 2021

* * *

A man who sexually assaulted a woman as she slept has been jailed for two years.

Darren Martyn Shaw, aged 35 and of Talbot Road, Bournemouth, was sentenced at Bournemouth Crown Court on Monday 22 March 2021 after admitting an offence of assault by penetration at an earlier hearing at the same court.

The victim, who was 18 at the time, went out with friends on the evening of Tuesday 1 January 2019 in Bournemouth town centre. In the early hours of Wednesday 2 January 2019 her group of friends met up with the victim's boyfriend and the defendant, who was known to her boyfriend but the victim had not met before.

They all went back to the victim's address. The victim went to sleep and she woke at around 7am to find the defendant sexually assaulting her.

She woke her boyfriend and told him what had happened. Police were called and officers attended the address, where Shaw was arrested.

Detective Constable Michael White, of Bournemouth CID, said: "Darren Shaw subjected his victim to a sexual assault while she was asleep and could in no way consent.

"This was a horrifying ordeal for the victim to go through and I would like to praise her for the courage she has shown in coming forward and supporting the police investigation so that we could ensure Shaw faced justice for his actions.

"I hope this case demonstrates that we will take reports of this nature very seriously and will do all we can to support victims and ensure offenders are identified and held responsible."
