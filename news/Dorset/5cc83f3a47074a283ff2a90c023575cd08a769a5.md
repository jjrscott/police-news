# Unprovoked assault in Poole â€“ witness appeal

30 August 2019

* * *

A man who was assaulted during an unprovoked incident in Poole is issuing a photo of his facial injuries in a bid to find the person responsible.

At 1.29am on Saturday 24 August 2019 Dorset Police received a report of a man being assaulted on Glenair Avenue at the junction with Commercial Road.

Luke Chamberlain, 33, was repeatedly punched and kicked by an unknown attacker as he made his way home. He sustained bruising and swelling to his face and was taken to hospital for treatment.

The offender is described as a white man aged in his 40s and of average build with blond hair and a square jawline. He was wearing a light blue short-sleeved shirt, denim trousers and dark-coloured shoes.

Police Constable Nina Tait, of Poole police, said: "This was an unprovoked assault that resulted in Luke sustaining nasty injuries to his face and I am carrying out a number of enquiries in a bid to locate the offender.

"It is believed that the offender was dropped off by a taxi a short time before the assault took place, but we have so far been unable to locate the driver.

"I am appealing to the driver of the taxi to come forward as they may have vital information to assist my investigation.

"I would urge anyone who may have witnessed the incident and has not yet spoken to police to get in touch immediately."
