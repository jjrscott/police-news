# Update â€“ appeal after man found with head injury in Bournemouth

16 January 2019

* * *

A man arrested in connection with an incident where another man was found with a head injury in Bournemouth will face no further police action.

Dorset Police was called at 2.24am on Tuesday 21 August 2018 to a report that a man who was located on Carysfort Road had been taken to hospital after sustaining a potentially serious head injury.

An investigation was launched to establish the cause of the injury and a 32-year-old man from Bournemouth was arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent. He was released under investigation.

Following detailed enquiries by detectives, there has been no evidence reported to suggest any kind of assault has taken place and the arrested man has been released from under investigation.
