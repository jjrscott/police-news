# Witness appeal following fail-to-stop collision in Poole

12 August 2016

Police investigating a serious injury fail-to-stop collision in Poole have issued an appeal for witnesses.

The collision occurred on Thursday 4 August 2016 at approximately 4.40pm at the traffic light junction on Longfleet Road and Fernside Road.

A motorcycle, being ridden by a 58-year-old man from Poole, was crossing the junction on a green light travelling toward Poole Hospital when he was in collision with a white Ford Transit-style van that had been waiting to turn right from Fernside Road onto Longfleet Road.

The collision caused the motorcyclist to leave the road before colliding with a wall. The rider sustained fractures to his hand and had to undergo surgery.

The van stopped briefly at the side of the road but the driver did not get out and he drove away.

Police Constable Kevin Farenden, of Dorset Police's Traffic Unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who saw this incident and has not yet spoken to officers to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would also urge the van driver, or anyone who knows who was involved, to please get in touch."
