# Update following CCTV appeal after alleged assault in Sherborne

01 October 2020

* * *

Following a CCTV appeal a boy has come forward in relation to an investigation into an alleged assault and theft of a mobile phone in Sherborne.

It was reported that at around 11.20pm on Saturday 19 September 2020 the victim - a 19-year-old local man - was with friends at the White Hart pub in Cheap Street when he became involved in a verbal altercation with a man from another group.

It is alleged that when the victim left the pub, he was assaulted by the man. He was taken to hospital and received treatment for swelling to his head and he also sustained grazes to his shoulder and neck.

Later the victim realised his phone - a black iPhone 11 - had gone missing during the incident.

Following an appeal a 17-year-old boy from Gillingham has come forward and is assisting with the investigation. No arrests have been made.
