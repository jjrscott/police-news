# Witness appeal following fatal road traffic collision near Bere Regis

13 October 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to a fatal road traffic collision near Bere Regis to come forward.

At around 10.30am today, Friday 13 October 2017, a road traffic collision occurred on the A31 at the White Post junction.

The collision involved a red Volkswagen Passat, a white single decker Volvo coach and a white Volvo skip loader.

Sadly, the driver of the Volkswagen - a 55-year-old man from Southampton - was pronounced dead at the scene. His family have been informed and the coroner has been notified.

The driver of the coach, who did not have any passengers in his vehicle, received minor injuries and did not require hospital treatment. The driver of the skip loader was uninjured.

The A31 was closed in both directions between the Bere Regis roundabout and the Roundhouse roundabout while emergency services dealt with the incident and collision investigators examined the scene. Motorists were advised to avoid the area and seek alternative routes, with diversions put in place. The road was reopened around 4.30pm.

Police Sergeant Phil Lee, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was travelling along the A31 and witnessed this collision to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who saw the manner of driving of either vehicle immediately before the collision or has a dash cam fitted in their vehicle that may hold vital evidence.

"I appreciate the road closures on this busy route would have caused inconvenience to motorists and I would like to reassure them that they were absolutely necessary to allow the emergency services to carry out their work and to allow for a proper examination of the scene."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at scit@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 13:141. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
