# Dorset Police support national knife surrender campaign

14 December 2016

* * *

Dorset Police and the Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) implement knife surrender bins in three police stations to support the 'Save A Life Surrender Your Knife' campaign.

The Home Office backed campaign 'Save A Life Surrender Your Knife' is operating across the UK and aims to raise awareness of the issues of knife crime and youth violence.

Although Dorset has few issues with knife crime and is one of the safest places in the UK to live, visit and work, the Force is still keen to support any initiative which encourages this trend to continue.

The knife surrender bins are now available in Bournemouth, Poole and Weymouth police station enquiry offices and can be utilised for depositing any bladed instrument easily and safely. They will be available until the end of January 2017.

Members of the public are asked to ensure that any knives being brought to the surrender bins are carried discretely, secured safely in a bag and are covered with protection such as bubble wrap and cardboard to prevent injury.

Assistant Chief Constable Mark Cooper said: "Incidents involving bladed weapons can be particularly tragic and I am pleased that Dorset does not have many of these cases.

"Carrying knives and other bladed weapons in public will not be tolerated and anyone found doing so will be dealt with robustly. The introduction of the surrender bins is yet another way to keep our communities safer and provides an opportunity for knives to be disposed of anonymously."

Organised by the Raising Aspirations Charity, in partnership with the British Ironworks Centre, the 'Save A Life Surrender Your Knife' campaign has also been implemented by other UK police forces with a target of eliminating 100,000 weapons off the streets of the UK.

All knives surrendered will be used to create a National Monument against Violence and Aggression, which will be in the form of a 24 foot Angel. Upon completion, the angel will be displayed on the Fourth National Plinth in Trafalgar Square. In addition, the charity works closely with families who have been directly affected by knife crime and violence and invite anyone who has lost a loved one to engrave an everlasting message on a blade which can be attached to the monument.

Assistant Chief Constable Mark Cooper continues: "With the zombie knife ban being implemented in the UK in August this year, this is an opportune time for members of the public who may still have such items in their possession to hand them in.

"As well as zombie knives, it is important to remember that it is illegal to carry a knife in public without good reason and it is always illegal to carry, buy or sell any type of banned knife such as lock or flick knives, disguised knives and sword sticks."

Acting Dorset Police and Crime Commissioner, Colin Pipe, said: "Dorset is one of the safest counties in the country, with very few knife crimes and it is vital we maintain this record. The Commissioner and I are keen to support any initiative which continues this positive trend, helping to keep our communities safe."
