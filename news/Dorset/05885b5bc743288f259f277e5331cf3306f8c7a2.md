# Update â€“ witness appeal following reported burglaries in Bournemouth

09 October 2018

* * *

A woman arrested in connection with two reported burglaries in Bournemouth has been released without charge.

It was reported that between 10pm and 11pm on Wednesday 29 August 2018 a woman was found inside two different flats in Seabourne Road in the Southbourne area of the town. On both occasions it was alleged that she was discovered by residents of the flat, challenged and then left the address. Nothing was stolen.

A 38-year-old Bournemouth woman was arrested on suspicion of burglary and, following an investigation by detectives, has now been released without charge.

Officers are not looking for anyone else in connection with these incidents.
