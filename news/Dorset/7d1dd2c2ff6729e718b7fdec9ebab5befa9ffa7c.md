# Update â€“ man due in court in connection with reported assault in Sherborne

12 February 2018

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with an alleged assault on a bus driver in Sherborne.

At 8.37am on Thursday 12 October 2017 Dorset Police received a report of an incident on the A30, which involved a Nippy Bus double-decker school bus and a black BMW 1 Series.

It was reported that the driver of the car came out of his vehicle and entered the bus before hitting the victim.

The bus driver sustained facial injuries and a wound to his arm and was taken to hospital.

A 25-year-old man from Yeovil was arrested and has now been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Monday 19 February 2018 for an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
