Two teenage boys are due to appear in court in connection with a reported robbery in Bournemouth.

It was alleged that at around 2.45am on Wednesday 28 August 2019 a 16-year-old boy was robbed after being approached by a group of teenagers in Winton Recreation Park on Fitzharris Avenue.

It was reported that one of the group hit the victim on the head, causing him to lose consciousness. When the victim gained consciousness it is alleged that he was threatened with a knife and his bag was stolen, which contained a mobile phone and a quantity of cash.

The victim sustained minor injuries to his head and was taken to hospital for treatment.

A 16-year-old Bournemouth boy has been charged with robbery in relation to the incident and a 16-year-old boy from New Milton has been charged with possessing a knife blade or pointed article in a public place and possession of a weapon for the discharge of a noxious liquid, gas or electrical incapacitation, namely a pepper spray.

Both boys are due to appear at Poole Youth Court on Tuesday 7 January 2020.

A third boy, aged 15 and from Bournemouth, who was arrested in connection with the incident was released from police bail without charge and will face no further action.
