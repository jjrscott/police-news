A woman has been arrested in connection with a reported serious assault in Bournemouth town centre.

The assault is alleged to have occurred in the early hours of Friday 9 August 2019, with a 50-year-old man sustaining serious head injuries.

Dorset Police received a report from the ambulance service that a man had been assaulted at The Triangle and was being taken to hospital for treatment. His condition was not life-threatening.

The victim was reportedly approached by a group of people, one of whom allegedly punched him to the head, causing him to fall to the ground face first. While he was unconscious, it is alleged the group stole the victim's bank card and mobile phone.

Following a CCTV appeal and enquiries by officers, a 44-year-old woman, of no fixed abode, has been arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm and robbery and has been released under investigation.
