* * *

Officers investigating an incident of criminal damage at a Wimborne pre-school are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

It was reported that between 4.30pm and 6.30pm on Sunday 3 September 2017 a group of teenagers had gained access to the grounds of Down in the Woods Pre-School in Chichester Walk in Merley.

A considerable amount of damage was caused to the outside play area including a hole in the roof of a metal shed, damage to a playhouse and a plastic toy box. It is estimated the total cost of the damage is more than Â£1,000.

Officers have made a number of enquiries into the incident, including house to house enquiries and CCTV enquiries.

The boys involved were believed to be in their early teens. One was described as being aged 12 to 14 years old and was wearing a blue short-sleeved top with white stripes down the side. He was also wearing a backpack.

Police Constable Julie Payne, of Dorset Police, said: "I would urge anyone who witnessed this incident or who has any information to please contact me.

"This pre-school has been subjected to criminal damage in the past and it is distressing to all involved. We have offered crime prevention advice and will continue to liaise with the pre-school to identify those responsible."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170137463. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
