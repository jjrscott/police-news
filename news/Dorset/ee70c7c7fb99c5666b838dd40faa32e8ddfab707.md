# Update â€“ man charged in connection with reported assault in Ferndown

12 September 2018

* * *

A man has been charged in connection with an alleged assault in Ferndown.

It was reported that a local woman aged in her 70s was walking her dog along Church Road near to the Village Hall when the incident occurred at around 1.40pm on Tuesday 4 September 2018.

A man riding a bicycle along the footpath said something to her and she challenged him about cycling on the pavement. He then reportedly stopped, got off his bike and shouted at the woman before he pushed her.

It was alleged that the man then grabbed her by the throat and started pushing her backwards.

Following a photo appeal issued by police, a 34-year-old man from Ferndown was arrested and has now been charged with assault. He is due to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 28 September 2018.
