# Update: appeal following reported fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth

10 July 2017

* * *

Officers have arrested a man following a reported fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth.

At approximately 10.30pm on Friday 7 July 2017 a collision occurred outside Coffee and Dice on Christchurch Road involving a red Nissan X-Trail and a pedestrian.

The pedestrian - a 20-year-old Bournemouth woman - sustained serious injuries and was taken to hospital for treatment.

The red Nissan X-Trail reportedly failed to stop at the scene.

A 53-year-old man from Hampshire has been arrested in the Sussex area on suspicion of driving offences and released under investigation.

Police Constable Tim Gooding, of the traffic unit, said: "I am still appealing to anyone who knows the current location of the vehicle, or who may have seen it travelling out of the county through East Hampshire to the Worthing area of Sussex since the time of the collision, to contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 7:568. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
