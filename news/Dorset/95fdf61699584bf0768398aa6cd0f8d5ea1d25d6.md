# Witness appeal following indecent exposure incident in Bournemouth

04 January 2021

* * *

Officers investigating an indecent exposure incident in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The victim - a 17-year-old girl - was on Court Road at the junction with Charminster Avenue at around 9.45pm on Friday 18 December 2020 when she was tapped on the shoulder. It is reported that she turned around and saw a male teenage boy indecently exposing himself. He spoke to the victim and made a suggestive comment.

A member of the public came out of a house in the nearby area and the boy ran off down Charminster Avenue toward the Fiveways Pub.

The boy is described as white, aged between 16 and 17 years old and was wearing a grey tracksuit with the hood up.

Police Constable Calum Maton, of Bournemouth police, said: "We have carried out a number of enquiries into this incident so far, including house-to-house visits in the surrounding area.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed what happened or has information about the identity of the boy to please get in touch.

"I would also like to hear from any motorists who were travelling in the area on the night of the incident and may have captured relevant dashcam footage to assist my enquiries."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200190595. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
