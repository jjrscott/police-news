Officers investigating criminal damage to a car in Purbeck are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Between 10am and 3.45pm on Saturday 1 August 2020 damage was caused to a white Dacia Sandero that was parked on Ferry Road in Studland near to Jerry's Point bus stop.

There were several large scratches on the rear passenger door and two dust caps were stolen.

Police Constable Chantelle Gosney, of Dorset Police, said: "I have been carrying out a number of enquiries into this incident, including checking for CCTV in the area, but these have so far proved unsuccessful.

"I am appealing to anyone who saw someone causing damage to a vehicle on Ferry Road during the relevant time period to please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200113578. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
