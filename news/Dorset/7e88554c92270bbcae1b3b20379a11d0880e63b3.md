# Renewed appeal in relation to West Dorset burglary

18 December 2020

* * *

Officers continuing to investigate a burglary at a home in a West Dorset village are renewing their appeal for anyone with information to come forward.

The burglary occurred at a property in Beaminster Road in Melplash between 11am and 3.30pm on Friday 4 December 2020. Entry was gained to the rear of the premises, a search was carried out and various items including jewellery and a red cash tin were stolen.

Following an earlier appeal, a witness has come forward and reported that at around 2.45pm on Friday 4 December 2020 two men were seen walking from the church in Melplash toward the layby opposite.

A red vehicle was then seen to perform a U-turn and drove off toward Beaminster on the A3066.

Officers are keen to speak to these two men and the driver of the red vehicle as they may have information that could assist their investigation.

The witness also reported seeing a red cash tin being discarded in the road through Melplash, but it has not been recovered.

Police Constable Michelle Day, of West Dorset police, said: "We are keen to hear from anyone with information relating to the individuals, vehicle seen in the area or who has come across the red cash tin.

"We are also continuing to appeal for anyone who has dashcam footage of their journey along the A3066 through Melplash between 1pm and 4pm on Friday 4 December 2020 to get in touch. We would ask that any footage is preserved so that officers can review it to assess whether it is of assistance to our investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200182658. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
