A man has been arrested in connection with the alleged theft of high-value watches from a shop in Bournemouth.

It was reported that at around 1.05pm on Saturday 22 August 2020 a man entered Goldsmiths on Old Christchurch Road and made off without paying for three Tag Heuer Aquaracer watches, with an estimated total value of around £6,250.

Following a CCTV appeal and enquiries by officers, a 24-year-old man from Salisbury has been arrested on suspicion of theft and has been released under investigation.
