24 December 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a reported affray in Boscombe are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police was called at 7.39pm on Friday 20 December 2019 to a report of a fight involving approximately 20 people near to McDonald's on Christchurch Road.

Officers attended but could not locate the incident.

At around 8.32pm on the same day a further report was received of a fight on Christchurch Road involving two groups of people.

It is alleged that some of the people involved were in possession of wooden sticks and knives.

Officers attended the area and identified the reported incident. There were no reports of any injuries.

A 16-year-old boy from Bournemouth, two 17-year-old boys from Swanage, a 17-year-old Bournemouth boy, and two men, aged 19 and 38 and both from Bournemouth, were arrested on suspicion of affray.

The 16-year-old boy was also arrested on suspicion of possession of a bladed article in a public place and one of the 17-year-old boys from Swanage was also arrested on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon in a public place.

All six people have been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Police Constable Stephen Hawke, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We believe that the two incidents may have been linked and I am appealing to anyone who witnessed either one to please get in touch.

"I would also like to ask residents with home CCTV systems or motorists who were in the area at the time to check their footage for anything relevant."
