# Witness appeal following indecent exposure in Dorchester

29 August 2017

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward after an incident of indecent exposure in Dorchester.

The incident at an address off Buckingham Way was reported at around 11.30pm yesterday, Monday 28 August 2017.

The victim, a woman aged in her 50s, saw the man outside her house indecently exposing himself. When she went to call the police the man walked up to her window and banged on it to get her attention.

He left the area prior to police arriving on the scene. A search of the area was carried out but the offender was not located.

The offender was wearing some kind of covering on his face and head, which left only his eyes visible. He was wearing light coloured trousers and a dark top and is described as being of heavy build and around five feet six inches tall.

Detectives believe the incident could be linked to a series of indecent exposures in Dorchester and the surrounding area that they have been investigating. A total of 29 offences were reported between February 2012 and November 2016.

Detective Sergeant Mark Portelli, of Weymouth CID, said: "We have made a number of enquiries into the latest incident and believe it could be linked to the series of indecent exposures we have been investigating.

"I would urge anyone who saw any suspicious activity in the area around the relevant time or who has any further information to please contact police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170133955. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
