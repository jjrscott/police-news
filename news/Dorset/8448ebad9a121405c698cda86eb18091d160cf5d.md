30 January 2018

* * *

A second man has been arrested in connection with an alleged street robbery in Bournemouth.

It was reported that at around 8.30am on Sunday 16 July 2017 a group of four boys and two girls - all aged around 16 years old - were playing football in Kings Park when they were approached by two men.

The men reportedly threatened the group, claiming they had acid and a knife, and stole money and a vape smoking device.

No one was physically injured and no weapon was seen.

A 26-year-old man, of Winchester, has been arrested on suspicion of robbery and has been released under investigation while police enquiries continue.

A 24-year-old man, of Winchester, was previously arrested on suspicion of robbery and was also released under investigation.
