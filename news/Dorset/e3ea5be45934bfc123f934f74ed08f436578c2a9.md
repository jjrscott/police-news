* * *

Two people are due to appear in court in connection with the reported theft of Lego from a supermarket in Bournemouth.

It was reported that at around 10pm on Monday 11 November 2019 a man and woman entered the Tesco store in Riverside Avenue and selected around Â£400-worth of Lego before allegedly leaving the shop without paying.

Following enquiries by officers, a 37-year-old man from Battle in East Sussex and a 53-year-old woman from Hailsham in East Sussex have been issued with postal requisitions to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 3 March 2020 for an offence of theft.
