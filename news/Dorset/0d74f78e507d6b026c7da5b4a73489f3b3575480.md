Officers investigating a fatal road traffic collision in East Dorset are appealing for witnesses to come forward - with two people being arrested.

At 2.11am today, Saturday 8 October 2016, Dorset Police was informed of the collision in which a black Ford Ranger had collided with a white Ford Transit van on Ringwood Road near Three Legged Cross.

Sadly, the driver of the Ford Transit van - a 49-year-old man from the Shepton Mallet area - died from his injuries. His next of kin have been informed and the coroner has been notified.

A 26-year-old male passenger in the Transit van suffered neck and spinal injuries and was taken to Poole Hospital, the injuries are not considered life-threatening.

A road closure has been put in place on Horton road, outside the entrance to the Woolsbridge industrial estate. Traffic has been diverted via Woolsbridge Road and Three Legged cross to allow emergency services to deal with the incident. There is access to Moors Valley Country Park from the A31 direction and to Woolsbridge industrial estate and Ashley Heath car boot event from the West Moors end.

A 28-year-old man and 21-year-old woman, both from Shaftesbury, have been arrested on suspicion of driving offences and are currently assisting officers with enquiries.

Sergeant Nikki Burt of Dorset Police Traffic Department, said: "I am appealing for witnesses to the collision and to the manner of driving of the vehicles leading up to the collision to come forward."
