# Witness appeal following burglary at Portland store

07 November 2019

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward after thieves used a stolen vehicle to force entry to a Portland store.

The incident occurred at around 11.25pm on Wednesday 6 November 2019 at the Co-op store in Fortuneswell.

A Land Rover, which was reported as stolen from an address in the Bridport area, was driven into the premises and two men forced entry to the store. It is believed a quantity of cash was stolen from a cash machine.

The offenders left the Land Rover at the scene and made off in a blue Audi S3 Quattro.

Detective Sergeant Dave Horn, of Weymouth CID, said: "We are carrying out a detailed investigation to identify those responsible for this offence. This will cause a considerable inconvenience to the business targeted and a cordon will be in place while investigation work is carried out.

"I would urge any witnesses or anyone with information about the break-in to please contact us. I would also appeal to anyone who was driving in the area around the time of the incident and has dashcam fitted to their vehicle to check their footage for anything relevant."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190175623. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
