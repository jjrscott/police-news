# Family tribute following fatal road traffic collision on A31 near Merley

08 October 2017

* * *

The family of a 17-year-old Bournemouth boy who sadly died in a collision on the A31 near Merley have paid tribute to him.

Emergency services were called to the collision, involving an orange and black Hyosung motorcycle and a white Ford Transit panel van, at 12.49pm on Friday 6 October 2017.

Sadly, the rider of the motorcycle, David Pilbro, died at the scene. The driver of the van, a 48-year-old man from Southampton, was uninjured.

On behalf of the family, following the awful events of Friday 6 October where David sadly lost his life, Sean - David's father - said: "David was in the happiest part of his life. His loss will be with us forever.

"There are no words to express how we feel as a family. For sister Jade, grandparents John and Elizabeth, Chris and Nicky and girlfriend Amy and her family it's especially difficult.

"We have received an incredible amount of support and messages, which show how many people cared about David. We miss him and love him and he will be in our hearts forever.

"We believe a number of people at the scene tried everything they could to help him. We thank you for everything - the marine, the E-zec staff and the nurse. Please respect our privacy and dignity at this difficult time."
