# Appeal for information following road traffic collision in Poole

30 January 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a collision involving a car and a bicycle in Poole are appealing for the driver involved or anyone with information to come forward.

The collision occurred at around 12noon on Thursday 2 January 2020 on Wimborne Road, near to the New Inn pub. The cyclist, a man aged in his 40s, was knocked off his bike and sustained injuries to his head, fingers, ankles, legs and shoulder.

The car involved, described as a copper-coloured Nissan - possibly a Juke or Qashqai - with black inner wheels, stopped at the scene and the female driver, believed to be aged in her 20s, got out and spoke to the cyclist but departed without leaving her details.

Police Constable Ryan Jackson, of Poole police, said: "The injuries sustained by the cyclist have caused him to be off work since the collision and we are continuing to investigate the incident to establish the full circumstances.

"We have been conducting enquiries to try and identify the car and the driver involved but these have so far been unsuccessful and I would urge her to do the right thing and come forward so she can give her account of what happened.

"We would also like to hear from any witnesses or anyone who may have captured the collision on dashcam."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200000732. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
