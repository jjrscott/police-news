27 September 2016

* * *

A man has been charged following a road traffic collision in Weymouth.

At around 12.50pm on Monday 26 September 2016, officers spotted a suspicious vehicle on Portland Beach Road. The vehicle did not stop for officers when requested.

The vehicle - a blue Vauxhall Astra - was followed by officers. The car was seen to travel through the town along Buxton Road, Lanehouse Rocks Road, Abbotsbury Road, Radipole Park Drive and Dorchester Road before colliding with another vehicle - a green Mini Cooper - in Weymouth Way near to Chafey's roundabout. Two police cars were also damaged in the incident.

The vehicle was abandoned and a man was arrested a short time later. Two police officers received minor injuries during the arrest.

The ambulance service attended as a precaution and the female driver of the Mini Cooper was treated for shock.

A 22-year-old Liverpool man has been charged with driving a motor vehicle dangerously, failing to stop for police, driving otherwise than in according with a licence, driving without third party insurance and assaulting a constable in the execution of his or her duty. He is due to appear before Bournemouth Magistrates' Court tomorrow, Wednesday 28 September 2016.
