# Renewed appeal after reported fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth

01 August 2018

* * *

Officers investigating a reported fail-to-stop road traffic collision in Bournemouth between a pedestrian and a car are renewing their appeal for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police was called to the incident in Richmond Park Road at 12.17am on Wednesday 1 August 2018.

The male pedestrian was taken to Southampton hospital with serious leg and head injuries where he remains in a serious condition.

A short while later a 20-year-old man from Bournemouth came forward and was arrested on suspicion of driving offences. He has now been released under investigation.

There were road closures in place at the Bennet Road and the Charminster Road junctions to allow officers to investigate the scene.

Police Sergeant Craig Tatton, of the traffic unit, said: "I would like to renew our appeal for any witnesses to the collision, or the behaviour of the pedestrian or vehicle involved prior to it, to come forward.

"Also, I would like to hear from anyone who may have dashcam footage of the incident.

"This was a serious road traffic collision and the road closure was absolutely necessary to allow the emergency services to deal with the initial incident involving a man who required immediate medical treatment and then for a thorough investigation of the scene.

"We only have one opportunity to get our scene investigation right. Once the road is reopened, any evidence is lost. We owe it to victims and their families to make sure we do not lose that opportunity.

"Diversions were put in place during this road closure in a bid to keep the disruption to a minimum and traffic warnings were issued through the relevant channels.

"Diversions will never be as effective as allowing traffic to use the closed road and that is why we will always operate as efficiently as possible to allow the road to reopen as soon as possible. However, our priority has to be the emergency response to a serious incident and carrying out a detailed investigation into it.

"We have already thanked members of the public for their patience and understanding during the road closures to allow us to deal with the scene safely and we trust they appreciate that we do not do this lightly."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at scit@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 1:005. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
