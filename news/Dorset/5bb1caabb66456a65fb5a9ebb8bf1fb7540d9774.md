# Update â€“ woman released without charge following reported burglaries in North Dorset

21 August 2017

* * *

A woman arrested in connection with reported burglaries in North Dorset has been released without charge.

It was reported that a quantity of cash and a charity box was stolen from WHSmith on High Street in Shaftesbury at around 2.55am on Saturday 21 January 2017 when a black Ford Focus estate was driven into the front door of the building, forcing the doors to open.

A further incident was reported between 11.40pm and 11.55pm on Saturday 21 January 2017 at WHSmith on Cheap Street in Sherborne. A man allegedly tried to open the doors of the shop using a bent strip of metal but nothing was taken.

A 39-year-old woman of no fixed abode was arrested on suspicion of burglary offences but has now been released without charge.

A 33-year-old man and a 28-year-old woman - both from Weston-super-Mare - previously arrested in connection with the incidents were also released without charge.
