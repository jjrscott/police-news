# Force Remembrance Service video - message from Chief Constable James Vaughan

11 November 2020

* * *

This year has been a challenge for many members of the Dorset community and we thank you for your ongoing resilience and support.

The current restrictions have meant that we have had to work in different ways and this has extended to the Force Remembrance Service.

We wish to pay tribute to the departed who gave their lives in service of their country, and so we have filmed a short service in their memory and for those we have lost along the way.
