* * *

Officers in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an alleged assault in the town.

Sometime between 2am and 2.30am on Sunday 25 September 2016, it was reported that an altercation occurred between a group of men and a second group of men who were travelling in a silver Vauxhall Insignia near to the underpass along Wellington Road.

A 21-year-old man from Bournemouth sustained a facial injury. A 28-year-old man from Eastleigh in Hampshire suffered facial injuries and a fractured hand. They were taken to hospital for treatment.

Five Bournemouth men, aged 22, 23, 24, 25 and 27, have been arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and have been released on police bail pending further enquiries until the beginning of November 2016.

Investigations officer Emily Greenwood, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the incident to please come forward.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who saw a silver Vauxhall Insignia in the area at the relevant time."

A 27-year-old was arrested on suspicion of a driving offence. He has been charged with failing to provide a specimen of breath for analysis and is due to appear before Bournemouth Magistrates' Court on 11 October 2016.
