# Witness appeal following assault in Wareham

01 June 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward as they investigate an assault in Wareham.

The incident occurred at around 5pm on Wednesday 20 May 2020 in the car park of the Sainsbury's supermarket in South Street.

It was reported that the victim, a man aged in his 40s, had been involved in a verbal exchange with another man, who he did not know, in relation to social distancing while he was shopping in the store. The two men were then involved in a further altercation in the car park and the victim was punched in the jaw area, causing him to fall to the ground.

Staff members came out of the store to intervene and both men then left the scene, with the offender getting into a small black hatchback car.

The victim did not require hospital treatment for his injuries, which included swelling to his jaw and a graze to his elbow.

The offender is described as white, aged around 35 to 45, about five feet ten inches tall and of medium build. He was possibly wearing a short-sleeved shirt.

Police Constable Sam Everton, of Purbeck police, said: "We are carrying out enquiries into this incident and I am keen to hear from anyone who may have been in the area at the time and witnessed this altercation.

"I would urge anyone with information that could assist our investigation to come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200071426. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
