# Appeal after cat shot with air rifle in Verwood

05 June 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for information from the public after a female cat was shot and injured with an air rifle in Verwood.

On the evening of Sunday 2 June 2019 the cat returned to the family home in Hainault Drive injured. It was taken to the vet and underwent surgery. An x-ray was taken and the vet believes an air weapon was used as pellets were found lodged in her body.

The cat is expected to make a full recovery.

Police Community Support Investigator Kayleigh Hole, of Dorset Police, said: "The cat's owner does not know of any reason why someone would want to harm her cat or who may have been responsible. She has understandably been left very upset by what has happened.

"I would urge anyone who has any information or knows the identity of the person or people involved to please contact Dorset Police. "

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk, or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190084115. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
