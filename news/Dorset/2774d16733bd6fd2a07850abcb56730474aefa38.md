Detectives investigating an alleged assault in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses to get in touch.

At 4.02am on Tuesday 28 June 2016, officers were called to reports of an alleged assault in Bath Street in the town.

A 17-year-old boy from Dorchester sustained non-life threatening facial injuries and was taken to Poole Hospital for treatment.

A 21-year-old man, 19-year-old woman and a 24-year-old woman from Weymouth have been arrested on suspicion of assault.

Two men aged 18 and 20, both from Weymouth, have been arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm without intent.

All five have been released on police bail pending further enquiries until the end of September 2016.

Detective Constable Sarah Desmond, of Weymouth CID, said: "I know there were a number of people in the area at the time and I am appealing to them to please contact Dorset Police if they have not yet spoken to officers."
