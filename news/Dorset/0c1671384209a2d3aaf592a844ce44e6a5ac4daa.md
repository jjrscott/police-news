# Update following serious injury collision near Sherborne

23 January 2020

* * *

A woman who sustained life-threatening injuries during a collision near Sherborne has very sadly died.

Dorset Police was called at 3.53pm on Tuesday 21 January 2020 to a report of a two vehicle collision involving a grey Skoda Roomster and a silver Toyota HiAce panel van on the A30 at Babylon Hill, near to the Marl Lane turn off to Over Compton.

The driver of the Skoda, a local 88-year-old man, sustained serious injuries and remains in a serious condition in hospital. His 86-year-old wife, who was travelling in the front of the car, sustained life-threatening injuries and was rushed to hospital for treatment. She sadly died on the afternoon of Wednesday 22 January 2020. Her family is being supported by a specially-trained family liaison officer.

The driver of the Toyota van, a man aged in his 50s and from Yeovil, sustained minor injuries.

Police Sergeant Sarah Jones, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the woman's family at this difficult time.

"We are continuing to investigate the collision and I would like any witnesses who have not yet spoken to officers to please come forward.

"As part of my enquiries I am keen to obtain general dashcam footage of the A30 between 3.30pm and 4pm on Tuesday 21 January. I would ask any motorists with such footage to please come forward, even if it doesn't capture the collision."
