# Witness appeal following indecent exposure in Poole

05 February 2018

* * *

Officers investigating an indecent exposure incident in Poole are appealing for any witnesses to come forward.

At around 4.55pm on Monday 29 January 2018 a woman was walking her dog along the seafront at Baiter Park close to the skate park when a man appeared from a wooded area.

The offender wore a dark T-shirt and a pair of green trainers but he did not have any clothing on his lower body. He exposed himself to the victim and ran away when she challenged him.

Officers attended and carried out a search of the area but were unable to find the offender.

He is described as being aged in his mid-50s, with short dark hair and of a heavy set.

Police Constable Robert Hopper, of Poole police, said: "This was a distressing incident for the victim and I am keen to trace this man. I am appealing to anyone who saw a man matching the description given in the area at the relevant time to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would also ask anyone who might know who this man is to please come forward."
