# Witness appeal following aggravated burglary in Bournemouth

20 April 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an aggravated burglary in Bournemouth.

At around 6.10pm on Wednesday 18 April 2018 Dorset Police was called to reports that a man entered an address on Richmond Park Crescent and followed two female occupants to their bedroom.

The offender closed the bedroom door, pointed what appeared to be a plastic-looking handgun at the pair - aged 17 and 18 - and demanded money from them. He pushed one of the victims in the back. The second victim slapped the man on his arm. It is reported the man then appeared to get spooked, possibly by the sound of the victim's dog barking, and he left the bedroom and ran out of the side door toward Richmond Park Crescent and Richmond Park Road.

The victims were not physically injured. Nothing was taken.

The offender is described as aged in his late teens, five feet 10 inches tall, of very slim build and of Indian appearance. He had a smooth face with no facial hair, very dark eyes and short black hair cut in a bowl-style. He wore a blue zipped-up jacket.

Detective Constable Andy Hale, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was a very frightening ordeal for the victims, who cannot think of a reason why they were targeted.

"From our enquires, we know the victims had travelled on the M1 bus from Castlepoint at 5.19pm and got off at the stop outside the Richmond Arms pub. It is possible the offender may have been on the same bus and followed the victims home. I would urge anyone who was on this bus and has any information that could assist my investigation to please contact Dorset Police.

"A full and detailed investigation is now underway in a bid to find the man responsible for this incident, including house-to-house visits, CCTV searches and enquiries with the bus company.
"I am keen to hear from anyone who was in the area at the relevant time and who saw or heard anything suspicious to please come forward."

Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team will be continuing their patrols in the area and can be approached with any community concerns.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 55180057767. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
