* * *

Officers investigating a report of a commercial burglary in Poole are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

It was reported that at around 8.40am on Sunday 13 September 2020 entry was forced to Pawseidon, a canine rehabilitation facility at the Albany Business Park in Cabot Lane.

The offenders allegedly carried out a search of the premises and stole a number of items including a silver Omega Seamaster watch with distinctive military branding on the rear, a silver Tag Heuer watch, a black Traser dive watch, a black Luminox dive watch, a black Elliot Brown dive watch with the bezel missing and a black Casio watch.

Also reported stolen was a GoPro underwater camera with a waterproof case and a 64GB memory card, £690 in cash including at least £300 in Scottish bank notes, a pair of black size nine Under Armour trainers, a green Barbour bomber jacket and a black Arc'teryx jacket.

Following enquiries, a 44-year-old local man was arrested on suspicion of burglary and he has been released under investigation.

Police Constable Chris Raspini, of Dorset Police's Priority Crime Team, said: "We are continuing to investigate this matter and the items reported stolen have still not been recovered.

"A number of them are quite distinctive and I would urge anyone who comes across items matching the descriptions of those given being offered for sale or in any other unusual circumstances locally to please contact us.

"I would also ask for anyone who has witnessed any suspicious activity in the area to come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200137857. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
