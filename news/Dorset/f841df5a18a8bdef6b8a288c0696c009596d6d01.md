# Update: Appeal to find missing dog

23 May 2017

* * *

A dog that was reported stolen from Lytchett Matravers has been reunited with her owner.

Officers received a report that Kaya, a 10-month-old Greyhound and Whippet cross, had been taken from the Peatons Lane area on the evening of Wednesday 15 March 2017.

Following investigations, a public appeal was issued.

Kaya was later found by a woman at Moors Valley Country Park on Tuesday 18 April and handed in to the RSPCA Ashley Heath Animal Centre.

When Kaya's microchip was scanned it alerted staff at the centre to contact police and officers then liaised with the dog's owner so he could make arrangements with the centre.
