# Serious road traffic collision in Poole - witness appeal

06 August 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses after a serious road traffic collision in Poole.

The incident happened at around 10.15pm on Friday 4 August 2017 between a Suzuki motorcycle ridden by an 18-year-old local man and a Mitsubishi Colt being driven by a 67-year-old local woman.

It occurred at the junction of Wallisdown Road and Canford Road.

As a result of the collision, the rider of the motorcycle sustained serious injuries and he was taken to Poole Hospital for treatment. His condition is no longer life-threatening, but the injuries sustained are potentially life-changing.

The road was closed to allow officers and collision investigators to examine the scene.

Police Constable Sean Todd, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who saw the collision or the manner of driving of either vehicle prior to the incident to contact Dorset Police.

"I believe there may have been a large group of people near to the Subway restaurant on Wallisdown Road before and at the time of the collision and I would like to speak to any of these people who haven't already been spoken to by officers."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 4:561. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
