Officers investigating reports of an assault in Weymouth are appealing for the alleged victims or any witnesses to come forward.

At 3.30am on Tuesday 30 January 2018 police were called to Actors Bar in Maiden Street following reports that two women had been punched in the face.

Officers attended and as one police constable went to detain a woman at the scene he was reportedly assaulted. He was taken to hospital for treatment to injuries to his hand and jaw.

The woman also reportedly spat at an officer when she was taken to the Weymouth custody suite.

An 18-year-old Weymouth woman has been arrested on suspicion of assaulting an officer in the execution of their duty and has been released under investigation.

Police Constable Susan Tagg, of Weymouth police, said: "We are making a number of enquiries into this incident and I am keen to speak to the two alleged victims of the reported assault at Actors Bar, who we have not identified and are yet to give an account to police.

"I would urge these two women, or anyone else with information about the incident, to get in touch."
