# Witness appeal following theft of parcels from delivery vehicle in Poole

11 December 2020

* * *

Officers investigating the theft of parcels from a delivery vehicle in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 3.20pm on Friday 4 December 2020 a woman parked on Compton Avenue and left the keys in the ignition of her car to deliver a parcel to a nearby property.

As the victim was doing so, she heard the engine of her car being started and she turned to see her car being driven away in the direction of Sandecotes Road.

Officers attended and carried out a search of the area, but the vehicle was not located.

On Monday 7 December 2020 the stolen vehicle was reported to be on Highview Gardens. The car has been recovered and the 96 parcels, which were inside have been taken.

Police Constable Jade Harper, of Poole police, said: "I am carrying out an investigation into this incident and would like to hear from anyone who may have seen or heard any suspicious activity in the area around the relevant timeframe.

"I would also urge residents and motorists to check their home CCTV systems or dashcams for any footage to assist my enquiries.

"I am aware there have been a number of similar thefts from delivery vans in the Dorset area recently, but this incident is not believed to be linked at this time.

"Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to remind motorists not to leave keys in the ignition of their vehicles, no matter how quickly you are leaving it for. Always lock your vehicle when leaving it unattended."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200182633. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
