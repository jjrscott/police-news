# Incident in North Bournemouth â€“ man charged

18 August 2017

* * *

A man is due to appear in court charged in connection with a disturbance at a block of flats in North Bournemouth.

Dorset Police was called at 12.50am on Thursday 17 August 2017 to reports of a disturbance at a block of flats where a man was setting fire to items in the garden in Gillam Road in Bournemouth. It is alleged that the man also made threats that he was making a bomb.

Officers attended, along with Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service and the South Western Ambulance Service.

During a search of one of the flats unknown items were found. A cordon was put in place and, as a precaution, around 30 residents were evacuated for their own safety.

The Military Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) team attended and, alongside scenes of crime officers, assessed the items. They were subsequently found not to be a viable explosive device and no controlled explosions were necessary.

A 42-year-old man from Bournemouth has been charged with using threatening, abusive, insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause fear of violence and is due to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court today, Friday 18 August 2017.

A 29-year-old woman also arrested in connection with the incident has been released without charge.
