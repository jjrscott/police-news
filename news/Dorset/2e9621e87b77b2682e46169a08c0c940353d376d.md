# Witness appeal following road traffic collision on A35 Upton bypass

24 July 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward following a road traffic collision near Poole.

Dorset Police received a report at 1.10pm today, Wednesday 24 July 2019, of a single vehicle collision involving an orange Vauxhall Corsa that had left the road on the westbound carriageway of the A35 Upton bypass, near to the Bakers Arms roundabout.

The occupant of the Corsa, a Bournemouth man aged in his 30s, was reported to be trapped in the vehicle.

Officers attended, along with the fire service and ambulance service.

The man was freed from the vehicle and taken to Poole Hospital with injuries that are not serious.

Road closures were put in place between the Bakers Arms roundabout and Holes Bay Road to allow the emergency services to deal with the incident and for an examination of the scene.

Inspector Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "We are carrying out a full investigation to establish the circumstances of this collision.

"The Vauxhall Corsa was in the outside lane and it is thought that another vehicle, a dark or black-coloured small hatchback, was travelling on the inside lane when the collision occurred.

"We do not believe the vehicles came into contact with each other but we would like to trace the owner of that vehicle as they may have information to assist my investigation.

"I am appealing to any witnesses who have not already spoken to police to contact us and I would also like to hear from anyone who was travelling in the area and may have captured the incident on dashcam.

"I appreciate the closure of this main road for a significant period may have caused some inconvenience to members of the public but it was absolutely necessary to enable the emergency services to respond to the incident and for a detailed examination of the scene to be carried out.

"I would like to thank motorists for their patience and understanding during these closures."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 24:276. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
