# Witness appeal following reported assaults in Bournemouth

25 April 2019

* * *

Detectives investigating the reported assault of two people in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

It was reported that shortly before 2am on Sunday 21 April 2019, the victims - a man and women aged in their 30s - were walking from Old Christchurch Road toward the Lansdowne roundabout when they became involved in a verbal altercation with a man who accused them of damaging his phone.

They walked away from the man and entered Christchurch Road near to Zephyr nightclub and KFC when the female was reportedly struck by an item, believed to be a glass bottle thrown by the alleged offender, who had followed them.

The male victim turned to give chase and was also reportedly struck by an item that was believed to be a glass bottle. The male victim sustained lacerations to his face and the woman sustained a head injury.

The alleged offender was described as white, around five feet nine inches tall and with short dark hair and was wearing grey jeans and no top.

A 34-year-old man from Margate in Kent was arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent and has been released under investigation as detectives continue to make enquiries.

Detective Constable Matt Manners, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing for any witnesses to these reported assaults or anyone with information that can assist our investigation to contact police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190059758. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
