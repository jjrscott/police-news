# Witness appeal following assault and dangerous driving incident in Weymouth

18 June 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses following an assault and dangerous driving incident in Weymouth.

At 9pm on Saturday 16 June 2018 it was reported that a grey Volkswagen Transporter overtook eight vehicles on Portland Beach Road, close to the Victoria roundabout, despite there being oncoming traffic.

The manoeuvre caused the driver of a black Mercedes to stop suddenly. The driver of the Transporter got out of his vehicle and shouted at the driver.

As the victim attempted to get out of his car, the offender pushed his door shut and trapped the victim's right ankle in the door.

The offender then proceeded to slam the door onto the man's ankle a further six times.

The victim - a 35-year-old local man - sustained injuries to his ankle. He also suffered a broken thumb, which will require surgery to repair.

Police Constable Chris Stephens, of Weymouth police, said: "I am appealing for anyone who was travelling in the area the relevant time and witnessed all or part of the incident to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am also keen to hear from any motorists who may have captured the incident on dashcam."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180092971. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
