# Witness appeal following assault in Gillingham

10 December 2019

* * *

Officers investigating an assault in Gillingham are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 3.15pm on Sunday 8 December 2019 the victim - a local woman aged in her 60s - was walking her dog in a field near to the St Mary the Virgin Primary School.

A black and white Springer Spaniel approached the victim and began jumping at her and circling around her dog. The victim pushed the dog away.

A man, who was with the owner of the Spaniel, came over and shouted abuse at the victim. As she tried to walk away, the dog owner spat in the face of the victim and made verbal threats.

The victim attempted to take a photo of the offender, but he grabbed her on the arm and threatened to smash her phone.

The two men are both described as white, aged between 35 and 40 years old and of medium build with short hair. They were both wearing jeans and green Wellington boots.

The first man is also described as being five feet ten inches tall and wearing a dark-coloured coat with a hood.

The second man was described as being five feet eight inches tall and wearing a dark-coloured coat that was possibly green. He also had a chocolate Labrador with him.

Police Constable Craig Marshall, of North Dorset police, said: "This was a distressing incident for the victim and an investigation is underway to identify the two men.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the time and witnessed the assault to please get in touch.

"I would also urge anyone who recognises the two men from the descriptions given to come forward."
