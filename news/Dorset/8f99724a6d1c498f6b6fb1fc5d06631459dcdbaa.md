# Image appeal after suspected stolen items recovered

29 October 2020

* * *

Officers are issuing images of a number of suspected stolen items that were recovered following an incident in West Dorset - with two men arrested.

At around 12.40am on Friday 16 October 2020 Dorset Police received a report of two people carrying items from a car into a van that was parked nearby in the Mosterton area.

Officers carried out a search of the area and located the van travelling toward Beaminster.

Two men, aged 27 and 31 and both from Yeovil, were arrested on suspicion of theft from a motor vehicle and have been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Following the arrests, a search was carried out at an address in Yeovil and a number of suspected stolen items were recovered.

These include a number of tools, a white Cannondale bike, a yellow Carrera bike and a welder.

Police Constable Paul Diffey, of Bridport police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who recognises any of the items pictured to please get in touch."
