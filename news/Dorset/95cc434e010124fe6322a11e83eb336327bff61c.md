# Appeal for witnesses following reported assault in Gillingham

19 October 2020

* * *

Detectives investigating an alleged assault in Gillingham are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

It is reported that at around 10pm on Saturday 17 October 2020 two 18-year-old men were walking in the area of Addison Close when they were approached by a group of people who challenged them to fight.

One of the group reportedly punched one of the 18-year-old men several times to his head and ears, before he fell to the ground and was knocked unconscious.

He sustained a fractured cheekbone, a blood clot behind his eardrum, bruising to his brain and a fractured skull.

The second 18-year-old man allegedly attempted to intervene, but was punched to the face causing a small cut to his lip.

On Sunday 18 October 2020 a 20-year-old man from the Gillingham area was arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and assault. He has been released on police bail pending further enquiries.

Detective Sergeant Matt Bradley, of Weymouth CID, said: "An investigation is underway into this incident and officers have been carrying out a number of enquiries so far, including carrying out house-to-house visits.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the Addison Close area and witnessed what happened, or may have any relevant dashcam or home CCTV footage, to please get in touch.

"I understand there were a number of people who came to the aid of the victim and I would ask any of them who have not spoken to police to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200156664. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
