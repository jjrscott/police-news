# Witness appeal after alleged dangerous driving incident in North Dorset

01 April 2020

* * *

Officers investigating an alleged dangerous driving incident in North Dorset are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

It was reported that, at around 2pm on Tuesday 31 March 2020, a black BMW 3 series was seen to drive dangerously past police in Le Neubourg Way in Gillingham. The vehicle then reportedly drove at speed down Cemetery Road and failed to stop for police. It was subsequently alleged to have been driven dangerously and at speed on the A30 and in Shaftesbury.

It was reported that the driver was wearing a white medical face mask.

The vehicle was located a short time later in a car park in Fontmell Magna and was seized by police. A search of the vehicle revealed a small quantity of suspected cocaine and a medical face mask.

A 27-year-old man from Shaftesbury was arrested on suspicion of offences of dangerous driving, driving whilst disqualified and possession of a class A drug. He has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Inspector Simon Perry, of North Dorset police, said: "We are making further enquiries into this incident and I would urge anyone who witnessed a black BMW driving at excessive speeds or in a dangerous manner in the area at the relevant time to please contact us.

"I would also ask anyone who was driving in the vicinity and has dashcam fitted to their vehicle to check their footage for anything relevant."
