# Dorset Police encourage courtesy for all road users - Be #BikeSmart

19 November 2018

* * *

**The theme of this year’s Brake Road Safety Week 19 – 25 November 2018 is for road users on both two wheels and four (or more) to be #BikeSmart and show due consideration for each other.**

More information about this national charity can be found on its website www.roadsafetyweek.org.uk

Dorset roads policing officers, including the No Excuse team, are taking part in and supporting a number of activities during the week, all with the aim of improving safety on the county’s roads.

Police and Crime Commissioner Martyn Underhill said: “With over 100 cyclists and motorcyclists injured every day in needless, preventable crashes, they are among the most vulnerable road users in the UK. It is therefore fitting that this year Road Safety Week is focusing on the safety of those who travel by either bike or motorbike.

“Road safety is an important issue for our communities and for a small Force, Dorset Police is punching well above its weight. I encourage everyone to think about the decisions they make while using our roads and to be considerate of other road users and their safety.”

Dorset Police officers will also be present at a public consultation on keeping horses and riders safe on the road, hosted by the British Horse Society from 7.30pm on Thursday 22 November at Durweston Village Hall. There is free entry and free tea and coffee and all are welcome. Further information at www.bhs.org.uk/dorset

The week kicks off with the Safe Drive Stay Alive initiative at Weymouth Pavilion which will be attended by young people from surrounding colleges.

Now in its 13th year, the partnership presents emergency services personnel on stage to tell their stories of dealing with the results of road traffic collisions. These emotive and hard-hitting presentations reach out to new and pre-drivers, influencing behaviour and attitude on the roads.
