# Witness appeal following assault in Bournemouth

27 December 2018

* * *

Officers investigating an assault in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 10.30pm on Friday 21 December 2018 the victim, a man aged in his 50s, was walking in Braidley Road with his wife and friends when they noticed a man who appeared to be intoxicated stumbling along the road.

The victim wished the man a Merry Christmas, to which he responded by becoming agitated and confrontational. He went on to trip the victim and they both fell in the road. The man then punched his victim several times to the face and head before running off toward Meyrick Park.

The victim was taken to hospital by his friend and was treated for a cut to his forehead. He also suffered bruising below his eyes, swelling to the face and a cut lip.

The offender is described as white, aged in his late 20s or early 30s, with dark hair and a pale complexion. He was wearing a grey beanie hat, dark jacket, light trousers and light-coloured trainers.

Police Constable Joshua Benoke, of Bournemouth police, said: "This was a nasty assault that understandably left the victim feeling very upset and we are determined to identify the man responsible.

"We are carrying out a number of enquiries, including a review of CCTV footage in the area, and I am appealing for any witnesses to the incident to come forward. I would also urge anyone who was travelling in the area at the relevant time and has dashcam fitted to their vehicle to check their footage."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180204577. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
