# Witness appeal following attempted robbery in Bournemouth

16 May 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an attempted robbery in Bournemouth.

At around 10.25am on Monday 14 May 2018 a 33-year-old local man was walking along Riverside Avenue near to the Tesco entrance, playing on his phone and listening to music through his earphones, when he became aware of shadows near to him.

As he looked up, one male offender attempted to grab the headphones. The victim managed to pull away but was struck in the face by a second male offender using what is believed to be a metal bike chain.

The chain connected with the victim's nose and forehead causing a small cut. The victim suspects the offenders made off into bushes leading to Playgolf Bournemouth. Nothing was stolen.

The first offender is described as white, approximately six feet tall, aged in his early 20s, of average build and wearing a black baseball cap.

The second offender is described as white and was possibly wearing sunglasses.

Police Constable Josh Benoke, of Bournemouth police, said: "We have carried out a number of enquiries following this incident, including CCTV searches but these have been unsuccessful.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the relevant time and may have seen or heard anything suspicious to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am also keen to hear from any motorists who were travelling along Riverside Avenue that day and time and may have captured the offenders on dashcam."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180072565. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
