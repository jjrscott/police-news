# Witness appeal following reported robbery in Bournemouth

28 May 2020

* * *

Detectives investigating an alleged robbery in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

It is reported that at around 1.20am on Saturday 23 May 2020 the victim, a boy aged in his late teens, was walking through the alleyway between High Howe Lane and Ringwood Road when he saw a male teenager ahead speaking with a woman.

It is alleged that the teenager began to engage with the victim, while the woman walked away from the area. During the conversation it is reported that he lifted his top to display a knife tucked into the waistband of his trousers.

The male teenager reportedly demanded the victim hand over his phone and threatened to stab him if he tried to run away.

It is also alleged that he demanded cash from the victim and, despite him saying he did not have any, the male teenager made the victim go to a nearby cash machine to withdraw money.

Once the money was handed over, it is reported that he walked with the victim back to the alleyway before letting him go. The victim ran away from the area.

Following enquiries, a 15-year-old Bournemouth boy was arrested on suspicion of robbery. He has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Detective Constable Neil Causebrook, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the incident to please come forward.

"I would urge local residents to check their home CCTV systems to see if they have any footage of people in that area at the relevant time.

"If you have any information to assist my investigation, please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200072711. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
