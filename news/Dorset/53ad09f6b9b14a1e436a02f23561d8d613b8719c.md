# Witness appeal following criminal damage in Dorchester

10 March 2021

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward after damage was caused to a rainbow banner outside a school in Dorchester.

At around 8.30pm on Sunday 7 March 2021 it was discovered that a plastic rainbow banner that was on the front gate of The Prince of Wales School on Maiden Castle Road had been set alight.

Following enquiries, it was reported that a group of young people were seen earlier in the evening approaching the school while carrying a lighter.

Neighbourhood Inspector Darren Stanton, of Dorchester Police, said: "This banner was being displayed as a thank you to the NHS during the pandemic and it is very upsetting that it has now been damaged.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the area and witnessed what happened to please get in touch.

"I would be really keen to hear from any local residents or motorists who may have captured relevant footage on either home CCTV systems or dashcams.

"Finally, if you know who was responsible for this incident or have any information that may assist us, please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210037308. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
