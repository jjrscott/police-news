# Update â€“ second man due to appear in court in connection with investigation into alleged scam

18 March 2020

* * *

A second man is due to appear in court in connection with an investigation into an alleged scam where a Bournemouth couple were reportedly conned out of a significant amount of money.

It was reported that the couple, aged in their 70s, were targeted by fraudsters through a series of courier and banking scams after first being contacted by a man claiming to be from the Metropolitan Police in August 2019.

He allegedly claimed that they had arrested a man who was found to be in possession of their bank cards and provided them with details of an account where they could put their money so it would be safe.

The couple were reportedly persuaded to hand over a large amount of money across a number of transactions and through various means before they subsequently established that the man they had been in contact with was not a Metropolitan Police officer.

Following a detailed investigation by detectives from Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT), with support from City of London Police, a series of warrants were executed at addresses in the Ilford area of London on Monday 3 February 2020.

A 39-year-old man was arrested and was previously charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation and money laundering. He is next due to appear at Bournemouth Crown Court on Friday 3 April 2020.

A 50-year-old man who was also arrested has now been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Monday 23 March 2020 for 12 offences of converting or transferring criminal property.
