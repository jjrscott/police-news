Detectives investigating a suspected arson at a property in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police was called at around 12.25am on Monday 8 March 2021 to a report of suspicious activity at an address in Clayton Close.

Officers attended and located a fire. The occupants of the building were evacuated and did not sustain any injuries.

A cordon was put in place to allow for an examination of the scene to be carried out.

A man aged in his 30s and from Weymouth was arrested on suspicion of attempted arson with intent to endanger life. He has been released on police bail while enquiries continue.

Detective Sergeant Andy Marsh, of Weymouth CID, said: "We have been carrying out a number of enquiries so far into the fire, including house-to-house visits in the local area.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity around the relevant timeframe to please get in touch."
