# Reported sexual assault on bus in Christchurch â€“ man arrested

29 March 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a reported sexual assault on a bus in Christchurch have arrested a man.

At 3.23pm on Monday 11 March 2019 a local woman aged in her 20s got onto the 1A Yellow Bus on the Barrack Road stop by KFC.

A couple of stops later by the Tesco garage on Barrack Road two men got onto the bus. One sat in the seat next to the victim. It is alleged he made advances toward the victim, repeatedly asking her personal questions. He mentioned her perfume and started leaning toward her before attempting to kiss her neck around five times.

It is reported he continued to attempt to engage with the victim and inappropriately touched her leg three or four times despite her asking him to stop.

Officers released a CCTV image of a man as part of their investigations.

A 26-year-old man from Christchurch has been arrested on suspicion of sexual assault and has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.
