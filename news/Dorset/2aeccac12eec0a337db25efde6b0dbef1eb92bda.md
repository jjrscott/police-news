# Update â€“ further arrest following alleged assault on Portland

28 July 2017

* * *

A sixth person has been arrested in connection with an alleged assault on Portland.

At 4.40am on Saturday 22 July 2017 Dorset Police received a report that several people entered an address on Fortuneswell which contained a number of men and threatened some of them with a knife. A fight ensued during which it appears someone was injured. The people then left the address.

A 24-year-old London man has now been arrested on suspicion of assault and has been released under investigation.

A 43-year-old man, a 36-year-old man and a 29-year-old woman, all from the Weymouth area, and a 17-year-old boy of no fixed abode, have previously been arrested on suspicion of assault and have been released under investigation.

A 23-year-old man of no fixed abode was also arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary and released under investigation.

Detectives are still keen to hear from any witnesses to the incident who have not already spoken to police.
