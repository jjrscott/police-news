In consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service three of the four people, arrested in relation to the investigation into the death of 17-year-old Jack Gudge, have been released from police bail with no further action.

Officers had been called to reports of a fight outside Tesco Express on Wimborne Road in Winton at around 12.55am on Saturday 16 July 2016.

A fourth arrested person, a 24-year-old Bournemouth man, remains on police bail until October pending further enquiries.
