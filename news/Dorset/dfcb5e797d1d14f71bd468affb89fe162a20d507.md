# Witness appeal following altercation in Weymouth

15 March 2019

* * *

Officers investigating an altercation and assault in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At around 4.20pm on Tuesday 5 March 2019 an altercation took place between two men on Weymouth seafront, close to the King's Statue.

One of the men aged in his 50s sustained injuries to his face. The men were known to each other.

Police Constable Lisa Fisher, of Weymouth police, said: "I am keen to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time and witnessed the incident, in particular a man and woman who briefly spoke to officers and helped direct them to the injured man. Unfortunately these members of the public left before officers got their details."
