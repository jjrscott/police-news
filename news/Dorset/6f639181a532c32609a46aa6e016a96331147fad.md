Officers investigating a fatal road traffic collision in Dorchester are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward.

At 4.10pm on Friday 14 September 2018 Dorset Police was informed by the ambulance service about the incident in Hessary Street.

The air ambulance service attended and the motorcyclist, a 25-year-old local man, was taken to Southampton hospital with serious injuries. Sadly he died this morning, Sunday 16 September 2018.

"I would like to renew our appeal for any witnesses to the collision who have not spoken with officers yet to come forward.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who saw the manner of driving of either vehicle before the incident or who has relevant dashcam footage."
