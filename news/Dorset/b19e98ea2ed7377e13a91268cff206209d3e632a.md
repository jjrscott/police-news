# Witness appeal following assault in Bridport

27 December 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following an assault in Bridport.

The victim, a man aged in his 40s, was out running in the town when the assault occurred at around 4.30pm on Tuesday 24 December 2019.

As he ran along Tannery Road the victim saw a group of around 10 to 15 young adults. As he ran past them, one of the group came towards him and he pushed the man away as he feared for his safety.

As the victim rounded the corner near to the Hope and Anchor pub in St Michael's Lane, he realised he was being chased by another member of the group. The man confronted him and punched the victim to the left side of his face.

The victim was left with swelling under his left eye and a bleeding nose but did not require medical treatment.

The offender is described as white, aged in his early 20s and of athletic build with a square face. He was wearing a plain black jacket, black slim-fit jeans and black and white trainers.

Police Constable Neil Gauden, of Bridport police, said: "We are continuing to investigate this incident and are making enquiries to identify the man responsible for this assault.

"I would urge anyone who witnessed the incident or who has any information that might assist our investigation to please contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190201460. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
