# Man found guilty of raping woman as she slept

10 December 2020

* * *

A man has been found guilty of raping a woman in Bournemouth as she slept.

Marti Nicholas Reynolds, 29 and of Baardwyk Avenue, Canvey Island, was convicted on Wednesday 9 December 2020 of rape following a trial at Salisbury Crown Court. He was found not guilty of a second rape offence.

He will return to the same court on Thursday 14 January 2021 to be sentenced.

The offence occurred in October 2017 when Reynolds lived in Bournemouth and came to light on Friday 27 October that year when a woman contacted Dorset Police to say Reynolds had admitted to having sexual intercourse with a woman as she slept. He was arrested the same day.

Officers from Dorset Police made contact with the victim - who is aged in her 20s and knew Reynolds as a fellow student - to take an account from her.

The victim told police that she had been out drinking with friends in Bournemouth town centre on the evening of Sunday 22 October 2017. She returned home to her address in the Winton area of the town and went to bed, allowing Reynolds to stay with her as a friend. She woke to discover Reynolds raping her and she got up and left.

Detective Constable Christopher Panther, of Dorset Police, said: "Marti Reynolds targeted his victim as she slept and at no point had she given consent.

"The investigation into Reynolds has taken a period of time to get to court due to geographical difficulties and a delay in cases being heard in court as a result of COVID-19. I would like to thank the victim in this case for her patience and understanding during this lengthy process.

"I commend her for the courage she has shown in coming forward and standing up to Reynolds to say what he did to her was wrong.

"I hope this case will again demonstrate that Dorset Police takes these offences extremely seriously. We will always listen to and support anyone who reports matters to us. No matter how long it takes, offenders will be held accountable for the crimes they commit."
