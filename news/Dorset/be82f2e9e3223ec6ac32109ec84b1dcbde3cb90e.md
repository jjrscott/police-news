Officers investigating reports of a man possessing an offensive weapon and committing a public order offence in Swanage are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At 11.30am on Saturday 23 September 2017 Dorset Police received a report of man in Cow Lane swinging a sword around and acting in a threatening manner.

The man reportedly left the scene in a white Volkswagen Transporter and when the vehicle was traced a roofing tool was located behind the driver's seat.

There were no reports of any injuries.

A 44-year-old Swanage man was arrested on suspicion of possessing an offensive weapon in a public place and using threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour with intent to cause fear of or provoke unlawful violence and has been released under investigation.

Police Constable Tom Renshaw, of Purbeck police, said: "We are continuing to investigate this incident and I would urge any witnesses who have not already spoken to police to please contact me."
