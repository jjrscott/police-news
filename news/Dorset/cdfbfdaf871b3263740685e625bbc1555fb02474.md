# Witness appeal following serious injury collision in Sherborne

31 October 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a serious injury collision in Sherborne are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

Dorset Police received a report at 12.08pm on Thursday 29 October 2020 of a collision involving a MAN 18T HGV and a pedestrian in the Waitrose car park on Cheap Street.

Officers attended, along with the ambulance service. The pedestrian - a woman aged in her 70s from Sturminster Newton - was taken to Southmead Hospital in Bristol with injuries that are believed to be life-changing.

Police Constable Donal Doyle, of the traffic unit, said: "We are carrying out enquiries to establish the full circumstances of this collision and I would ask for any witnesses to please come forward.

"I would also ask anyone who was in the car park at the relevant time and has dashcam fitted to their vehicle to please check their footage for anything that might assist our investigation.

"Finally, I would like to thank members of the public for their patience and understanding during the road closures, which were necessary to allow the emergency services to respond to the incident and for an examination of the scene to be carried out."
