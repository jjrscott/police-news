# Appeal for witnesses after robbery in Weymouth

23 October 2018

* * *

Officers in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses following a robbery.

The incident happened at the junction of Abbotsbury Road and Weymouth Way at around 10am on Saturday 20 October 2018.

The victim - a local man aged in his 40s - was driving his blue Ford Fiesta when he stopped at the traffic lights.

A man then approached his vehicle from behind, opened the driver's door and punched the victim in the face.

The offender then tried to pull the victim from the vehicle, but was prevented by the seatbelt. At some point, his wallet fell from his pocket and the offender picked it up before walking away.

The victim did not require medical treatment.

The offender is described as black, aged in his late 30s or early 40s, around six feet two inches tall and of medium build. He had short curly black hair with grey stubble and was wearing a black bomber jacket, dark jeans and white trainers.

Police Constable Darren Tharme, of Weymouth Police, said: "This was a very distressing incident for the victim and we are determined to identify the man responsible.

"This was a particularly busy time of the day and I am appealing to anyone who witnessed anything suspicious in the area around the time to please come forward.

"If you were driving in the area and have dashcam fitted to your vehicle, I would ask you to review this and please contact us if you have any relevant material."
