# Witness appeal following fatal collision near Blandford

21 April 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a fatal collision near Blandford.

At 8.27pm on Sunday 21 April 2019 a road traffic collision occurred on the A357 at Durweston involving an orange Suzuki Swift and a grey Kawasaki motorcycle.

Very sadly the rider of the motorcycle - a 22-year-old man from Sturminster Newton - died at the scene. His family have been informed and the coroner notified.

The driver of a Swift, a local woman aged in her 40s, sustained minor injuries and was taken to hospital.

The road remains closed between Durweston Bridge and Shillingstone.

Sergeant Craig Tatton, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the motorcyclist's family at this very difficult time.

"An investigation is underway into the circumstances of this collision and I would appeal to anyone who was travelling along the A357 at the relevant time and either witnessed the collision or the manner of riding or driving of the vehicles involved to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would also ask these motorists to check their dashcam footage to see if they have anything that may be relevant to my investigation.

"Finally, I would like to thank residents and other motorists for their patience and understanding during the road closures, which are necessary to allow us to establish what happened."
