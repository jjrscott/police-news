# Appeal following theft of catalytic converters in East and North Dorset

25 September 2019

* * *

Officers are urging the public in East and North Dorset to remain vigilant and report any suspicious behaviour following a spate of catalytic converter thefts.

Between Wednesday 11 September and Tuesday 24 September 2019 a total of 19 reports have been made to Dorset Police about the theft of the part from vehicles parked in the two areas of the county.

The thefts have occurred in Wimborne, Verwood, Alderholt, Ferndown, Shaftesbury and Gillingham.

Police Sergeant Tim Travers, of East Dorset police, said: "These thefts have had a significant financial and personal impact on the victims who have been left to foot the bill to pay for new ones to be fitted while not being able to use their vehicles. It would appear that in a number of the incidents Honda vehicles have been targeted.

"We have a full investigation underway to identify the person or people responsible for these thefts. Our enquiries have centered around checking household CCTV systems in the event the offender or offenders have been caught on camera.

"I would like to remind residents in these areas to remain vigilant and report any suspicious behaviour to Dorset Police. I am also keen to hear from any residents who may have captured anything relevant to my investigation on CCTV."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190148660. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
