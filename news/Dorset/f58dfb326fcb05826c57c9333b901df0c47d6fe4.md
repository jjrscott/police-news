Detectives investigating two alleged burglaries in Bournemouth that may be linked have arrested a woman.

It had been reported that between 10pm and 11pm on Wednesday 29 August 2018 a woman was found inside two different flats on Seabourne Road in the Southbourne area of the town. On both occasions it is alleged that she was discovered by the residents of the flat, challenged and then left the address. Nothing was stolen.

Last night, Friday 31 August 2018, a 38-year-old Bournemouth woman was arrested on suspicion of burglary and is helping officers with their enquiries.
