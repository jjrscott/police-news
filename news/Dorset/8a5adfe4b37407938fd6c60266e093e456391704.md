# Appeal for information following criminal damage and assault in Poole

29 July 2020

* * *

Officers investigating an incident of criminal damage and assault in Poole are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

Between 12pm and 12.30pm on Monday 20 July 2020 a man aged in his 40s was driving a Mini Cooper convertible with the roof down along The Esplanade in Canford Cliffs near to the play area when a group of teenagers threw an egg at the passenger side of his vehicle.

The egg sprayed over the passenger in the vehicle, a woman aged in her 80s. It also caused damage to the paintwork of the car.

Police Constable Simon Shaw, of Dorset Police, said: "I am keen to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time and witnessed the incident or has had an egg thrown at their vehicle in similar circumstances in the vicinity recently.

"I would also ask any motorists who were travelling along The Esplanade around the time of the incident and have dashcam fitted to their vehicle to please check the footage for anything relevant.

"If you know who was responsible, please get in touch as soon as possible."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200106350. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
