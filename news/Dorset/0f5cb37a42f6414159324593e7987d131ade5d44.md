# Update â€“ man arrested in connection with reported burglary at hospital in Bournemouth

15 January 2021

* * *

A man has been arrested in connection with a reported burglary at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital.

It was reported that at around 6.15pm on Monday 14 December 2020 access was gained to a locked area to the rear of the cafe in the main foyer of the hospital and a CCTV hard drive was allegedly stolen, as well as other items.

Around 45 minutes later the same man was reported to have broken into vending machines in another area of the hospital and emptied the cash box.

Following enquiries and a CCTV appeal, a 44-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of burglary and has been released on police bail as officers continue their investigation.

We would like to thank everyone who shared our appeal.
