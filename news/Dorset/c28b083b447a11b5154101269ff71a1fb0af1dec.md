# Witness appeal following reported attempted robbery in Bournemouth

11 November 2019

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward as they investigate a reported robbery in Bournemouth town centre.

Three people have been arrested and charged in connection with the incident, which occurred in Central Gardens at around 3.45pm on Thursday 7 November 2019.

Officers attended the gardens following a report that two 17-year-old boys were being attacked by three male suspects.

The victims were located near to the bus stop at the entrance to the gardens opposite House of Fraser. They reported that they had been followed by the three suspects before they demanded money from them.

The boys were reportedly assaulted but did not hand anything over and the alleged offenders walked off.

Following searches of the area, a 16-year-old Poole boy, 17-year-old Bournemouth boy and a 23-year-old man of no fixed abode were arrested and subsequently charged with attempted robbery. They appeared at Poole Magistrates' Court on Saturday 9 November 2019 and are next due to appear at Bournemouth Crown Court on Thursday 12 December 2019.

Detective Constable Ben Swain, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We are continuing to make enquiries into this incident and I would appeal to any witnesses who have not spoken to police to please contact us.

"I understand a group of people intervened and came to the aid of the victims during the incident and I would be keen to speak to members of that group."
