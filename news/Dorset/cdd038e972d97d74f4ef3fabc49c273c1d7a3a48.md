# Appeal following unprovoked assault in Bournemouth

03 July 2019

* * *

Officers are appealing for anyone with information to come forward following a serious unprovoked assault in Bournemouth.

Just before midnight on Thursday 27 June 2019 the victim - a local man aged in his 50s - was walking along St Luke's Road when he was approached from behind by two men riding bicycles who verbally abused him.

The suspects got off their bikes, reached into a backpack and took out a weapon, believed to be a chain or something similar, and attacked the victim by hitting him around the top of the head, eyes and mouth.

They cycled off toward Winton.

The victim was taken to Poole Hospital for treatment. He has sustained damage to his retina and has undergone treatment. It is possible that he may have sustained permanent damage to the vision in his left eye. He also sustained cuts to his head and injuries to his left wrist, hand and thigh.

The first suspect is described as white, aged in his 20s, around six feet tall, of skinny build and wore a dark-coloured hooded top with the hood up and black tracksuit bottoms.

The second suspect is described as white, also aged in his 20s and of skinny build, around six feet tall and wore a khaki green hooded top, black trousers and was wearing a dark-coloured rucksack.

Police Constable Jon Park, of North Bournemouth police, said: "This was a violent and unprovoked assault on a man as he walked home.

"We are continuing to investigate this incident and our extensive enquiries include looking for CCTV images of the suspects.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed this incident and is yet to speak to officers to please contact us. I am also keen to hear from anyone who may know the identity of the men responsible for this assault."
