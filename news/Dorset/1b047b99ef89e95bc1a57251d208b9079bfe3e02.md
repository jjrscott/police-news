# Update â€“ man in court in connection with reported sexual assaults in Bournemouth

18 July 2019

* * *

A man has appeared in court in connection with a series of reported sexual assaults in Bournemouth.

It was reported that two separate women were sexually assaulted just after 5.21pm on Saturday 13 April 2019 at the Co-op petrol station on Castle Lane West. Two further incidents were reported to have taken place in the Castlepoint area a short time later. It was alleged the offender smacked or touched the bottoms of the women.

Following enquiries, a 34-year-old Bournemouth man was arrested and he was subsequently issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 12 July 2019 for five offences of sexual assault.

He is next due to appear at Bournemouth Crown Court on Thursday 15 August 2019.
