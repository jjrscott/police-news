# Witness appeal following road traffic collisions on Portland

30 June 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses following two road traffic collisions on the Portland Beach Road.

The first collision occurred at around 11.35pm yesterday, Thursday 29 June 2017, and involved a blue Honda motorcycle and a red Peugeot 308.

The ambulance service attended and the motorcyclist was taken to hospital with serious injuries, which are not believed to be life threatening or life changing.

At around 2.30am today, Friday 30 June 2017, a further collision occurred at the scene involving a stationary police vehicle and a red Volkswagen Polo.

Two officers sustained serious but not life changing or life threatening injuries and were taken to hospital for treatment.

A 22-year-old Weymouth man has been arrested on suspicion of driving offences in relation to the second collision and is assisting officers with their enquiries.

Road closures were put in place as emergency services dealt with the incident.

Police Sergeant Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing for witnesses to either collision who have not already spoken to police to come forward.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who witnessed the manner of driving of any of the vehicles involved prior to the two collisions.

"I want to thank members of the public for their patience during the road closures that were put in place to allow the emergency services to do their work."
