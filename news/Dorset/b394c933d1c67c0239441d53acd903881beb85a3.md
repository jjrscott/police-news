# Update - Investigation underway following incidents in Poole

12 July 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating two incidents in Poole are issuing an update.

At 11.14am yesterday, Wednesday 11 July 2018, Dorset Police received a report from a hospital that they were concerned for the welfare of a female patient in her 40s, who had been transferred to the critical care unit after being admitted to hospital on Saturday 7 July 2018. It had been reported that she had sustained bruising and had collapsed.

She remains in a critical condition in hospital.

Officers are investigating the circumstances of how the woman came to be in such a critical condition. A property in Knowlton Road forms part of that ongoing investigation.

At 2.20pm yesterday officers were called to reports that the body of a 34-year-old man had been found in woods off Leicester Road. His next of kin have been notified and the coroner has been informed.

An examination of the scene was carried out yesterday and following these initial enquiries the death is no longer being treated as suspicious. The cordon has been lifted and officers are carrying out further enquiries on behalf of the coroner.

A 40-year-old man from Poole who was arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm with intent on the woman has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

He was also arrested on suspicion of murder in relation to the second incident but has been released without charge for this offence.

Today, Thursday 12 July 2018, a 28-year-old man from Poole has been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm in relation to the woman in hospital and is assisting officers with their enquiries.

Detective Chief Inspector Steve Symms, of Bournemouth CID, said: "Our investigation into how the woman fell critically ill remains ongoing.

"I would like to thank residents in Penn Hill for their patience and understanding while we carried out our investigations into the man's death yesterday. These have revealed that his death is not suspicious and there was no third party involvement."

Poole Neighbourhood Inspector Ady Thompson said: "Residents can expect to see some extra neighbourhood patrols on the streets over the next few days and anybody who has any concerns is encouraged to approach these officers and speak to them."
