# Witness appeal following reported assault in Poole

06 March 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a man was reportedly assaulted following an altercation in Poole.

Sometime between 11.45am and midday on Saturday 3 March 2018 it was reported that an altercation occurred between two men in the car park of the Travelodge on Holes Bay Road, which is also attached to the car park for the Asda supermarket.

The initial altercation occurred inside a silver BMW X5 when a 72-year-old local man was allegedly punched in the mouth. He sustained a cut to his lip.

It is reported that both men then left the vehicle and exchanged words in the car park before a further altercation occurred. The second man then got into a silver Land Rover Discovery.

A 48-year-old man from Wrexham voluntary attended the police station to be questioned on suspicion of assault and has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Both men are known to each other.

Police Constable Riona Hanley, of Poole police, said: "This incident occurred on a Saturday morning and, while it may not have been as busy as normal because of the snow, I believe there were a number of people in the area at the time who may have witnessed all or part of the incident.

"I would ask anyone who did witness an incident between two men in the area at the relevant time to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180032648. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
