# Dorset Police take Operation Wheels to Poole Bike Night

01 September 2016

* * *

On Tuesday 30 August, Dorset Police took part in a 'special' bike night at Poole Quay in support of Operation Wheels.

For the first time, biker representatives from the South Western Ambulance Service, Dorset & Wiltshire Fire and Rescue, Dorset Police and Dr Ian Mew (Doc Bike) himself hit the quay together, in support of the Force's ongoing preventative operation to reduce motorcycle casualties across the county.

During the evening, Dr Ian Mew, Dorset Police's medical advisor was presented with a certificate for being the first UK doctor to complete a Police Riding course, which allows him to support our emergency services and ride a marked "Doctor" bike in response to motorcycle collisions.

Riders are the most at risk road user group, accounting for 25 per cent of those killed or seriously injured whilst covering just 1 per cent of road miles travelled.

To understand the circumstances in which riders are being killed or critically injured, Dorset Police has analysed both police and medical data.

It was found that in 74 per cent of cases, rider error was a contributing factor. Of those killed or seriously injured from 2010-2014, 52 per cent were aged between 40 and 59 years old and nearly all were male.

Officers from the Alliance Road Policing team are patrolling 'red routes' that have statistically seen the most collisions, encouraging riders and drivers to work together to keep our roads safe.

As part of Operation Wheels, Dorset Police has also created a BikeSafe rider handout that will be given to all riders that come into contact with an officer. As well as signposting bikers to additional training, it contains advice including how to plan better road positioning, make yourself more visible, anticipate the dangers and how to respond if you find a biker down.

Inspector Matt Butler of the Alliance Road Policing team, said: "Having biker representatives from across the emergency services attend Poole Bike Night formed a vital part of ongoing efforts to reduce casualties.

"We know all too well how being a rider on our roads makes us vulnerable. We don't have the protection of a car body around us; we have to rely on our own judgement.

"Unfortunately, we deal with what happens when it goes wrong on a daily basis. We hope that our collective experience has enabled us to pass on a few lifesaving tips to keep riders safe and reduce the number of calls to collisions we receive year on year."

Doc Bike, Dr Ian Mew, said: "Whether in the air ambulance or on the DocBike, if you meet me at the roadside something has gone seriously wrong. Through BikeSafe, Biker Down and working with advanced rider groups, we want to inform bikers of how to keep out of trouble and how to keep someone alive until the ambulance arrives if the worst happens."

Paramedic Adam Rathbone, of the South Western Ambulance Service, said: "In the nicest possible way, I don't want to meet bikers on a professional basis. Enjoy riding, stay safe and get home."
