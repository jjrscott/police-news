# Witness appeal following robbery in Bournemouth

09 April 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating a robbery in Bournemouth are appealing for any potential witnesses to come forward.

At 11am on Saturday 7 April 2018 a robbery occurred on the footpath from West Overcliff Drive to Alum Chine car park near the Tropical Gardens.

The victim - a local man aged in his 20s - was approached by a man who asked him for the time. As he got his phone out to check the time, a second man walked up behind and stretched some sort of metal wire across the victim's neck.

The first offender then produced a knife from his tracksuit waistband and demanded the victim's rucksack. The second offender searched through the victim's pockets and stole a mobile phone, wallet and cash.

The victim sustained minor injuries to his neck, which didn't require hospital treatment.

The first offender is described as white, aged in his 20s, of stocky build and five feet eight inches tall. He had tanned skin, short dark curly hair and a short beard which was described as being well-kept. He wore a green tracksuit and baseball cap.

The victim did not see the second offender's face but saw part of his arm and therefore believes he is a black man.

Detective Sergeant Ian Allen, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This was a very frightening experience for the victim and he is lucky to have not been more seriously injured. I would like to reassure members of the public that a full investigation is underway involving CCTV and other detailed enquiries.

"This is a popular location, especially on a Saturday morning, and I would urge anyone who was in the area at the relevant time and saw or heard anything suspicious to please contact Dorset Police.

"Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team are aware of this incident and will be continuing to patrol the area to reassure the community."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180051481. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
