# Witness appeal following serious injury road traffic collision in West Parley

14 June 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to a road traffic collision that left a motorcyclist with a serious leg injury.

Just before 6pm yesterday, Tuesday 13 June 2017, a collision occurred on Christchurch Road in West Parley, by the junction with Church Lane.

The collision involved a black Yamaha motorcycle and a red Volkswagen Transporter panel van.

The motorcyclist, a 59-year-old man from the Bournemouth area, was flown by air ambulance to Southampton Hospital after suffering a serious leg injury.

His pillion passenger, a 36-year-old Bournemouth woman, was also taken to hospital but her injuries are not believed to be serious.

The driver of the van was uninjured.

Officers have praised the members of the public who went to assist the injured motorcyclist.

Sergeant Fern Graham, of the traffic unit, said: "I commend the action of all those people who stopped to help and would like to publicly thank them.

"While the injured man has suffered serious life changing injuries, if it was not for their brave intervention the outcome could have been even more tragic.

"I would also like to thank members of the public for their patience while the scene was examined."

Officers are also appealing for any witnesses to the collision, or anyone who witnessed either vehicle in the area prior to the collision, to contact police.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 13:380. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
