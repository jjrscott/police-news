# Update - CCTV appeal following bank card theft in Poole

13 September 2019

* * *

Two men have been arrested in connection with a bank card theft in Poole and other bank fraud offences in Dorset.

It was reported that on the morning of Friday 16 August 2019 an elderly woman received a phone call from a man purporting to be the manager of NatWest bank. He informed her that her accounts were being merged and he asked her to attend the bank to trade her two bank cards into one.

The victim informed the caller that she was unable to attend the bank. The man reportedly told her that someone would attend her house in Poole to collect the cards.

It is reported a man later attended and the victim handed over her cards.

It is alleged two of the victim's stolen cards were subsequently used to withdraw cash at 3.05pm that day at the cashpoint at Tesco in Fernside Road and later in Hackney in London.

A CCTV appeal was issued on Wednesday 28 August 2019 of a man officers wished to identify.

On Wednesday 11 September 2019 a 23-year-old man from Newham, London, and a 26-year-old man from North Woolwich in London were arrested in Wiltshire on suspicion of fraud and have been released on police bail pending further enquiries.

They have been arrested in relation to the bank card theft in Poole as well as 10 other similar offences in Shaftesbury and East Dorset and four in Wiltshire.
