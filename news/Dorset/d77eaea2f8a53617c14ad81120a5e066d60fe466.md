# Family appeal for missing Poole man

27 December 2018

* * *

The family of a missing man from Poole is asking for the public's help in finding him.

Mark Keadell, 50 and of Kimmeridge Avenue, was reported missing at 1.38pm on Wednesday 19 December 2018.

Mark is white, five feet seven inches tall and of average to slim build. He has short grey hair and grey blue eyes.

The family of Mark said: "We want Mark to come home. We are all so worried about his disappearance and want to make sure he is safe.

"No matter how insignificant a piece of information may seem, please come forward and get in touch with police.

"Mark, please get in contact, we love you and just want to know where you are."

Inspector Richard Honnywill, of Dorset Police, said: "We are still very concerned for Mark's welfare as he has not been seen by his family for over a week now, which is highly unusual and out of character.

"We believe he will not have vital medication with him. Therefore, we need to find him urgently to ensure he is all right.

"I would encourage anyone who believes they have seen Mark to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information or knowledge as to Mark's whereabouts is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 19:200.
