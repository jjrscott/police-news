# Witness appeal following fatal collision in Christchurch

27 July 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a fatal collision in Christchurch.

At around 2.30pm on Monday 17 July 2017 a bronze coloured Toyota Yaris was involved in a collision in the car park behind the Regents Centre in Christchurch. No other vehicles were involved in the incident.

A 69-year-old Bournemouth woman, who was a passenger in the car, was taken to hospital with serious injuries. She sadly died in hospital on Tuesday 25 July.

Police Constable Kevin Farenden, of the traffic unit, said: "We acknowledge this collision was some time ago but Dorset Police was only made aware of this incident following the sad death of the woman in hospital and I am keen to establish exactly what happened.

"I understand there may have been other people in the car park at the time of the collision, and I am appealing for them or anyone who may have witnessed the incident who has not already contacted police to get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170114416. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
