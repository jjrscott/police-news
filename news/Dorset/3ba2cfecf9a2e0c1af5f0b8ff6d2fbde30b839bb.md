# Update â€“ reported serious assault in Bournemouth

09 February 2018

* * *

Detectives are issuing an update on their investigation into a reported serious assault in Bournemouth.

At 5.47pm on Saturday 7 October 2017 it was reported that an altercation had taken place involving a group of people at the Kings Arms in Wallisdown Road during which a man in his 50s sustained injuries.

Shortly afterwards a further incident was reported at the school playing field in Talbot Drive. Following this, a 23-year-old man was found unconscious and taken to hospital for treatment to serious injuries. He has since been released from hospital. A teenage boy also sustained minor injuries.

A 29-year-old man and a 40-year-old man, both from Bournemouth, were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and have now been released without charge for that offence.

Detectives have carried out a detailed investigation and are not looking for anyone else in connection with this incident.

The 29-year-old man has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 23 February 2018 for offences of driving without due care and attention and criminal damage to property on the same night.
