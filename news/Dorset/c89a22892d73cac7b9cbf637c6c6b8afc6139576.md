A man has been charged and has appeared in court in connection with a reported burglary and alleged vehicle offences on Portland.

It was reported that at around 5am on Friday 1 January 2021 someone entered a house in Easton Street and took a set of keys. A blue Ford Focus that was parked on the road outside was allegedly stolen, as well as a men's Adidas coat.

It is reported that the Ford was then sighted around Weymouth and Portland before being abandoned in Weymouth.

There were also two reports of the attempted theft of vehicles in Easton Square. These were believed to have occurred at around 4am on Friday 1 January 2021.

Following enquiries by detectives from Weymouth CID, a 33-year-old local man was arrested and subsequently charged with burglary, theft from a motor vehicle, vehicle interference, aggravated vehicle taking, driving without valid insurance and driving whilst disqualified.

He appeared at Poole Magistrates' Court on Monday 18 January 2021 and is next due to appear at Bournemouth Crown Court on Thursday 18 February 2021.
