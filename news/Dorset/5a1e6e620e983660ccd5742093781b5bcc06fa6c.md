# Witness appeal after wheelchair stolen in Dorchester

12 April 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for information after a wheelchair was stolen in Dorchester.

The wheelchair was taken from outside an address in the town centre between 1pm and 6pm on Wednesday 22 March 2017.

The wheelchair, which was provided by the NHS and was being used by a local woman in her 50s, is an Active 2 model which is mainly black.

The head rest and back pillow were not on the wheelchair when it was taken.

Following investigations, officers are now appealing to the public for any information regarding the wheelchair.

Police Constable Jackie Kearle, of Dorset Police, said: "This was a despicable offence as the victim relied on the wheelchair to get around.

"Having now had the opportunity to speak further with the victim, she has been provided with a replacement by the NHS but the incident has caused her considerable distress.

"I would ask anyone with information about this incident or who comes across a wheelchair matching the description given to please contact me."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170042156. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestopeers-uk.org.
