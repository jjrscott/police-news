# Witness appeal following fail-to-stop collision in Bridport

01 September 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a fail-to-stop collision in Bridport are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

At around 8.45am on Saturday 29 August 2020 a male cyclist - aged in his 60s and from Somerset - was riding along the B3162 when a small lorry turned out of Donkey Lane and collided with him. The lorry was white and had a large pipe sticking out from it.

The cyclist went to hospital for treatment to three broken ribs and a punctured lung.

Police Constable Dan White, of Bridport police said: "The driver of the lorry did not stop at the scene and an investigation is underway to locate them.

"I would ask anyone who witnessed the incident, or has dashcam footage of the vehicle on North Allington, to please get in touch.

"I am also keen to hear from residents who may have seen a small lorry matching the description given in the Donkey Lane area recently."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200130972. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
