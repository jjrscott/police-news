A man is due to appear in court in connection with a serious collision in Shaftesbury.

At 1.26pm on Tuesday 12 December 2017 a two vehicle collision occurred on Salisbury Road near to the junction with Greenacre Way involving a black Hyundai i40 and a black Peugeot 307.

The driver of the Hyundai, a 64-year-old man from Singapore, sustained injuries that were initially believed to be life-threatening and was taken to hospital but was later released. His passenger, a 95-year-old man from Salisbury, sustained serious injuries and was also taken to hospital.

A 68-year-old woman, who was the driver of the Peugeot, sustained serious injuries and was also taken to hospital.

A 64-year-old man from Singapore has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 5 June 2018 for an offence of driving without due care and attention.
