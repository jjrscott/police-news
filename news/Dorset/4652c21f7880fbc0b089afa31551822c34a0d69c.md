* * *

A man has been arrested in connection with an alleged serious assault in Bournemouth.

It was reported that at around 1.30pm on Friday 16 March 2018 a 46-year-old local man was walking into Denmark Road from Castle Road when another man walked past him and barged him with his shoulder.

The alleged victim shouted at the suspect, which reportedly led to a scuffle between the pair.

It was reported that during the scuffle that the alleged victim felt the other man push him onto the railings of some iron gates. His arm was impaled on the spike of the gate.

The man freed himself and sought help from a nearby doctor's surgery. He was taken to hospital for treatment to an artery injury, which has required him to undergo surgery.

Following a CCTV appeal, a 27-year-old Bournemouth man attended Bournemouth police station and has been arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm. He has been released under investigation as police enquiries continue.
