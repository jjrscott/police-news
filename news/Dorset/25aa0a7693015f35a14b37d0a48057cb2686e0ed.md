# Witness appeal following reported sexual assault in Poole

26 January 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating a reported sexual assault in Poole are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At around 3.55pm yesterday, Wednesday 25 January 2017, officers were called to Jellicoe Close off Constitution Hill following reports a man approached a woman and forcibly persuaded her to get into a white van. It was reported that once inside the van the man sexually assaulted her.

The woman - aged in her 40s - got out of the van and left. She was not physically injured.

The van, which had ladders on the back, was found nearby.

A 43-year-old man from Christchurch has been arrested on suspicion of sexual assault and is currently assisting officers with enquiries.

Detective Sergeant Karen Penn, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I believe that shortly after the reported incident, the man approached a second woman and spoke to her.

"I would urge anyone who has been approached by a man in unusual circumstances in the area to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident or who saw a similar van driving in the area in recent weeks."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170012486. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
