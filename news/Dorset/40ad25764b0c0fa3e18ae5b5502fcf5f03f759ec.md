A man is due to appear in court in connection with the alleged theft of a bike from outside a hospital in Dorchester.

Some time between 7.30am and 6pm on Saturday 27 June 2020 a red Specialized Allez Elite road bike was reportedly stolen from outside the North entrance to Dorset County Hospital.

Following a CCTV appeal and enquiries by officers, a 41-year-old Bournemouth man has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Thursday 10 December 2020 for an offence of theft. He is also due to appear in connection with three further alleged bike theft offences.
