# Series of motorcycle thefts in Weymouth, Portland and Dorchester - appeal

02 November 2017

* * *

Officers in Dorchester, Weymouth and Portland are warning the public following a series of motorcycle thefts across the area.

A theft occurred on Beverley Road in Weymouth sometime between 5pm on Monday 30 October and 9am on Tuesday 31 October 2017. A grey Hyosung motorcycle was stolen, which has since been recovered. An attempted theft of a motorcycle also occurred over a similar time period on Dorchester Road.

Dorset Police has received at least 47 reports in the three areas of thefts or attempted thefts of motorcycles since February 2017.

Weymouth and Portland Deputy Neighbourhood Inspector Darren Stanton, said: "A detailed investigation is ongoing into this series of thefts and I am appealing to anyone with information about the thefts to please contact Dorset Police.

"I would strongly advise motorcycle owners to ensure their bike is secure and to follow our crime prevention steps to ensure you do not become the victim of bike thieves."

Top tips on securing your motorbike:

• Always take your keys with you when you leave your motorbike, even for a short time. If you have security devices fitted, always use them.
• Fit an approved alarm and immobiliser (and sticker) to your bike - this will deter criminals. If the criminal manages to bypass the alarm, the immobiliser will make it difficult if not impossible to start.
• Park your bike in designated areas that are in full view of a busy street or car park.
• Always try and lock your bike away in a secure location such as a garage or shed when it is not in use. By doing this you may also benefit from cheaper bike insurance.
• If you cannot do this then consider adding additional high security measures such as wheel clamps to deter thieves.
• Security mark as many parts of the motorcycle and accessories as possible, use the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) or unique coding supplied by a security company.
