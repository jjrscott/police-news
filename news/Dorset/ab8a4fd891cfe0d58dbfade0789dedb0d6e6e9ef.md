A man arrested in connection with an alleged fail-to-stop collision in Bournemouth has been charged and has appeared in court.

At around 3.55pm on Thursday 12 January 2017 police were called to Ashley Road opposite the bus depot at the Sovereign Centre in Boscombe following a report that a woman had been struck by a vehicle that had failed to stop at the scene.

The victim, a 20-year-old woman from Bournemouth, sustained a broken ankle and severe bruising to her legs as a result of the incident.

A 33-year-old Poole man has been charged with failing to stop at the scene of an accident and driving without due care and attention and appeared at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 5 September 2017. He is next due to appear at the same court on Tuesday 5 December 2017.
