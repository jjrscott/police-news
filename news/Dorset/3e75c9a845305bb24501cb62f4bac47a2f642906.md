# Bournemouth drug house closed following court order

14 December 2016

* * *

A house used for drug-related activity and anti-social behaviour in Bournemouth has been closed following a court order.

The closure order was issued by Bournemouth Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 22 November 2016 under the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014.

The order states that the premises of 30 Midland Road will remain closed for three months from the issue date and that anyone who remains in or enters the address is liable for prosecution.

The application was made after complaints were received from residents about drug-related activity and anti-social behaviour at the address.

A Misuse of Drugs Act Warrant was executed in August 2016 with over 4,000 tablets of prescription drugs and a quantity of methadone seized.

Police Constable Gareth Bridger, of Bournemouth North Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "We have listened to concerns of residents and have taken positive action to close the address.

"I would like to thank the residents for their ongoing patience and support. We worked alongside local people and Bournemouth Borough Council to obtain this closure order from court.

"We will always seek to take action and use police powers where there is evidence of drug activity and anti-social behaviour.

"I would encourage residents to report any concerns about such activity in their community to Dorset Police or anonymously to Crimestoppers."

Anyone with information or concerns about anti-social behaviour or drug-related activity is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
