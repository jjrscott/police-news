# Witness appeal following attempted robbery in Dorchester

04 January 2021

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following an attempted knifepoint robbery in Dorchester.

At around 5.30pm on Thursday 31 December 2020 the victim - a local man aged in his 50s - was walking on South Walks when he was approached by a man who asked for directions. The man then produced a knife and demanded money.

The victim managed to kick out at the offender and run away from the scene. He was not injured during the incident.

The man is described as white, aged around 35 years old, approximately five feet eight inches tall, and of medium to stocky build. He was wearing a grey hooded top with red or orange lining and dark-coloured clothing, including a padded jacket. The man spoke with an Eastern European accent.

Detective Sergeant Simon Austin, of Weymouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the area and witnessed what happened to please get in touch.

"I would also like to hear from any motorists who were driving along South Walks at the relevant time and may have captured any footage on dashcam to assist my enquiries."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200196465. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
