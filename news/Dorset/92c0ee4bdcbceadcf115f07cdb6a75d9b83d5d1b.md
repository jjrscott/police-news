# UPDATE - Witness appeal after alleged attempted robbery on bus in Christchurch

13 July 2016

* * *

A man has been arrested in connection with an alleged attempted robbery on a bus in Christchurch.

The incident occurred at around 4.35pm on Monday 6 June 2016 on the 1A bus from Bournemouth to Christchurch.

The driver stopped at a scheduled stop close to the junction of Harewood Avenue in Bournemouth where a man got on the bus. As the bus arrived at the roundabout at Stanpit Road at the end of Purewell Road in Christchurch it is alleged the man attempted to grab the driver's box of change.

The driver was assaulted during the incident and sustained a minor injury. Nothing was stolen.

A 52-year-old man of Bournemouth was arrested on suspicion of attempted robbery and racially/religiously aggravated fear or provocation of violence and has been released on police bail pending further enquiries until the end of July 2016.
