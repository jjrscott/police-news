# Witness appeal following serious collision in North Dorset

23 July 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a serious injury road traffic collision in North Dorset are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

Dorset Police received a report at 4.57pm on Wednesday 22 July 2020 of a single vehicle collision involving a white Ford Transit tipper truck that had left the carriageway of the B3091 at Hartgrove near Shaftesbury and collided with a tree.

Officers attended, along with the ambulance and fire services, and the driver of the vehicle - a local man aged in his 30s - was taken to Southampton General Hospital by air ambulance for treatment to serious injuries.

Two other occupants of the vehicle were treated for minor injuries.

The road was closed to allow the emergency services to deal with the incident. It was reopened at around 9.15pm.

Sergeant Lee Savage, of the traffic unit, said: "We are carrying out an investigation to establish the circumstances of this collision and I am appealing for any witnesses to please come forward.

"I would also urge anyone who was driving in the area at the time and has dashcam fitted to their vehicle to check their footage for anything relevant.

"Finally, I would like to thank members of the public for their patience and understanding during the road closure, which was necessary to allow the emergency services to respond to the incident and for a detailed examination of the scene to take place."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 22:364. Alternatively, or alternatively to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
