# Appeal following reported robbery and kidnap

05 July 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating a reported robbery and kidnap are appealing for anyone who may have come across the victim after the incident to come forward.

The victim, a 21-year-old Bournemouth man, reportedly met up with one man he knew and three other men at his home address at around 11.30pm on Thursday 29 June 2017 and got into a car with them.

It was reported that they collected another unknown man before heading to a forest, where the victim was threatened with a firearm and asked to hand over his bank card, PIN and mobile phone.

It was alleged he was then taken to a petrol station where his card was used to withdraw cash and pay for fuel before the victim was returned to the forest and left there.

He does not know the location of where he was left, but it is believed to be in the Wareham Forest area.

The victim - who has a strong Polish accent, is about five feet five inches tall and has long, wavy, dark brown hair - walked to Poole and stopped a number of people on the way to ask for directions to Bournemouth and Poole.

It is thought that one of the unidentified men in the car was also threatened during the incident.

Detective Sergeant Andy Haworth, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We have made a number of enquiries into this incident and would like to hear from anyone with any information.

"I am particularly keen to speak to anyone who may have come across the victim as he walked back to Poole in the early hours of Friday 30 June 2017."

Two Bournemouth men, aged 21 and 23, have been charged with robbery, kidnap and possessing a firearm while committing an offence and are next due to appear before Bournemouth Crown Court on Thursday 3 August 2017.

A further three Bournemouth men, aged 26, 30 and 34, have been arrested on suspicion of the same offences and have been released under investigation.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170098737. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
