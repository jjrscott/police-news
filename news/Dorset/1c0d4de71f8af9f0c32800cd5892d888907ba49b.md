# Witness appeal following two robberies in Bournemouth

30 December 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating two robberies in Bournemouth that may be linked are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward.

The first incident happened at around 4pm on Friday 28 December 2018 in Southbourne Road. A local woman in her 70s was walking along the road when a young man came running up behind her and pulled her handbag from her, causing her to fall to the side. He then ran off toward Tuckton.

The stolen bag, which has an African design, contained a mobile phone, a purse and house keys.

The offender has been described as white, possibly in his late teens, about five feet six inches tall and of slim build. He has dark brown scruffy hair and was wearing dark clothing - including a black top with a red or grey stripe across it.

Before the robbery the male offender was seen sitting on a bench nearby with a woman, who was older and taller than him. She has been described as white, of slim build with dark shoulder-length hair. She was wearing dark clothing, including a coat.

The second robbery took place at approximately 12.10pm on Sunday 30 December 2018 in Stourwood Avenue. A local woman in her 70s was approached from behind by a man and pushed into a vehicle before her brown handbag - which contained cash and a mobile phone - was stolen. The man then ran off toward the seafront. During the incident the victim sustained a head injury.

The male offender has been described as white, in his 20s, of slim build and with short dark hair. He wore a dark jacket and dark jeans.

Detective Sergeant Karen Penn, of Bournemouth CID, said: "Due to the similar descriptions of the offenders and the way both robberies occurred we believe they could be linked.

"These were frightening incidents for the victims and we need to catch those responsible to prevent them from targeting anyone else. We are conducting a number of enquiries including searches for relevant CCTV.

"I am appealing for any witnesses to either incident or anyone with information about the offenders to contact us as soon as possible."
