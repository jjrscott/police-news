Detectives investigating a reported attempted robbery in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At around 10.45pm on Tuesday 12 September 2017 it was reported that a man approached two other men as they walked in the area of Crescent Street and Derby Street, repeatedly demanded money and threatened to stab them. No weapon was seen.

The victims, two local men aged 18 and 19, were not physically injured.

The offender left the scene in the direction of Derby Street. He is described as white, aged in his late teens, with dark facial hair and was wearing a grey McKenzie hooded top with an orange logo.

A 21-year-old man of no fixed abode has been arrested on suspicion of attempted robbery and has been released under investigation.

Detective Constable Sarah Desmond, of Weymouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident, or saw any suspicious activity in the area at the time, to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly keen to hear from a couple who were walking their dog in the area at the time of the incident and may have witnessed all or part of the incident."
