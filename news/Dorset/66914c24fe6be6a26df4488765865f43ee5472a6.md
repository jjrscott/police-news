Officers investigating a reported altercation in Weymouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police received a report at around 1.15pm on Thursday 16 April 2020 of a disturbance on Abbotsbury Road, near to the junction with Chickerell Road, involving two women and a man.

Officers attended and a woman aged in her 30s was found at the scene with facial injuries. The woman was taken to hospital for treatment and also reported that she had lost her mobile phone during the altercation.

A man and a woman, both aged in their 20s and from Weymouth, have been arrested on suspicion of robbery and have been released under investigation as officers continue their enquiries into the incident.

Sergeant Richard Barnett, of Weymouth police, said: "We are appealing to anyone who witnessed this incident to please come forward.

"I am particularly keen to hear from the occupant of a flatbed lorry that I understand had stopped close to the scene when the reported altercation occurred."
