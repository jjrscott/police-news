# Witness appeal following knifepoint robbery in Bournemouth

17 April 2019

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a man was robbed at knifepoint in Bournemouth.

Sometime between 3.30pm and 4pm on Friday 12 April 2019 the victim – an 18-year-old man from Qatar – was walking down an alleyway off Branksome Wood Road leading to the Upper Gardens when he was approached from behind by three men.

One of the offenders held a knife to the victim’s neck while the others searched him for his wallet. His wallet containing ID, two Qatar bank cards and 2,000 Qatari riyal notes was stolen.

The victim sustained minor scratches to his neck. He has since returned home.

The offenders left the scene via the gardens.

All the offenders are described as white. The one who was armed with the knife had blond hair and a tattoo on his right hand of a skull and chains.

Detective Constable Nicky Sharpe, of Bournemouth CID, said: “This was a very frightening incident for the victim and I am appealing to anyone who was in the Upper Gardens area near Branksome Wood Road at the relevant time and recalls seeing three men acting suspiciously to please contact Dorset Police.

“I am also keen to hear from anyone who has been offered Qatari riyal currency since Friday in unusual circumstances."
