# Investigation into death of woman following incident in West Parley â€“ witness appeal

10 May 2020

* * *

Detectives investigating the death of a woman following an incident in West Parley are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

Dorset Police received a report from the ambulance service at 3.39pm on Saturday 9 May 2020 in relation to two people requiring medical assistance in the car park of the Horns Inn in Christchurch Road.

Officers attended to assist the ambulance service.

A woman aged in her 40s, who had reportedly been found unconscious, was taken to the Royal Bournemouth Hospital for medical treatment. Very sadly, she died in hospital on the morning of Sunday 10 May 2020. Her family has been informed and is being supported by specially-trained officers.

A man aged in his 40s was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and taken to Poole Hospital for treatment to injuries to his arms. He was later released from hospital. Following the death of the woman, he was further arrested on suspicion of murder and is assisting detectives with their enquiries.

The man and woman were known to each other.

Detective Chief Inspector Richard Dixey, of Dorset Police, said: "Our thoughts are of course with the woman who sadly died and her family.

"I would like to stress that the death is being treated as unexplained at this time and we have launched an investigation to establish the full circumstances of what happened. I would urge anyone with information to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who witnessed any activity in the car park of the Horns Inn on the afternoon of Saturday 9 May 2020 and has not already spoken to police. I would also urge anyone who was driving in the area and has dashcam fitted to their vehicle to check their footage."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200065559. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
