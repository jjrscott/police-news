# Man sentenced for drug supply offences in Bournemouth

03 March 2021

* * *

A man caught dealing drugs in Bournemouth has been sentenced.

Qamar Anthony-Sampoh, aged 21 and of St Peter's Grove, London, was sentenced at Bournemouth Crown Court on Friday 26 February 2021 after admitting two charges of possessing a class A drug with intent to supply.

He was given a two-year jail term, suspended for two years, with a requirement to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work in the community.

At around 2.20pm on Friday 22 November 2019 an officer on patrol in the area of Grove Road saw two known class A drug users who appeared to be waiting for someone.

They were then involved in an exchange with someone in a vehicle and the car, a Volkswagen Polo, was subsequently stopped by the officer in Derby Road. The vehicle then drove off into the grounds of a nearby property.

Officers attended the premises and Anthony-Sampoh was seen to discard something over a fence. He was detained for a drugs search and the item he had thrown was recovered.

It was found to be a bag containing around Â£500 in cash. The defendant then alerted officers that he had swallowed three wraps of class A drugs and had further drugs concealed on his person.

Officers subsequently found a further 50 wraps of crack cocaine and 16 wraps of heroin.

Police Constable Stuart Grant, of the Bournemouth South Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "We are committed to tackling the supply of class A drugs in our communities.

"Through our proactive patrols we were able to identify Qamar Anthony-Sampoh as someone involved in the drugs supply chain and bring him before the courts.

"I would urge anyone with information about suspected drug-related activity to contact us at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101."
