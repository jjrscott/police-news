A man is due to appear in court in connection with a road traffic collision near Wimborne.

At around 12.10pm on Monday 28 May 2018 a four-vehicle collision occurred in the area of Badbury Rings on the B3092 between Blandford and Wimborne.

A passenger in a Renault Clio that was involved in the collision was taken to hospital for treatment to serious injuries. Very sadly the man, aged in his 80s, died in hospital on Friday 12 October 2018.

Following a detailed investigation by the traffic unit, a 21-year-old man from Trowbridge in Wiltshire has now been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 24 April 2020 for an offence of causing death by dangerous driving.
