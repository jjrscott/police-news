# Update – man due in court in connection with theft of scratchcards in Bournemouth

25 September 2019

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with the alleged theft of scratchcards belonging to a Bournemouth store.

At around 1.20am on Tuesday 21 May 2019 a break-in occurred at the Tesco Express in Poole Road and a quantity of scratchcards, worth more than £1,000, were reportedly stolen.

A number of the cards were then reportedly cashed at various locations in Bournemouth.

Following a CCTV appeal, a 44-year-old Bournemouth man attended for a voluntary interview with police. He has now been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 1 October 2019 for offences of theft and fraud by false representation.
