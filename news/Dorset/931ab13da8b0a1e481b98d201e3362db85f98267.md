# Witness appeal following serious injury collision in Weymouth

20 May 2016

* * *

Police are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward after a serious injury collision in Weymouth.

The incident happened at around 4.55pm on Thursday 19 May 2016 outside the Royal Hotel, The Esplanade.

A 37-year-old man from Weymouth riding a bicycle was in collision with a 24-year-old Weymouth man riding a motorcycle.

The cyclist was initially thought to have suffered minor injuries, but his condition has since deteriorated and is now in a critical condition. He was initially taken to Dorset County Hospital, but has now been transferred to Southampton General Hospital for treatment.

Sergeant Nikki Burt, of Dorset Police's Traffic Unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or the manner of riding of either person prior to the incident to contact me.

"It was a busy time of the evening and we know that several people came to the assistance of both riders following the incident before the ambulance arrived. If you are one of these people and have not yet spoken to police I urge you to come forward to assist with my investigation."

Witnesses and anyone with information should call Dorset Police on 101 quoting incident number 19:322. Alternatively, call the free and anonymous Crimestoppers line on 0800 555 111 where mobile phone tariffs may apply.
