# Witness appeal after teenage girls racially abused in Shaftesbury

31 March 2017

* * *

Officers in Shaftesbury are appealing for witnesses to come forward after four teenage girls were racially abused in the town.

The incident happened at around 3.10pm on Tuesday 28 March 2017 along Barton Hill.

A man walking along the opposite side of the road began to shout racist abuse toward the girls - who were all aged between 14 and 15.

The man is described as white, aged in his early 40s, around five feet seven inches tall and of medium build. He was wearing a grey top, worn-out black trainers and a dark beanie hat with the hood pulled over the top. He had facial stubble and was described as looking dishevelled and unkempt.

Police Constable Simon Rogers, of North Dorset police, said: "This was a very frightening and deeply upsetting incident for the girls to endure and the extremely aggressive nature of the man caused the girls to fear for their safety.

"We will not tolerate such behaviour and I am appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident, or is able to identify the man from the description, to please contact police or call Crimestoppers anonymously."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 55170045328. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers.org.
