# Family tribute to ‘loving young man’ killed in East Dorset collision

07 February 2020

* * *

The family of a young man who sadly died in a collision in East Dorset have issued a tribute to their loved one.

At 10.38pm on Friday 24 January 2020 Dorset Police was called to an unnamed road running from Chalbury Common to Holt Forest to reports that a white Volkswagen Golf had left the road and collided with a tree.

The driver, a 20-year-old local man named by his family as Joshua Willis, sustained serious injuries and was airlifted to Southampton General Hospital for treatment. He very sadly passed away the following day.

His family said in a statement: "Josh was such a selfless, brave and beautiful young man. He was the most incredible son, brother, uncle, boyfriend and friend to all who knew him.

"He did everything and anything to make those he loved happy. Other people's needs were always put before his own and that never went unnoticed.

"Josh was the most loving young man who had the kindest heart and the funniest sense of humour.

"He had such a cheeky way of going about life but we wouldn't have asked for Josh to be any other way. Josh has left a huge hole in everyone's lives and will be sorely missed."

Joshua's funeral will be held at 3pm on Saturday 15 February and will take place at Harbour View, Randall's Hill, Lytchett Minster, Poole, BH16 6AN.

The family of Joshua Willis would like to thank all family and friends for any given contributions and kind words at this difficult time.

They said they would also like to thank the emergency services who helped on the night and the young man and father who stayed with Josh until he was transported to hospital.

Inspector Joe Pardey, of the traffic unit, said: "Our thoughts remain with Joshua's family at this very difficult time and they continue to be supported by specially-trained officers.

"We are continuing to investigate the circumstances of the collision and I would urge any witnesses who have not already spoken to police or anyone who may have relevant dascham footage to please contact us."
