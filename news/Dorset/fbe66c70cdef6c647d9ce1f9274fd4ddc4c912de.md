# Update â€“ witness appeal following reported attempted robbery in Weymouth

11 April 2018

* * *

Two men arrested in connection with an alleged attempted robbery in Weymouth have been released without charge.

Dorset Police received a report of an incident at around 10.20pm on Friday 6 October 2017 on Custom House Quay outside Rendezvous.

It was alleged the victim, a 61-year-old local man, was sitting in his parked car in one of the bays when two unknown men approached his vehicle and one got inside. The pair then left the area. Nothing was taken from the man and he was not injured.

Two local men, aged 37 and 42, were arrested on suspicion of attempted robbery and have now been released without charge.

Officers are not looking for anyone else in connection with this incident.
