# Fatal collision in Dorchester â€“ woman due in court

24 April 2018

* * *

A woman is due to appear in court next month charged in connection with a fatal collision in Dorchester.

Police were called at 7.46pm on Wednesday 27 December 2017 to reports of a collision between a pedestrian and a car on The Grove. It is alleged the driver failed to stop at the scene.

The female pedestrian - 39-year-old Erika Prisacaru from Dorchester - was taken to Dorset County Hospital, but she sadly died from her injuries. She left behind her six-year-old son Andrei who is now being cared for by relatives.

A 47-year-old local woman, who was arrested in connection with the collision, has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Friday 4 May 2018 for offences of failing to stop at the scene of a collision and failing to report a collision.

A 60-year-old Dorchester man who was arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice has been released from the investigation.
