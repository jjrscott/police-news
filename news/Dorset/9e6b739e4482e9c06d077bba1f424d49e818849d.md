# Update - appeal for information following reported dog bite incident in Blandford

03 August 2020

* * *

A woman has come forward following a reported dog bite incident in Blandford.

On Wednesday 15 July 2020 it is alleged that the victim - a man aged in his 70s - was walking his dog at Milldown Nature Reserve when he came across a Golden Retriever with a woman and a boy.

The two dogs started to play with each other, but the offending dog then reportedly became aggressive and the victim grabbed hold of it to stop it from attacking his dog.

When the victim returned to his car he realised he had been bitten on his arm. His jeans were also ripped and he had scratches on his legs.

Following an appeal, a woman has come forward and is assisting officers with their enquiries to establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident. No arrests have been made.
