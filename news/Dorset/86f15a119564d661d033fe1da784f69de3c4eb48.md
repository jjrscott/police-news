# Witness appeal after fatal road traffic collision in Christchurch

13 October 2016

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a fatal road traffic collision in Christchurch.

The incident happened just after 7pm today, Thursday 13 October 2016, when a cyclist and a grey VW Polo collided in Barrack Road.

The cyclist, a local man in his twenties, was taken to Royal Bournemouth Hospital with very serious injuries. Sadly, he was pronounced dead at the hospital. His family is being supported by specially trained officers.

The driver of the car, a 53-year-old Christchurch woman, was uninjured.

The road has been closed at the junction of Stour Road and Barrack Road, at Bailey Bridge roundabout and at Clarendon Road while emergency services deal with the incident and collision investigators inspect the scene. Motorists are advised to please avoid the area.

Police Constable Julie Loveless, of Dorset Police's Road Policing Team, said: "Our thoughts are with the young man's family at this difficult time.

"We would like to thank motorists for their patience during the road closure.

"I am appealing for anyone who witnessed the collision, and has not yet spoken with officers, to come forward and contact police."
