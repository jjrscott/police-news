# Update following reported theft from Poole store

13 October 2020

* * *

A man has been identified following a reported theft from a Poole store.

At around 11.40am on Thursday 10 September 2020 a man allegedly entered Beales store at the Dolphin Centre and picked up a vacuum cleaner and a pair of jeans before leaving without paying for them. The total value of the items was Â£179.99.

Following a CCTV appeal, a man aged in his 30s from the Poole area attended the store and admitted the offence, before paying for the stolen items.

A community resolution has been agreed, which is supported by the victim. No further action will be taken.
