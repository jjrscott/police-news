Officers investigating reports of an assault at a shopping centre in Bournemouth have arrested a man.

At around 12.30pm on Sunday 24 June 2018 a member of the public reported that she witnessed an assault while shopping in Asda in Castlepoint.

Detailed enquiries have been carried out and a CCTV image of a man officers wished to speak with was issued by Dorset Police on Thursday 4 October 2018.

A 33-year-old man from Bournemouth has now been arrested on suspicion of assault and using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause fear of or provoke unlawful violence. He is assisting officers with their enquiries.
