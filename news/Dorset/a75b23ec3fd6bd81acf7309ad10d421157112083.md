# Investigation launched following the death of two people in Weymouth and Portland

02 April 2021

* * *

Detectives have launched an investigation into the circumstances of the deaths of a woman in Weymouth and a man on Portland.

Dorset Police was called at 5.40pm on Thursday 1 April 2021 by the ambulance service to a report that a woman had been found injured at an address in Ranelagh Road in Weymouth.

Very sadly, the woman - aged in her 50s and from the local area - was pronounced dead at the scene. Her next of kin has been informed.

The woman's death is being treated as suspicious and an investigation is underway to establish the full circumstances surrounding her death.

As part of our enquiries, at around 6.40pm on the same day officers attended an address in Grove Road on Portland and located the body of a man aged in his 50s. The death is being treated as unexplained and an investigation is underway. His family has also been informed.

The man and woman were known to each other.

A cordon is in place at both addresses while officers carry out enquiries at the scene.

Detective Inspector Wayne Seymour, of the Major Crime Investigation Team, said: "A detailed investigation is underway looking into the circumstances of both deaths, which are currently being treated as linked.

"The families of both the woman and the man are being supported by specially-trained officers.

"I would urge anyone who witnessed or heard anything suspicious in the area of either Ranelagh Road or Grove Road during the afternoon of Thursday 1 April 2021 to please contact us."
