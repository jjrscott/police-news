# Witness appeal following reported fail-to-stop injury collision at Hurn

15 May 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses and anyone with dashcam footage to come forward following a reported fail-to-stop collision at Hurn near Christchurch.

At around 5.26pm on Friday 15 May 2020 a BMW car travelling along on Parley Lane reportedly failed to stop for police.

The officers lost sight of the vehicle and a short time later it was in collision with a red Volkswagen Fox on the roundabout at the junction of Avon Causeway.

The driver of the Volkswagen - a 22-year-old local woman - sustained a serious head injury and was taken to Poole Hospital for treatment. Her condition is described as potentially serious.

Two Bournemouth men aged 22 and 24 were arrested at the scene on suspicion of driving offences. A third man was reported to have left the scene. A search of the area was carried out, involving the NPAS helicopter and the police dog unit, and a 24-year-old man from Bournemouth was arrested nearby on suspicion of driving offences. All three are assisting officers with their enquiries.

The road was closed while emergency services dealt with the incident.

Police Sergeant Craig Tatton, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was travelling along Parley Lane at the relevant time and witnessed the collision to please come forward.

"I am also keen to hear from any motorists who witnessed the manner of driving of any of the vehicles involved, or captured the collision or vehicles on dashcam, to please contact Dorset Police.

"Finally, we are also looking to speak to a man who was seen in the area at the time who may have information relating to the collision. He is described as a white, approximately six feet tall, of heavy build and was wearing a blue top and cream shorts."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200068912.
