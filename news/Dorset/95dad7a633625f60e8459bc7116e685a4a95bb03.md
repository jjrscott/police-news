# Witness appeal following robbery at store in Bournemouth

18 October 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating a robbery at a shop in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At 9.05pm on Tuesday 17 October 2017 a man entered Costcutter in Palmerston Road, approached the counter holding a small kitchen knife and threatened the member of staff.

The suspect demanded cash before he left the store and cycled away toward Boscombe. He is described as white, of slim build and was wearing a black coat, jeans and rode a black mountain bike.

A quantity of cash was stolen. The member of staff, a local man, was not physically injured.

Officers attended the store and carried out a search of the area, assisted by the NPAS helicopter. No one was located and no arrests have been made.

Detective Constable Andy Hale, of Bournemouth CID, said: "From our initial enquiries we know that the suspect had made a number of attempts prior to the incident to top up his mobile phone at the store. On each occasion his card failed. I know there were a number of customers during this time and I would urge anyone who visited the store between 8.25pm and 9.05pm to please contact Dorset Police.

"Finally, I would ask anyone who saw a man matching the description given in the area at the relevant times to please come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170162650. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
