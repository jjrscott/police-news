# Dorset Police take part in national operation to target suspected organised crime gangs

02 July 2020

* * *

As part of the UK's biggest ever law enforcement operation a series of warrants took place in Dorset to target suspected organised crime gangs involved in the supply of controlled drugs.

Dorset Police worked alongside the South West Regional Organised Crime Unit (SW ROCU) and the National Crime Agency as part of Operation Venetic to act on intelligence uncovered through the takedown of EncroChat, a bespoke encrypted global communication service used exclusively by alleged criminals.

During the operation, a series of warrants were carried out at addresses across Bournemouth.

Seven men, aged between 25 and 42, a woman aged in her 20s and a woman aged in her 40s, all from the Bournemouth and Poole areas, were arrested on suspicion of drugs and firearms offences.

A man aged in his 20s and a man aged in his 40s, both from Bournemouth, were arrested on suspicion of a drugs offence and possession of an offensive weapon in a public place.

Also, a man aged in his 30s and a woman aged in her 20s, both from Dorset, were arrested in south London on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of controlled drugs. A search of their vehicle located approximately £80,000 in cash.

Following these arrests, a number of warrants took place in Bournemouth, Christchurch and London. A large quantity of suspected controlled drugs and further amounts of cash were located.

Three men aged between 30 and 55, all from London, and a local man aged in his 30s were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of controlled drugs.

All of the arrested people have been either released on police bail or under investigation pending further enquiries.

In total from all of the warrants, approximately £160,000 in cash, a large quantity of suspected class A drugs and a firearm were seized.

Detective Chief Inspector Andy Dilworth, Deputy Director of Intelligence for Dorset Police, said: "The extensive joint work undertaken by a number of agencies as part of Operation Venetic demonstrates our ongoing commitment to disrupt suspected drug dealing in our county.

"We are fully aware of the detrimental effects this alleged activity has on residents in our communities.

"I would like to send out a clear message to everyone that we do not tolerate any alleged drug-related activity in Dorset. We will work incredibly hard to deter any suspected organised crime groups from blighting and damaging our county."
