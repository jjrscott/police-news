# Family tribute following fatal road traffic collision near Sherborne

22 February 2019

* * *

The family of a man who died in a fatal road traffic collision near Sherborne has issued a tribute.

At 5.50pm on Saturday 26 January 2019 Dorset Police received a report of a collision involving a single vehicle that had left the carriageway at Tiley Knap, Middlemarsh. The passenger, 37-year-old Neil Adam Parsons from Sherborne, later sadly died from his injuries.

His family said in a statement: "In our hearts and memories Neil will always stay. Loved and treasured by all who knew him. A very special son, daddy, partner, brother, grandson, uncle, nephew and cousin. Friend to many."

The driver of the vehicle, a 43-year-old man from Somerset, was arrested on suspicion of driving offences and taken to Dorset County Hospital by ambulance as a precaution. He has been released under investigation as officers continue to make enquiries.
