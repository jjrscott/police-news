Officers are appealing for witnesses following a serious road traffic collision in Poole.

At approximately 9.05am on Tuesday 16 January 2018 a collision occurred on Tollerford Road between a silver Renault Clio, a silver Audi A8 and a green Ford Fiesta.

The driver of the Renault, a 79-year-old woman from Poole, sustained life-threatening injuries and was taken to Poole General Hospital for treatment.

A man aged in his 80s, who was the driver of the Audi, was taken to Poole General Hospital for treatment to minor injuries.

The Ford driver, a local woman aged in her 40s, was uninjured.

The road was closed to allow emergency services to deal with the incident. It reopened at 2.15pm on the same day.

Police Sergeant Mark Scammell, of the traffic unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision, or the manner of driving of either vehicle prior to the incident, to please get in touch.

"I would also like to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time and may have dashcam footage that would assist with my investigation.

"I wish to thank everyone for their patience while the road closures were in place, which were absolutely necessary to allow us to investigate this collision thoroughly."
