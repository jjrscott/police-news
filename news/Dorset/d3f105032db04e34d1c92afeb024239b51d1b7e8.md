* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses after a robbery in a car park in Bournemouth.

The incident happened at around 11pm on Monday 4 December 2017 in the Bath Road South car park.

The victim - a man aged in his 20s - was sitting in his car when he was approached by three men.

The men initially asked for directions, before they told the victim to hand over his phone and wallet.

One of the offenders then hit the victim over the head with an empty bottle before biting him. The victim was also punched three times.

A pouch of tobacco was stolen.

The victim sustained a cut to his head and bite mark on his shoulder and was taken to hospital for treatment.

The first offender is described as black, aged in his 20s and of athletic build. He was around six feet two inches tall and was wearing a black beanie hat, black tracksuit and had a couple of gold teeth.

The second offender was white, aged around 18 years old and of slim build. He was five feet eleven inches tall with short brown hair and was wearing a grey Nike tracksuit top.

The third suspect was around five feet eleven inches tall and was wearing goggles on his face, a scarf covering half of his face and a black hooded top.

Detective Constable Sara Watts, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the incident or saw anyone acting suspiciously in the area at the time to please come forward.

"Enquiries are ongoing and although the incident itself was not captured on CCTV, we are currently trawling town centre CCTV to see if any of the men described can be identified."
