# Witness appeal following public order incident in Poole

03 September 2018

* * *

Officers investigating a racially aggravated public order incident in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 3pm on Friday 31 August 2018 the victim, a woman aged in her 30s, was at the car park behind the Canford Cliffs Library watching the Red Arrows.

The car park was busy at the time and a minor collision occurred involving a blue Audi A1 and a silver Ford Focus, which officers attended and dealt with.

Following the collision one of the motorists approached the victim, who was not directly involved in the incident, and reportedly subjected her to racial verbal abuse.

Police Constable Debbie Day, of Poole police, said: "I understand there were a number of other people in the car park at the time of this incident and I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the racially aggravated incident or who has any information to contact police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180141049. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
