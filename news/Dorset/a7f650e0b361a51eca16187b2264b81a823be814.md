# Reported robberies at Bournemouth stores â€“ man charged

24 December 2020

* * *

A man has been arrested and charged in connection with three reported robberies at stores in Bournemouth.

At 5.21pm on Monday 21 December 2020 it is reported that a man entered Central Stores on Seamoor Road in the Westbourne area and demanded cash from the till.

It is alleged that he used a screwdriver to remove the till and attempted to leave the store on a Beryl bike. A member of staff intervened and it is reported the offender dropped the till drawer and left empty handed.

Following enquiries, a 51-year-old man from Bournemouth was arrested on suspicion of robbery.

He was also arrested in connection with a reported robbery at Smiggle in Old Christchurch Road at 3.20pm on Friday 18 December 2020 where a man is alleged to have entered the store, threatened staff with a syringe and snatched cash from the till.

He was further arrested in relation to a similar reported offence at McColls in Commercial Road on Tuesday 15 December 2020 where a man is alleged to have entered the store and made threats to harm a staff member unless they handed over money from the till. The man reportedly made off with a number of bank notes.

The man has been charged with all three robberies and is due to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Thursday 24 December 2020.
