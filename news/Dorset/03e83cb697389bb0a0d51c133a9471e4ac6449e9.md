# Witness appeal following fail-to-stop collision in Poole

11 December 2017

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a fail-to-stop collision in Poole.

Sometime between 3pm and 4pm on Friday 1 December 2017 a road traffic collision occurred on Constitution Hill Road just off the Seaview roundabout involving a pedestrian and a car.

The pedestrian, a local 23-year-old man, was using the crossing when he was struck and knocked to the ground by a silver-coloured car.

The victim sustained bruising but did not requires hospital treatment.

The driver of the car initially stopped at the scene but the victim has told officers he was in a state of shock and was unable to communicate effectively with the driver so she failed to give her details.

The driver is described as black, with black hair and is aged between 30 and 40 years old.

Police Constable John Upsher, of Poole police, said: "I am keen to identify this vehicle and would ask the driver to please come forward.

"I understand that there were a number of people sat at a nearby bus stop who may have witnessed the incident and I would ask for them to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55170188459. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
