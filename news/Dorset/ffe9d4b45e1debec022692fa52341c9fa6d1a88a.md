# Witness appeal following assault and road rage incident in Blandford

09 February 2021

* * *

Officers investigating an assault and road rage incident in Blandford are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Between 3.25pm and 3.35pm on Wednesday 3 February 2021 the victim - a woman aged in her 30s - was turning out of the car park at Tesco on Bournemouth Road when a male driver of another car coming down the road slammed on his brakes and beeped his horn.

It is reported that the woman carried on driving and the driver of the other car followed behind flashing his headlights and gesticulating for the woman to pull over.

The victim stopped in Vale Park off Bournemouth Road and both the woman and the male driver got out of their cars. It is reported that the man pushed the victim into her car and pushed her face. She sustained a cut to her lip that did not require hospital treatment.

Police Constable Nick May, of North Dorset police, said: "An investigation is underway into this incident and I have been carrying out a number of enquiries so far, including CCTV checks in the area.

"I am appealing to anyone who saw either the incident outside Tesco or in Vale Park involving a silver Ford Focus and a silver Vauxhall Astra to please get in touch.

"I would ask motorists who were travelling in the area at the time of the incident and have dashcam fitted to their vehicles to check their footage for anything relevant to assist my enquiries."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210020735. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
