Local officers are appealing for information following a spate of break-ins to vans in Crossways.

A total of five incidents were reported in the area on Saturday 28 November, Sunday 29 November and Monday 30 November 2020.

The incidents occurred during the hours of darkness and items stolen from vans include power tools and gardening tools.

Police Community Support Officer Alison Donnison, from the local neighbourhood policing team, said: "We are investigating this series of offences and I am appealing to anyone who has witnessed any suspicious activity in the area overnight recently to please contact us.

"I would also urge anyone who has come across tools being offered for sale in unusual circumstances locally to get in touch.

"Officers will be increasing patrols in the area and I would like to take this opportunity to encourage residents to remain vigilant, make sure they leave their vehicles secure and not to leave any tools or valuable items in them overnight."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200180016. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
