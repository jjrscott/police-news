# Dorset Police support National Knife Amnesty

09 February 2018

* * *

If youâ€™re arming yourself with a knife, scissors, screwdriver or any other bladed item in Dorset this week, drop them safely in one of our amnesty bins and face no risk of prosecution.

Dorset Police is supporting Op Sceptre, a campaign led by the Home Office to reduce knife crime.

Although Dorset is one of the safest places in the UK to live, visit and work, the Force is still keen to support any initiative which encourages this trend to continue.

Knife amnesty bins are available in Bournemouth, Poole and Weymouth police station enquiry offices from today, Monday 12 February, until Sunday 18 February and can be utilised for depositing any bladed instrument safely and anonymously.

Members of the public are asked to ensure any knives being brought to the surrender bins are carried discretely, secured safely in a bag and are covered with protection such as bubble wrap and cardboard to prevent injury.

Further information on what knives are legal or illegal and under what circumstances can be found here: www.gov.uk/buying-carrying-knives
