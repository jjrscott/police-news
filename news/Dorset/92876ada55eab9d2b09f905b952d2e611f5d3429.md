# Appeal for information following fail-to-stop collision in Poole

15 June 2020

* * *

Officers investigating a fail-to-stop road traffic collision in Poole are appealing for witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to come forward.

At around 5pm on Thursday 11 June 2020 a collision occurred on the A35 near to the Civic Centre involving a cyclist and a white Ford Transit van. It was reported that the van failed to stop at the scene.

The cyclist, a Poole man aged in his 40s, suffered minor injuries and did not require hospital treatment.

Police Constable Stuart Wilson, of Dorset Police, said: "We are continuing to make enquiries into this incident and I am keen to speak to any witnesses who may have information to assist our investigation.

"I would also urge anyone who was travelling in the area at the time and has dashcam fitted to their vehicle to check their footage for anything relevant."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200083690. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
