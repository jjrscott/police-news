# Arrest made following fatal collision near Bere Regis

16 July 2018

* * *

A man has been arrested in connection with a fatal collision near Bere Regis.

At 4.40pm on Saturday 14 July 2018 Dorset Police was called to reports of a three vehicle collision on the westbound lane of the A35 Dorchester bypass near Bere Regis, just before the single carriageway becomes a dual carriageway.

The collision involved a white BMW, a white Land Rover Freelander and a silver Mercedes.

Very sadly the driver of the Freelander - a Weymouth man aged 49 - sustained serious injuries and died at the scene. His family has been informed and the coroner notified.

A 59-year-old woman who was travelling in the front passenger seat of the Freelander sustained serious injuries and was flown by air ambulance to Southampton General Hospital for treatment.

The driver of the BMW - a 27-year-old man from Bournemouth - sustained serious injuries and was taken to Southampton General Hospital for treatment. A 39-year-old Bournemouth man who was travelling in the BMW sustained a life-threatening head injury and was flown by air ambulance to Southmead Hospital in Bristol. A second passenger - a 26-year-old man - sustained serious injuries and was taken to Poole Hospital for treatment.

No one from the silver Mercedes was injured.

Due to the number of people injured in the collision, the A35 was closed in both directions between Bere Regis and the Stinsford roundabout to allow the emergency services to land helicopters at the scene and tend to the casualties.

The road was reopened in the early hours of Sunday 15 July 2018.

A 38-year-old man has been arrested for causing death by dangerous driving and causing serious injury by dangerous driving and has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Police Sergeant Fern Graham, of the traffic unit, said: "I would like to thank those witnesses who have already contacted Dorset Police following our appeal.

"I would ask any other witnesses or anyone who was in the area and may have dashcam that could be relevant to our investigation to please get in touch."
