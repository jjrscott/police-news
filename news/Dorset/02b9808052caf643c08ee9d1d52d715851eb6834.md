# Public appeal in relation to fraudulent charity collector in Dorchester

31 December 2020

* * *

Officers are appealing for anyone with information to come forward after a man was fraudulently collecting money for charity in Dorchester.

At around 12pm on Tuesday 22 December 2020 a man was standing on South Street collecting money in a bucket claiming to be on behalf of the 'Food For Life' charity.

The man had photo ID for the company with a charity reference number attached, however following enquiries it has been established that this group was removed from the charity register in 2003 and no longer operates.

He is described as aged in his early 20s, approximately six feet two inches tall and of slim build with dark hair. He was wearing a red coat and jeans and was carrying a yellow bucket.

Police Community Support Officer Mark Wodarek-Black, of Dorchester Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "If anyone has been approached by the man described in similar circumstances, please get in touch.

"I would also like to take the opportunity to warn members of the public not to donate money to this man and to report any suspicious activity to Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200192422. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
