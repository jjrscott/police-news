Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an alleged fail-to-stop collision in the Boscombe area of the town - with one man arrested.

At around 3.55pm on Thursday 12 January 2017 police were called to Ashley Road opposite the bus depot at the Sovereign Centre following a report that a woman had been struck by a vehicle which had failed to stop at the scene.

The victim, a 20-year-old woman from Bournemouth, reportedly stepped out to cross the road when a silver Skoda Octavia started to move hitting the woman and throwing her onto the bonnet and then into the road.

The vehicle carried on toward Holdenhurst Road and failed-to-stop at the scene.

The victim sustained a broken ankle and severe bruising to her legs and ribs as a result of the incident.

Police Constable Mel Rooney, of Boscombe police, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident to please contact me urgently.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who witnessed the manner of driving of the Skoda before and after the incident."

A 33-year-old Poole man has been arrested and reported for driving offences.
