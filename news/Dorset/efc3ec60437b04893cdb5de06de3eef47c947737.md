# Investigation underway following death of woman at Bestival

11 September 2017

* * *

An investigation is underway following the death of a woman at Bestival.

Officers at the event were alerted just before 1am today, Monday 11 September 2017, to reports of a concern for welfare of a 25-year-old woman from London who had attended the festival at Lulworth Castle.

Very sadly, following a search of the area the body of the woman was located in a wooded area on the edge of the festival site.

Her family have been informed and the coroner has been notified.

An investigation is underway to establish the circumstances surrounding her death and a cordon is in place on site while forensic examinations are being carried out.

A 28-year-old man from London has been arrested on suspicion of murder, to enable officers to conduct an interview under caution to help establish the full circumstances.

Detective Chief Inspector Sarah Derbyshire, of Dorset Police, said: "Following the discovery of the woman's body we have now launched an investigation into her death. We have specially-trained officers supporting her family at this very difficult time.

"Enquiries are now underway to establish how she died. A post-mortem examination will be carried out in due course and this should give us more of an indication as to the cause of her death.

"We are working closely with the festival organisers and I would appeal to anyone with any information about the incident to contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 11:36. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
