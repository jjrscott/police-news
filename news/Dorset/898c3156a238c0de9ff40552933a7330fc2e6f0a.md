# Witness appeal following religiously aggravated assault in Bournemouth

13 August 2016

* * *

Police have issued an appeal for witnesses following a religiously aggravated assault on a woman in the Charminster area of Bournemouth.

At around 2.20am today, Saturday 13 August 2016, a Turkish woman aged in her 20s was walking in Charminster Road close to Cemetery Junction when she was approached by a man who was walking towards Bournemouth town centre.

The offender made a religious comment to the woman before punching her on the side of her face. She sustained bruising to her head but did not require medical treatment.

A passer-by came to the victim's aid and took her to a nearby bar to alert the police.

The offender is described as aged in his 40s, of stocky build and was wearing a grey tracksuit and a grey hooded top with the hood up. He spoke with a Scottish accent.

Deputy Neighbourhood Inspector Jonathan Wasey said: "This was a vicious and unprovoked attack on a young woman as she walked alone.

"I am urging anyone who witnessed the incident or saw a man matching the description given in the area at the relevant time to please contact Dorset Police immediately.

"Racially motivated incidents such as this have no place in our community and they will simply not be tolerated. A full investigation is underway to find the offender.

"Officers from the Neighbourhood Policing Team will be carrying out high-visibility patrols in the area to reassure the community and can be contacted with any concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 13:55. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
