# Dog bite incident in Weymouth â€“ public appeal

23 December 2020

* * *

Officers investigating an incident in which a woman was bitten by a dog are appealing for the public's help to identify the owner.

At around 3.30pm on Wednesday 2 December 2020 the victim - a woman aged in her 30s - was walking a friend's Border Collie dog on Weymouth beach near to Avenue Road when it began playing with a Golden Retriever dog.

The two dogs would not leave each other and the owners of the Golden Retriever appeared to get annoyed. As the victim put the dog she was walking on the lead, the Golden Retriever snarled and went for the Collie. During the incident the dog bit the victim, causing a puncture wound to her hand and leaving a hole in her coat.

The Golden Retriever owners, who were wearing dark clothes with the hood up and beanie hats, did not say anything and walked off with their dog.

Police Constable Jennie Sykes-Martin, of Dorset Police, said: "I have carried out CCTV checks in the area to see if I can identify the dog's owners, but these have not been successful. I would ask the owners, or anyone who knows who they are, to please contact Dorset Police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200181467.
