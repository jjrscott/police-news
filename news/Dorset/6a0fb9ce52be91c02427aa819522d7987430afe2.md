Police investigating a reported attempted sexual assault on a woman in Gillingham are appealing for witnesses to come forward - with one man charged.

At around 8.40pm on Sunday 16 October 2016 it was said that a local woman aged in her 20s was walking along Rolls Bridge Way when a man attempted to sexually assault her.

Detective Constable Adam Pilton, of Weymouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the area of Rolls Bridge Way at the relevant time on Sunday evening and witnessed an incident between a man and woman to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly keen to hear from a member of the public who was driving in the area, stopped his car and drove the woman to a place of safety."

A 31-year-old man of Gillingham has been charged with attempted sexual assault and appeared before Bournemouth Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 18 October 2016. He is next due to appear before Bournemouth Crown Court on Thursday 17 November 2016.
