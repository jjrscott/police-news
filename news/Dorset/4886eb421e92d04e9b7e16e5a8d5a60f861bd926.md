# Witness appeal following street robbery in Bournemouth

17 July 2017

* * *

Detectives investigating a street robbery in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At approximately 8.30pm on Sunday 16 July 2017 a group of four boys and two girls - all aged around 16 years old - were playing football in Kings Park when they were approached by two men.

The men threatened the group claiming they had acid and a knife and demanded cash. They stole money and a vape smoking device. One attempted to steal a bicycle belonging to the group.

The offenders ran off when one of the group approached nearby members of public for help.

No one was physically injured and no weapon was seen.

The first man is described as white, aged in his mid-20s, approximately five feet eight inches tall with a Liverpudlian accent, of slim build, with shaven brown hair and brown eyes. He was wearing a full navy Adidas tracksuit with dark trainers.

The second man is described as white, aged in his mid-20s, around six feet tall, of medium build with a rounded stomach, short blond hair and green eyes. He did not have a top on but wore grey tracksuit bottoms and carried a blue hooded top draped over his shoulders.

Detective Constable Sara Watts, of Bournemouth CID, said: "Investigations are underway to identify these two men including house-to-house and CCTV enquiries.

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or saw the two offenders in the Kings Park area to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am particularly keen to identify and speak to the members of the public who helped the victims during the incident and may be able to assist my investigation."

Officers from the neighbourhood policing team will be carrying out high-visibility patrols in the coming days to reassure the public and address community concerns.
