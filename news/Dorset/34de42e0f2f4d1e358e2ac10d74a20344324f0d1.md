# Cyber security event is coming to Poole

06 June 2017

* * *

Dorset Police, in partnership with Get Safe Online, is hosting a cyber security event at the Dolphin Centre, Poole, giving advice and information to help keep you and your data safe online.

Cyber security is something that everyone should actively instate in order to ensure their data is safe online. Recent events have highlighted the importance of having good and secure cyber protection in place.

An event, hosted in the Poole Dolphin Centre on Friday 9 and Saturday 10 June 2017, will be running from 10am until 4pm.

Online safety advice about shopping, finance, social media, running your business, keeping your loved ones safe online and protecting your devices will all be available at the event.

Please bring your devices down and discuss online safety and security with experts from Get Safe Online and other partners including banking experts, Action Fraud and Dorset Police cyber-crime unit.

Cyber-crime prevention officer Jake Moore said: "If recent events have taught us anything it's that cyber security is so important.

"This event has been designed to answer any of your cyber security questions, show you software designed to protect your data, and offer simple tips to help keep you safe online.

"Please come down and see us in the Dolphin Centre and get some free advice and information about all things cyber. There may even be some freebies to get your hands on!

"This event isn't designed to tell you what to do, just give you the information you need to help you make wise choices online."

Dorset Police and Crime Commissioner, Martyn Underhill, said: "Jake's role was introduced as part of my pledge to continue to educate communities in Dorset about the dangers of cyber-crime and the steps they can take to protect themselves.

"I'm pleased to say Jake has been doing a fantastic job, spreading the message of cyber-awareness to businesses and communities across the county. This will be another great opportunity to make the most of Jake's expertise, alongside a host of knowledgeable partners."
