Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a car failed to stop when requested near Dorchester.

At 8.51pm on Wednesday 29 January 2020 it was reported that a silver Mitsubishi pick-up failed to stop for officers when requested after it had been seen speeding on the A35 Puddletown bypass.

The vehicle was subsequently reported to be seen travelling along the A31 and into Wimborne.

Following a search, with support from the NPAS helicopter, the vehicle was located in New Borough, however the driver had left the vehicle.

Further searches were carried out in an attempt to locate the driver but they have not yet been identified and enquiries are ongoing.

Police Constable Neil Wallis, of the No Excuse team, said: "It has been established that the vehicle involved was reported as stolen from an address in Bridport.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have seen the vehicle being driven on the night of the incident, or has any knowledge about the driver, to please come forward."
