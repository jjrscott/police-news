# Alleged altercations in North Dorset and Wiltshire - witness appeal

07 June 2016

* * *

Detectives investigating alleged altercations in North Dorset and Wiltshire are appealing for witnesses to come forward - with one man being arrested.

Three incidents are reported to have happened at three separate locations on Saturday 4 June 2016.

The first was reported outside or near to The Old Bell Inn, Warminster in Wiltshire at around 1am. It is alleged a man driving a silver Land Rover had an altercation with a woman before they drove off together.

Later it was reported an altercation between the pair occurred sometime between 1am and 1.30am in a layby or verge along the A350 southbound just past the village of Longbridge Deverill in Wiltshire.

A third incident is alleged to have occurred near to the junction of High Street and Bimport in Shaftesbury travelling from the direction of the Kings Arms and Ship pubs. It is reported the woman exited the vehicle while it was being driven and the Land Rover drove away.

The victim suffered injuries to her arm as a result of exiting the vehicle. The pair are known to each other.

Detective Constable Andy Lovering, of Weymouth CID, said: "I would like to speak to anyone who may have witnessed any of the incidents described, or who has information that could assist me with my investigation."

A 41-year-old man from Shaftesbury was arrested on suspicion of assault and is currently on police bail until the middle of July 2016, pending further enquiries.

Witnesses and anyone with information should call Dorset Police in confidence on 101 quoting occurrence number 55160084290. Alternatively, call the free and anonymous Crimestoppers line on 0800 555 111 where mobile phone tariffs may apply.
