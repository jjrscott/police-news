# Dorset Police Chief Constable has been awarded the Queen’s Police Medal

04 January 2019

* * *

Chief Constable James Vaughan has been awarded the Queens Police Medal (QPM) for his 27 years of service to British policing. The QPM is awarded to those in the Force who have shown gallantry or distinguished service.

During his time in the police he has helped transform the service both locally, regionally and nationally. He has addressed numerous high profile issues as well as leading many projects to success, such as the South West Forensic Collaboration project.

Chief Constable Vaughan qualified as Detective and progressed through the ranks in Wiltshire to Chief Superintendent. He led on a number of serious and organised crime cases and here he developed his abilities to influence policing further than his own force area.

In Dorset he was promoted to Assistant Chief Constable and a year later onto Deputy Chief Constable. His dedication to public service continues to go beyond force boundaries, such as being the national lead for the police for forensics.

After receiving the award, Chief Constable James Vaughan, said: “I am delighted to be honoured in this way for a job I love doing. However this is about more than myself, it is recognition for all the men and woman in Dorset Police who give so much.” He finished by saying “I extremely pleased that my fellow Chief Constable Shaun Sawyer in Devon and Cornwall Police has also been recognised.”
