# Ongoing investigation into exposure incidents in Dorchester and Purbeck â€“ CCTV appeal

07 December 2020

* * *

Detectives are issuing CCTV footage of a man they would like to identify as they continue to investigate a series of indecent exposure offences in the Dorchester and Purbeck areas.

At least 40 incidents have been reported since 2002 and officers believe the same offender is responsible.

They occur at night and typically involve a man standing outside of the victim's address exposing himself or committing an act of gross indecency. The majority of the victims are woman aged in their 40s, 50s and 60s.

The offences have occurred sporadically and none were reported for the first eight months of this year. However, in recent weeks incidents have been reported in Dorchester and Swanage, with the latest incident on Saturday 14 November 2020.

Detectives from Weymouth CID have been carrying out a range of enquiries since 2002 into this series and made several public appeals to try and identify the offender.

They are now issuing CCTV footage of a man they are keen to identify as part of their ongoing investigation.

Detective Sergeant Andy Marsh, of Weymouth CID, said: "We recognise the distress these incidents have caused to the victims involved. This has been a long-running investigation and we have continued to explore a number of lines of enquiry to try and identify the man responsible.

"We are now releasing CCTV footage connected to an incident in Charminster in December 2019 of a man we are keen to identify as part of our enquiries. I appreciate it is not the best quality footage, but we owe it to the victims to do all we can to try and establish who is responsible for these offences.

"I would urge anyone with information as to this man's identity, or anything that might assist our enquiries, to please contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190164124. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
