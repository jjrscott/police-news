24 December 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward after a woman was found with injuries in Christchurch.

At 2.15pm today, Monday 24 December 2018, Dorset Police was called by the ambulance service to the car park at the Royal British Legion on Bargates after a woman aged in her 70s was found unresponsive.

She has been taken to hospital for treatment. Her family has been informed.

The area has been cordoned off while crime scene investigators carry out their examinations.

Detective Inspector Neil Wright, of Bournemouth CID, said: "At this time we do not know how this woman sustained her injuries and an investigation is underway to ascertain what happened and whether anyone else was involved.

"I am appealing to anyone who was at the Legion today or in the area who may have seen this elderly woman or heard something out of the ordinary to please contact Dorset Police urgently."

Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team can be contacted with any concerns.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 24:234. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
