# Witness appeal following rape in Bournemouth

04 January 2018

* * *

Detectives investigating a rape in Bournemouth on New Year's Eve are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The victim, a Bournemouth woman aged in her 30s, met a man in Southcote Road at around 11.30pm on Sunday 31 December 2017.

They walked together to a bowling green nearby, where sexual activity took place that was initially consensual. However, it is reported the man then became physically violent toward her and further sexual activity took place that the victim did not consent to.

The offender is described as white, aged around 21, six feet three inches tall and of slim build. He was wearing a red and black chequered jacket and black jeans as well as a baseball cap, which he removed when he entered the bowling green area.

The woman was able to get away and is reported to have spoken to a number of members of the public before finding a taxi to take her home.

The incident was reported to police in the early hours of today, Thursday 4 January 2018.

Detective Constable Jo Blackmore, of Dorset Police, said: "We are making a number of enquiries into this incident and the victim is being supported by specially-trained officers.

"I am appealing for any witnesses or anyone who spoke to the victim following the incident to please contact police immediately."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 4:3. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
