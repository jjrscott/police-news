# Renewed photo appeal for missing Swanage man

07 March 2018

* * *

Officers continuing to search for missing Swanage man Gerald Turner are releasing a new photo of him.

The 67-year-old was reported missing at 11.30am on Sunday 4 March 2018, having last been seen at his home address in Church Hill at around 3am.

Searches have been taking place in the Swanage area and police search teams have been supported by HM Coastguard, DorSAR (Dorset Search and Rescue), Dorset & Wiltshire Fire and Rescue and Wessex 4x4.

Following enquiries by local officers, CCTV footage showing a man walking across High Street in Swanage toward Priests Road at around 6.30am was released to the media and public on Monday 5 March 2018. It is believed the man in the footage is Gerald.

Officers are today, Wednesday 7 March 2018, releasing a new photo of Gerald in the hope it might jog someone's memory.

They also continue to appeal to members of the public to check any CCTV or dashcam footage they may have for possible sightings of Gerald on Sunday morning. Residents are also being urged to check their gardens and outbuildings in case he has taken shelter there.

Gerald is described as around five feet seven inches tall and of slim build with short, thick, dark hair and a greying goatie beard and moustache. It is believed he was wearing a black waterproof jacket, blue cotton tracksuit type trousers and green wellies.

Chief Inspector Bryan Duffy, of Dorset Police, said: "We have been continuing to liaise and update Gerald's family this week. Following further enquiries we have obtained a new photo of him, which is more recent. I would urge anyone who believes they may have seen Gerald to please contact police.

"Officers are continuing to carry out extensive searches around the Swanage area and we are grateful to all our partner agencies and volunteer organisations that have been supporting us.

"Our thoughts continue to be with Gerald's family at what must be a very difficult time for them.

"I would urge anyone who has any information as to where Gerald could be to contact police immediately.

"I am also appealing directly to Gerald if you see this message to contact us or your family as we all want to ensure that you are safe and well."

Anyone with information or knowledge as to Gerald's whereabouts is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180033032.
