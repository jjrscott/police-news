# Witness appeal following serious injury fail-to-stop collision in Sturminster Newton

06 July 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a serious injury fail-to-stop collision in Sturminster Newton.

At around 7.20pm yesterday, Thursday 5 July 2018, Dorset Police was called to reports of a collision on Manston Road, at the junction with Green Close, involving a green Mini and a silver Chevrolet Kalos.

The driver of the Mini - a local 19-year-old man - sustained a very serious head injury and was taken to Dorset County Hospital. His condition is described as life-threatening. His family have been informed and are being supported by specially-trained officers.

The driver of the Kalos failed to stop at the scene and the vehicle was located unattended nearby.

Police Constable Andrew Fields, of the traffic unit, said: "We are carrying out a number of enquiries in a bid to identify and locate the driver of the Kalos and I would urge anyone with information to please get in touch.

"I am aware that there may have been a number of people in the area and I would ask them, or anyone else with information, to please contact Dorset Police.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who was travelling along the road at the time and may have captured the incident on a dashcam.

"Finally, I would like to thank motorists for their patience during the road closures, which were necessary to ensure we could fully investigate the circumstances of this collision."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email at SCIT@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 5:467. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
