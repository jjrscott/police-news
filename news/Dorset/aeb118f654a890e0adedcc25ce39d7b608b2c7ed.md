# Witness appeal following attempted theft and assault in Weymouth

02 April 2018

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an attempted theft and assault incident in Weymouth.

At approximately 6.40pm on Friday 30 March 2018 a man was sitting in Costa Coffee on St Mary Street when he noticed three men attempt to steal his bicycle from outside the shop.

The man, aged in his 70s and from Weymouth, followed the men and approached them outside the Black Dog pub further down the road.

One of the offenders punched the man causing him to fall to the floor. The victim sustained a serious head injury and was taken to hospital for treatment. His condition is described as stable.

The first offender is described as white, aged in his 30s with a bald head. He was wearing a dark-coloured jacket, dark trousers and a shirt. The second man is described as white, also aged in his 30s with dark brown short hair. He was wearing a black anorak with a hood, a white top, dark jeans and dark-coloured shoes. The third man was wearing a grey jacket with the hood up.

Detective Sergeant Mark Portelli, of Weymouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the assault, and has not yet spoken to police, to please come forward.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who recognises the men from the description given, or has any information about who they might be.

"We are currently investigating a number of lines of enquiry including CCTV checks in the area."
