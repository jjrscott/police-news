# Witness appeal following assault in Bournemouth

31 July 2016

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following an assault in Bournemouth town centre.

The incident happened at around 2.30am on Sunday 31 July 2016 when a 23-year-old Wimborne man entered the Lower Gardens with his friends. He was then attacked by a group of young adults.

During the assault the victim sustained a cut to his head. He was taken to Royal Bournemouth Hospital for treatment.

Detective Constable Lee Emery, of Bournemouth CID, said: "We do not believe that this was a targeted attack.

"I am appealing for witnesses and anyone with information about those responsible to come forward.

"I believe that a man with a dog was part of the group which attacked the victim and therefore I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who saw a man with a dog in the area at the time.

"Local Neighbourhood Policing Teams are stepping up their patrols in the area for reassurance."

No arrests have been made.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 31:57.
