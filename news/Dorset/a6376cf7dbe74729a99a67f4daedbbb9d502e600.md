15 December 2017

* * *

A man is due to appear in court in connection with a reported collision near Weymouth.

At 1.36pm on Saturday 24 June 2017 it was reported that a road traffic collision occurred on the B3157 between Abbotsbury and Swyre involving a white Mercedes Sprinter van, a white Ford Connect Transit van and a Royal Enfield motorcycle.

The rider of the motorcycle - a 55-year-old man from Sherborne - sustained serious leg injuries and was taken to Dorset County Hospital for treatment.

A 30-year-old man from Boston in Lincolnshire has been issued with a postal requisition to appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 19 December 2017 for driving without due care and attention.
