# Arrest made following reported theft and fraudulent card use in Bournemouth

23 October 2020

* * *

Officers investigating the alleged theft and subsequent fraudulent use of a bank card in Bournemouth have arrested a woman.

At around 10am on Friday 29 May 2020 the victim - a local man aged in his 60s - was sitting on a wall on Commercial Road. He went into a shop and realised that he had left his phone and bank cards outside.

When he realised his phone was missing, his friend phoned it and it rang nearby. The phone was recovered, but it was discovered that his bank cards that were stored inside the phone case were allegedly stolen.

It is reported that one of the bank cards was used to make two fraudulent transactions at shops in The Triangle on the same day.

Following enquiries and a CCTV appeal, a 38-year-old woman from Bournemouth was arrested on suspicion of theft and fraud by false representation. She has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.
