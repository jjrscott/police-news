# Appeal following attempted robbery in Blandford

28 November 2020

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward following an attempted robbery in Blandford.

At around 7pm on Thursday 26 November 2020 the victim - a local woman aged in her 40s - was approached by an unknown man as she walked in an alleyway between Salisbury Road and Barnes Close. The suspect demanded money from the victim, before hitting her in the face causing several minor cuts. No money was stolen and he ran away into Barnes Close.

The suspect is described as white, aged in his early 20s, around five feet six inches tall, with stubble on his face. He was wearing a black hooded top.

Detective Constable Sean Garrett, of Weymouth CID, said: "We have already carried out a number of enquiries in relation to this incident, including CCTV and house-to-house visits.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the relevant time and either saw or heard anything suspicious to please contact me.

"I would also like residents and local motorists to check footage from their home CCTV systems and dashcams and to call Dorset Police if they find anything that may be relevant to my investigation."

North Dorset Inspector Simon Perry said: "Local officers from the neighbourhood policing team will be continuing with their regular patrols and can be approached with any community concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200178420. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
