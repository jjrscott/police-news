# Request for public help after report of paraglider out of control

07 May 2017

* * *

Officers are searching in Gillingham after a report of a paraglider being out of control and coming down and are asking anyone with information to come forward.

At 9.48pm on Sunday 7 May 2017 Dorset Police received a call from a concerned member of the public.

Around 30 minutes earlier he had seen what he believed to be a paraglider in trouble. It appeared that the engine had cut out and it was losing control. The glider was spinning round and fell from about 200 feet to 50 feet before going out of sight. The location has been described as Chantry Fields behind Sainsbury's and Asda.

Chief Inspector Ernie Henley, of Dorset Police, said: "The member of the public, who reported the incident, and our officers have searched the relevant area but have so far been unable to find the paraglider.

"We are hoping that the person in the paraglider is fine and was able to control the machine but we want to make sure that this is the case.

"I am appealing for anyone with further information about the incident to come forward.

"If the paraglider involved sees this appeal, please get in touch so we know you are safe and well."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 7:404. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
