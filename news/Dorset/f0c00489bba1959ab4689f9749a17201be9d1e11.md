A teenage boy has been arrested in connection with a reported burglary at a store in Christchurch.

It was reported that two people entered the Co-Op store on Fairmile Road at around 9.50pm on Saturday 9 January 2021 and stole cigarettes and alcohol from behind the counter while staff were away from the till.

Following enquiries, a 15-year-old Bournemouth boy has been arrested on suspicion of burglary and has been released on police bail.

Officers have previously issued a CCTV image of a man they would like to speak to as part of their investigation and are still making efforts to identify this individual.
