A motorist who was involved in a fatal collision, which lead to the death of a pedestrian and seriously injured another as they crossed the road, has been found not guilty.

On conclusion of the three-day trial the 25-year-old man from Bransgore was found not guilty of causing death by dangerous driving and causing serious injury by dangerous driving. The prosecution offered no evidence for a charge of driving without insurance. The jury deliberated for just over five hours before reaching the majority verdict.

The collision happened at around 7.30pm on Sunday 13 December 2015 in Castle Lane East at a traffic light controlled junction close to the Royal Bournemouth Hospital and Chaseside. Peter Worrall, 49, sustained fatal injuries and sadly died at the scene. A female pedestrian sustained serious injuries.
