# Witness appeal following reported aggravated burglary in Ferndown

29 May 2020

* * *

Detectives investigating an alleged aggravated burglary in Ferndown are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

It is reported that at around 9.55pm on Thursday 28 May 2020 three men entered an address on Ford Lane and took a quantity of cash before driving away in a white BMW.

During the incident it is alleged that a male occupant was stabbed and he sustained injuries to his head and eye. He was taken to hospital for treatment.

A woman also sustained injuries to her arm that did not require hospital treatment.

Following a search of the area armed officers, assisted by the NPAS helicopter, stopped a vehicle on the A31 eastbound at St Leonards. The road was closed to allow officers to carry out their enquiries and reopened just after midnight on Friday 29 May 2020.

A 20-year-old man and two teenage boys, aged 15 and 17, have been arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary and are currently assisting detectives with their enquiries.

Detective Inspector Gavin House, of Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the reported aggravated burglary or saw any suspicious activity in Ford Lane to please get in touch.

"I would urge local residents or any motorists who were in the Ford Lane area at the relevant time to check their home CCTV systems or dashcam for any footage that may assist my investigation."
