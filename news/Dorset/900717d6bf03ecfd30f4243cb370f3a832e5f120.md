Three men are due to appear in court following an alleged assault in Poole.

An investigation was launched following an incident outside Munchies in the High Street at 2.19am on Saturday 26 August 2017.

A 22-year-old Poole man had suffered a serious head injury and was taken to hospital for treatment.

Following a CCTV appeal issued by police, three men were identified and voluntarily attended for interviews.

Two men aged 20 and a 27-year-old man, all from Bovington, have been issued with postal requisitions and are due to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 19 January 2018 charged with inflicting grievous bodily harm.
