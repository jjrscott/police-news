01 October 2018

Detectives who are investigating reported assaults in Weymouth have now spoken to a man who has come forward as a witness following a CCTV appeal.

At around 4.15am on Saturday 8 September 2018 a man was reportedly assaulted on The Esplanade. The victim, aged in his 20s and from Bridgwater in Somerset, sustained a suspected broken jaw.

A short time later, at about 5.05am, officers were called by the ambulance service to reports of an assault in Maiden Street in which a local man aged in his 20s sustained serious head injuries. He was taken to hospital for treatment to a fractured eye socket and partial loss of sight in one eye.

A 40-year-old local man was arrested nearby on suspicion of two counts of inflicting grievous bodily harm and has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Following a CCTV appeal issued by officers, a man has come forward to assist the investigation as a witness.
