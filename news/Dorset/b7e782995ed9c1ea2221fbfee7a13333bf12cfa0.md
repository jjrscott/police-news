# Update in relation to reported assaults in Bournemouth

03 February 2020

* * *

A man has come forward following the latest appeal in relation to a number of alleged assaults in Bournemouth.

A CCTV appeal was issued to identify a man officers wanted to speak to in connection with the incidents that occurred during the early hours of Saturday 31 August 2019.

At 2.42am it was reported that an assault occurred on Old Christchurch Road near to Chkn Station and a man was hit over the head with a bottle. He sustained an injury to his ear that required hospital treatment.

Around 15 minutes later, a report of an assault was received outside TK Maxx on Old Christchurch Road. It is alleged that a man was pushed to the ground. A second man - aged in his 30s - intervened and was reportedly kicked and punched, causing injuries to his nose and lip.

A further assault was reported to have occurred in The Square, where a man was punched and kicked.

Two men, both aged 21 and from Bournemouth, were arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm, assault and affray. They were released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Following a previous CCTV appeal, a 19-year-old man came forward and is assisting officers with their enquiries.

A second CCTV appeal was issued on Thursday 30 January 2020 and following that appeal a second 19-year-old man has also come forward and he too is assisting officers with their enquiries.
