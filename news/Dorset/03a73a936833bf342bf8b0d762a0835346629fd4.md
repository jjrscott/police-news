# Witness appeal following theft of vehicle and collision in Poole

02 July 2018

* * *

Officers investigating a collision involving a reported stolen vehicle in Poole are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At 7.05am today, Monday 2 July 2018, it was reported that a Chevrolet was stolen from outside an address in Christopher Crescent. It is believed the keys had been taken from inside the address, which had been left insecure overnight.

Subsequent enquiries revealed that the stolen vehicle had been involved in an earlier road traffic collision, which was reported to Dorset Police at 4.59am today.

The stolen vehicle had left the road and gone into a wall on Wimborne Road at the junction with Heckford Road. It caught fire immediately following the incident and Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service attended to extinguish the blaze. The vehicle was destroyed by the fire.

It is reported that two occupants were seen to get out of the vehicle and run away. Enquiries are underway to establish the circumstances of the burglary and collision.

No arrests have been made.

Police Constable Libby Peak, of Poole police, said: "An investigation is underway to establish the exact circumstances of these two linked offences. I am appealing to anyone who was in the area of Christopher Crescent or Wimborne Road and saw or heard anything suspicious to please contact Dorset Police.

"We are keen to identify the people who were in the vehicle at the time as it is possible they may have sustained injuries and might need urgent medical attention."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 2:49. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
