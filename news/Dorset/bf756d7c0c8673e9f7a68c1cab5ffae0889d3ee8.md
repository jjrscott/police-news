# Witness appeal following assault on man in Bournemouth

18 February 2019

* * *

Officers investigating an assault on a man in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At around 1.25am on Thursday 14 February 2019 a 21-year-old local man, who has a disability, entered the Inside London Market convenience store on Old Christchurch Road. Once inside he was approached by three men who hurled abuse at him about his disability and then assaulted him.

The victim ran out of the store, up Old Christchurch Road and attempted to get into a taxi but the offenders had followed him and one grabbed him by the throat.

The victim again tried to get away. He ran past Vodka Revolution and back into the store. He was followed by the offenders and further assaulted before a member of security from a nearby club went to his assistance.

The victim was taken to hospital for treatment to a small lump on his head and concussion.

The offenders are described as white and aged in their late teens or early 20s.

Police Constable Josh Benoke, of Bournemouth police, said: "This was an unprovoked, sustained and violent assault on a vulnerable man. This incident has understandably caused great upset to him and his family.

"Enquiries are underway to identify the men involved, including assessing CCTV, and I would urge anyone who was in the area at the time and may have witnessed all or part of the incident to please contact Dorset Police."
