Detectives are appealing for the public's help to find a man responsible for assault on an elderly woman in Poole.

The incident happened at around 2pm yesterday, Tuesday 28 June 2016, as a woman aged in her 90s was walking through the Old Town area.

"Officers from the Neighbourhood Policing Team will be carrying out high-visibility patrols in the area to reassure the community."
