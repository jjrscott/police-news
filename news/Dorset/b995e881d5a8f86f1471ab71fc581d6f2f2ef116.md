# Reported careless driving incident in Wareham â€“ case due at court

17 October 2018

* * *

A man has been issued with a postal requisition in connection with an alleged careless driving incident in Wareham.

At 6.11pm on Friday 6 April 2018 a Nissan Navara was seen being driven from South Street into Trinity Lane in what was reported to be a careless manner. It is alleged the vehicle narrowly missed two adults and a child who were walking along the pavement.

A 27-year-old man from Wareham has been issued with a postal requisition for an offence of driving without due care and attention. The case will be considered at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 23 October 2018 under the Single Justice Procedure.
 The Single Justice Procedure was introduced by the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015. It means certain cases involving adults charged with summary-only non-imprisonable offences can be dealt with outside of the courtroom by one magistrate who has a trained legal adviser with them.

The matter is considered on paper only and there is no requirement for the defendant to attend.

The magistrate can impose a fine, victim surcharge, prosecution costs and driving licence penalty points.
