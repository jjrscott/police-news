# Appeal for witnesses after fail to stop collision near Bridport

15 April 2019

* * *

Officers investigating a fail to stop collision near Bridport are asking for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

The incident took place on Wednesday 10 April 2019 at around 9.55am when a man was riding his bicycle on the B3162 at the junction with Duck Street in Symondsbury.

A vehicle, believed to be a people carrier with a possible partial index of WX18, crossed the road into the cyclist's path. The vehicle hit the cyclist's right arm, but the driver did not stop and continued toward Bridport.

The cyclist, a local man in his 40s, managed to stay on his bike but sustained bruising.

A passer-by in a black coloured Volkswagen Golf stopped and checked on the cyclist.

Police Constable Alex Marshall, of Bridport police, said: "I'm very keen to speak to the VW driver as he might have important information that could help with my enquiries.

"If anyone else saw the incident or has any information about the vehicle involved, please contact police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55190055379. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
