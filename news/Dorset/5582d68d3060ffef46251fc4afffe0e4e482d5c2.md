A man has been arrested in connection with an alleged attempted robbery and theft at a Bournemouth post office.

At around 6.50am on Sunday 26 January 2020 Dorset Police was called to the Post Office in Tuckton Road following reports a male member of staff had been approached by a man with his hood up and face covered with sunglasses and a scarf, who produced a hammer and ordered him to put money into a bag.

It was reported the staff member pressed a panic alarm and the offender allegedly grabbed a pack of four beers before running out of the shop without paying.

A CCTV appeal was issued by officers on Tuesday 4 February 2020.

A 36-year-old Bournemouth man has been arrested on suspicion of robbery and has been released under investigation as officers continue to make enquiries.
