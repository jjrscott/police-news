Officers investigating an assault in Blandford are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 5pm on Sunday 1 March 2020, a 14-year-old girl was walking along The Close near to the junction with Dorset Street with a friend when she was approached by a group of teenagers. One of the members of the group began verbally abusing the victim before pulling her hair and hitting her in the face.

The victim was left with bruising to her eye.

Police Constable Alistair James, of North Dorset police, said: "We are carrying out a full investigation to identify the offender of this unprovoked assault.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed what happened or who has any information about who is responsible to please contact us."
