Officers continuing to search for missing Swanage man Gerald Turner are releasing CCTV footage showing a potential sighting of him.

The 67-year-old was reported missing at 11.30am on Sunday 4 March 2018, having last been seen at his home address in Church Hill at around 3am.

Following enquiries by local officers, CCTV footage has been obtained showing man walking across High Street in Swanage toward Priests Road at around 6.30am. It is believed the man in the footage is Gerald.

Police search teams have been supported by HM Coastguard, DorSAR (Dorset Search and Rescue), Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service and Wessex 4x4.

Officers are appealing to members of the public to check any CCTV or dashcam footage they may have for possible sightings of Gerald on Sunday morning and residents are being urged to check their gardens and outbuildings in case he has taken shelter there.

Gerald is described as around five feet seven inches tall and of slim build with short, thick, dark hair and a greying goatie beard and moustache. It is believed he was wearing a black waterproof jacket, blue cotton tracksuit type trousers and green wellies.

Chief Inspector Bryan Duffy, of Dorset Police, said: "We are issuing this CCTV footage in the hope that it might jog someone's memory and I would urge anyone who may have been in the area at the relevant time and seen a man matching Gerald's description to contact police.

"I would also like to renew our plea to local residents to check any CCTV or dashcam footage.

"Officers are continuing to carry out extensive searches around the Swanage area and we are grateful to all our partner agencies and volunteer organisations that have been supporting us.

"We are doing everything possible to try and locate Gerald and our thoughts are with his family at what must be a very difficult time for them.

"I would urge anyone who has any information as to where Gerald could be to contact police immediately.

"I am also appealing directly to Gerald if you see this message to contact us or your family as we all want to ensure that you are safe and well."

Anyone with information or knowledge as to Gerald's whereabouts is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180033032.
