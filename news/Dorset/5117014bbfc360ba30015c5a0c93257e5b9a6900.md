# Witness appeal following suspicious incident in Bournemouth

15 February 2021

* * *

Officers investigating a report of suspicious activity involving a male driver of a car and a boy in Bournemouth are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

At around 5.05pm on Saturday 6 February 2021 an 11-year-old boy was playing on the pavement of MacLaren Road when a white Nissan Leaf approached him.

It is reported that the male driver of the car asked the victim to get in, but he said no and the request was repeated until the boy ran away.

The driver of the car is described as having a beard and was wearing a blue jacket. A woman was sitting in the front passenger seat of the car and there was a young child in a car seat in the back.

Police Constable Jason Barnes-Warden, of Bournemouth police, said: "At this time it is not known whether this was a genuine misunderstanding or whether there was anything more suspicious behind this interaction.

"I understand this incident will cause some concern, but I would like to reassure members of the public that we have been carrying out a number of enquiries, including house-to-house visits and checking CCTV in the area.

"I would like to appeal directly to the driver of the Nissan to come forward so that we can take your account and establish exactly what happened.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who may have seen the car in the area around the time of the incident and witnessed what happened."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55210022452. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call Freephone 0800 555 111.
