Two men are due to appear in court in connection with an alleged street robbery in Weymouth.

At around 10.05pm on Monday 11 December 2017, police received a report that a 50-year-old local man was followed by a group of men as he walked along King Street and into Ranelagh Road.

Two of the group reportedly assaulted the victim and stole his bag containing cash.
