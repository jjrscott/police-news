# Witness appeal following fail-to-stop collision in Bridport

18 May 2018

Officers investigating a fail-to-stop collision involving a car and a pedestrian in Bridport are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

At around 6.15pm on Monday 14 May 2018 the victim, a local woman aged in her 30s, was crossing the road opposite the Londis store in Coronation Road when a black car approached from her left and collided with her.

The vehicle failed to stop at the scene.

The driver was described as elderly, with a freckly complexion and balding or receding hair, which is grey on the sides and very short. He was wearing a brown or beige jacket. He had a passenger in his vehicle, who was a woman believed to be in her 20s.

The car is described as a black hatch back with a rounded boot.

The woman sustained injuries to her neck, arm and hip and attended hospital for treatment.

Police Constable Ash Jacobs, of Dorset Police, said: "This incident must have been very distressing for the victim and we are determined to identify the driver involved.

"I am keen to hear from any witnesses or anyone with information about this incident.

"I am particularly keen to speak to the driver of a grey vehicle who stopped and spoke to the victim after the collision as they may have witnessed the incident."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180072959. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
