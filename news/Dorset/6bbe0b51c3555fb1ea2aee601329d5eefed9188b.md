# Flare amnesty offered in Dorset as part of Sea Safety Day

12 April 2017

* * *

Dorset Police, in conjunction with Ramora UK has arranged a flare amnesty for private boat owners as part of a Sea Safety Day.

A flare amnesty will take place at Cobbs Quay, Poole, as part of a family Sea Safety Day on Saturday 15 April 2017.

The event, organised in partnership with Dorset Police, MDL Marina and Ramora UK aims to raise awareness about the dangers of expired flares.

Out of date flares can be safely disposed of in return for a small donation between 10am and 2pm on the day.

Unfortunately, this amnesty is for non-commercial boat owners only. Commercial vessels must follow standard procedures for the disposal of their flares, they are unable to be disposed of at the event.

Visitors can also watch safety demonstrations hosted by the RNLI, Dorset & Wiltshire Fire & Rescue Service, Ocean Safety and Powerboat Training UK and Ocean Safety, with life jacket checks, 'man overboard' and 'fire aboard' presentations and a display of emergency vessels planned.

The disposal of out-of-date flares is a growing problem for boat owners, who face severe penalties if they fail to follow the correct procedures.

Police Constable Lyn Parsons, Dorset Police Marine Section said: "This is the first flare amnesty that Dorset Police has arranged. It is a great opportunity to empty your boat lockers and dispose of your expired marine flares before they become a nuisance.

"The flare amnesty and Sea Safety Day is a great example of how we can work with our partners to provide an effective service to the marine community whilst promoting public safety."

David Welch, Ramora UK's Senior Explosive Officer said "We are delighted to be working alongside Dorset Police Marine Section as part of our ongoing flare amnesty initiative. The collection and disposal of these potentially dangerous items is vitally important to public safety and should be dealt with by experts.

"We are proud to provide this service to members of the public living in or visiting the Dorset area."

Sea Safety Day will commence at 10am on Saturday 15 April 2017 and run until 2pm.
