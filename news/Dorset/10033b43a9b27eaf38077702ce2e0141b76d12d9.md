# Witness appeal following indecent exposure in Poole

06 July 2018

* * *

Officers are appealing for the public's help to identify a man who indecently exposed himself in Poole.

At around 10am on Monday 2 July 2018 a woman aged in her 30s was running through Branksome Chine with her dog when she saw a man indecently expose himself and perform a lewd act while looking at another woman. It is believed this second woman, who was walking her dog, was unaware of the man.

The offender was hiding in a bush along a path near to a stone footbridge. Once he noticed the woman he hurried away.

He is described as white, aged in his 40s, taller than six feet and of medium build. He had short dark grey hair, was clean shaven and wore a grey T-shirt, grey shorts, white sports socks and light-coloured trainers.

Police Constable Alex Kimmins, of Poole police, said: "This incident caused the woman great concern and an investigation is underway to identity this man. We have carried out a number of enquiries in the area but have so far been unsuccessful.

"I would appeal to anyone who was in Branksome Chine at the relevant time and may have seen a man acting suspiciously to please contact Dorset Police.

"Officers from the neighbourhood policing team are available to speak with members of the public if they wish to raise any concerns."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55180102594. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
