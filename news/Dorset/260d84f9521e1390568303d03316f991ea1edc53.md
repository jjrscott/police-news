# Murder investigation launched in Poole

10 August 2020

* * *

Detectives have launched a murder investigation following the death of a man after an alleged stabbing in Poole.

At 7.36pm on Sunday 9 August 2020 Dorset Police was called to a report of a stabbing at an address in Rossmore Road.

Officers attended, along with the ambulance service. A local 66-year-old man sustained a stab wound to his abdomen and was taken to hospital for treatment.

A 53-year-old man from Poole was arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm.

Sadly, the man died in hospital on the morning of Monday 10 August 2020. His family has been informed and the coroner has been notified.

The arrested man - who is known to the victim - was subsequently arrested on suspicion of murder. He is currently assisting detectives with their enquiries.

Detectives from Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT) have launched a murder investigation.

A cordon is in place at the scene while crime scene investigators carry out their examinations. Local officers can be approached by members of the community with any concerns.

Detective Chief Inspector Jez Noyce, of the MCIT, said: "A full and thorough investigation is underway to establish the full circumstances of what happened.

"I am keen to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident and has not already spoken to police or anyone who has important information to assist my enquiries."

Dorset Police had contact with the individuals involved on the day before the incident. As is mandatory in these circumstances, the matter has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55200118171. Alternatively, to stay 100 per cent anonymous, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers online at Crimestoppers-uk.org or call freephone 0800 555 111.
