# Appeal after reported burglary of opticians in Poole

29 July 2016

* * *

Detectives are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information to come forward after a reported burglary in Poole - with three men being arrested.

The incident occurred at around 1.40am on Tuesday 26 July 2016 at Leightons Opticians in Poole High Street.

It is alleged that a group of people smashed the front glass of the opticians to gain entry and take around Â£10,000 worth of sunglasses.

Officers arrived and located three local men aged 44, 38 and 19 in the vicinity who have been arrested on suspicion of burglary in relation to this incident and are currently on police bail until the middle of September 2016 pending further enquiries.

Detectives are also investigating an incident at Matthews Opticians in Sherborne on Sunday 24 July where it was reported that pairs of sunglasses were stolen following a break-in. Detectives are keeping an open mind as to whether the incidents are linked.

Detective Constable Laura McQueen, of Poole and Bournemouth CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed either incident or has any more information that could assist with my investigation to contact me.

"I would particularly like to speak to anyone who has been offered sunglasses for sale in suspicious circumstances. It is also possible some sunglasses may have been discarded nearby so if you do discover such items please don't touch them and report it to police immediately."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 55160112083. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
