Detectives in Poole are appealing for information following a robbery at a bookmakers in the town.

Officers were called at 6.32pm on Monday 21 January 2019 to reports that a man had entered Ladbrokes in Commercial Road, threatened staff with a weapon, believed to be a bladed weapon or screwdriver, before making off with a quantity of cash.

There were no reports of any physical injuries to the members of staff.

Officers attended to search the area and are continuing to carry out enquiries. At this stage no arrests have been made.

The offender is described as being around five feet seven inches tall and of medium build. He was wearing dark clothing.

Detective Inspector Wayne Seymour, of Bournemouth CID, said: "This must have been a very distressing incident for staff at the bookmakers and I would like to reassure members of the public that a full investigation has been launched to identify the offender.

"I am appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident, or who noticed any suspicious activity in the area at the time of this offence, to contact us.

"We recognise this is the second similar incident in recent days following the robbery at Ladbrokes in West Moors on Wednesday 16 January and we are keeping an open mind as to the possibility that the two could be linked."
