Police investigating a robbery where an electric mountain bike was stolen have issued images of a male they would like to identify.

It happened at about 7pm on Monday, 8 March, when a man in his twenties was riding a Specialized bike along Bay Hall in Huddersfield.

He was then confronted by the suspect, who is said to have produced a knife and told the victim to get off the bike.

The suspect, who was described as being a male of middle eastern ethnicity between 25 and 30, then rode off towards St Johnâ€™s Road.

Anyone who may recognise this male, or who may have seen him riding the bike in the area after 7pm, is asked to contact the Kirklees District Crime Team on 101, or by using the contact options on the West Yorkshire Police website.

The crime reference is 13210117486.
