Four men have been jailed for more than 80 years for their involvement in the death of a Bradford man.

Raheel Khan, Robert Wainwright and Suleman Khan were convicted of the murder of Mohammed Feazan Ayaz at Bradford Crown Court yesterday (Tuesday) and appeared again at court today (Wednesday) where they were given life sentences with minimum terms.

Raheel Khan, aged 27, of no fixed address, was sentenced to a minimum of 30 years. He was also given a four-year sentence to run concurrently after he admitted possession with intent to supply Class A drugs in relation to a separate incident.

Robert Wainwright, aged 26, of Mannville Terrace, Bradford, was jailed for a minimum of 25 years.

Suleman Khan, aged 20, of Sandford Road, Bradford, was ordered to serve a minimum term of 25 years.

Shaoib Shafiq, also 20, of Gladstone Street, Bradford, who was convicted of assisting an offender, was jailed for 21 months.

A 17-year-old male who cannot be named for legal reasons and who was also found guilty of assisting an offender is due to be sentenced at Bradford Crown Court tomorrow (Thursday).

The body of Mr Ayaz who was 20 and known to his family as Feazan, was found in Saffron Drive, Bradford in the early hours of 1 July last year.

Speaking after today's sentencing Senior Investigating Officer Detective Superintendent Mark Swift, said:

“Our sympathies remain with Feazan’s family at this time and I hope they can now have some closure, knowing that three men who caused his death have been jailed for many years.

“There are other suspects we wish to trace in this investigation who we believe left the country shortly after Feazan was killed and we continue to make extensive enquiries to locate them.

“We have had recent successes in locating people who fled abroad after serious crimes in West Yorkshire and we are working with partners to find these individuals and bring them before our courts.”
