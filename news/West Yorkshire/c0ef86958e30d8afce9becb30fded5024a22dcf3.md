Two teenagers who were jailed for attacking a man with a knife in the centre of Huddersfield have received criminal behaviour orders.

Ginji Gabriel from Almondbury and Luke Brown from Lindley, were sentenced to 12 months and 21 months respectively at Leeds Crown Court in December last year for their roles in an attack on a male in 2019.

Both 19-year-olds had previously guilty to violent disorder and possession of an offensive weapon in a public place for the incident in John William Street in Huddersfield, during the afternoon of March 25.

The incident saw the suspects chase and then assault a male victim in an incident widely seen by shoppers, resulting in multiple calls to the police.

Fortunately the attack did not result in serious injury to the victim, who was protected from the blows by the heavy coat he was wearing.

Yesterday (Thursday), Leeds Crown Court made three-year orders which will apply on their release from prison, which ruled they must not:

• Congregate in a public place in a group of more than two persons in a manner causing, or likely to cause any person to fear for their personal safety, or

• Be together in a public place, including being in a vehicle with each other or 12 other named persons.

If either breaches the order they will be brought back before the courts, where they are likely to receive a further custodial sentence.

Detective Inspector Mark Catney of West Yorkshire Police, said:

“I would like to thank the court for granting these orders against Gabriel and Brown, which will assist police and partner agencies in managing their behaviour when they are released from prison.

“This was a shocking offence in which a man was attacked in broad daylight in the middle of a busy shopping street.

“They are both violent and dangerous offenders whose outrageous behaviour brought chaos to John William Street and could potentially have had fatal consequences or the victim."
