The deaths of two women at their home in Leeds have been confirmed as not suspicious following post-mortem examinations.

The women, aged 78 and 81, were found at their address in Stonegate Road, Moortown, on Sunday after a neighbour raised concerns.

The cause of their deaths is currently unascertained pending further tests, but they are not being treated as suspicious and reports are being submitted to the Coronerâ€™s Office.
