Police are appealing for information after a 64-year-old man was found with serious injuries by the side of a road in Leeds.

The man was taken to hospital by ambulance after being found by a passing motorist at 10.45pm on Saturday (17/10) in a layby at the side of the northbound carriageway of Scott Hall Road, just across from the junction with Sholebroke Mount.

He contacted police yesterday afternoon following his discharge from hospital to report the incident.

He had been drinking with friends and had been dropped off at his home in Moortown at about 10pm before later being found in Scott Hall Road.

Detectives are carrying out enquiries to establish the circumstances and are considering the possibility that the man could have been involved in a road traffic collision.

Detective Inspector Guy Shackleton, of Leeds District CID, said: “We are checking CCTV in the area and carrying out house-to-house enquiries around the scene but would like to hear from anyone who has witnessed anything in Scott Hall Road leading up to when the man was found at about 10.45pm.

“This is a busy main road and even at that time of night we would expect there to have been people about or passing the spot where this man was found.

“We are keeping an open mind as to how he has come to be injured but clearly we need to establish what has happened to him.”

Anyone with any information that could assist the investigation is asked contact Leeds District CID via 101 quoting reference 13200522406 or online via www.westyorkshire.police.uk/101livechat
