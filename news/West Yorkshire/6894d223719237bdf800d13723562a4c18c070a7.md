Police are appealing for witnesses to a collision which happened in Bradford, in July, after a woman who was injured at that time has now sadly died.

Seventy-six-year-old Kathleen Neilan, of Bradford, was driving a black Peugeot 107 when it was involved in a collision with a white Ford Mondeo estate car at the junction of Green Lane and Westfield Lane, Bradford.

This happened on Sunday 12 July 2020, at about 3.10pm.

She was taken to hospital at the time but has now sadly died.

There are no independent witnesses to the collision and so police are now putting out an appeal to try and identify anyone who may remember witnessing the incident.

Anyone who saw the collision or has any information about it is asked to contact the Major Collision Enquiry Team at West Yorkshire Police on 101 or via our LiveChat.
