Police in Leeds have issued images of two men they would like to speak to in connection with a high value motorcycle theft.

The Leeds District Crime Team would like to speak to anyone who can identify the two men pictured behind a washing line in the doorway of a house, as enquiries continue into the theft of a Yamaha motorcycle from the Shadwell area.

The Yamaha MT09 SP edition, registration Y55 RTS, was taken in a break-in at a property on Holywell Lane, Shadwell, Leeds on June 11 after five thieves targeted the property and stole the high value motorcycle and a pedal bike.

Officers arrested a 26-year-old man who was charged and dealt with at court for the matter. He received a suspended eight month jail sentence after pleading guilty to burglary.

The bike was not recovered however, and enquiries remain ongoing into the offence, and to locate the vehicle.

Anyone who can identify the two men, has any information about the whereabouts of the motorcycle, or can assist enquiries in any way, is asked to contact the Leeds District Crime Team on 101 referencing crime number 13200291346 or online at www.westyorkshire.police.uk/101livechat.

Information can also be given in complete anonymity to the independent Crimestoppers charity on 0800 555 111.
