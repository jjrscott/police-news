**Friday 28 August 2020**

Police are appealing for witnesses after an attempted burglary on Staincliffe Road, Dewsbury in the early hours of today (Friday 28 August).

Three males attempted to get into the house through a kitchen window at around 5am before they were disturbed.

They then fled empty handed.

The three are described as 5’7” – 5’9” tall.

Officers are particularly for anyone who witnessed a black coloured Volkswagen Golf in the area at the time to get in contact.

The suspects made off in the vehicle which had false registration plates on it (stolen earlier on in the night from a car on Sanderson Avenue, Bradford)

Any witnesses are asked to call police on the 101 chat service, quoting crime reference 13200432707.
