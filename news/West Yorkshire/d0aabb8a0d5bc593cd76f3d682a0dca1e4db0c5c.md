**Sunday 8 November 2020**

Leeds District Police are appealing for witnesses following a serious disorder incident on Kendal Drive in Leeds on Saturday evening.

Officers were called to Kendal Drive from about 4.22pm on Saturday afternoon (November 7) to reports a large group of youths were causing damage to a car and property there.

Police attended the incident and remained on scene during Saturday evening as a result of the continuing disorder, in which objects were thrown at police officers and vehicles.

A male police officer and a female police officer were struck by objects but uninjured.

Three police vehicles were damaged during the disorder.

Public order units were deployed to disperse groups of youths during the evening and then retained a highly visible presence on the road as the incident deescalated.

Officers have arrested a male in connection with the incident.

Temporary Assistant Chief Constable Oz Khan of West Yorkshire Police, said: “This sort of lawless behaviour is absolutely unacceptable in our communities and a full investigation is taking place into what occurred on Saturday evening.

“Two police officers were struck by objects and police vehicles were damaged in the disorder which took place, and we are working to identify those involved who will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

“Local neighbourhood policing team officers are also conducting reassurance patrols in the area, speaking with residents and doing what they can to support households there.

“I would ask anyone who has information about the disorder on Kendal Drive or the identity of those responsible, or any mobile phone or CCTV footage of offences, to contact Leeds District CID on 101 referencing police log 1282 of November 7.

“Information can also be given anonymously to the independent Crimestoppers charity on 0800 555 111 or online at www.westyorkshire.police.uk/101livechat
