Police are appealing for information and issuing two images of men they want to speak to following the theft of jewellery from a house in Huddersfield.

Kirklees District CID would like to speak to anyone who may have information about the men pictured or who saw suspicious behaviour on Benomley Road, Almondbury, on the evening of Sunday October 4.

It is believed two suspects broke into the property at around 10.50pm and made off with a quantity of jewellery which had been the property of the victim’s late mother and was of considerable sentimental value.

Items taken included :

 * A zig zag style 18 carrot gold ring with different coloured sapphire
 * A 22 carrot gold Saudi Arabian bangle with a Saudi Arabian symbol on the inside and an engraved line round the outside
 * A zig zag style 1 x necklace with large sapphire multi coloured cross
 * An 18 carrot gold ring with different coloured sapphire

DS Pete Usher of Kirklees CID, said: “We are conducting a number of enquiries into this offence which has been deeply distressing for the victim, given that this irreplaceable jewellery had belonged to her late mother.

“I would ask anyone on Benomley Road who saw two men behaving suspiciously on the street that night, who has any information, or who has information about the whereabouts of the jewellery to contact us.

“Reports can be made to Kirklees CID on 101 referencing crime number 13200499571 or online at www.westyorkshire.police.uk/101livechat

Information can also be given anonymously to the independent Crimestoppers charity on 0800 555 111. "
