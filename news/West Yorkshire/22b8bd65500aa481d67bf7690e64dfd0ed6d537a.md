Detectives investigating a serious sexual assault on a woman in Leeds are appealing to trace a specific witness.

A 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of rape in relation to the incident and is currently released on bail pending further enquiries.

The victim, a 19-year-old woman, had left a bar in Otley Road, Headingley, at about 8.30pm on Wednesday, November 4, after becoming separated from her friends.

As she walked home, she was approached by the suspect who offered to take her back to his address to charge her phone. She subsequently reported being the victim of a serious sexual assault while at the address.

Prior to encountering the suspect, she recalled being approached by a man near the Co-op store in Cardigan Road who offered to get her a taxi. This is likely to have been sometime between about 8.40pm and 9.20pm.

Officers are keen to speak to this man as a potential witness who may be able to assist the investigation.

That person or anyone who can assist in tracing him is asked to contact Leeds District CID via 101 quoting crime reference 13200553367 or online via www.westyorkshire.police.uk/101livechat
