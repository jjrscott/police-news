The Bradford District Crime Team have charged a man with robbery offences and possession of a offensive weapon in a public place.

The incident occurred on 3 February this year, when a suspect approached the female victim outside a pharmacy on City Road, in Bradford where she worked.

The suspect said he needed some medication but she refused as the premises was closed and he then assaulted her by punching her in the face and also pulled out a knife and threatened her.

He then stole her car keys and keys to pharmacy and made off in her car.

The victim suffered injuries to her cheek, nose and hands during the assault.

Abdul Ghaffar, 45, of Archibald Street, Bradford was charged and he appeared at Bradford Magistrates Court yesterday (10 February) and will appear again on 10 March.
