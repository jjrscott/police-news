A 26-year-old Bradford man was remanded in custody after appearing at Bradford Magistrates Court yesterday (Friday 15 January) charged with drugs offences.

Sohail Ahmed, of Naples Street, Bradford, appeared at court charged with possession with intent to supply class A drugs and the importation of class B drugs.

He was arrested by officers from the Force’s Programme Precision Team in an operation in Peel Square (Bradford) on Wednesday 13 January.

Detective Chief Inspector Jonathan Key, from the West Yorkshire Police Programme Precision Team said: “Illegal drugs ruin the lives of people across West Yorkshire. Criminals involved in drugs supply regularly use violence and intimidation which further impacts on individuals and communities.

“My teams will continue to work with local officers and local communities across West Yorkshire to bring to justice those responsible for this vile trade.”
