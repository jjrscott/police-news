**Wednesday 13 January 2021**

Police in Kirklees are appealing for information to try and identify a male they wish to speak with in connection with a report of a non-recent offence.

The Kirklees District Safeguarding Unit is appealing for information to try and identify a male believed to be called ‘Russell’ who it is believed to have lived on Acre Street in Lindley in 1989.

They would like to speak to Russell to see if he can assist with enquiries into a report of a criminal offence which took place in Lindley in the spring of that year.

Multiple enquiries have been carried to identify Russell since the report was made to officers recently. Detectives would ask him or anyone who can remember a male with the name on Acre Street or in the local area at the time to come forwards.

Anyone who can assist the enquiry is asked to contact the Kirklees Safeguarding Unit on 101 referencing crime number 13200226623.

Information can also be given online at www.westyorkshire.police/uk/101livechat or anonymously to the independent CrimeStoppers charity on 0800 555 111.
