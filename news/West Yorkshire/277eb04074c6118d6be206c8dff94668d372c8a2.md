Bradford’s Cyber PCSOs are continuing to educate parents and children about staying safe on the internet, despite the Coronavirus pandemic.

The team have taken their sessions online and are continuing to deliver their presentations to schools and parents via video conferencing facilities.

They currently work with 168 schools across Bradford District and in the last two academic years have delivered nearly 3,000 presentations to children and a further 300 to parents, to raise awareness around the importance of using the internet safely.

PCSO Luke Carson, said:

“Many schools now have video conferencing facilities, so we have adapted our sessions so they can be delivered online.

“Internet use will have increased over the lockdown period, so it is even more important for parents and children to be able to use their devices safely.

“We hope to be able to return to schools to deliver our sessions in person again in the future as that engagement is key to successful community policing, but the feedback we have had from the online sessions suggests that they are just as popular!”

If your school would like to receive a presentation on internet safety then please contact [email protected]
