Detectives are appealing for information following a report of an altercation inside a club in Halifax on Saturday 22 August.

At around 10.55pm, officers attended La Salsa on Silver Street and found a woman in her 30s unconscious following an altercation.

Three people, a man and two women, were arrested in connection with the incident and have been released under investigation.

The woman in her 30s sustained a laceration to her head and cuts to her face.

Halifax CID is now appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident or anyone who has mobile phone footage capturing the altercation to come forward.

Officers are asking for footage to be sent to police and not posted on social media as this may hinder the investigation.

Anyone with footage or anyone who witnessed the assault should contact police using the 101 live chat service or by calling 101, quoting crime reference 13200423869.

Information can also be passed anonymously to independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
