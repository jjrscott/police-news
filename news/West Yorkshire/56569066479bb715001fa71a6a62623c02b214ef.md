A man from Halifax has been jailed for four years for breaking into the home of an 88 year old woman whilst she slept.

Neville Elliott, 53 or Rye Lane, Pellon broke into the property in Halifax back in August last year, stealing a handbag.

Today at Bradford Crown Court he was jailed for 4 years.

Officers arrested Elliot after he was caught on CCTV walking away from the scene.

Detective Inspector Gary Stephenson of Calderdale CID said:

‘I welcome today’s lengthy sentence as Elliott is one of our prolific offenders.

‘Elliott has a long list of burglary offences and targets the homes of vulnerable and elderly people.

‘Having someone breaking into your home can be extremely traumatic so hopefully his victims can find some comfort in the sentence.’
