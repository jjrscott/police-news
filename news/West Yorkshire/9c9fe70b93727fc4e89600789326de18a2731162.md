Police are appealing for anyone who recognises these clothes to come forward.

They were found in a bin at the rear of Canal Wharf in the centre of Leeds on Monday, 2 November.

Officers want to trace the owner of the clothes to ensure they are safe and well.

Detective Sergeant Emily Smith of Leeds CID, said:

“There is likely a perfectly innocent explanation for these clothes being left as they were – we just want to trace the owner to ensure they are ok."

The owner of the clothes or anyone who knows who they could belong to is asked to call police on 101, quoting reference 13200548012.
