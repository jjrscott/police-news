West Yorkshire Police has been recognised for the fourth year running as one of the UK’s Top 20 Inclusive Companies.

The IC Top 50 Awards were announced online yesterday (Wednesday) and saw the force take 20th position.

The Inclusive Companies Awards is the only awards ceremony that rewards organisations for harnessing a truly diverse workforce, thus recognising the significant efforts of organisations nationwide that excel in their commitment to equality and inclusion across all strands of diversity.

Assistant Chief Constable Angela Williams, the force’s People lead, said:

“To feature in the UK’s Top 20 most inclusive companies consistently over the last four years is a fantastic achievement and I would like to thank everyone who helped with our submission this year, which clearly demonstrated to the judges our commitment in this area.

“We are confident that we are continuing to make improvements, as we move closer to our goal of creating a workforce that is truly representative of the diverse communities we serve in West Yorkshire and ensures that our officers and staff feel respected, valued, safe, trusted and have a sense of belonging.”

The nationwide recognition in the IC awards comes just days after the force was confirmed as a signatory of the Business In The Community Race at Work charter, which means it is an organisation taking practical steps to ensure it is tackling barriers that ethnic minority people face in recruitment and progression.
