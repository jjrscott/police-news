Police are asking for the public’s help to locate Leeds man Aaron Conlon.

Conlon is 23-years-old and is wanted for assault and the breach of a court order, plus failing to appear at Leeds Magistrates Court in November.

Extensive enquiries have so far proved unsuccessful in finding him.

Anyone who believes they may know of Conlon’s whereabouts or who may have recently seen him, is asked to contact West Yorkshire Police on 101, or via LiveChat, quoting reference number 13200521456.
