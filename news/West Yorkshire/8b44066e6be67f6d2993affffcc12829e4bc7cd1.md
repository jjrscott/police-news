Police are appealing for information following a firearms discharge in Bradford.

Officers were called to a report of damage to a car in Agar Street at about 9.42pm on Thursday (8 October)

Further enquiries at the scene established the damage to a Hyundai to be consistent with a firearms discharge.

An investigation has been launched by the Firearms Prevent and Investigation Team.

Detective Chief Inspector Fiona Gaffney, said: “Our enquiries so far suggest this happened while the vehicle was parked and unattended, so we do not believe it was an attempt to seriously injure or kill someone.

“Nevertheless the discharge of a firearm is a serious matter, and we are keen for anyone with information which may assist our investigation to come forward.”

Anyone with information which may assist is asked to contact police on 101 or by using the West Yorkshire Police website.

Information can also be reported anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers.

The log reference is 1796 of October 8.
