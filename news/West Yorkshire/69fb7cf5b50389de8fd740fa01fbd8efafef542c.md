Police are appealing for information following an attempted aggravated burglary in Huddersfield.

The incident happened at around 5.55pm on March 4 (4/05), after a group of males attempted to gain access to a residential property on Thornton Lodge Road, Thornton Lodge.

The suspects had what appeared to be a baseball bats and bladed weapons, when they tried to gain entry to the property.

Occupants were present at the time of the incident but sustained no injuries.

Damage was caused to the rear window of the property by the males who fled

It is believed that the suspects made off in a silver car in the direction off from the scene.

Detectives are also linking the offence with an attempted burglary on Winton Street which took place shortly beforehand.

Enquiries are ongoing into that offence in which a group of suspects are reported to have tried and failed to break into a house before leaving the scene in a silver car.

The suspects were described as four males wearing dark clothing and face coverings.

DI Sarah Lambert of Kirklees CID, said: “Enquiries are ongoing into both of these crimes, which we are linking, and we would like to speak with anyone who witnessed either incident, who has relevant CCTV footage, or who saw a group of males leaving either street in a silver car.
