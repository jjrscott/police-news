A Keighley man has been jailed for 12 months after he supplied false details in relation to speeding offences.

David Cauchi, aged 57, of Minnie Street, was sentenced yesterday (Thursday) at Bradford Crown Court after he pleaded guilty to three counts of perverting the course of justice by providing false information on a Notice of Intended Prosecution (NiP)

The charges related to three separate occasions where a Vauxhall Corsa registered to Cauchi had activated speed cameras in Shipley and Toller Lane.

The offences were identified through enquiries by West Yorkshire Police’s Prosecutions and Casualty Prevention Unit.

Head of unit Paul Jeffrey, said:

“I hope the outcome of this case serves as a warning to anyone who believes they can avoid penalties for speeding.

“West Yorkshire Police and partners are committed to making our roads safer and we will always investigate those who deliberately attempt to avoid prosecution for road traffic offences.”
