Police are appealing for witnesses to the robbery of an Argos van which happened in Clayton on Thursday 3 December 2020.

A driver had parked his Argos van on Pasture Close, Clayton, just after 7pm to deliver a parcel to a house.

As he got out of the van, he saw two male suspects running towards him. They pushed him to the ground and demanded the keys to the vehicle.

The two suspects drove away in the van.

Police immediately carried out a search of the area and at 7.26pm found the van abandoned on Ramsden Avenue, Scholemoor estate.

Enquiries are ongoing to establish what may have been taken from the vehicle before it was abandoned.

Anyone who witnessed this incident or believes they may have seen the suspects before or after taking the vehicle, is asked to contact West Yorkshire Police on 101 or via LiveChat, quoting reference number 1396 of 03/12/20.
