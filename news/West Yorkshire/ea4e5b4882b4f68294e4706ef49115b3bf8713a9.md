Police are appealing for information to trace a man who is wanted in relation to a domestic-related incident in Leeds.

Karl Lewis, aged 23, was the subject of a missing person appeal yesterday due to concerns for his welfare at the time. Those concerns have since been negated and he is no longer being treated as a missing person.

Wanted: Karl Lewis

Officers from Leeds District Domestic Abuse Team now want to trace him in relation to an incident at an address in Pudsey on Saturday.

Anyone who has seen him or who has any information that could assist is asked to contact officers via 101 quoting reference 13210100997 or online via www.westyorkshire.police.uk/101livechat

Information can also be given anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
