Police are appealing for witnesses following a fatal road traffic collision in Brighouse on Saturday.

The Major Collision and Enquiry Team (MCET) would like to speak to anyone who has information about the two car collision which took place at about 2.22pm on the A643 Highmoor Lane in Brighouse on Saturday 22 August.

It occurred after a Vauxhall Corsa which was travelling away from Brighouse and a Mercedes C180 travelling towards Brighouse were in collision.

A 21-year-old Dewsbury woman who was a passenger in the Vauxhall Corsa suffered serious injuries in the crash and, despite medical attention, was confirmed to have died at the scene.

DS Alison Webb of the Major Collision and Enquiry Team, said “This has clearly been a very serious incident in which a young woman has lost her life and we are conducting a full investigation into what took place.

“We are appealing for witnesses and I would like to speak to anyone who saw the collision or either the Mercedes or Corsa just prior the incident taking place.

“We would also ask anyone who has dashcam footage of the collision or the vehicles driving just prior to the crash to contact us.

“Information can be given to MCET on 101 referencing police log 1017 of August 22 or online at www.westyorkshire.police.uk/101livechat. “
