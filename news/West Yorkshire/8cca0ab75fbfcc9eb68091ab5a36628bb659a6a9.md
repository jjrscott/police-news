Police are appealing for witnesses following a bogus burglary on Fleet Lane, Bradford.

The incident happened around 16:30 on Monday 16 November after a male suspect attended the 92-year-old victim’s home claiming to be from the water board.

The suspect told the victim he needed to check the water pipes as he was fitting a kitchen in a nearby property.

The male victim went into the kitchen and the suspect went in and out of rooms in the house and then fled the property, stealing the victim’s wife’s purse.

The suspect is described as white male, aged 35-40, big build and wearing a dark suit with a jacket over the top.

Police are urging residents to be vigilant and also always advise residents that you are under no obligation whatsoever to let any ‘cold caller’ into your home. If anyone claims to be from an official body such as a local authority, gas or water provider, they will carry photo ID and have a number you can ring to check their credentials or use to arrange another appointment.

Anyone who witnessed anything suspicious in the area or has any information is asked to contact the police via 101 quoting crime reference number 13200574835.

Information can also be passed to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
