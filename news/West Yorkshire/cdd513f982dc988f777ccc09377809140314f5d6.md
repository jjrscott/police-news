Two West Yorkshire Police Officers and two Derbyshire Police Officers have successfully completed and passed the NPCC General Purpose Police Dog Instructor Course.

The officers were put through an intense four week course which involved written exams and practical assessments in order to achieve their qualification.

>
> ‘The dog section of West Yorkshire Police is a credit to the force and we are immensely proud of the work they do on a daily basis from searching for missing people to detaining suspected criminals.
>
> ‘It requires dedication and skill to become a competent dog handler and the selection process and training is no easy task.

> ‘These officers have completed hours of training to make sure their dogs remain competent and their skill set as a team is effective as possible.

> ‘We are lucky to have specialist trainers within force who are experienced dog handlers themselves who ensure training is highly regarded on a national level.
>
> ‘We look forward to see the officers and their dogs PD Kai and PD Diesel on the beat!’
