West Yorkshire Police officers seized more than 2kg of illegal drugs as part of a Programme Precision operation in December 2020.

The class A and B drugs were found by specialist search officers at a house on Riley Lane, Halifax, on Wednesday 9 December 2020.

On 18 March 2021, 28-year-old Benjamin Hardy, of the address, was sentenced to eight years in prison after admitting possession with intent to supply cocaine.

He was also sentenced to two years after admitting possession with intent to supply cannabis. The sentences are to run concurrently.

Detective Chief Inspector Jon Key, from the force’s Programme Precision, said: “Illegal drugs cause misery to the communities of West Yorkshire and beyond.

“Today’s sentence should act as a clear warning to anyone getting involved in the vile trade that they should expect to spend a considerable amount of time in jail.

“Through Programme Precision we are bringing more and more people to justice for their involvement in these types of offences.”
