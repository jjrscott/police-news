Police are issuing a picture of a man they want to speak with in connection with criminal damage incidents in Castleford.

The Castleford Neighbourhood Policing Team are appealing for information regarding offences in which the shop windows of eight businesses were damaged in the town centre in the early hours of Saturday November 14.

Damage was also reported to two bus stops, and it is believed a hammer was used in the incidents.

Although the manâ€™s face is not identifiable police are sharing the image as part of the investigation to see if anyone recognises his clothing or has perhaps seen a male wearing a similar large backpack, fishing hat and black coat in the local area.

Anyone or who has any information that could assist the investigation is asked to contact 101 quoting crime reference number 13200570739. Information can be shared online via www.westyorkshire.police.uk/101livechat

It can also be given anonymously to the independent Crimestoppers charity 0800 555 111.
