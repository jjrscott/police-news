A 35 year old man from Ipswich has been charged with assault.

It follows an incident that took place on Dobbs Drift in Kesgrave in the early hours of yesterday (Wednesday 5 September).

At about 7am a woman in her early 50s was walking her dog when she was approached by an unknown male who has grabbed her left hip. When shouted at by the female, he released his grip but remained in the vicinity. Officers were called about the incident and swiftly conducted a search of the area. A short while later they arrested a man who was taken to Marltesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning. The woman was unharmed in the incident.

35 year old Ionuts Natase of no fixed abode was subsequently charged with assault and use of threatening or abusive words or behaviour and appeared before Ipswich magistrates court today (Thursday 6 September).
