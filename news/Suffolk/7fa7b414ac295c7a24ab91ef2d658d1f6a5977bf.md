A man and a woman from Ipswich have appeared in court today in connection with cannabis and stolen goods offences in the town.

Mindaugas Amdruzevicius aged 22, and Jadvyga Gruzinskaite aged 21, both of Kitchener Road in Ipswich, were arrested following the execution of a warrant at the same address on Thursday 29 June.

Officers conducted a search of the property and seized more than 70 wraps of cannabis, as well as seven bicycles which were believed to be stolen.

Gruzinskaite had previously pleaded guilty to the charge of possession of cannabis with intent to supply. She appeared before Ipswich Crown Court today, Friday 4 August, where she was bound over with a recognizance of £100 for the next 12 months upon release from custody to leave the jurisdiction at once and not return for a period of 12 months.

Amdruzevicius was charged with possession of cannabis with the intent to supply, as well as the handling of stolen goods. He pleaded guilty to both offences and has been sentenced to six months’ imprisonment.

> **Sergeant Jonathan Driver, of Ipswich Central Safer Neighbourhood Team (SNT), said:** "We are committed to tackling the supply of drugs and associated criminality in our town.
>
> "Having your bike stolen can be particularly distressing and we will continue to work with our partners to minimise bike theft and ensure that anyone who does commit cycle crimes is caught and penalised.
>
> "Three of the stolen bicycles have since been returned to their owners, and we would urge that anyone who has had their bicycle stolen in recent months to contact us – regardless of whether the theft was reported – with the frame number or a detailed description.”

You can contact your local SNT at Suffolk Police on 101 or online via https://www.suffolk.police.uk/your-area for more information about bike theft.
