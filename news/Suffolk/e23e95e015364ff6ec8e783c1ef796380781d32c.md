A 19 year old man has been convicted for a burglary in Lowestoft.

Jordan Ashcroft of Alma Road in Lowestoft appeared at Ipswich Crown Court yesterday (Thursday 13 September) for breaching previous court orders.

At the same hearing he pleaded guilty to a burglary of a property on Wollaston Road in the town on Sunday 2 September when a mobile phone and £70 in cash were taken.

He was arrested later the same day and taken to Great Yarmouth Police Investigation Centre for questioning and subsequently charged with burglary.

He was sentenced to 10 months custody in a young offenders institute and was given a further 14 months for breaching a suspended sentence and community orders.

Detective Inspector Matt Adams of CID in Lowestoft said: “To see Ashcroft convicted is a great satisfaction as he was a prolific offender with a string of previous offences such as criminal damage, failing to comply with community orders and breaching court orders.

“We are determined to continue to bring those who are responsible for this type of crime to justice.

“With the nights start to draw in it can often be easier to identify homes where there is nobody in so I would take this opportunity for people to consider using timers for lights. People should always keep their doors and windows locked, keep their outside tools locked away in sheds and garages and it is also important to be alert to any strangers loitering in residential streets. If you see any suspicious activity please call the police.”
