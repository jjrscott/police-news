A man has been convicted of failing to provide a breath test following an incident in Felixstowe last year.

60 year old Christopher Sheen of Adastral Close was charged with failing to provide a breath test when stopped by officers on the evening of 4 October last year on Manning Road in the town.

Officers stopped the red Ford Focus he was driving and when spoken to by officers he smelt of alcohol. He was given seven attempts to perform breath test, but failed to exhale any breath on any of the attempts. He was arrested and taken to Marltesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning. He was subsequently charged with failing to provide a breath test.

At Ipswich Magistrates Court on Thursday 25 March he pleaded guilty to failing to provide a breath test and was consequently given a 17 month driving disqualification.
