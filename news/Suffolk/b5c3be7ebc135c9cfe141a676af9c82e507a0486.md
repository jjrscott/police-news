Police are appealing for witnesses to a road traffic collision in Stuston.

It happened on the B1077 just after midnight on Sunday 8 October at 12:20am 200 metres from the junction of Church Lane.

A silver VW Polo was travelling south on the B1077 towards the A140 before losing control on a slight left hand bend, crossing the carriageway and hitting a large tree.

The female driver, aged 22 and sole occupant of the car sustained a broken lower right leg, a broken jaw and loss of teeth. The road was closed while the vehicle was recovered and reopened at just after 5.15am

Anyone who witnessed the collision should contact Bury St Edmunds Roads Policing on 101.
