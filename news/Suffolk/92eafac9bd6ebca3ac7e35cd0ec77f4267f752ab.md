Police are appealing for witnesses after cash and jewellery were stolen during a robbery at a home in Ipswich.

Officers were called just before 1.20am this morning, Sunday 5 August, to reports that the incident had just occurred at an address in Nacton Road, between the junctions with Queenâ€™s Way and Nacton Crescent.

A number of police units were immediately dispatched to the property and on their arrival received a report from the family living there, that four men had initially knocked on their front door before forcing their way in.

The offenders then threatened the occupants with a knife and demanded cash and jewellery, with two of the occupants of the house sustaining punches during the incident.

The four men left the property having stolen a quantity of cash, jewellery and mobile phones from the address. It is believed that they left the area on foot.

The suspects are described as three mixed race males and one white male. They spoke with what the victims believed to be an Eastern European accent. All of the suspects were wearing jeans, one wore a red hooded top and another wore a yellow top.

The victims have been left shocked and badly shaken following this ordeal and are being supported by police officers, as detectives work to identify the people responsible.

Anyone with any information relating to this incident is asked to contact South CID based at Landmark House in Ipswich on 101 quoting reference 44087/18. Alternatively call the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
