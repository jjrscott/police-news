Police are appealing for witnesses and information after a robbery in Ipswich.

The incident took place just before 4pm yesterday, Thursday 28 September, at a business premises in Bramford Road, near junction with Prospect Road.

A man entered the shop, initially pretending to be a customer, before demanding money and threatening staff with a knife.

A quantity of cash was stolen from the till and the suspect is believed to have fled the scene on foot in the direction of Wellington Street.

The suspect is described as white, believed to be in his late 40s to early 50s, and of skinny build but with a protruding stomach. He was wearing a grey hooded top like a cape, with only the hood on head, a green/grey polo shirt, jeans and white trousers, and was carrying a Poundland carrier bag. He is also believed to be missing teeth at the front of his mouth, and was unshaven and of unkempt appearance.

Police would like to hear from anyone who was in the area during this time who may have seen this suspect or his direction of travel, or may have any information to help with the investigation.

Those with information should contact Ipswich CID at Suffolk Constabulary on 101 quoting 63826/17 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 55511.
