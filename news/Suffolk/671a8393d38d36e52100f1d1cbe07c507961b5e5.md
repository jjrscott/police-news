Police are releasing CCTV footage of a man they would like to speak to following the burglary of a home in Neath Drive in Ipswich in September.

Last month officers released still CCTV images of the man they want to trace following the burglary on Thursday 1 September.

Someone gained entry to the property between 7.20am and 6.40pm and stole a number of items including a silver iPad in a purple case, cigarettes, a pair of emerald earrings and a Rolex watch.

Now the footage, which shows the individual in the area of the burglary, is being released in a further bid to identify him.

Do you know who he is?

Anyone with information is asked to call Ipswich CID by dialling Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting crime number 53171/16.

Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers, anonymously if required, on **0800 555 111**.
