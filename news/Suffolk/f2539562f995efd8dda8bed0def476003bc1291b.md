Following further enquiries made in relation to an assault that took place in Lowestoft (Wed 16 Jan) officers are now satisfied the incident didnâ€™t happen as first described.

Police spoke with the victim, a man in his early 40s, about the incident on Roman Road at 6.30am and he admitted that he had self-harmed rather than being stabbed by someone.

## Previous release I 17 January 2019

Police are appealing for witnesses to an assault that took place in Lowestoft.

It happened at about 6.30am yesterday Wednesday 16 January on Roman Road. The victim, a man aged in his early 40s, was removing goods from his car.
