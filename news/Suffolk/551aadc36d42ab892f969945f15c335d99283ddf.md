Officers are appealing for information after an incident of racially aggravated assault.

The incident took place on Wednesday 14 November at around 2.45pm on the A12 in Darsham. Following a serious traffic collision at this location road closures were in place to assist the emergency response and diversions were set up. A road worker helping police officers at the scene to direct traffic reported that a male car driver stopped, wound down his vehicle window and demanded to be let through the closure. When he was told to follow the alternative route it is understood that the man then racially abused the roadworker. The silver Volvo C60 car that he was driving then reportedly rolled forward and made contact with the roadworkerâ€™s leg before being driven off on the diversion route.

The victim, a man in his 50s, sustained bruising to his leg but did not require medical treatment.

Witnesses or anybody who may have captured footage of any part of this incident on a dash-cam or mobile phone are asked to contact Police on 101 quoting reference 66183/18.
