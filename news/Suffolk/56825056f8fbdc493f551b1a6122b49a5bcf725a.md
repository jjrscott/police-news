Police are holding a free catalytic converter marking session in Stowmarket this weekend.

Members of the public are invited to attend and have their catalytic converters marked and registered free of charge by officers and thereby reduce the chance of becoming a victim of theft. No appointment necessary â€“ just bring your vehicle along on the day.

The event will take place on Saturday 3 December, between 9am and 11:30am (closing at 12 Midday), at Truck East Scania, Violet Hill Road, Stowmarket, IP14 1NN.

Vehicle owners can also follow these tips:

 * Keep private vehicles in a well-secured garage where possible, and if no garage is available, in a well-lit public area.
 * Park vehicles in such a way as to make access to the catalytic converter difficult or parallel with another vehicle if you own one.
 * Keep commercial vehicles in a locked building or compound.
 * Use alarms, lighting and CCTV to deter thieves.
