Police have arrested a man in connection with a burglary that took place in Lowestoft.

Car keys were removed from the door lock of a property on Stradbroke Road in the town and a grey Audi A3 was stolen at some point overnight between Saturday 19 December and Sunday 20 December at 3am.

Police spotted a vehicle being driven at speed in the Norfolk Street area of town at about 3am. Following a brief pursuit by officers the vehicle was followed to Kent Road where the driver decamped. An 18 year old man was arrested on Denmark Road on suspicion of burglary and taken to Great Yarmouth Police Investigation Centre for questioning.

He was subsequently released on police bail pending further enquiries to answer bail on 15 January 2021.
