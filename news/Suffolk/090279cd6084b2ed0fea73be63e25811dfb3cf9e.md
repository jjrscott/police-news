A former police officer from Suffolk Constabulary has appeared in court and pleaded guilty to two offences.

28 year old Daniel Jackson of Lakenheath in Suffolk appeared at Norwich Crown Court today (Friday 11 September) to face two charges - misconduct in a public office and perverting the course of justice.

It follows an incident on 20 October 2019 where another man was detained for possession of drugs in Newmarket.

Following a police interview on 8 April this year, he was summonsed to Norwich Magistrates Court on 14 August 2020 for an initial hearing.

Jackson resigned from the force in July and following his guilty plea the case has been adjourned for pre-sentence reports until Friday 2 October.
