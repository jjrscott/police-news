A man has been found guilty of attempted murder following an incident in Needham Market.

18 year old Raekwon Jemmison, of Green Lane in Ilford, was found guilty at Ipswich Crown Court today Tuesday 23 February of attempted murder of a 30 year old woman at a property on Quinton Road, on October 19, 2019.

Officers were called at 6.10am to reports of a woman, aged in her 30s, being stabbed and found seriously injured in the driveway of a neighbour's home.

She had sustained multiple stab wounds including a collapsed lung, serious injuries to the kidney and liver and a perforated bowel.

Following police enquires Jemmison was arrested on Sunday 20 October in the London area on suspicion of attempted murder and was taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre for questioning. He was subsequently charged on October 21 with attempted murder and possession of bladed article.

The court heard how the victim had met an individual called SK in Ipswich and that subsequently this individual would be setting up a drug dealing line in Needham Market and that SK would use her property as a base. The court heard during the trial that she had also met another man and all three of them had travelled back to Needham Market via train and the pair had all stayed over with her at her property before the stabbing took place the following morning. At an earlier hearing Jemmison pleaded guilty to the charge of possession of bladed article.

DI Stephen Clarke of Bury St Edmunds CID said: "It was incredibly fortunate that the victim did not die as a consequence of the injuries she sustained during this attack. It was a sustained series of stab wounds causing injuries which have caused significant long term impact on the victim.

DC Sarah Warner, the OIC for this investigation praised the victim for her bravery in attending the court and giving evidence, reliving the attack which put her in intensive care.

Jemmison will be sentenced on 12 April, subject to confirmation.
