Police are appealing for witnesses and information after a teenage boy was assaulted in Ipswich.

The incident occurred at around 4.45pm yesterday, Thursday 21 January in Greenfinch Avenue.

The victim – a 16-year-old teenage boy – was walking home from the park when he was approached by two unknown males. One of the males then punched the boy in the face, causing him to fall and lose consciousness.

As a result of the incident, the boy sustained a broken jaw and broken nose.

One of the male suspects is described as white and the other was black. It is believed they were both aged between 16 and 18-years-old.

Detectives would like to hear from any witnesses to this crime, or anyone who saw two males matching the descriptions above in the vicinity of Greenfinch Avenue and Goldcrest Road.

Any witnesses are asked to contact South CID at Landmark House in Ipswich, quoting reference: 37/3381/21
