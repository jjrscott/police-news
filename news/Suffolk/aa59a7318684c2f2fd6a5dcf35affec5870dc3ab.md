A 40-year old man has been sentenced to seven years in jail after admitting to supplying Class A drugs.

Alexander Rozmus, of no fixed abode, was sentenced to seven years in prison, after pleading guilty to four counts of possession with intent to supply crack cocaine and heroin when he appeared before Ipswich Crown Court on Monday 28 September.

On 12 January 2020, officers from the proactive East Scorpion drugs team, on patrol in Leiston town centre and acting on intelligence received, stopped and searched Rozmus. He was found to be possession of two wraps of crack cocaine and heroin. He was arrested by police on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A drugs and taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning.

In connection with the arrest officers also searched an address in Leiston and recovered two further wraps of class A drugs and set of digital scales. Rozmusâ€™s mobile phone was also seized and the phone data analysed.

Rozmus was subsequently charged with two counts of possession with intent to supply class A drugs and two further offences of being concerned in the supply of class A drugs between December 2019 and January 2020.
