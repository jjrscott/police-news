Police are appealing for witnesses and information following an incident of theft from a neighbourhood park in Ipswich.

At some point between 7:30pm on Wednesday 19 and 9am on Friday 28 April, the black rubber protective mats were removed from around the edge of a tennis court on Murray Road.

These are believed to have been removed in at least two separate occasions, as 10 rubber mats were discovered missing on Tuesday 25 April, and a further 30 were stolen by the end of the week.

Each rubber tile measured at 1.5 metres by 1.0 metres, which were secured together and so it would have taken considerable effort and time to remove them. The theft has been valued at a cost of more than £1,000.

Witnesses or anyone with information is asked to contact Suffolk Police on 101 quoting reference 32733/17. Alternatively, this can be reported online via the ‘Report a Crime’ page on the Suffolk Police website: www.suffolk.police.uk.
