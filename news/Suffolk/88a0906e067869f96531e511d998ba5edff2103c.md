Police have arrested a teenage boy after a business burglary in Bury St Edmunds.

The incident took place at the Warhammer shop, Risbygate Street in the town in the early hours of Saturday 31 October. Officers were called by a member of the public at 02:50am to reports of a male using a hammer to smash a window at the premises. The teenager then ran from the scene.

Police were on the scene quickly and arrested a 16-year-old boy nearby on suspicion of burglary, possession of an offensive weapon and going equipped to steal. He was taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre and was questioned by officers investigating the incident.

The teenager has been bailed to return to police on 28 November.
