Security marking your tools, will protect them against theft and assist the police to return your property to you if it is stolen and recovered.

There are a number of ways of security marking your items, these include:
Ultraviolet (UV) or invisible marking - UV pens put an invisible mark on your property that can only be seen under UV light.
Engraving or etching - Both methods are suitable for many hard surfaces and can be done using an electric engraving tool or hand engraver.
Ceramic marking - Ceramic marking pens are designed to mark china, glass or glazed surfaces. They do not cut or scratch the surface but do leave a permanent mark.
Forensic marking solutions - These are harmless solutions that contain a unique forensic code (like a fingerprint), making it easy to identify marked items. Firms that provide these marking solutions include: Smartwater – www.smartwater.com Selecta DNA – www.selectadna.co.uk· Applied DNA Sciences - www.adnas.com
