Three people have been charged with robbery following an incident in Lowestoft earlier this week.

The crime took place at around 7pm on Tuesday 13 December at an address in Normanston Drive.

The victim – a man aged in his sixties – received a call at the door from a woman asking for his assistance with moving house.

After the woman entered his property two men are then alleged to have burst in, with one holding a knife to the victim’s neck and the other apparently holding down the woman.

The victim handed over his wallet and the men then left, getting into a car waiting nearby.

Police were called and two women were arrested in connection with this incident at around 9.20pm the same evening, followed by a man the next day, Wednesday 14 December.

All three people arrested have now been charged as follows:

 * Jason Willers, aged 34, of The Street, Beccles. Charged with robbery and also possession of a Class A drug.
 * Patti Mulholland, aged 35, of High Street, Lowestoft. Charged with robbery.
 * Kelly Brown, aged 44, of Oxford Road, Lowestoft. Charged with robbery.

They appeared before Norwich Magistrates’ Court today, Thursday 15 December.

Willers and Mulholland were remanded in custody by magistrates and Brown was granted conditional bail. They are all due for a next appearance at Ipswich Crown Court on Thursday 12 January.
