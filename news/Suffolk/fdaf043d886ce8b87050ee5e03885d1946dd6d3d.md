A man arrested on suspicion of hare coursing in the Higham area has now been charged.

Officers were called at just after 9.00am yesterday, Monday 4 December to reports of men with dogs and a vehicle in fields near Higham. Police attended and arrested a 28-year-old man in connection with hare coursing. A red Mercedes ML320 4x4 car had left the scene and an area search was made for the vehicle but it was not located.

William Cook of Longfield Avenue, Longfield, Kent was taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre for questioning and was subsequently charged with trespass in the pursuit of game, under the Game Act 1831.

Cook has been bailed to appear at Ipswich Magistrates Court on 2 January 2018.

Witnesses, especially those that might have dash-camera footage relating to the Mercedes car, or anybody who has any information are asked to contact Suffolk Police on 101 reference 77421/17.
