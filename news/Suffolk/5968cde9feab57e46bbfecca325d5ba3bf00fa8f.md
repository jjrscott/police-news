Police are appealing for witnesses after they received a report of two horses being injured by an airgun early on Thursday 5 October in Stradishall.

It happened at some point between 5.30pm and 6.30pm. One horse was hit in the face and the other in the leg and face causing injuries that required a vet to be called to sedate them and remove the pellets.

Police would like to speak to two people in connection with the incident in the village and who were seen at about 5.50pm the same day. One was carrying a green canvas gun bag over his shoulder and was five foot, six inches tall, aged around 19 years old and had mousey cropped hair. He was of a skinny build, was wearing jeans and wore a green jumper with a zip at the neck. The second male was aged in his early 20s, about five foot, eight inches tall with scruffy mousey brown hair and had a short beard, was wearing a white t-shirt with a pattern on and blue jeans. Both were described as laughing.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has knowledge of it should call police on 101 quoting crime number 37/65306/17. Owners of horses in the area are asked to remain vigilant for people looking out of place or acting suspiciously.
