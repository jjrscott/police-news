Police investigating a number of robberies in Ipswich have arrested three boys.

Yesterday afternoon, Tuesday 9 October, officers arrested three 12-year-old boys in connection with four robberies and one burglary in North West Ipswich which have taken place in the last two months.

This action forms part of the overall policing response to concerns raised regarding crime and anti-social behaviour in the area.

The boys were all brought to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre where they are being questioned by officers.
