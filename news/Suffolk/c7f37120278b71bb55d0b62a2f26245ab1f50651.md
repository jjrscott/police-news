Police are appealing for witnesses after an alleged road rage incident in Felixstowe.

Officers were just after 5.30pm on Wednesday 12 December to reports of an altercation between two lorry drivers on the A14 westbound Port of Felixstowe Road.

At the time of the incident, traffic was at a standstill due to a collision which had just occurred near Dock Spur roundabout.

One of the men sustained a cut and a swollen jaw as a result of the incident.

A 37-year-old man from Great Yarmouth was arrested on suspicion of assault and taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning. He was released under investigation pending further enquiries.

There were a number of other vehicles in the vicinity at the time and officers are appealing to any witnesses to come forward, in particular anyone who may have dash cam footage.

Anyone with information is asked to contact the South Neighbourhood Response Team in Martlesham on 101 quoting reference 71875/18.
