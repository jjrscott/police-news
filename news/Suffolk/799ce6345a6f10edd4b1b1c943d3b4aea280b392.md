Police are appealing for help to identify a man they want to speak to in connection to distraction thefts in Ipswich.

The first incident took place on Monday 28 December 2020 at about 10am when an elderly man who was struggling to use the ATM at Barclays bank on Princes Street was approached by an unknown male who has offered to help. The male distracted the victim, aged in his 70s, and swiped the card and subsequently used it to withdraw and steal £160 from the victim leaving him highly distressed (crime number: 37/75041/20)

A second incident the same day at about 10.40am saw a woman, aged in her late 70s, use the ATM at Sainsburys on Hadleigh Road. Whilst going through her transaction a male has walked up behind her and distracted her and removed her bank card from the machine. It was later established that £250 had been withdrawn (crime number: 37/74992/20).

Anyone who recognises the individual depicted should contact Ipswich police, quoting the relevant crime number.
