Police are appealing for witnesses following an incident of arson in Great Barton near Bury St Edmunds.

It took place at approximately 4.50pm on Saturday 14 July in a field near Nacton Lane and the B1106 Mill Road.

A straw bale was deliberately set alight on a freshly harvested field subsequently causing a further ten bales to catch alight.

Sgt Brian Calver from Suffolk Constabulary’s Rural Crime Team said: "Farmers should ensure they store straw bales in small stacks and also keep them away from public access areas, ideally out of sight.

“Stacks should also be brought into barns as soon as possible.”

Mark Hardingham, Chief Fire Officer for Suffolk Fire and Rescue, said: “With the extreme hot and dry weather to continue, the Suffolk Fire and Rescue Service encourages everyone to be extra vigilant. Be aware of fire risks when you are out in the open, especially near to standing crop, crop stubble or trees and undergrowth, all of which is currently tinder dry.”

Officers would be keen to speak to two young people who were believed to be in the area at the time of the incident or anyone who may have any information about this crime.

Anyone who has any information about this incident, is asked to contact Sgt Brian Calver from the Rural Crime Team on 101 quoting incident number 39272/18 or alternatively, contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Advice from Suffolk Fire and Rescue Service states:
• Only BBQ at home
• Put out cigarettes properly
• Do not leave glass outside
• Dial 999 if you see a fire
