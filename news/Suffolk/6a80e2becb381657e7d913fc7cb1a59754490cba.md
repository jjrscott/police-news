A man from Ipswich has been fined after being convicted of a string of theft offences in Ipswich.

Darren Wragg, 31, of Campbell Road, appeared before Ipswich Magistrates’ Court on Friday 12 February, where he was fined £250 and ordered to pay costs of £105.

Wragg was also ordered to pay compensation costs of £120.74 and must pay a victim surcharge of £34.

The sentence follows three charges for theft from shop offences, all occurring in Ipswich last year.

The first offence occurred on 21 October at Co-op in Penshurst Road. A man concealed coffee and pork, valued at £45.92, within his clothing and left without paying.

A further incident occurred on 22 October 2020 at Co-op in Clapgate Late. Two gammon steaks, valued at £8, were stolen from within.

A third incident occurred on 7 December 2020 at Co-op in Foxhall Road. A man concealed confectionery and coffee, valued at £66.82, and left without paying.

Following being charged with these offences, Wragg asked for 17 other theft from shop offences to be taken into consideration.

All of the offences occurred between September and December 2020 at supermarkets in Ipswich.

Police Constable Tim Barrell from the Op Converter team said: "Darren Wragg was approached while on court bail and he was given the opportunity to engage with the TIC process. He made voluntary admissions to 17 further offences involving theft from supermarkets in Ipswich and he asked for them to be Taken Into Consideration at court.

“He was remorseful for his actions.”
