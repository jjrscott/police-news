A 52-year-old man has been charged following an incident earlier this year in a licensed premises in Lavenham.

Police received reports that a man entered the Angel Public House, Market Place in the early hours on Monday 8 January 2018 with prohibited and offensive weapons.

Following a police investigation, John Raines, of Langham Road, Boxted, has been charged with common assault, affray, possession of an offensive weapon and possession of a taser (a section 5 firearm).

Raines is due to appear before Ipswich Magistrates Court on 30 July.

In accordance with the Licensing Act 2003, a summary review of the premises licence issued to the Angel Hotel, Market Place, Lavenham was held following the incident and the Designated Premises Supervisor was immediately removed. This decision was also upheld by the Babergh Licensing Sub-Committee at the full review hearing held at Babergh District Council Offices, Endeavour House, Ipswich on 8th February 2018. An application for a new Designated Premises Supervisor was subsequently made to Babergh District Council and approved, allowing The Angel Public House to continue trading.
