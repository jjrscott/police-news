The Coroner’s Office is appealing for help to trace the next of kin of a man from Ipswich.

Paul Backhouse who resided at an address in Emmanuel Close sadly died on Monday 17 April, at the age of 68. There were no suspicious circumstances.

Officers would like to trace anyone who may have known Paul. It is believed he had links locally, in Portsmouth and overseas in America.
