A man in his 70s has died following an incident on Bury Road in Ipswich this morning.

Police were called just after 9.35am today, Saturday 23 January, to reports of a collision on the roundabout close to the Asda supermarket. A VW Golf had collided with a Rover 75.

Officers are looking into the possibility the driver of the Golf, the man who died, suffered a medical episode before the collision occurred. A woman passenger in the Golf has been taken to Ipswich hospital with chest pains.

The female driver of the Rover had to be freed from her vehicle and she is being taken to Addenbrookes hospital by air ambulance with serious injuries.

The A14 east bound and west bound off slip roads at the A1156 junction are currently closed, along with the A1156 Bury Road itself.

Police are asking anyone who may have seen what happened to call Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting CAD number 113 of today, Saturday 23 January.
