Police are urging members of the public to be vigilant following an incident of attempted fraud in Ipswich.

The victim, in her early 90s, received a phone call from a male claiming to be from the police saying they are investigating a fraud with Barclays Bank.

The victim is then transferred on the phone to a female. During this telephone call the victim is told in a very insistent manner to withdraw £7,600.

Arrangements are made for the victim to be collected from her home address. Around 30 minutes later a car described as large and black or dark in colour arrives outside the victim’s address. A male then knocks on the door but the woman refused to open the door to the male. He is described as white male, in his early 30s and wearing headwear described as similar to a turban.

Anybody who witnessed the car or the occupants is asked to contact DC Stephanie Rose on 101 quoting reference 37/66483/17 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.

Residents should remember the following:

Your bank or the police will never ask you to withdraw money or purchase items

 * Your bank or the police will never ask for your PIN, bank card or bank account details over the phone – never give these details out

 * If you receive such a call leave the landline for at least five minutes to make an outside call. Fraudsters will keep the line open and have been known to play ring tones, hold music and a recorded message down the phone so the victim believes they are making a call to a legitimate number

 * Use a friend or neighbour’s telephone instead

 * Friends, family, carers and neighbours are asked to spread the word to ensure everyone is aware of this scam and what they should do
