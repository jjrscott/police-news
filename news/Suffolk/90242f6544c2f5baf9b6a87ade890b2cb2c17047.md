A 20 year old man has been charged following a burglary in Lowestoft.

It follows an incident on 2 December 2018 where a burglary took place on Ashfield Crescent in the town where two laptop computers, a mobile phone and passports were stolen.

Following enquiries police arrested a man on 10 January in the town on suspicion of burglary and he was taken to Great Yarmouth Police Investigation Centre for questioning.

20 year old Travis Aldred of no fixed abode was subsequently charged with burglary and was remanded to appear before Norwich Magistrates Court on 11 January where he was remanded to Ipswich Crown Court at a date to be fixed.
