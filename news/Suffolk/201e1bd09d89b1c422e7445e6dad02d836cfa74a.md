A 16-year-old boy has been charged with two counts of possession of a knife in a public place and two counts of using threatening/abusive behaviour.

Police received reports on Sunday 22 April at around 6.20pm of an altercation that had taken place on Green Fleet Drive involving a teenager offender in possession of a knife who made threats towards a teenage boy and a man.

Officers attended and arrested a teenage boy who was later charged with possession of a knife in a public place and threatening behaviour. Nobody was injured as a result of the incident.

He has also been charged in connection with an incident that took place on Friday 6 April at Bloomsbury Close in Lowestoft in which a man was threatened with a knife.

The teenager has been remanded into youth detention to appear before Norwich Magistrates Court on 15 May 2018.
