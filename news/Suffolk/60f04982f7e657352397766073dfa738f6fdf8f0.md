A 24-year-old man from north London has been charged in connection with the supply of Class A drugs in Ipswich.

Armed police arrested a man after stopping a taxi in Wherstead Road at around 4pm yesterday afternoon, Thursday 28 January, and he was taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning.

A large amount of cash was seized following his arrest and as a result of related searches of a property in London, a significant quantity of Class A drugs were also seized.

Junior Elegbede, of Town Road in the London Borough of Enfield, has subsequently been charged with the following two offences: being concerned in the supply of crack cocaine; and being concerned in the supply of heroin.

He has been remanded in custody to appear before Ipswich Magistrates’ Court tomorrow, Saturday 30 January.

The arrest followed a joint investigation by Suffolk Police’s Serious Crime Disruption Team and colleagues in the Metropolitan Police, working together as part of Operation Orochi.

Operation Orochi, led by the Metropolitan Police, has been in place in Suffolk since February 2020. It focuses on analysing the data of mobile phones used to buy and sell crack cocaine and heroin by dealers and controllers. Officers from the team in Suffolk will share this intelligence with a dedicated team at the Met, who will then investigate in order to identify the line controller and their location.
