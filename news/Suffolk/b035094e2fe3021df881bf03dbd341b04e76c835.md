Police are urging vigilance after two reports of fake banknotes being used to buy games consoles advertised on online platforms.

The incidents took place in the Stowmarket area on 26 and 27 June and involved a Playstation 4, worth £160 and an X-Box gaming console and headset etc, worth £260 advertised on online secondhand sites. When the purchasers arrived to pay and collect the goods they did so using fake banknotes and left before the victims were able to check the money used.

The main suspect is described as a white man, in his 30s, unshaven who spoken with a local accent. He was wearing dark shorts and a white T-shirt in one incident and black top in the other. He was driving dark vehicle, thought to be a Mercedes, possibly an A-Class model. The second suspect is described as a woman aged 35-40 years of age, brown medium length hair, with a heavy build. She was wearing grey pyjama trousers and a pink pyjama top with a tattoo on the underside of her right wrist.

Police would like to hear from anybody who recognises the people involved to get in contact, quoting reference 35893/20 or 36030/20 via
