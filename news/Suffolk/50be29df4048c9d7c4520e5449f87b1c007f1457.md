Suffolk officers from the Serious Crime Disruption Team together with the Metropolitan police have arrested a man in London in connection with drug supply offences.

The arrest made yesterday (Thursday 20 August) follows on from other arrests made in connection with Operation Orochi â€“ an operation set up by Suffolk Constabulary with the Met Police to tackle County Lines drug dealing that operate between London and Suffolk.

21 year old Ronnie Downes of Winterbourne Road in Dagenham was subsequently charged with two counts of being concerned in the supplying of class A drugs between 1 December 2019 and 27 July 2020.

He was remanded to appear before Ipswich Magistrates Court tomorrow morning at 10am (Saturday 22 August).

Since February 2020* Operation Orochi, led by the Metropolitan Police, has been in place in Suffolk. It focusses on analysing the data of mobile phones used to buy and sell crack cocaine and heroin by dealers and controllers. Officers from the team in Suffolk will share this intelligence with a dedicated team at the Met, who will then investigate to identify the line controller and their location.
