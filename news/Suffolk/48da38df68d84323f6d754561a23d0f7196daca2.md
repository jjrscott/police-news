Detectives are appealing for witnesses following a sexual assault in Ipswich.

The incident occurred at around 6.50pm on Friday 29 September in Shackleton Road.

The victim – a teenage girl – was walking along the road when a male approached her near to Badshah Avenue, where he pushed her against a fence and sexually assaulted her. He then walked off towards Felixstowe Road.

The suspect is described as black, around 6ft tall, with short dread locks. He was wearing a long-sleeve top with a grey front and black sleeves, and dark blue trousers.

Any witnesses, or anyone with information about this incident, is asked to contact the South Safeguarding Unit on 101 quoting reference 64060/17, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
