Police are appealing for witnesses following a single vehicle collision in Eyke yesterday morning, Sunday 24 September.

The motorcyclist, a man in his 50s, had been travelling towards Butley when he is said to have come off the road. He sustained serious injuries, including fractures to his pelvis, leg and arm, and was taken to Ipswich Hospital via land ambulance. He has since been transferred to Addenbrookes Hospital for treatment.

Anybody who witnessed the collision or who has information are asked to call Suffolk Police on 101 quoting CAD 111 of 24 September.
