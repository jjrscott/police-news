Police are appealing for information after dog attacks on sheep in fields in the Hollesley area in the past few days.

Two sheep had to be destroyed and two were injured following what are thought to be two separate incidents that happened between Friday 12 and yesterday, Wednesday 17 August.

Two rare breed Norfolk Horn sheep in a field off Heath Road were attacked and the injuries they sustained were so severe they had to be destroyed. It’s thought a large dog may have caused the injuries.

Two Norfolk Horn sheep on Lower Hollesley Common, off Heath Road, were found to have wounds and it’s not clear if these sheep will survive. The injuries are believed to have been caused by a small dog due to the size of the puncture wounds and it’s thought the incident happened between Sunday 14 and Wednesday 17.

Police are investigating the incidents and are asking anyone who may have information to come forward. If you saw anything suspicious between these dates, or have any details about the dogs involved or their owners, please call the south area Neighbourhood Support Team by dialling Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting crime number 50387/16.
