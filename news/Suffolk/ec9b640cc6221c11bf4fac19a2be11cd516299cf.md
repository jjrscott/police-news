Police are appealing for information following an incident of theft in Rishangles.

It took place at the Baptist Church in the village on Friday 11 May.

A 3ft high sundial belonging to the church was stolen. The hollow section of the structure contained the ashes of a couple, Roy and Peggy Talbot, who devoted a lot of their time to the church.

The sundial, which has a gold plaque on the top bearing Peggyâ€™s name, has a heavy base and it is thought a vehicle would have been needed to take it away from the church.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has knowledge of it should contact Suffolk police on 101 quoting crime reference 37/27462/18 or call the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
