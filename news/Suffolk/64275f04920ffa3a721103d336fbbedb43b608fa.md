Police are appealing for witnesses to an incident of theft of a motor vehicle in the Haverhill area.

The incident took place overnight between 8.30pm on Tuesday 25 July and 5.30am on Wednesday 26 July.

The vehicle, a grey BMW 318 was stolen from the driveway of a property on Seymour Drive.

A second incident was reported to have taken place at some point between 25 July at 8pm and 26 July at 7.55pm. A silver BMW was parked on the driveway of Cleves Road in Haverhill when a wallet containing cash was taken from the vehicle.

Police are reminding people of the following crime prevention advice:

 * Do not leave anything on display in your car, thieves can sometimes mistake them for valuables and the damage they can do to the car to get in can be costly.
 * Take all your belongings with you when you leave the car. If you cannot, then lock them in the boot out of sight.
 * CD players and stereos – remove them if you can, get them security marked and keep a note of serial numbers.
 * Sat Navs – remove unit and holder from windscreen, wipe the residue circle from the screen (this could indicate to a thief you have hidden the unit in the car).
 * Keep your keys safe.
 * Fit security devices - electronic immobiliser, mechanical immobiliser, locking wheel nuts, vehicle alarm.

Anyone who has knowledge of either incident or saw any suspicious activity should contact Suffolk police on 101 quoting crime references 37/50982/17 for the first incident and 37/51011/17 for the second.
