Police have charged two people in connection with a robbery in Ipswich.

The crime took place at approximately 3pm on Monday 30 January in the Buttermarket where it was reported that two teenagers approached a man in his 20s, threatened him with a knife and demanded his silver neck chain.

The victim handed over the chain and the suspects left on foot.

A 15-year-old boy from London and 18-year-old Malik Julouis of Broxley Mead, Luton have subsequently been charged with robbery. Both are due to appear before Ipswich magistrates today, Wednesday 1 February.

A 17-year-old girl from Ipswich was arrested on suspicion of robbery and has been released on bail to return to police on Monday 3 April.
