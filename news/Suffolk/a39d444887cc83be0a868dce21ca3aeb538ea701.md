Police are appealing for witnesses to an assault that took place in Sudbury.

The incident happened on Girling Street at about 430pm on Saturday 13 March.

A male, in his 40s, was having a cigarette near to the entrance to the back of North Street Tavern when he was approached by a male who had walked up Girling Street in the direction of the Aldi supermarket from Weaver Tap.

The offender struck up a very brief conversation with the male with the cigarette before he punched the victim twice in the face. This caused deep puncture wounds to his lower eye and eyebrow.

Officers arrested a 21 year old male on suspicion of grievous bodily harm earlier today (Tue 16 Mar) and he has been taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre for questioning where he remains.

Police are trying to trace a male who was driving a white Transit van and who stopped to help the victim after the assault.
.
Additionally, anyone who saw the assault, or knows who was responsible should contact Sudbury police, quoting crime reference 37/12411/21
