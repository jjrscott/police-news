Police are appealing for witnesses following a robbery at a convenience shop in Haverhill.

The incident occurred at around 7.15pm yesterday evening, Tuesday 8 May, at B & B Stores in Chapple Drive.

The male suspect approached the counter and demanded free cigarettes, which the shopkeeper refused. The offender then jumped over the counter and attempted to grab some cigarettes, but the victim tried to block him from gaining access to the kiosk.

The offender punched the victim to the eye and a struggle then ensued as he tried to take more cigarettes, before he then left the store with one packet of tobacco. The victim was left with swelling and reddening to his eye as a result of this incident.

The suspect is described as white, aged around 16-years-old, and with short hair. He was wearing blue shorts and did not have a top on.

Any witnesses, or anyone with information about this incident, is asked to contact West CID at Bury St Edmunds Police Station on 101 quoting reference 25011/18. Alternatively contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
