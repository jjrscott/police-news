Police are appealing for witnesses following a road traffic collision on the A11 at Red Lodge yesterday.

Officers were contacted by the East of England Ambulance Service just before 2:50pm yesterday, Sunday 10 September, to reports a blue Fiat car had left the southbound carriageway and collided with a tree.

The driver, a man in his 60s, sustained serious injuries and was flown by air ambulance to Addenbrookeâ€™s Hospital where he remains in a critical condition.

His passenger, a woman in her 50s, sustained minor injuries and was assessed by paramedics at the scene but did not require hospital treatment.

Any witnesses who have not yet spoken to police, including other motorists in the area at the time who may have dash cam footage, are asked to contact the Serious Collision Investigation Team on 101 quoting CAD 221 of 10 September.
