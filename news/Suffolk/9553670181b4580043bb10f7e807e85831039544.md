Four people have been arrested after a cannabis factory was discovered in Lowestoft.

Officers were called shortly before 4.15am on Friday 27 November, following reports that a burglary was believed to be in progress at a property in Fir Lane.

On police arrival, three males attempted to run away from the scene but they were located and detained a short time later. A woman was also detained in connection with the incident nearby.

A 29-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession of Class B and C drugs, cultivation of cannabis and burglary.

A 27-year-old man, now aged 28, was arrested on suspicion of possession of Class B or C drugs, cultivation of cannabis, burglary and for abstracting electricity.

A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of cultivation of cannabis, burglary and for abstracting electricity.

A 37-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of possession of a Class A drug, possession with intent to supply Class A and for abstracting electricity.

All four people were taken to Great Yarmouth Police Investigation Centre for questioning and have subsequently been released on bail until Tuesday 22 December and Wednesday 23 December.

Approximately 200 cannabis plants were seized from within the property.

Officers would urge local residents and businesses to be vigilant to suspicious activity and anyone with information about drug-related activity in their community should contact Suffolk police.

The signs to spot include a strong or sickly sweet smell in the air; buildings with windows constantly blocked off; high levels of heat and condensation and the constant buzz of ventilation. Such operations would most likely have people coming and going from an address at unsociable hours too.

Anyone with information should contact Suffolk police, quoting crime number 37/68775/20

Members of the public who have concerns or information regarding the production or sale of illegal drugs in their community, should contact their local policing team. Details can be found on the force’s website: http://www.suffolk.police.uk/your-area
