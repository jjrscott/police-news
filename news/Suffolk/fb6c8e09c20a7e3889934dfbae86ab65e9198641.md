Throughout the past year, officers from the Suffolk Constabulary East Sports & Social Club acquired a number of Suffolk Constabulary specific metal poppy pin badges. The company that supplied them did so at a discount so extra funds could be raised for the Poppy Appeal. Now having sold over 150 of them, the club is delighted to be able to donate £500 to the Lowestoft branch of the Royal British Legion Poppy Appeal.

Sergeant Steve Wright, who manages the club for the area, said, “I am delighted so many of my colleagues wanted to support the Poppy Appeal and buy these special badges. Being a bugler and playing the last post each year, I take great pride in wearing my poppy as I know all of my colleagues do as well.”

PC Claire Bodmer, who is the Chair of the Eastern Area Sports & Social Club, said, “The club conducts lots of activities throughout the year to raise money for good causes. We know how difficult it is for charities and voluntary organisations in the current climate and if we can make a small difference to those around us, we are delighted to do so.”
