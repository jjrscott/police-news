Police are issuing CCTV images of a man they would like to speak to in connection with an incident of burglary that took place in Ipswich.

At approximately 04:30am on Sunday 11 March, a woman – aged in her forties – awoke to discover an unknown man in her bedroom.

When the victim confronted the man, he left the property in Rectory Road, by going through the back door.

Following the incident, officers arrested a 33-year-old man from Ipswich, in the early hours of yesterday, Tuesday 13 March, on suspicion of burglary. He has since been released under investigation pending further enquires.

Anyone who recognises the individual in the CCTV stills should contact Ipswich CID on 101, quoting crime reference 37/13342/18 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
