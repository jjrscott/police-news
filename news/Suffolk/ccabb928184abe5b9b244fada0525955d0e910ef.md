A 33-year-old man is to be charged with murder, in connection with the death of a man found unconscious outside his Ipswich home in the summer of 2018.

At 7.15am on Friday 20 July 2018, Clive Wyard, aged 74, was found collapsed on his driveway in Valley Road.

He had sustained injuries to his head and face, including black eyes, a split cleft lip, a further cut to his lip, a deep cut to his cheek and other cuts to his body. He was taken to Ipswich Hospital where he sadly died 12 days later.

A post mortem examination concluded that Mr Wyard died as a result of a severe head injury, having sustained a skull fracture and a bleed on the brain.

An inquiry into the circumstances surrounding Mr Wyard’s death by the Joint Norfolk and Suffolk Major Investigation Team then followed, which has resulted in approval being gained from the CPS to bring charges against an individual.

Rhys Burroughs, previously of Colchester Road, Ipswich, has been summonsed to appear before Ipswich Magistrates’ Court on Thursday 20 May, where he will be formally charged with murder and attempted robbery. Burroughs is currently in custody.
