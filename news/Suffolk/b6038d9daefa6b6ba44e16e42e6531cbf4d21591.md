Police are appealing for witnesses to a series of burglaries that took place near Bury St Edmunds.

They happened in Whepstead overnight between Tuesday 31 October and Wednesday 1 November.

Two incidents took place at separate properties on Tuffields Road. In the first incident a kitchen window was forced open and the offender(s) stole some jewellery while the occupants were away overnight.

In the second incident, also on Tuffield Road, entry was gained via a kitchen window by smashing a pane of glass. They then searched the main bedroom where it is thought some items of jewellery were taken and they made their exit via rear doors from the conservatory.

A third incident took place at a property on Rede Road. The property was unoccupied between 2.25 and 5pm on 31 October. The offender(s) forced open a pair of wooden doors and a search of the property took place with a diamond necklace, diamond stud earrings and a pair of diamond earrings with decorative gold surrounds all stolen.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or how saw any suspicious behaviour should contact Bury St Edmunds CID on 101, quoting crime reference numbers 37/70842/17, 37/70647/17 and 37/70639/17 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
