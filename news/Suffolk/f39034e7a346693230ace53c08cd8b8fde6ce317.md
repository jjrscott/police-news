Police are appealing for witnesses after an elderly woman was robbed in Haverhill at the weekend.

The incident occurred at around 9.20am yesterday morning, Sunday 2 April, in Camps Road.

The victim was walking towards the town centre when she encountered a man who was walking in the opposite direction. As they passed each other he grabbed her handbag, shoved her to the floor and then ran off with the bag along the alleyway of Lower Downs Slade, leading to Downs Crescent.

The victim was taken to Addenbrookeâ€™s Hospital for treatment as a result of this incident.

The offender is described as having a tanned complexion, aged in his 20s, 5ft 8in tall, of slim/slight build, with a dark beard and moustache. He was wearing a hooded top and a beanie hat.

Any witnesses are asked to contact Bury St Edmunds CID on **101** quoting reference 26508/17, or Crimestoppers anonymously on **0800 555 111**.
