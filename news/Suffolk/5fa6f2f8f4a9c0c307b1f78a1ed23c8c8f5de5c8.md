Police are appealing for witnesses following an assault in Ipswich.

The incident took place at 4.15pm on Wednesday 31 July in Maidenhall Approach.

The victim - a woman aged in her 20s - was walking with her child in the direction of Stoke High School - Ormiston Academy, when she saw a group of five young people, aged approximately between 10 and 14 years.

A member of the group then threw what is believed to have been water over the woman, and as she turned around, a boy from the group made a threatening comment towards her. The group then ran off in the direction of the shops.

The woman was left shaken as a result of the incident but no one was physically harmed.

The three teenage boys are described as having dark short hair and the two girls with long dark hair. The group were wearing dark clothing, jeans or tracksuits.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has knowledge of it should contact Suffolk police quoting crime reference: 37/46096/19.
