Police are appealing for witnesses following an attempted robbery in Bury St Edmunds last week.

The incident occurred at around 7.45pm on Friday 31 August in Anglian Lane.

The victim, a 16-year-old boy, was walking along the road when he passed a group of three males near to an alleyway, which is next to the industrial estate entrance.

As he entered the alleyway, he was tripped by one of the group and then pushed to the floor where he was kicked a number of times and told to hand over his phone and wallet.

The attack came to an end when the offenders were disturbed by two passers-by in a car who shouted at them. They then ran away up a track that runs along the back of Raynham Road and beside the industrial estate.

Nothing was stolen from the victim, who sustained a small cut and soreness to his head as a result of this incident.

The offenders are described as three white males, aged between 16 and 20 years-old. One of them was wearing a camouflage jacket.

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to contact West CID at Bury St Edmunds Police Station on 101 quoting reference 50099/18, or alternatively the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
