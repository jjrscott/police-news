Police have arrested three men after a vehicle was stopped and searched in Ipswich.

The incident happened on Monday 3 September when at about 9.20pm officers had reason to stop a black Audi A3 on Shetland Close.

Officers subsequently searched the three male occupants of the car and recovered two knives and seven wraps of what was believed to be class A drugs. Following a further search of the vehicle five mobile phones, scales and cash in the region of Â£1000 was recovered.

A 19 year old male, 20 year old male and 18 year old male were all arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of class A drugs, while the 19 year old and 18 year old were both arrested on suspicion of possession an offensive weapon. They were taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning.

All three have since been released under investigation pending further enquiries.
