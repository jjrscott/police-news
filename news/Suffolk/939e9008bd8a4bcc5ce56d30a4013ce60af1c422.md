Detectives are investigating two burglaries in Bentley.

Both incidents took place on Tuesday, 29 November and police are looking into the possibility that they may be linked.

The first break-in happened at some point between 1pm and 4pm at a home address on Station Road, where a window to the rear of the property was forced open.

The second incident is thought to have occurred between 3pm and 4:30pm later that same day, at a home address on Capel Road. A window to the rear of the property was smashed and an untidy search of the home was then made. The victimâ€™s car keys were taken, and a black Ford Mondeo was subsequently stolen.

Police are appealing for anyone with information to come forward and contact Southern Area CID on **101** , quoting reference 68936/16.
