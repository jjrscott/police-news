Police are urging residents to be alert for telephone scams following reports that a number of residents have been contacted by a caller claiming to be from the tax office, HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), this week.

Fraudsters are typically contacting the elderly, intimidating victims with threats of arrest for alleged outstanding debts or unpaid taxes in their name.

An HMRC spokesperson said: “Phone scams are widely reported, and generally attempt to target elderly and vulnerable people. They often involve people receiving a call out of the blue and being told that HMRC is investigating them. If you can’t verify the identity of the caller, we recommend that you do not speak to them.

“HMRC will call people about outstanding tax bills, and sometimes use automated messages, however it would include your taxpayer reference number. If you are uncertain of the caller, hang up and call HMRC directly to check – you can confirm our call centre numbers online if you are unsure. For tax credits, we do not include your details in any voicemail messages.”

1\. **Recognise the signs** \- genuine organisations like banks and HMRC will never contact you out of the blue to ask for your PIN, password or bank details.

2\. **Stay safe** \- don’t give out private information, reply to text messages, download attachments or click on links in emails you weren’t expecting.

3\. **Take action** \- forward suspicious emails claiming to be from HMRC to [email protected] and texts to 60599, or contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 to report any suspicious calls or use their online fraud reporting tool.

4\. Check GOV.UK for information on how to avoid and report scams and recognise genuine HMRC contact.

5\. If you think you have received an HMRC related phishing/bogus email or text message, you can check it against the examples shown in this guide.

6\. Contact HMRC here.
