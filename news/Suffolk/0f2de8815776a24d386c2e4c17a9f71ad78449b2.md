Police Community Support Officers from the Ipswich East Safer Neighbourhood Team (SNT) were joined by members of the Ipswich Kerala Cultural Community to help clean-up the roads in the vicinity of Ipswich Hospital.

The event took place on Saturday 17 December from the Ipswich East SNT office at Heath Road from 10am, where residents were invited to meet the officers and air any concerns they had within the community, before joining in the organised litter-pick along Woodbridge Road East, Lattice Avenue and Newbury Road.

The event saw 14 bags of rubbish collected by the group, assisted by local Councillor Shelly Darwin who was also in attendance.

PCSO Paul Sermons said: "The aim of the event was to help bring about positive change in the community and it was great to see so many volunteers sharing this goal and joining us to help improve the look of the area. We would like to thank all volunteers who took part in the event and express our gratitude to Ipswich Borough Council which supplied the equipment.‚Äù
