Police are appealing for witnesses following two daytime burglaries in Woolverstone.

The first incident occurred between 7.30am and 5.30pm on Monday 9 July at an address in Main Road.

At some point between the times stated, an unknown suspect forced entry through a kitchen window and stole various items from within, including a shotgun that had been locked in a cabinet.

The shotgun is a Beretta Silver Pigeon 12-bore over and under with the serial number Z39699S.

The second incident occurred between noon and 4.30pm at a home in Main Road on the same day.

At some point, an offender forced a rear door and made an untidy search. Personal documents and a money box containing loose change were stolen.

Detectives are exploring the possibility that these two incidents may be linked.

Anyone with information about these incidents is asked to contact Suffolk police on 101 quoting incident numbers 37/38158/18 or 37/38149/18.

Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

If you believe a burglary is in progress call 999 immediately.

In order to reduce the risk of being a victim of such a crime, there are some steps you can take:

• Deter access to the rear of the property by ensuring gates are locked and fences are in good repair. Fence panels should be screwed into place and should be at least 1.8 (6ft) high.

• Remove anything that could be used to facilitate entry to the rear garden such as wheelie bins stored at the front of the house.

• Remove anything from outside that could be used to force entry such as bricks and garden tools.

• Lock all doors at all times. Multi-point locking/PVC doors need to be locked with the key as well as lifting the handle to be secure.

• If you have a conservatory or porch, make sure you lock the internal doors and windows into the house as well as the external ones. Always have a fire plan so you can get out quickly if you need to.

• Remove keys from doors and windows and ensure they are not left within reach and sight. Some burglaries have occurred when glazing has been smashed and the offender then reaches in to unlock the door to gain access.

• If you have an alarm, use it. If you don’t, consider getting one fitted. Contact www.nsi.org.uk 01628 637512 or www.ssaib.org 0191 296 3242 for details of local suppliers.

• You could also consider installing a Ring Doorbell camera in order to potentially film a burglar in action. For more information, visit https://www.suffolk.police.uk/news/latest-news/27-02-2018/suffolk-teams-smart-home-security-company-tackle-burglars.
