Police are appealing for help to identify a man who officers want to speak to in connection with an attempted burglary in Kesgrave.

It relates to an incident that took place at the Farmhouse pub on St Isidores in Kesgrave on 21 June 2020 at about 5.40pm.

Two males were seen to be attempting to enter the premises through a roof - the manager disturbed them and they fled the scene without stealing anything. Two roof tiles were damaged in the process.

Anyone who recognises the individual shown should contact Ipswich police, quoting crime reference 37/34449/20.
