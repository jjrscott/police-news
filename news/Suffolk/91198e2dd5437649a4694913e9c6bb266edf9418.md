Police are investigating a burglary in Newmarket.

The break in happened at a home address in the vicinity of George Lambton Avenue, near the B1103 junction, between 12:15pm and 12:30pm on Saturday 21 January.

The suspect entered via an insecure door to the front of the house and stole a handbag, which contained a purse with bank cards and a quantity of cash; a bunch of keys, a tablet device and prescription medication were also missing. It is believed the offender left via the rear of the property.

Police are issuing a warning that the medication could be dangerous if they are taken by anyone they are not prescribed for. The stolen medication includes around 60 Zomorph tablets, 500ml of Oramorph liquid & 60 Gabapentin tablets. Anyone who finds such medicine is asked to contact Suffolk Police on 101 or hand them in to your nearest doctors surgery.

Police are appealing to anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact Bury St Edmunds CID on **101** quoting reference 13751/17 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on **0800 555 111**.
