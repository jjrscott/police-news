Residents living in the West Halesworth area will get the chance to meet their local police officers this month in a series of crime prevention roadshows.

There are five drop-in events organised for November and local residents are invited to come along to speak to their local Neighbourhood Response team, ask questions about crime prevention and find out more about crime reduction over the winter months in the run up to Christmas.

The first roadshow event will be held tomorrow, 23 November, at Eye Library between 9:30am and 4pm. Subsequent roadshows this month include:

 **Friday 25th November – Framlingham Library, 9:30am to 4pm**

 **Saturday 26th November – Debenham Library, 9:30am to 1:30pm**

 **Monday 28th November – Stradbroke Library, 12:30pm to 4pm**

 **Wednesday 30th November – Halesworth Library, 9:30am to 4pm**

Additional dates in December will be advertised in advance on Suffolk Police Facebook and Twitter pages.
