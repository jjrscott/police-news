Police are appealing for witnesses to three attempted robberies that took place earlier this morning (Wednesday 7 October) in the west of Suffolk.

The first one was reported to have taken place at about 615am when a male walked into a petrol station on Bury Road in Newmarket demanding money, making threats with a wine bottle.

He was described as white, about five foot three inches tall, wearing a blue face mask and a grey hooded top and black trousers. He left the premises with just the bottle of wine and left on foot. (CAD 50)

In the second incident a male walked into Kentford service station on Bury Road at about 630am and a similar demand was made for money. He made an attempt to get cash from the till and the member of staff refused. She was subsequently hit on the head with a box of tin foil. The offender fled the scene on foot. (CAD 51).

At about 6.45am there was report of a similar incident at McColls in the Market Place in Mildenhall where a man, after buying two eggs, attempted to grab money from the till. This attempt failed.

He left the scene on foot but was seen to get into a red coloured vehicle, getting in the passenger side of the car (CAD 53).

No-one was hurt in any of the incidents. Enquiries are on-going and police are linking the three reported incidents.

Anyone who witnessed any suspicious behaviour at the time in any of the incidents, has dash cam footage of any suspicious activity recorded at around the times/locations of the incidents or knows who was responsible should contact Bury St Edmunds CID quoting the relevant CAD number of Wednesday 7 October.
