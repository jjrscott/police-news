Police investigating an attempted theft from an articulated lorry on the A14 have arrested two men.

Officers were called shortly before 12.40am, this morning, Friday 4 January, following reports of a crime in progress in Oaks Drive, Newmarket.

Police were quickly despatched and located a car, believed to have been involved in the earlier incident, in the Rougham area. Officers attempted to speak to a man but the man made off in the vehicle.

Officers pursued the vehicle along the A14 and a short time later, two men were arrested.

A 31-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of theft from a motor vehicle and was taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation for questioning, where he currently remains.

A 24-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession of a Class A drug, for failing to stop for police, for driving with excess drugs, for attempted burglary, driving without a licence and for driving without insurance. He was subsequently arrested on suspicion of fraud by false representation and driving whilst disqualified.

He was taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning, where he currently remains.
