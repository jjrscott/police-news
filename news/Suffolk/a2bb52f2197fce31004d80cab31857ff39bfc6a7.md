Police are appealing for witnesses to two incidents of robbery that took place in Ipswich.

The first incident (37/45287/18) took place last night (Thursday 9 August) about 9.10pm on Cox Lane where the female victim, in her mid 20s was walking along the street when two males have approached her and robbed her of her mobile phone. During the struggle whilst trying to keep hold of her mobile, she been punched in the arm causing no injury and the phone stolen.

A second incident (37/44888/18) took place on Fore St in the town at about 6.15pm on 4 August, near the University where a woman aged in her late 20s was approached by a group of three young males, one of whom was on a bike and had her phone snatched. The victim was unhurt. All were wearing casual clothing. The trio made off on push bike or on foot.

Police are reminding members of the public to be aware and keep their valuables hidden from view where possible. Potential thieves may use the ruse of asking for the time to strangers before snatching a mobile phone from the hands of the owner. These two incidents are being linked to three previous incidents that have taken place in the past week. Investigations are on-going into the incidents with officers pursing a number of lines of enquiry, speaking to victims, and are also studying CCTV footage.

Anyone who witnessed the incidents or has knowledge of the incidents should contact Suffolk Constabulary on 101, quoting the relevant crime number reference. Alternatively, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
