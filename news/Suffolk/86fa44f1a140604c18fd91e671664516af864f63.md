Police are appealing for witnesses after an arson attack at a business in Bury St Edmunds last week.

The incident occurred between 7.30pm on Thursday 8 December and 7.30am Friday 9 December at a premises in Hollow Road.

Entry was gained to the building by forcing open a rear door and a number of fires were then deliberately started inside. A loft hatch was also opened in what appeared to be an attempt to aid the fire in spreading.

The fire caused extensive damage inside the building, destroying tools and equipment.

Any witnesses, or anyone with information about this incident, is asked to contact Bury St Edmunds CID on **101** quoting reference 70735/16, or Crimestoppers anonymously on **0800 555 111**.
