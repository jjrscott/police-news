Police in Sudbury are appealing for witnesses to two incidents where girls were approached.

The first incident was reported in the town on Thursday 13 December and took place in the area of Wells Hall Road when a male made an inappropriate comment to a 14 year old. No further approach was made by the male.

It has also been reported that a second female of a similar age was also approached later that day in the same area. This is yet to be confirmed but enquiries are ongoing.

A second incident happened to a 13 year old girl yesterday, Tuesday 18 December at about 8.20am. She states she was followed from Ingrams Well Road by a male until she reached the Sainsburyâ€™s store. No direct approach was made by the suspect.

He is described as wearing a black Nike tracksuit, clean shaven, light brown or mousey hair, and was about five foot, five inches tall.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has knowledge of the incidents should contact Suffolk Constabulary on 101, quoting CAD 412 of 13 December 2018 or 37/73050/18 for the incident on 18 December.

Alternatively, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
