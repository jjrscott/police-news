Police have arrested a man in connection with drug offences following a stop by officers in Newmarket.

The arrest took place on Friday 22 February on Barbara Stradbroke Avenue in the town after the vehicle he was driving, a silver Peugeot 206, was stopped by officers.

A 66 year old man was searched under the Misuse of Drugs Act and found to be in possession of a small quantity of cocaine. Following a detailed search of the vehicle he was driving around two ounces of cocaine were also discovered, estimated to be valued in the region of £2,000 to £5,500. He was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of class A drugs, possession of class A drugs and also on suspicion of drug driving.

He was taken to Bury St Edmunds for questioning and subsequently released under investigation pending further enquiries.

The supply and dealing of illegal drugs will not be tolerated and residents can be reassured that any information passed to police will be acted on. Anyone concerned about drug related activity in their neighbourhood should contact police on 101, or you can provide any information anonymously by calling the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.
