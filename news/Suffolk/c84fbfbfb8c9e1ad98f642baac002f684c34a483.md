A man from Ipswich has been jailed for over four years in connection with drug offences.

26 year old Joshua Haynes, from Shackleton Road, Ipswich was convicted today (Friday 19 July) at Ipswich Crown Court after pleading guilty to being concerned in the supply of cocaine and heroin in Ipswich between April 2019 and March 2020. He was jailed for four years and six months,

Haynes was arrested on Thursday 14 May this year in Shackleton Road in the town on suspicion of drug offences and taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning. He was subsequently charged with being concerned in the supply of a Class A drugs, namely cocaine and heroin.

Investigating officer Richard Pennie from the Serious Crime Disruption Team said: "It’s hugely satisfying to see Haynes behind bars for over four years – this result demonstrates how Suffolk police wants to ensure the county remains a hostile environment for those involved in the supply of drugs. We always seek to deal robustly with the supply of drugs due to the wide range of people it affects and impact

"We continue to pursue, disrupt and arrest those suspects as well as acting on intelligence that members of the public provide and for which we are grateful for."
