Two people have been seriously injured following a two-vehicle road traffic collision on the A1088 at Ixworth.

Police were contacted around 7.35pm this evening, Sunday 2 July, to reports of a collision involving a car and a motorcycle not far from the A143 junction.

Two people on the motorcycle have been taken to hospital with serious injuries. One – believed to be a woman in her 60s - has been airlifted from the scene to Addenbrookes hospital in a critical condition. The other – a man, also thought to be in his 60s – has been taken to the West Suffolk hospital by road ambulance.

The car driver - a young woman - has also been taken to the West Suffolk hospital for treatment.

The road towards Thetford is currently closed from the A143/ A1088 roundabout while an investigation gets underway at the scene.
