Police are appealing for witnesses to a road traffic collision that took place in Redgrave on Thursday 6 April.

It occurred at about 7.30pm on the junction of the B1113 (The Street) and Fen Street.

A white SSangyong Korando was travelling south towards South Lopham when it was in collision with a white Citroen C1.

A male passenger, aged 23 who was in the white Citroen, sustained a serious head injury, a broken right leg and a fractured pelvis and jaw and was taken to West Suffolk hospital for treatment. The 21 year old female driver of the Citroen had a minor head injury. The 28 year old male driver of the SSangyong Korando had a cut to the ear and sustained some neck pain.

Police would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the collision and anyone with any information should call PC Daniel Smyth at Bury St Edmunds Roads Policing.
