Police are appealing for witnesses to a robbery that took place in Ipswich.

It happened in the early hours of this morning (Thursday 12 April) at about 12:50am on Norwich Road near to the Tesco store.

The victim, aged 50, was approached by two males who asked him for directions. They then grabbed hold of him from behind, pushed him to the ground, demanding his wallet and mobile phone before stating they had a knife. They ordered him to a nearby cash machine where he was ordered to withdraw cash before they ran off along Norwich Road in the direction of Ipswich town centre and down All Saints Road. The victim was shaken but unhurt.

One suspect is a white male, with dark coloured hair, described as having sunken cheeks and was of slim build. He wore a light coloured hooded jacket and a black t-shirt. He wore dark coloured trainers with a white sole. The second male was also wearing a light coloured jacket with a dark coloured hood, a black, shiny flat peak baseball cap and wore dark coloured trainers. Both suspects were aged between 20 and 30 years old and both described as five foot nine inches tall.

Anyone who witnessed the incident, saw any suspicious activity or has knowledge of the incident should contact Ipswich CID on 101, quoting crime number 37/19571/18 or call the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 800 555111.
