The fourth person found guilty of murdering a 41-year-old man in Ipswich at the beginning of last year has been sentenced to life imprisonment, with the collective minimum terms to be served by all four men totalling 76 years.

Dean Stansby, from Trimley St Mary, was fatally stabbed in Ancaster Road on the evening of Wednesday 8 February 2017.

At Ipswich Crown Court today, Tuesday 28 August, Amiadul Islam, aged 25, of Caistor Park Road in east London, was given a life sentence with a minimum term of 18 years.

The three other men convicted of his murder were also given life sentences at the crown court on Tuesday 31 July, with minimum terms set as follows:

 * Tecwyn Parker, aged 48, of Downside Close, Ipswich; 22 years
 * Daniel Kaganda, aged 24, of north London; 18 years

 * Jason Ruby, aged 45, of no fixed abode in Ipswich; 18 years

All four men had previously been found guilty of murder on Tuesday 24 July, following a 14 week trial at the crown court.

Dean Stansby was discovered by a member of the public at around 6.30pm on 8 February last year, collapsed on the ground in Ancaster Road near to the junction with Ranelagh Road.

He was taken to Ipswich Hospital for treatment, but despite the best efforts of medical staff he was pronounced deceased around an hour later. A post-mortem examination concluded that the cause of death was a result of a stab wound to the abdomen.
A murder inquiry was launched by the Joint Norfolk and Suffolk Major Investigation Team and they immediately began to piece together Mr Stansby’s last movements on the day of his death.

It transpired he had been driven into Ipswich by a relative and was dropped off outside Ipswich Railway Station at around 5.45pm. He then walked off along Ranelagh Road and was caught on CCTV from a passing bus entering Ancaster Road at 5.53pm – just over half an hour before he would be discovered near to that spot having suffered his fatal injury.

Through police analysis of his mobile phone, it was discovered that Mr Stansby had been in contact with a drug supply operation known as ‘AJ and Sky’ that afternoon and had come into Ipswich to purchase illegal drugs from one of their dealers.

Officers then began the exhaustive process of cross-referencing the mobile phone numbers he had been in contact with, and in turn what numbers those phones had been in contact with.

Mr Stansby had called AJ and Sky’s ‘business’ number which they used to communicate with people that wanted to buy drugs from them. AJ and Sky would then use a ‘controlling’ number to contact one of their dealers in the area and direct them to make the exchange. Through mobile phone mast analysis, both these phones were traced to east London and the area around Amiadul Islam’s home address.

Tecwyn Parker, Daniel Kaganda and Jason Ruby were identified as being people associated with the AJ and Sky operation who were on Ancaster Road at the time of the attack. Mobile phone data, CCTV images and eye witnesses all placed them there.

Amiadul Islam was one of the organisers of the operation, pulling the strings from east London. Kaganda was a ‘drug runner’, but on the day of the attack was actually controlling the drugs that were given out to be sold and received the money from the sale of those drugs. Parker and Ruby were both drug users local to Ipswich and were hired to go out and do the actual on-street dealing.

On the day of Dean Stansby’s murder, Parker, Kaganda and Ruby were all present in the flat of Parker’s sister in Gippeswyk Road, which is off Ancaster Road. Kaganda had travelled up to Ipswich from London on Sunday 5 February.

When the call came in from Mr Stansby to make a purchase, Parker was sent out to sell him the drugs and is captured on CCTV walking along Gippeswyk Road towards Ancaster Road at 5.56pm.

However, just three minutes later Parker returned to the flat without making the exchange, and Mr Stansby’s phone data supports this fact, as over the next 15 minutes or so he sends messages to the business number asking what was going on.

Whilst giving evidence during the trial, Tecwyn Parker stated that when he went out to sell the drugs he recognised Dean Stansby, who he thought might try and rob him, so he told Mr Stansby that he had forgotten the drugs and returned to the flat to inform the others.

Phone data analysis found that calls were then made between Kaganda and Ruby in Ipswich, to Amiadul Islam in London. Parker claimed that Kaganda was instructed to "teach Dean Stansby a lesson” as he had previously robbed the business.

Parker, Kaganda and Ruby then went out together, with CCTV from a passing bus capturing them in Ancaster Road at 6.22pm, with Dean Stansby standing near to the entrance to Gippeswyk Park. Mr Stansby was last seen on CCTV crossing Ancaster Road in their direction.

Mr Stansby received a single stab wound to the abdomen, but was able to make his way down Ancaster Road where he was found on the floor by passers-by close to the junction of Ranelagh Road. Dean sought the help of members of the public who telephoned for an ambulance and remained with him until paramedics arrived.

Ruby’s phone was found to have been in contact with Islam’s phone for a duration of just under four minutes between 6.21pm and 6.25pm, which covered the period Mr Stansby was attacked. The purpose of this call was to ensure the orders given from London were being carried-out.

During the extensive investigation that followed the murder of Dean Stansby, police also uncovered the defendants’ involvement a wider conspiracy to supply drugs into Ipswich by the AJ and Sky operation, dating back to November 2016.

Daniel Kaganda and Amiadul Islam admitted two counts of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs (heroin and cocaine) prior to the murder trial.

Islam will be sentenced for conspiracy to supply class A drugs at a later date. Kaganda had already been handed an eight-year prison sentence in respect of this, also to run concurrently with the life sentence.

Jason Ruby denied any involvement in the supply of Class A drugs at all, claiming he was just a user, but was found guilty of two counts of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs (heroin and cocaine) and sentenced to four years’ imprisonment, also to run concurrently with the murder sentence.

At the time of the murder trial Tecwyn Parker was already serving a four-year prison sentence for supplying heroin and cocaine in Ipswich, following his conviction for these offences in April 2017.

A fifth man also appeared before Ipswich Crown Court on 31 July in respect of being involved in the drugs conspiracy.

Yusuf Ahmed, aged 26, of Tollgate Road, in east London, pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs (heroin and cocaine). He will be sentenced at a later date.

Detective Chief Inspector Caroline Millar, the Senior Investigating Officer, said: "The sentencing given to Amiadul Islam is reflective of the seriousness of the offence he committed.

"This case highlights both the dangers of Class A drugs use and the complex world in which those involved operate. Dean was a man who had unfortunately become a user of those deadly substances and this in turn brought him into contact with the violent world of drug dealers.

"Suffolk Police will continue to combat the supply of drugs into our towns and the associated knife crime that often comes with it. We do not want more families to suffer the pain that Dean’s family have had to endure.

"The sentences handed down to all four offenders I hope will send a clear message to those who seek to peddle drugs, carry knives and spread misery that you will be caught and made to face the consequences of your actions.”

## Previous release | 24 July 2018

Four men have been convicted in connection with the murder of a 41-year-old man in Ipswich at the beginning of last year.

Dean Stansby, from Trimley St Mary, was fatally stabbed in Ancaster Road on the evening of Wednesday 8 February 2017.

At Ipswich Crown Court today Tuesday 24 July, four men were found guilty of murder following a 14 week trial. They are as follows:

\- Tecwyn Parker, aged 48, of Downside Close, Ipswich
\- Daniel Kaganda, aged 24, of north London
\- Jason Ruby, aged 45, of no fixed abode in Ipswich
\- Amiadul Islam, aged 25, of Caistor Park Road, east London
Mr Stansby was found by a member of the public at around 6.30pm on 8 February last year, collapsed on the ground in Ancaster Road near to the junction with Ranelagh Road.

He was taken to Ipswich Hospital for treatment, but despite the best efforts of medical staff he was pronounced deceased around an hour later. A post-mortem examination concluded that the cause of death was as a result of a stab wound to the abdomen.

A murder inquiry was launched by the Joint Norfolk and Suffolk Major Investigation Team and they immediately began to piece together Mr Stansby’s last movements on the day of his death.

It transpired that he came into Ipswich to purchase drugs from a supply operation known as ‘AJ and Sky’, who the four defendants all worked for.

Amiadul Islam was one of the organisers of the operation in London; Kaganda was a ‘runner’ who, on 8 February 2017 was located within an address and controlled the drugs that were given out to be sold and received the money from the sale of those drugs; Parker and Ruby were local drug users hired to deal the drugs provided by Kaganda on the street.

Parker was sent to deal the drugs to Dean Stansby that evening, but alleged that when he met him he recognised him and thought he was going to be robbed.

He then returned to the flat where Kaganda and Ruby were and a series of phones calls took place with Islam in London.

Kaganda, Parker and Ruby then went back out together where they confronted Mr Stansby, before he was then fatally stabbed.

During the extensive investigation that followed the murder of Dean Stansby, police also uncovered a wider conspiracy to supply drugs into Ipswich by the AJ and Sky operation.

Daniel Kaganda and Amiadul Islam admitted conspiracy to supply Class A drugs prior to the murder trial.

Jason Ruby denied any involvement in the supply of Class A drugs at all, claiming he was just a user. This was not accepted by the jury who unanimously convicted him.

All four men have been remanded in custody pending a sentencing hearing which is due to take place at Ipswich Crown Court on Monday 30 July at 10.30am.

Detective Chief Inspector Caroline Millar, the Senior Investigating Officer, said: “This was an appalling crime motivated by revenge and drugs. Violent crime and knife crime is a national issue and Suffolk Constabulary are committed to tackling the issues with our partner agencies. The verdicts today, send a clear message to those people who carry knives, pedal drugs and bring misery to our communities that they can expect to be caught and brought to justice.
