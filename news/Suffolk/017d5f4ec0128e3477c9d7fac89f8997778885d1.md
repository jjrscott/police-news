Two people have been charged with drug offences following a warrant on a property in Ipswich.

The arrests came after police conducted a search of the premises on Wells Close yesterday (Thursday 3 August).

Two men were both arrested at the location and were taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning.

43 year old Carl Mowles of Wells Close in Ipswich and 20 year old Mickell Douglas of College Road in London have both been charged with possession with intent to supply a controlled drug of Class A, namely crack cocaine and heroin.

They have both been remanded into custody following an appearance by virtual court to appear again before court on Friday 1 September.

A 57 year old man also arrested at the property on suspicion of supply of class A drugs has been released under investigation.
