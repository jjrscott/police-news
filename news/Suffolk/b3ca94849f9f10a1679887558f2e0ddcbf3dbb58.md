Police are appealing for witnesses following an attempted burglary in Lowestoft at the weekend.

The incident occurred in the early hours of Saturday 1 September at an address in Breckland Way.

The occupants were initially woken at around 1.30am by a loud bang on the front door, but when they looked outside they could not see anything.

At about 2.35am they were woken again by another loud bang and smashing glass and found that a piece of concrete had been used to break a glass panel next to the front door.

At 3.40am the exterior security light came on and when the occupants looked outside there was a male standing on the front lawn. He then ran off towards Crestview Drive when he realised he had been seen.

The suspect is described as white, approximately 5ft 8in tall, and of slim build. He was wearing a woolly hat and a dark-coloured three-quarter length coat.

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to contact East CID at Lowestoft Police Station on 101 quoting reference 50144/18, or alternatively call the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
