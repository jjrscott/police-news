Police are appealing for witnesses after a man approached a girl in Felixstowe.

An 11-year-old girl had been walking along Waveney Road between 8am and 8.30am yesterday, Wednesday 25 September, when a man in a white Transit-type van pulled up in front of her. He then got out and asked her to get into the van.

The girl then crossed the road and ran away and when she looked back, the van was not there.

As a result of the incident, the girl was left shaken but was physically unharmed and was not touched by the man.

The male suspect is described as being approximately 35-years-old and with brown hair. He was wearing a blue and red check shirt with black jeans and was driving a white long wheel base Transit-type van with the letter D in the last three letters of the number plate. He was also heard speaking what is being described as an Irish accent.

Anyone with any information about this incident is asked to contact PCSO Ben Sagi quoting reference number 37/58123/19
