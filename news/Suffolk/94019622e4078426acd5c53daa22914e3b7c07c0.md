A Hollesley Bay absconder who went missing from the prison in August has been detained in Hereford.

Gavin Owens, 33, was reported to police as an absconder on Monday 8 August. Since that time Suffolk Police have been liaising with colleagues in Leicestershire, and elsewhere, and enquiries were being made to locate him.

Suffolk officers were notified overnight that he had been detained in Hereford, by West Mercia Police yesterday evening, Wednesday 7 September, and had been taken into custody. He will now be returned to the prison system.

Suffolk Police would like to thank colleagues in both Leicestershire and West Mercia, and everyone who passed on information during the enquiry, for their help in tracing Owens.
