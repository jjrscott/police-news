Two women in their 20s have been convicted for shoplifting in Beccles.

It follows an incident on Saturday 9 February at the New Look store where goods totalling £126 were stolen.

Two suspects were arrested a short while later in Worlingham and taken to Great Yarmouth Police Investigation Centre for questioning.

22 year old Georgia Sugden of Kingsway in Bungay was subsequently charged with shoplifting and assault of a Special officer.

Both appeared before Norwich Magistrates Court on Monday 11 February. Sudgen received a 12 weeks jail sentence and was required to pay £100 compensation. Masterton received a 10 week jail sentence and was required to pay £100 compensation.
