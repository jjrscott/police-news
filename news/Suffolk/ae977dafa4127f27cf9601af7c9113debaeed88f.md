Police are appealing for witnesses following a two-vehicle collision on the A12 at Washbrook yesterday.

A green VW Golf and a black Ford Kuga were involved in the collision on the A12 southbound around 5.35pm yesterday, Thursday 25 May.

Police, fire and ambulance personnel attended the scene and the road was initially blocked, with the air ambulance landing on the northbound carriageway.

A man from Essex in the Golf sustained multiple breaks to his leg, and was airlifted to Addenbrookes hospital in a serious but stable condition, while the woman in the Kuga, also from Essex, sustained injuries to her wrists and ankles and was taken to Ipswich hospital.

Diversions were put in place around the on/ off slip roads while an investigation got underway at the scene, with northbound being partially open once the air ambulance left and then fully re-opened just after 7pm and the southbound fully re-opened around 11pm.

Anyone who saw the collision is asked to contact Pc Jerry Cohen at Martlesham Roads Policing Unit by dialling Suffolk Police on 101, quoting CAD number 348 of Thursday 25 May.
