Two people have been charged after police made eight arrests, as part of an ongoing investigation into a conspiracy to supply cocaine in Haverhill.

On Thursday 4 June, officers executed warrants under the Misuse of Drugs Act at two Haverhill addresses (in Sorrel Walk and Meadowsweet Close) and following searches of these premises a quantity of cash and suspected Class A drugs were seized.

Eight people were arrested as part of the operation - which is being led by the Serious Crime Disruption Team – and taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre for questioning.

Two people have subsequently been charged with being concerned in the supply of cocaine as follows:

\- Kelly Atcheson, aged 49, of Sorrel Walk, Haverhill

\- Leonard Whistlecraft, aged 40, of Meadowsweet Close, Haverhill

They appeared before Ipswich Magistrates’ Court on Saturday 6 June, where Atcheson was remanded in custody and Whistlecraft was granted bail, with both of them due to appear at Ipswich Crown Court on Monday 6 July.

The details of the other six arrests are as follows:

\- A 31-year-old woman from Haverhill; arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of a controlled drug; and money laundering

\- A 20-year-old woman from Haverhill; arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of a controlled drug; money laundering; and assaulting a police officer

\- A 16-year-old boy from Haverhill, arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of a controlled drug

\- A 54-year-old man from Haverhill, arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of a controlled drug

\- A 67-year-old man from Haverhill, arrested on suspicion of money laundering

\- A 69-year-old woman from Haverhill, arrested on suspicion of money laundering

All six have been released under investigation pending further enquiries.
