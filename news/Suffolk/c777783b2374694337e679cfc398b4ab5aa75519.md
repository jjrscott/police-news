Police are appealing for witnesses following a collision on the A14 at Nacton on Saturday afternoon.

A woman called police around 2.30pm on Saturday, 1 April, reporting she had swerved off the A14 westbound at Nacton after another vehicle had collided with her car and driven off.

Fortunately the woman was not injured, but her red Kio Rio was damaged.

Police have details of the vehicle believed to have been involved â€“ a Nissan Micra - and officers are making enquiries to trace the driver responsible, but are appealing for witnesses to the incident and are asking anyone who may have seen what happened to come forward.

If you saw the collision or either of the vehicles before or immediately after the collision please call PC Jerry Cohen at Martlesham police headquarters by calling Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting CAD reference number 218 of Saturday 1 April.
