Police are appealing for witnesses to an assault that took place at Brandon.

It happened on Saturday 29 December after police were called at about 1.30am after a fight involving a group of around four males outside the Five Bells Public House in the town on Market Hill. The incident took place at the back of the pub where a male sustained injuries to his face, including a broken eye socket and injuries to his jaw.

The victim, a male in his 30s, was taken to Addenbrooks hospital by ambulance for treatment and was discharged earlier today.

Police would like to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident, or has knowledge of it to contact Bury St Edmunds Cid on 101, quoting crime reference 37/74988/18.

Alternatively, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
