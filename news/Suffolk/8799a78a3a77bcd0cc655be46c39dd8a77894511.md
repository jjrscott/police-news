Police have released a CCTV image of a man they would like to speak to in connection with a theft from a motor vehicle and attempted burglary in Exning.

At some point between 6pm on Wednesday 21 December and 7:30am on Thursday 22 December 2016, a van was broken into in the vicinity of Windmill Hill; a gym bag, sportswear and a quantity of cash was stolen. Police are also investigating an attempted burglary in the area, believed to have taken place around 3am on the Thursday, 22 December.

Detectives investigating the incidents are keen to trace this man seen in the area. The man is described as white, between 5ft 5ins and 5ft 10ins tall, and is of skinny build. He was wearing a black or dark-coloured beanie hat, dark coloured long sleeved top, black gloves and dark coloured Nike jogging bottoms and trainers. Do you recognise him?

Anyone with information, or who knows the identity of the man, is urged to contact Suffolk Police on **101** quoting reference 73102/16. Alternatively call Crimestoppers anonymously on **0800 555 111**.

Officers are also urging van owners to ensure doors are locked and windows are closed to help minimise the risk of being targeted by thieves.
