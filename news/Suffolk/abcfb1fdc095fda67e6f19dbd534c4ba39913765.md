Police are appealing for witnesses to a burglary that took place in Lowestoft.

It took place on Monday 19 March at some point between 6.05am and 2.45pm at a property on Newlands Close

The offender(s) went to the enclosed back garden and entered a garden shed removing an edging spade, screwdriver and garden fork.

All the instruments then used to force open double UPVC doors to a sun lounge at the rear. Once inside the premises an untidy search was made of all rooms. The offenders found both sets of keys to the victim's vehicle that was parked in the garage. It is thought the vehicle was driven out of the garage and then loaded up with three TVs (two of an LG make and one Samsung) and two Samsung tablets that were taken from the lounge, kitchen and bedroom. The vehicle, a blue Nissan Qashqai, was then driven away.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or saw any suspicious behaviour should contact Lowestoft CID on 101, quoting crime reference 37/15011/18 or alternatively contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
