Four men are reported to have entered the property shortly before 1am and assaulted the victim by stabbing him with a knife, before leaving via a back alley and fleeing the scene in the direction of Vaughan Street.

The victim received stab wounds to his arms, torso, back and legs. He was taken to hospital for treatment but has since been discharged.
