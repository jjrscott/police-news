Police are appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Lowestoft.

The incident occurred between 5pm and 5.10pm on Monday 2 April in Rotterdam Road.

The victim, a 26-year-old man, was cycling along the road and was flagged down by a man on the pavement when he reached the roundabout junction with Normanston Drive and St Peterâ€™s Street.

This man asked him the victim a number of questions before pushing him off his bike, causing him to fall into the road in front of a car which had to brake suddenly to avoid him.

The suspect took the bike and rode off along Normanston Drive and then into the cemetery. The victim gave chase across the cemetery and the suspect fell off the bike when he attempted to ride it down the steps leading back onto Rotterdam Road.

The victim then managed to take the bike back after a tussle with the suspect and fled the scene.

The suspect is described as white, aged in his late 30s, 5ft 10in tall, of stocky build and with curly, ear-length, black hair which had some grey streaks.

He was wearing a black woollen beanie hat with a white label, a black waist-length coat with black patches on the elbows, light blue denim jeans, brown trainers with white soles and glasses with black frames and red ends to the arms. He spoke with a London accent.

Detectives are appealing for any witnesses to this incident to make contact. They are particularly keen to trace the driver of the car which was forced to brake sharply and also a dog walker who shouted at them whilst wrestling for the bike in the cemetery.

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to contact East CID at Lowestoft Police Station on 101 quoting reference 17811/18. Alternatively call the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
