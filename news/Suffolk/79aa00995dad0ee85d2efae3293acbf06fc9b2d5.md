A 39-year-old man has been charged with 19 sexual offences against nine boys.

David Brown, formerly of Duke Street, Hintlesham, Ipswich, was arrested by officers in January 2019 on suspicion of a sexual assault of a boy under 13 years of age. Following a police investigation Brown was subsequently charged in March 2020 with five counts of intentional sexual touching of a boy under 13, four counts of causing or inciting sexual activity with a boy under 13, and one count of sexual activity with a 14-year-old boy, three counts of taking indecent images and six counts of voyeurism . All offences took place between July 2017 and January 2019.

Brown was bailed to appear before Ipswich Magistrates Court on 16 June.
