Police are appealing for the owner of a German Shepherd to come forward after a guide dog was bitten in Mildenhall last month.

The incident took place at approximately 12:10pm on Monday 18 September on a bus as it arrived at the bus station in King Street.

As the doors opened, a dog – believed to be a German Shepherd – boarded the bus and began to growl before running up to the guide dog and biting it around the back and neck.

Police would like to thank the bus driver and passing members of public who assisted in restraining the dog, which was not muzzled or on a lead.

Whilst the guide dog suffered no obvious injuries, the incident has left its owner – a woman in her 70s who is registered blind – very distressed and shaken.

Police would like to remind members of the public that an animal in your care should be under control at all times, whether that’s in a public space, such as a park, or in a private are, like a garden.

The owner of the German Shepherd is described as a young man, with dark hair and a beard.

Police are asking anyone with information about the incident to come forward. Anyone who can help is asked to call Suffolk Police on 101, quoting crime number 63439/17.
