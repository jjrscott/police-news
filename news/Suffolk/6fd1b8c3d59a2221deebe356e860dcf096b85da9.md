Police are releasing CCTV images of two men they would like to speak to after a taxi driver was robbed in Beck Row.

The incident happened at Falcon Way around 2am – 2:30am on Sunday 8 January.

The driver, a man in his 30s, reported he collected two men from Newmarket High Street and was asked to take them to Falcon Way. The men initially paid for the fare but as the driver returned their change he was dragged out of the vehicle and assaulted.

An unknown quantity of cash was stolen from the driver who sustained bruising to his head, neck and ribs.

The first suspect is described as white, around 18 years’ old, of medium build and approximately 5ft 8ins in height. He has blonde hair and was wearing blue jeans with a plain white T-shirt.

The second suspect is described as white, around 18 years’ old and of skinny build. He is approximately 5ft 8ins in height and has short dark hair.

Police would particularly like to trace two motorists who stopped at the scene. A man driving a dark-coloured vehicle, believed to be a Mitsubishi Pajero, and a woman driving a small red car.

Anyone with information about this incident, or who recognises the two men pictured, is asked to call Suffolk Police on **101** quoting crime number 11174/17.
