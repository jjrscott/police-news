Two men have been arrested after police carried out drugs warrants at two addresses in Pelican Close in Ipswich this morning.

Officers from Suffolk Constabularyâ€™s Drug Team, the South Scorpion Team and the local Safer Neighbourhood Team carried out the searches at two homes around 11.15am today, Wednesday 7 December.

An 18-year-old man and a 19-year-old man, both from Ipswich, were arrested at one of the addresses and a large quantity of what are thought to be class A drugs were found at the property. A quantity of cash was also seized by officers.

Both men were detained on suspicion of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply and have been taken into custody at Martlesham Police Investigation Centre where they will be interviewed by officers.
