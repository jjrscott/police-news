A man has been sentenced in connection with theft from motor vehicle and driving offences in the Red Lodge and Bury St Edmunds area.

Connor Stembarski aged 19, of no fixed address, was sentenced to 20 weeks in a young offenders institution.

Also appearing today was Joseph Cousins, aged 19 and of Guildford Way in Thetford for the same incidents. He was remanded in custody to appear before magistrates on 18 October.

It follows an appearance at Ipswich Magistrates Court today (Thursday 11 October).

Several incidents of theft from vehicles all took place between Tuesday 18 September and Thursday 20 September in the Red Lodge, Bury St Edmunds and Weeting in Norfolk. Among the items stolen were power tools, three sat navs, cash and bank cards, an i-pod nano and a pair of headphones.

It follows an incident on Wednesday 19 September in the Red Lodge area where officers spotted a suspicious looking vehicle in the Red Lodge area and their subsequent investigations led them to arrest two suspects on Thursday 20 September in Weeting and locate some of the stolen property.

Two 19 year olds were arrested and taken to Bury St Edmunds Police investigation Centre for questioning.

On Friday 21 September Stembarski was subsequently charged with nine counts of theft and one count of driving without insurance and one count of driving whilst disqualified. While Cousins, was charged with nine counts of theft.

Both men appeared before Ipswich Magistrates’ Court on Saturday 22 September where they pleaded guilty to all offences.

Sgt Steve Duncan from Mildenhall Safer Neighbourhood Team said: "This sentence comes as a result of some great team work between CID, Roads Policing and the local patrol officers. The patrol officers reacted quickly to the suspicious behaviour which prompted some great investigative work to locate some of the stolen items and consequently secure this sentence.

"I’d take this opportunity to remind motorists it only takes a criminal a few seconds to open your vehicle door and search the glove box. Don’t make it easy for them – lock it and take valuables with you every time.”
