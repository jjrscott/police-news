A 17-year-old teenage boy has been arrested following the theft of a bicycle in Ipswich.

The incident occurred shortly before 4pm yesterday afternoon, Wednesday 18 March, in Northgate Street.

Two males were witnessed by an officer on patrol riding bicycles away from the area. The two bicycles had previously been left unattended and unlocked.

Enquiries were carried out and a 17-year-old teenager was arrested a short time later nearby on suspicion of theft and for possession of Class B or C drugs.

He was taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre where he was questioned and subsequently released under investigation pending further enquiries.
