Three teenagers are due to appear at Ipswich Magistrates' Court tomorrow charged with the burglary of two garages in Otley in June.

Shane Wilson, 18, from Hill Rise, Stowmarket; a 17-year-old boy from Ipswich; and a 15-year-old boy from the Beccles area; have all been charged with two counts relating to the burglary of garages in Otley, where garden equipment was stolen.

The 17-year-old and 15-year-old canâ€™t be named because of their age.

The three were arrested on suspicion of burglary in the early hours of Thursday 2 June after police received a call reporting suspicious behaviour in the Helmingham Road area of Otley around 3am.

Items including tools and bikes were recovered by officers.

Following their arrest they were bailed for further enquiries and have now been charged to appear at court tomorrow, Tuesday 16 August.
