Two teenage boys have been arrested by police after an attempted burglary in Corton.

Officers were called at around 2:00pm on Sunday 20 September to reports of a burglary in progress at a property on Coast Road, Corton, near Lowestoft. Two boys had climbed over a fence and attempted to enter an outbuilding. The boys ran off when disturbed by the occupant of the property. They returned a short time later to collect their bicycle and reportedly pushed the victim. He was not injured as a result.

Police attended and after an area search located two 16-year-boys and both were arrested on suspicion of attempted burglary and assault. One boy was further arrested on suspicion of possession of Class B drugs.

The teenagers were taken to Great Yarmouth Police Investigation Centre for questioning and have now been released under investigation whilst enquiries continue.
