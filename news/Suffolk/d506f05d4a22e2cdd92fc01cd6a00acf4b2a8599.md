Police are appealing for any witnesses to an assault in south-east Ipswich, following which a woman was arrested.

The offence occurred at around 6pm on Monday 16 November in Gorse Road.

The victim – a woman aged in her 20s – alleges that she was assaulted by another woman who pulled her to the ground and then kicked and punched her, causing bruising and a suspected broken nose. The victim and suspect are known to each other.

A 29-year-old woman from Ipswich was arrested later that evening on suspicion of assault in connection with this incident. She was taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning and was subsequently released under investigation, pending further enquiries.

Any witnesses, or anyone with information about this incident, is asked to contact the Martlesham PIC Custody Investigation Unit, quoting reference: 66597/20.
