Residents in and visitors to Eye, Saxmundham and Southwold are being invited along to crime reduction events being held between now and the end of the month.

Safer Neighbourhood Team officers will be out later this week and next to give you the opportunity to pick up information and advice to help protect your home, vehicle and property against burglars and thieves.

There are a number of step that you can take to secure your property, with advice available from your local policing team or via our website at www.suffolk.police.uk/advice , however the events – at Eye Market between 10am and 2pm on Friday 21 April, at Saxmundham’s Waitrose store between 10am and 2pm on Wednesday 26 April and at Southwold Market between 10am and 2pm on Thursday 27 April - will give you the chance to talk to officers, raise any specific concerns or just get general advice about crime prevention.

Officers will also be able to give information about property marking, seasonal crime trends and how you can help prevent crime in your community.

Anyone who would like to talk to officers or pick up advice leaflets is welcome to attend.
