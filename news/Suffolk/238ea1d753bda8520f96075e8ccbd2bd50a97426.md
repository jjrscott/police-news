A Hollesley Bay prisoner has been detained, after failing to return to the prison following day release.

Scott Marchant, aged 37, was released on temporary licence at 9am on Saturday 5 December, but failed to return to the prison as designated later that afternoon.

Marchant was arrested by Essex Police officers this morning, Monday 7 December, and is currently in police custody, from where he will be returned to the prison system.

Police would like to thank members of the public and media for their assistance with this appeal.
