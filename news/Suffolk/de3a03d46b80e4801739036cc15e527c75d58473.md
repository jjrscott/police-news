Police are appealing for witnesses to incidents of poisoning of three cats at Great Blakenham.

It happened at a property on Stowmarket Road.

It is thought that since Thursday 22 November three cats, two Portuguese Siamese cats and a ginger tabby cat, have potentially died from suspected poisoning from anti-freeze.

Sadly, all three cats had to be put down by vets.

Anyone who witnessed any suspicious behaviour in the area prior to the incident or has knowledge of the incident should contact Hadleigh police on 101, quoting crime reference 37/68649/18.

Alternatively, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
