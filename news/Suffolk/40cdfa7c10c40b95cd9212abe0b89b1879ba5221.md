Police are appealing for witnesses following a two-car collision on the A1214 in Ipswich.

The incident took place at approximately 4:20pm on Wednesday 26 October, on the approach to the Scrivener Drive roundabout.

A grey Mazda 5 and a grey Vauxhall Astra had been travelling from the Copdock Interchange of the A14 towards Ipswich Town Centre when the collision took place, and one vehicle struck the central barrier.

One passenger was examined by attending paramedics as a precaution, but there were no serious injuries.

Both drivers have been interviewed by police but officers are appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the driving manner of the vehicles to contact the Ipswich Roads Policing Unit on **101** , quoting CAD 261 of 26 October.
