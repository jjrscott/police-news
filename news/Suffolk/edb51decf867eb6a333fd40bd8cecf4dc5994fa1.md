Detectives are releasing CCTV footage of an assault in Ipswich which occurred at the beginning of this month, and also of two people they would like to speak to in connection with the incident, whilst renewing an appeal for witnesses to come forward.

The attack occurred at around 12.05am on Sunday 4 November on Stoke Bridge, near the entrance to the skate park.

The victim, a 45-year-old woman, was walking over the bridge in the direction of the town centre. When she reached the entrance to the skate park, she passed another person walking in the opposite direction who appears to strike her with a single punch, resulting in her falling to the ground. The suspect does not break stride and continues walking in the direction of Stoke Street.

A few moments later, members of the public stop and assist the victim and call an ambulance. She was then taken to Ipswich Hospital having sustained a serious head and eye injury, before later being transferred to Addenbrooke’s Hospital.

The victim is no longer in hospital, but is still suffering with the effects of the attack and requires ongoing medical treatment.

Detectives are releasing CCTV footage of the attack on Stoke Bridge (in the clip, the victim is circled in green and the suspect in red).

They are also issuing footage of two males who were walking along Grey Friars Road at around 11.58pm on Saturday 3 November, before taking the turn towards the entrance to Cardinal Park, and then passing the side of the Golden Dragon Chinese restaurant just after midnight.

Officers would like to trace these two individuals as they may be able to assist with their enquiries. They were both wearing dark-coloured clothing, with one of them wearing a jacket which appears to black across the shoulders and the remainder of it grey. (In the first clip - which is black and white - their clothing appears light-coloured, but the second clip in colour shows this is not the case).

> Detective Inspector Dan Connick, of South CID, said: “We have made numerous enquires over the past two and a half weeks, including an extensive review of CCTV in the area.
>
> “Unfortunately, we have not yet been able to ascertain a motive for the attack or identify the person responsible. The victim has no recollection of the incident, which is to be expected due to the nature of the injuries she sustained, which continue to cause her significant pain and discomfort, and it is not yet known what long-term damage has been caused by this assault.
>
> “Although the footage of the attack is not the greatest quality, it does clearly portray the ruthless way in which the suspect punched the victim and continued walking as if nothing had happened.
>
> “Our review of CCTV has also found footage of two males who were in the vicinity of the incident just minutes before it occurred. They were walking in the general direction of Stoke Bridge and could have information which could assist our enquiries.
>
> “I hope that by releasing this CCTV footage it may either compel someone who knows something about the attacker to come forward, or help to jog the memories of people who were in the area that night and may have seen something which could prove to be vital to the investigation.”

Officers continue to appeal for anyone who was in the area of Stoke Bridge between 11.45pm on Saturday 3 November and 12.17am on Sunday 4 November, and saw anything suspicious to make contact. They are also keen to hear from anyone driving in the area that night who has a dash cam fitted in their vehicle.

The victim was wearing a white coat, red woolly hat, red hooded jumper, blue denim trousers and blue trainers.

Anyone with information about this attack is asked to contact South CID at Landmark House in Ipswich on 101 quoting reference 63902/18, or the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

## Previous release | 5 November 2018

Detectives are continuing to appeal for witnesses to come forward after an assault in Ipswich at the weekend which left a woman with serious injuries.

The incident occurred at around 12.05am yesterday morning, Sunday 4 November, on Stoke Bridge, near the entrance to the skate park.

Initial CCTV enquiries have found that the victim, a 45-year-old woman, was walking over the bridge in the direction of the town centre. When she reached the entrance to the skate park, she passed another person walking in the opposite direction who appears to strike her with a single punch, resulting in her falling to the ground. The suspect does not break stride and continues walking in the direction of Stoke Street.

A few moments later, members of the public stop and assist the victim and call an ambulance. She was then taken to Ipswich Hospital having sustained a serious head injury, before later being transferred to Addenbrooke’s Hospital. Her condition is now described as stable and her injuries are not believed to be life-threatening, but are potentially life-changing.

Officers are appealing for anyone who was in the area of Stoke Bridge between 11.45pm on Saturday 3 November and 12.17am on Sunday 4 November, and saw anything suspicious to make contact. They are also keen to hear from anyone driving in the area that night who has a dash cam fitted in their vehicle.

The victim was wearing a white coat, red woolly hat, red hooded jumper, blue denim trousers and blue trainers.

Detective Inspector Dan Connick, of South CID, said: "After reviewing the CCTV footage of the incident it would appear that this was a random and motiveless attack.

"However, at this early stage we are retaining an open mind and have not yet been able to speak to the victim due to the nature of her injuries, which are severe.

"The incident occurred directly at the side of the road, which despite it being just after midnight, was still busy. We know there were a number of people on foot and in vehicles in the area immediately before and after the attack and so I am directly appealing to those people to come forward.”

Anyone with information about this attack is asked to contact South CID at Landmark House in Ipswich on 101 quoting reference 63902/18, or the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
