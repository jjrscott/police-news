Police are appealing for help to trace the owner of a dog after a man in his 70s was bitten in Newmarket.

The incident took place at the George Lambton Playing Fields at approximately 10:45am on Tuesday 9 March.

A dog, believed to be a boxer dog, was being walked off-lead by a woman. The man attempted to pat the dog, which turned on him and bit him several times on the hand, which broke the skin and required medical treatment.

Officers are keen to speak with the woman, who is described as in her 20s, wearing dark clothing and with long brown hair which was tied up.

Police are also reminding dog owners to be mindful of their surroundings. While it isn't necessary for dogs to be on a leash at all times, it is always advisable from a safety perspective; it is easier to control a dog on a lead, particularly as dogs can be unpredictable around people, other animals and vehicles.

Dogs must be kept on a lead in designated pedestrian zones and on land where livestock is present.

Anyone who believes they may know the owner of the dog are asked to contact the Forest Heath Safer Neighbourhood Team quoting reference 11765/21 via
