Police are appealing for help to trace a large vehicle following a road traffic collision on a road approximately a mile west of Stradbroke, near Eye.

Officers were called shortly after 6:30pm yesterday (Wednesday 8 November) to reports of a collision between a VW Polo and what is thought to have been either a tractor, trailer or HGV on the B1117 Laxfield Road.

Police are trying to locate the driver of the large vehicle that may have also sustained damage as a result of the collision. The driver of the car sustained a cut to his arm which required minor treatment at hospital.

Anyone who may have witnessed the collision, or has any information, should contact PC Stuart McIlroy on 101 quoting CAD number 361 of 8 November.
