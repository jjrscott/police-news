An 18-year-old man has today been sentenced to life and told he will serve a minimum of 17 years for killing two men in Ipswich, Barry Street and Nathan Oakley.

Nelson Smith had been on trial at the Central Criminal Court (the Old Bailey) for the murders of both men and was found guilty on 28 June 2017 of the murder of Barry Street and the manslaughter of Nathan Oakley.

Today he was sentenced to life for a minimum of 17 years for the murder, with a 10-year concurrent sentence for the manslaughter.

Police were called on Thursday 8 December around 1.15pm to reports that a man in his thirties, had been stabbed at West Meadows, Ipswich and had collapsed outside the site entrance. The man was found to have received serious stab wounds to his neck and upper back and was taken by ambulance to Ipswich Hospital.

Officers were immediately on the scene and began a thorough investigation into the circumstances.

A further call was then received at just after 1.30pm reporting that another man aged in his late teens had arrived at Ipswich Hospital having sustained stab wounds to the chest. Both men received treatment but died in hospital a short time later as a result of their injuries.

The victims were named as Barry Street aged 32 and Nathan Oakley aged 18 years, both from Ipswich.

Police arriving at the scene at West Meadows were told that a teenage suspect had run off. A PCSO at Landmark House, Ipswich, which overlooks the area, spotted a person running across fields towards Paper Mill Lane. Officers on the ground were alerted and detained a 17-year-old boy, Nelson Smith, in the vicinity at around 1.35pm on the day of the incident. An abandoned knife, later identified as the murder weapon, was located in undergrowth near to where Smith was arrested.

Following an extensive investigation by the Joint Norfolk and Suffolk Major Investigation Team Smith was charged on Saturday 10 December with the murder of both men.

Detective Chief Inspector Caroline Millar said: “This was an isolated incident on West Meadows following a dispute on the site, with devastating consequences.

“I would like to thank the community for their assistance throughout this investigation, the officers in the case and the Crown Prosecution Team for their hard work in pursuit of the truth and justice.”
