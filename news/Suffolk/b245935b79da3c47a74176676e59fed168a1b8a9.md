Police are appealing for information after an incident in Ipswich.

Officers were called to the junction of Dombey Road and Dickens Road at around 12.55pm on Sunday 27 May to reports of an assault.

In what is believed to be a targeted attack, a man who was driving a grey Seat car was attacked by four males who got out of a white Mercedes with baseball bats and a machete.

The victim received cuts to his right thumb, left foot and right calf, which required hospital treatment.

The driver of the Mercedes is described as a white male, 5ft 10in tall, of average build with short, mousy brown hair. He was wearing a white t-shirt and dark jeans. One of the other males was described as wearing a black t-shirt with a white panel containing wording on the back. Another male was wearing a black t-shirt and was carrying a black pole similar in size to a baseball bat.

After the attack it is believed the Mercedes was driven towards London Road where it turned right.

Police are appealing to anyone who has information relating to the incident to contact Suffolk Police on 101 quoting crime reference 37/28925/18. Alternatively, they can call the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
