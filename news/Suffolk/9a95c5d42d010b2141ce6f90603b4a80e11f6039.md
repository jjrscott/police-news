Police are appealing for witnesses to an incident of arson in Ipswich.

Officers were called to an address in Fircroft Road at approximately 4:45am this morning, Thursday 26 October, following reports a parked car was on fire.

The vehicle – a red Ford Fiesta – is believed to have been stolen from outside an address in Henley Road and police are linking this to a second theft of a vehicle from the same location, a black Ford Focus, which was recovered undamaged in Dales Road.

Officers are carrying out enquiries to determine the circumstances of what happened and are appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the theft, or saw any suspicious activity, to contact Suffolk Police on 101 and quote crime reference 69549/17.
