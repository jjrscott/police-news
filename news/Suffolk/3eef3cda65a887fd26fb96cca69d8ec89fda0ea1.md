Suffolk Police are advising members of the public to consider the security of their sheds following a recent rise in in burglaries in and around Ipswich, which have occurred mainly around the central and east areas of the town.

Since the beginning of April, there have been over 40 such incidents, whereby expensive items such as power tools, fishing equipment, golfing equipment, cycles and gardening equipment have been stolen.

In a high proportion of these crimes, hinges have been unscrewed and or locks forced. However, in some incidents some sheds have been in a poor state of repair or left insecure.

The following steps will help to ensure that your shed and contents stay secure:

 * **Fittings should be bolted through the door and reinforced at the back** with a steel plate or washer; hasps should have concealed screws.

 * **Fit good locks to all doors**. Padlocks should be at least 6cm/2.5 ins wide, hardened steel, have at least 5 pins and be closed shackle.

 * **Make sure that the shed is in good condition.** Weaknesses such as rotten wood or holes in the doors or windows will be an easy access point for a burglar, even if there are good locks on the doors.

 * **Consider fitting an alarm** or investigating if your house alarm can be extended to cover the sheds/garage.

 * **Secure items within the shed.** Lock items to each other with a quality lock or secure them to a fixed point in the floor.

 * Make sure that the boundary fence is in good order, at least six foot high and check that gates are locked.

 * Use dusk to dawn security lights around the shed.

 * Security mark property and register it on www.immobilise.com.

If you see or hear anything suspicious, especially at night, please call the Police immediately on 101 or 999 if a crime is in progress.

For additional advice please contact your local Safer Neighbourhood Team (SNT) on 101.
