Police are appealing for witnesses following an incident involving a dog in Lowestoft.

The incident occurred at some point between 12.45pm and 1pm on Tuesday 7 April in Pakefield Park, Laxfield Way.

A woman and her two children were walking in the park when a dog, which was off the lead, approached the woman and bit her on her bottom, drawing blood. The dog owner didn’t make any attempt to speak to the woman.

As a result of the incident, the woman and her children were left shaken.

The dog is believed to have belonged to a female who had with her a number of other dogs on a lead in the park.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Suffolk police, quoting crime reference: 37/20270/20
