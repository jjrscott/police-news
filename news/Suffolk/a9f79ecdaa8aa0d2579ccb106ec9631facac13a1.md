A 30-year-old man from Newmarket has been jailed after being convicted of motoring offences in the town.

Joe Ebsworth, of Churchill Court, appeared before Ipswich Magistrates’ Court on Monday 13 November, where he pleaded guilty to driving whilst disqualified and driving without insurance.

This relates to an incident which occurred at around 2.10pm on Saturday 11 November, when officers out on patrol witnessed Ebsworth driving a Ford Focus car carrying two passengers on Elizabeth Avenue.

The officers suspected that Ebsworth was a disqualified driver and around 25 minutes later the car returned to the address it had been seen leaving from and he was arrested.

Subsequent checks by the officers confirmed that he was both driving without a licence and without insurance.

Ebsworth was sentenced to 20 weeks’ imprisonment, disqualified from driving for five years, fined £100, and ordered to pay a Victim Surcharge of £115 and costs of £85.

PC Jake Lees of the West Scorpion Team, said: "I am pleased by the sentence handed down by the court, as drivers who do not hold a licence and are uninsured pose a significant danger to other road users.

"The court justified the handing down of a 20-week prison term as a direct consequence of the large number of similar offences he has committed and the fact that on this occasion he was also carrying passengers.

"I hope this sends out a clear message to people who continually flout motoring laws that they face the prospect of custodial sentences, rather than just losing their driving licence.”
