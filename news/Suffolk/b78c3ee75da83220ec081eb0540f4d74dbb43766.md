Police are appealing for information after a man in his 60s was robbed in the Ranelagh Road area of Ipswich yesterday.

The man was walking along a path towards the back of the bingo hall around 5.55pm yesterday, Tuesday 2 August, when he was approached and surrounded by three boys. They tried to take his wallet and he fell and ended up on the ground. A fourth youth then joined the three and the offenders took his white Samsung phone in a black leather effect flip wallet before fleeing towards Ranelagh Road. One of them rode off on a dark coloured mountain bike.

All are described as being of mixed race appearance with dark hair.

One of the offenders is described as being around 10–12 years old, just under 5ft tall and of slim build, another was slightly older, possibly around 13-14, slightly taller at just over 5ft, of slim build, while the third was around 15-17, about 5ft 7ins- 5ft 8ins tall and was of broader build than the others and was wearing a dark shirt and blue jeans.

The fourth youth who joined them appeared to be around 18-years-old and was around 5ft 10ins – 6ft tall, of slim build and was wearing a white T-shirt.

Police are asking anyone who may have seen the incident or the boys in the area around this time to come forward. Anyone who can help or anyone with information about who the boys are should call Ipswich CID by dialling Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting crime number 48067/16. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers, anonymously if required, on 0800 555 111.
