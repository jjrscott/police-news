Police are appealing for help in tracing a Hollesley Bay prisoner who has absconded.

24-year-old Timothy Stone-Parker was found to be missing from the prison at around 6.30pm hours on Wednesday 5 August.

Initial enquiries have failed to locate Stone-Parker, who is serving a six and half year sentence for conspiracy to commit burglary.

He is described as white, 5ft 8 inches tall, brown hair, green eyes and is clean shaven. He has a scar on the left side of his face.

Stone-Parker has connections to Cambridgeshire.

Police are asking anyone who may have seen him or anyone with information about where he is to contact police on 101. You should not approach him or take any further action.
