Police are appealing for information and reminding members of the public to remain vigilant after a robbery in Ipswich.

The incident occurred at around 3am on Sunday 29 April in Woodbridge Road.

The victim, a 24-year-old man, walked onto the road from around the side of the old Odeon cinema and when he was immediately behind it, he became aware of a group of five males near the bus stop on the opposite side of the road.

One of these males then crossed the road and began walking with the victim, trying to engage him in conversation. The victim then became aware that the group were following behind, so fearing for his safety he began to run away.

At a point between the pedestrian crossing near Christchurch Street and the junction with Argyle Street, the offenders caught up with him and he was punched to the head before being threatened with a knife. They demanded that he gave them his phone and money, which he handed over, and they then ran away down the hill.

The suspects are described as speaking with a foreign accent.

Members of the public are advised to avoid walking alone late at night and to stay in groups where possible. Plan your journey home and try to use a taxi or arrange for a lift where possible.

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to contact South CID at Landmark House on 101 quoting reference 23053/18, or alternatively contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
