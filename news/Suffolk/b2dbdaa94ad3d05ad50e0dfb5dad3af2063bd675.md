Detectives are still searching for the mother of a newborn baby girl whose body was found in Needham Market just over seven months ago.

Officers were called shortly after 3pm on Thursday 14 May, to Sackers recycling centre in Ipswich Road, where the body of the baby girl was discovered.

It is believed she was taken to Sackers on the same day within one of two waste collection vehicles that collected commercial waste throughout the day from 52 different locations.

As part of the complex investigation, officers reviewed more than 11,000 hours of CCTV footage and visited over 800 addresses.

A comprehensive search was undertaken at Sackers recycling centre, during which a number of items were seized. However, following analysis, the items did not provide any further answers in the search for the parents of this baby girl.

A Home Office post-mortem was held on Tuesday 19 May, with the initial findings proving to be undetermined pending further investigations, which are continuing but will take more time.

DI Karl Nightingale said: "We are still investigating the tragic circumstances that led to this newborn baby girl being found.

“Although it has been just over seven months since she was found, we want to reassure everyone that we are doing all we can; remaining determined and hopeful of identifying her parents.

“We know that Christmas can be an extremely difficult time for anyone who has been affected by the loss of a baby and we are continuing to urge her mother and father to come forward so they can gain the support they need.

“We are repeating our previous plea for anyone with information about the baby girl’s death to come forward, however difficult this may be. This is information could be vital and may help us piece together the identity of this newborn baby.”

Detectives searching for the mother of a newborn baby girl whose body was found in Needham Market four months ago have completed their initial viewing of the CCTV gathered.

Officers were called shortly after 3pm on Thursday 14 May, to Sackers recycling centre in Ipswich Road, Needham Market, where the body of the baby girl, knowns as Baby S was discovered. It is believed she was taken to Sackers on 14 May within one of two waste collection vehicles that collected commercial waste throughout the day from 52 different locations.

As part of the enquiry, officers secured more than 11,000 hours of CCTV footage from areas in and around the bin locations, visiting over 800 addresses and premises. All the footage has been reviewed from midnight of 12 May through to the time when the bin was collected at each location on 14 May.

A comprehensive search was undertaken at Sackers recycling centre, during which a number of items were seized. However, following a review and analysis of these they have not assisted in identifying the parents to Baby S.

A Home Office post-mortem was held on Tuesday 19 May, with the initial findings proving to be undetermined pending further investigations, which are continuing.

DI Karl Nightingale said: "There are still active lines of enquiry to pursue as part of a major investigation we are conducting and we remain determined to finding answers to this tragic incident. We have preserved a vast amount of CCTV and conducted house-to-house enquiries to maximise the evidence gathered and prevent loss of potentially key evidence.

"Unfortunately, we cannot specify the location where this little baby girl was left prior to being conveyed to Sackers. We are still trying to establish if Baby S died before being left at one of the collections sites and examinations in relation to this remain ongoing with support from medical experts. It is anticipated these will still take many weeks.

"We’d repeat our previous plea for anyone with knowledge to come forward and help us piece together the identity of Baby S and her parents. It may be difficult to come forward with information, particularly if you have concerns about a family member or friend, but if you know who this baby girl is and how she came to be placed into a bin, I urge you to come forward and help us as soon as possible please.”

## Previous release I 11 June 2020

A senior police officer is urging the public to come forward with any information which may help identify a newborn baby girl whose body was discovered four weeks ago.

Officers were called shortly after 3pm on Thursday 14 May, to Sackers recycling centre in Ipswich Road, Needham Market, where the body of the baby girl was found.

It is believed she was taken to Sackers on 14 May within one of two waste collection vehicles that collected commercial waste throughout the day from 52 different locations. Maps marking those locations are provided.

As part of the investigation, officers have now visited more than 830 residential addresses or business premises near to the collection sites to gain further information. CCTV footage has also been collected from within these areas and is under review.

Officers will be displaying further posters nearby to the 52 commercial waste pick-up locations in an effort to encourage anyone with information to come forward.

Detectives believe information from the public will be vital in identifying the baby girl.

A Home Office post-mortem was held on Tuesday 19 May, with the initial findings proving to be undetermined pending further investigations, which will take some time.

An extensive search was undertaken at Sackers, which concluded on Wednesday 3 June. A number of items were seized and are subject to ongoing review and analysis.

Chief Superintendent Tonya Antonis said: “Four weeks ago today, the body of a baby girl was tragically found at the recycling centre. Since then, we have been trying to identify her but we need further help from the public.

“We believe this newborn girl was placed into a commercial bin at one of 52 waste pick-up locations. She was left there before being collected by a waste collection lorry on Thursday 14 May. It is likely the baby girl was placed into the bin on 13 or 14 May.

“While we continue to review hundreds of hours of CCTV footage, we are appealing to anyone who may have seen anything unusual or have any information, however limited, to come forward.
“During the past four weeks, we have carried out many enquiries and have been working closely with partner agencies to gain further information that may help us identify the baby girl but this has so far proved unsuccessful.

“It may be difficult to come forward with information, particularly if you have concerns about a family member or friend, but if you know who this baby girl is and how she came to be placed into a bin, I urge you to come forward and help us as soon as possible please.”
