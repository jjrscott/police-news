Police investigating the theft of six vehicles from a business in Claydon have arrested two men.

Officers were called at 5.45am, this morning, Tuesday 18 December to reports of a burglary in progress at Claydon Autos, Ipswich Road. Entry had been forced to the premises and keys to a number of cars removed and the vehicles then taken from the car park.

Police were quickly dispatched and located a Kia Sportage car, believed to be one of the vehicles stolen, being driven in the Whitton area of Ipswich. Officers attempted to stop the vehicle and two males decamped from the car and ran from the scene. A short time later a 23-year-old man and a 27-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of burglary and theft of motor vehicles. Both were brought to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre where they will be questioned by detectives.

Two further stolen vehicles, a blue Ford B-Max, and a black Nissan Juke have now been located in Ipswich today.

Three vehicles remain outstanding - an orange Ford Fiesta (AY66 WCN), a white BMW 1 series (YB15 ZRE) and a yellow Ford Focus (no index plates) Witnesses to the incident or anybody who has information as to the whereabouts of the cars not located are asked to call South CID on 101 quoting reference 37/72901/18.
