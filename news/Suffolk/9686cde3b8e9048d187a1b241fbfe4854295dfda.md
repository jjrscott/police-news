Police are appealing for information after a woman was assaulted in Ipswich.

In the early hours of Sunday morning (Sunday 1 October), at some point between 2.20am and 2.30am, a woman in her 40s was walking along Handford Road close to the car park when an offender grabbed her from behind by the cardigan.

After a short altercation, the woman fell to the floor and managed to run away. The offender followed the victim for a short way along Handford Road and Elliot Street but then left the scene.

The offender is described as a white male, 5 feet 6 inches tall, bald head, clean shaven and mid to late 30s. He is of stocky build and was wearing a plain red hooded jumper with a white round neck t-shirt underneath and dark jeans.

Anyone with any information should contact Suffolk Police on **101** quoting crime number 37/64350/17.
