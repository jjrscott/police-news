Police are appealing for witnesses to a robbery in Lowestoft.

The incident took place on London Road North in the town at about 3.30pm on Friday 13 July.

An 18 year old male was approached by two girls who made threats to him with a small knife and told him to remove his clothes and handover his clothes which he did.
The two suspects then fled the scene, while the victim was shaken but unhurt in the incident.

A 15 year old teenage girl was arrested on suspicion of robbery later the same day and taken to Great Yarmouth Police investigation Centre for questioning. She released on police bail pending further enquiries.

Anyone who witnessed the incident, saw any suspicious activity or has knowledge of the incident should contact Lowestoft on 101 quoting crime reference 37/39043/18.
