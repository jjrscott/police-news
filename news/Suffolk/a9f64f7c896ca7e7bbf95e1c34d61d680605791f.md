One man has been arrested on suspicion of cannabis production after police uncovered two cannabis factories at two addresses in Ipswich, yesterday, Monday 5 March.

Officers from the Ipswich East Safer Neighbourhood Team carried out a warrant under the Misuse of Drugs Act and discovered approximately 200 cannabis plants growing on the first floor of a property in Parliament Road. Electricity had also been abstracted with damage caused to the property in order to build a cannabis factory. Class A drugs were also found during the search.

A 42-year old man, from Ipswich, was subsequently arrested on suspicion of the production of cannabis, criminal damage, abstracting electricity and for possession of a Class A drug. He was taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning where he currently remains.

Officers then searched another property in Braeburn Close, sometime later, where an additional cannabis factory was found and approximately 400 plants were recovered.
