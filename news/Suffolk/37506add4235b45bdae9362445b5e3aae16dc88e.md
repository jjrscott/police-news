Police are appealing for witnesses to a robbery that took place in Ipswich.

It happened yesterday (Thursday 15 March) on Raeburn Road shortly after 8.30pm.

The male victim, aged 17, was walking down the road when he was approached by an unknown offender who asked for his wallet. The victim gave it to the offender, who then looked through and took a bank card. The offender has then asked the victim to come and take money out of a cashpoint. The victim then punched the offender in the face, the victim then grabbed his wallet and ran away.

The victim saw what he believed to be a knife handle in the pocket of the offender and he would use it if he did not comply with the offender’s demand. There was no attempt to use it during the incident and it remained in the suspect’s pocket.

The offender is described as a white male, in his early 20s, about five foot nine inches tall, of skinny and athletic build, was wearing a grey hooded top with the hood up, and also wore a black item of clothing covering the lower part of his face. He also wore baggy tracksuit bottoms with three white stripes down the outside of both legs. His trainers, described as an Addidas brand, had a white sole, grey toe material and black plastic detailing. He also had gloves on both hands, although on the right one there appeared to be a black fingerless glove.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or saw any suspicious activity in relation to the incident should contact Ipswich CID on 101, quoting crime reference 37/14278/18 or alternatively contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
