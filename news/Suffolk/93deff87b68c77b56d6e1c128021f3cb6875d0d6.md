Two teenagers have been arrested after a takeaway delivery driver had his car stolen in Felixstowe.

Police were called at around 9.20pm on Monday 10 October to reports that the victim had been approached by two males and one female whilst in his car – a Peugeot 308 – in Undercliff Road West.

One of the suspects then snatched the keys out of the ignition and the three then walked off. They then returned a short while later and took the car, with the victim being assaulted in the process. A witness who had attempted to intervene was also threatened.

Officers attended the area to search for the vehicle and it was located in Candlet Road and a short pursuit ensued, ending in Manor Terrace at around 9.55pm where the stolen vehicle collided with a police car.

Two people were arrested following this incident:

 * A 17-year-old boy from Ipswich: arrested on suspicion of aggravated vehicle taking; dangerous driving; driving whilst unfit through drink/drugs; possession of an offensive weapon; robbery; and possessing a drug of class B or C.
 * A 15-year-old boy from Ipswich: arrested on suspicion of aggravated vehicle taking; possession of an offensive weapon; assault causing actual bodily harm; and common assault.

Both boys were questioned by detectives at Martlesham Police Investigation Centre where they have been bailed to return to on Tuesday 15 November pending further enquiries.

Any witnesses are asked to contact Southern Area CID on **101** quoting reference 60190/16.
