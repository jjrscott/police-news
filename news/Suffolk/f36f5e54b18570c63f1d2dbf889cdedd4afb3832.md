Police arrested a man last night in connection with an attempted burglary at a business premises in Bury St Edmunds.

Officers were called at around 9.45pm on Sunday 14 January to reports of a burglary in progress at a Charged Electric Bike Store, Hillside Road on the Moreton Hall estate.

Offender/s attempted to force entry to the business but nothing was reported to have been stolen. Officers were at the scene quickly but offender/s had fled the address.

The police helicopter was deployed to locate the offender/s. At around 10.45pm officers from Cambridgeshire Police brought a van to a stop by the use of a stinger device at the Spittals Interchange on the A14. A man in his twenties from the West Midlands was then arrested in connection with the attempted burglary.

The man will be brought to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre today to be questioned by detectives.
