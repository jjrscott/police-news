Six people arrested in connection with an incident in Newmarket where two people were stabbed have now all been released from police custody pending further enquiries.

Officers were called at 12.15am yesterday morning, Tuesday 22 August, to reports that two people had been assaulted in Green Road.

A teenage boy had sustained a single puncture wound to his back and a man in his 20s suffered a head injury and slash wounds to his back and leg. They were taken to hospital and have since been discharged after receiving treatment for their injuries.

Following initial police enquiries, six people were arrested in connection with this incident and taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre for questioning.

Three of these arrests were made by officers after they attended an address in Bill Rickaby Drive:

 * A 28-year-old woman from Newmarket, arrested on suspicion of being concerned in supplying a controlled drug. She has been released on bail until Friday 15 September
 * A 28-year-old man from Newmarket, arrested as he was wanted on recall to prison. He has now been returned to the prison system.

The details of the other three arrests are as follows:

 * A 23-year-old man from Colchester (not from London as previously publicised), arrested on suspicion of being concerned in supplying a controlled drug; obstructing police; and driving offences. He has been released under investigation.
 * A 20-year-old man from London, arrested on suspicion of being concerned in supplying a controlled drug. He has been released on bail until Tuesday 12 September.
 * A 16-year-old boy from London, arrested on suspicion being concerned in supplying a controlled drug; and possession of an offensive weapon. He has been released on bail until Tuesday 12 September.
