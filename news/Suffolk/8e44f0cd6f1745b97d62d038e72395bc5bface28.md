A 23-year-old man is due to appear in court this morning charged with possession of crack cocaine with intent to supply after he was arrested in Ipswich yesterday.

Officers went to an address in Samuel Court yesterday afternoon, Thursday 22 June, and detained two men for searches. A quantity of class A drugs and cash were both found at the property.

Michael Walsh, 23, of Eleanor Cross Road, Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, has now been charged with possession of crack cocaine with intent to supply and he has been detained to appear before Ipswich Magistrates Court this morning, Friday 23 June.

The second man, a 42-year-old from Ipswich, has been released under investigation for being concerned in the supply of controlled drugs.
