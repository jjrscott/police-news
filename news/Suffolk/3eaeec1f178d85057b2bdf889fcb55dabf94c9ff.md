Police are appealing for witnesses following a road traffic collision in Wherstead last month.

Emergency services were called at around 11.55pm on Thursday 20 April to reports of a single-vehicle collision on the A137, between the junctions with White Horse Hill and Valley Lane.

The vehicle – a blue Mitsubishi Evo – was travelling northbound from the direction of Tattingstone towards Ipswich, when it collided with a tree and went into a ditch.

There were four people in the car at the time of the collision and the driver and front seat passenger were trapped and had to be cut out.

The driver – a man aged in his 20s – sustained a serious and potentially life-changing leg injury, with the front seat passenger suffering a broken arm. The two other passengers had minor injuries only.

Officers would like to hear from any witnesses who may have seen the car immediately prior to, or at the time of the collision.

Anyone with information is asked to call the Police Headquarters Roads Policing Unit on 101 quoting reference CAD 536 of 20 April.
