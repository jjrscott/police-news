Police investigating an incident of assault in Ipswich are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At around 6:20am on Friday 18 November, a 40-year-old man was walking his dog on a path that runs alongside the River Gipping, off London Road, when he was approached by another man.

The suspect initially asked after the breed of dog before punching and kicking the victim who sustained a lump to his forehead. The dog was not injured.

The suspect is described as a white man, in his late 20s to 30s and of slim build. He was wearing black boots and carrying a Bluetooth speaker.

Anyone with information about the assault is asked to contact the Ipswich Neighbourhood Response Team on **101** , quoting reference 66889/16.
