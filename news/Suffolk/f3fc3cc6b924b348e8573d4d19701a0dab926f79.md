Police are appealing for witnesses following a burglary in Ipswich.

The incident occurred between 9am on Monday 17 September and 8.30pm on Monday 24 September at a property in Felixstowe Road.

At some point during the dates stated, unknown offender/s forced entry by smashing a skylight and once inside, an untidy search was carried out. A quantity of collectable coins and a large safe containing personal documents of great sentimental value, cash and jewellery were stolen.

Officers are keen to hear from anyone who recognises the safe or who may have heard or seen anything between Monday 17 September and Monday 24 September.

Anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity or who has any information about the crime is asked to contact Suffolk police on 101 quoting reference 55110/18.

Alternatively, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org
