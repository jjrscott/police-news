Residents living in West Ipswich will get the chance to meet their local police officers next week, Wednesday 5 October, as part of a new fortnightly Police Advice Surgery launched earlier this month.

The event will take place in a mobile police station, which will be visiting Garrick Way between 11am and 2pm. Residents are invited to attend, meet officers from the West Ipswich Safer Neighbourhood Team (SNT) and air any concerns they may have within their community.

SNT Police Sergeant Alisa Newman said: "Following the success of our first two surgeries, we will continue to hold them on every 1st Wednesday of the month at various locations across West Ipswich. It is an informal, drop-in surgery for anyone who wishes to stop and have a chat.

"We are striving to achieve greater confidence from the public and find out what’s important to local communities. By holding these Police Advice Surgeries across the area, we hope to be able to meet more local residents at a time that is convenient to them and allow them to have a say. Police work closely with partner agencies to address local concerns and we will be working with them to hopefully resolve any issues raised.”

The Police Advice Surgery dates and opening times may vary each month and will be advertised in advance on Suffolk Police Facebook and Twitter pages.
