Police are issuing an E-fit likeness of a man they would like to trace following a serious sexual assault in Ipswich.

The incident took place at around 2am on Sunday 22 May in Orford Street. The victim, a man aged in his twenties, was approached by another man who sexually assaulted him.

The victim has been supported by specialist officers as police have continued efforts to identify the offender. This has included forensic work, along with CCTV and house to house enquiries in the vicinity of the attack. Officers also spoke to a number of people during anniversary checks one week on from the incident, which took place between 12.20am and 2.30am on Sunday 29 May.

Detectives would like to speak to the man pictured in the E-fit. He is described as white, 5ft 7in tall, of large build, with dark hair which was very short at the back and sides and slightly spikey on top. He was wearing dark jeans and a t-shirt and spoke with a local accent.

> #### Detective Inspector Kevin Hayward, of the Major Investigation Team, said: "The anniversary checks carried-out at the weekend unfortunately did not provide us with any new lines of enquiry, so we are hopeful that this E-fit will assist with the investigation.
>
> #### "We continue to appeal for any witnesses to this attack to come forward, or anyone who believes they may know the man pictured in the E-fit.

Anyone who with information about this incident, is asked to contact the Major Investigation Team on **101** quoting reference 34489/16, or Crimestoppers anonymously on **0800 555 111**.
