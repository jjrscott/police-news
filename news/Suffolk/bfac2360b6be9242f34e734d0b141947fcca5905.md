A 21-year-old man has been charged in connection with a burglary that took place in Lowestoft.

The incident occurred between Tuesday 28 August and Saturday 1 September at an address in Hillcrest Drive.

Entry was gained by smashing the glass in the front door and items including cash, jewellery, old coins, a laptop and a carriage clock were stolen from inside.

Zak Adams of Bridge Road, Lowestoft, was arrested by officers investigating this crime on Sunday 16 September and taken to Great Yarmouth Police Investigation Centre for questioning.

Adams was subsequently charged with burglary the following day and was remanded in custody.

He appeared before Norwich Magistratesâ€™ Court yesterday (Tuesday 18 September) and was remanded, pending a further court appearance.
