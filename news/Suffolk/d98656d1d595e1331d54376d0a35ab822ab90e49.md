Police are appealing for witnesses after three vehicles were damaged or interfered with in Bures.

At some point between noon on Wednesday 20 May and 3.20pm on Wednesday 24 June, car valves were either interfered with or damaged while the vehicles were parked in Church Square.

A tyre was also damaged when it was driven on after deflating.

Officers would like to issue a reminder that tampering with vehicles is extremely dangerous and could result in a serious accident.
