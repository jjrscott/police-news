Police are investigating after part of a cashpoint machine was stolen from the Esso garage at The Street in Great Barton.

Officers were alerted around 3.45am this morning, Wednesday 19 April, to reports a group of people appeared to be pulling out the stand alone ATM at the garage and a 4X4 vehicle was leaving the scene. The vehicle appeared to have a spare tyre on the back.

Police attended and found part of the cashpoint has been stolen. It appears the vehicle was used to pull the top part of the machine out.

At this stage itâ€™s not known how much cash was in the part of the machine they took, however considerable damage was caused.

An investigation is underway and officers are asking anyone who may have seen anything in the area in around this time, or a 4X4 vehicle on the roads in the area in the early hours, to call Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting crime number 29715/17.
