Police are appealing for information following a distraction burglary at a home in Ipswich.

The incident happened around midday on Thursday, 22 September, in the Tern Road area. A woman in her 70s was in her kitchen when she became aware of a woman standing in the hallway. The woman, who was not known to the resident, said she was from the council and engaged her in conversation for a few minutes. The resident felt uncomfortable with the situation and, after the woman left, she checked her handbag and found a quantity of cash had been stolen.

It’s thought a second person had entered the woman’s home while she had been distracted, made a search and stole the money.

Police are investigating the incident and are looking to trace the woman who is described as white, in her late 20s or older, with brown hair, much of which was hidden under a headscarf she was wearing. She also wore glasses, was smartly dressed with an overcoat and is described as being of chubby appearance.

Anyone who saw the woman, or two people, in the area around this time on Thursday, or anyone with information about the incident or those involved should contact Ipswich CID by dialling Suffolk Police on **101** quoting reference 56853/16.
