It follows a warrant conducted at a property under the Misuse of Drugs Act on Monday 7 January. Upon entry into the premises, a quantity of cannabis plants were found in the garage and quantities of herbal cannabis were found inside of the property.

A man was subsequently arrested and taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre for questioning.

Stewart Devere Hunt of Carson’s Drive in Great Cornard in Sudbury was subsequently charged with producing cannabis. He was also charged with one count of impersonating a police officer. This follows an incident on 13 November 2018 where a phone call was made by Devere Hunt to his neighbour’s work and posing as a police officer, stated a work van had been crashed.

He appeared before Ipswich Magistrates Court on Wednesday January 9 and was given a suspended sentence of four months, suspended for 12 months.
