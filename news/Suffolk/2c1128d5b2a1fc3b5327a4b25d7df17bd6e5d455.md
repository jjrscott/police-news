Police are appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Ipswich.

The incident took place in St Matthews Street between 9.30pm and 9.35pm on Friday 12 July.

The victim – a woman aged in her 50s – was waiting at a bus stop outside of a Chinese restaurant when an unknown male approached her and asked her for a cigarette, a £1 and to use her mobile phone, among other questions. The woman said no to all of his requests.

At this point, the male asked the woman for the time and the woman got out her mobile phone in order to show the male the screen. He then pushed the victim and grabbed the mobile phone – a pink and purple Samsung S9 - before running off in the direction of Benezet Street.

The suspect is described as male, 5ft 5ins, aged between 16 and 19 years of age, clean shaven, of a slim build, with short brown hair, an olive complexion and he spoke with a foreign, possibly an Eastern European, accent. He was wearing a white t-shirt and khaki green trousers.

Anyone with any information about this incident is asked to contact South CID quoting crime reference 37/40919/19
