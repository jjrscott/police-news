Police are appealing for witnesses or information after two vans were stolen in Ipswich last week.

At just after 01.00am in the early hours of Thursday 7 February, two Mercedes Sprinter vans and trailers that were parked on Cottingham Road on the outskirts of the town were stolen. The vans and their trailers were full of household waste.

One of the vans was recovered later the same day in Essex but the other van is still outstanding. The hire van is white with distinctive branding and www.loadgodisposable.co.uk logo. The trailer carried the wording ‘Site Clearance – Digger Work’. At the time it was stolen the van was displaying the registration index plate KU18FHN.

Witnesses or anybody who has any information regarding the whereabouts of the van and trailer is asked to call Suffolk Police on 101, quoting reference 37/7479/19. Alternatively, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
