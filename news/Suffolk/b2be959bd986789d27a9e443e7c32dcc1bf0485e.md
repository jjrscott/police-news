Police are appealing for witnesses after an incident in Ipswich in which three females were injured.

Officers were called by the East of England Ambulance Service at just after 6:30pm tonight, Sunday 13 December, to an incident on Grafton Way, opposite Cardinal Park. It was reported that some large fencing on a site had fallen onto three female pedestrians causing serious injuries.

All three have been taken to Ipswich Hospital by ambulance. None of the injuries are thought to be life changing or life-threatening at this time.

Police are investigating the circumstances of the incident and enquiries are continuing.

The road will remain closed for the next few hours and motorists are asked to find alternative routes.

Witnesses or anybody who was driving along Grafton Way around 6:30pm and who may have relevant dash-cam footage are asked to contact Ipswich CID quoting CAD 258 of 13 December.
