A 70-year-old woman who died at a property in Rattlesden on Monday has been formally named as Beryl Mary Taylor.

Police were called to an address in Birds Green around 12.30pm on Monday, 11 July, following the death of Mrs Taylor, who is believed to have been known as Mary.

A Home Office post mortem examination was carried out yesterday, Tuesday 12 July, and further tests will now be required to confirm the cause of death.

A 73-year-old man was initially arrested on suspicion of assisting a suicide. He was taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre as enquiries were made into what had happened. He was then further arrested on suspicion of murder.

The 73-year-old was interviewed and has now been bailed to return to police on August 24 to allow further enquiries to be carried out.
