Officers are appealing for witnesses after a serious collision which took place on the B1119, north of Parham at around 6.30pm on Friday 6 July.

A motorcycle travelling towards Saxmundham collided with a tractor that was travelling from Cransford towards Parham. The tractor was pulling a custom trailer containing a combine harvester.

The motorcyclist, a man in his 20’s, was taken to Addenbrooke’s hospital having sustained severe facial injuries and spinal fractures. He remains in hospital in a critical but stable condition.

Witnesses or anybody who may have dash-cam footage of the incident or the manner of driving of either vehicle prior to the collision are asked to call Police on 101 quoting reference CAD 335 of 6 July.
