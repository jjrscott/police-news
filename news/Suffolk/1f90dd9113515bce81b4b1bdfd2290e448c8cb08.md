Police are appealing for witnesses after three thefts in the Ipswich and Martlesham areas on Tuesday 16 January

The first incident (crime reference 37/3157/18) took place on Tuesday 16 January at 11am on London Road at Lidl where the victim, a woman in her late 70s, was shopping. Some tinned items fell to the floor and an unknown male has helped her after which she has found that her purse has been stolen,

The following steps may help you protect your purse, wallet or bag from thieves:

Keep your bag closed and close to you at all times if possible with the opening towards your body.

Try not to overload yourself with bags and coats.

Avoid carrying your wallet or purse in a back trouser pocket.

Keep cash secure and out of sight

When you put money in your handbag, don’t let people see where you put it – especially when you are using an ATM.

Do not leave your handbag, pushchair or shopping trolley unattended.
