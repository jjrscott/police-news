A man has been arrested in connection with money laundering and drug-driving offences, after police stopped a car in Kesgrave.

Just before 9.45pm last night, Wednesday 10 February, officers from the Roads and Armed Policing Team who were out on patrol had cause to request a Vauxhall Astra to stop on Main Road.

The driver failed a roadside drug wipe - testing positive for cocaine - and following searches conducted as a result of this, officers seized a large quantity of cash.

A 29-year-old man from Ipswich was subsequently arrested on suspicion of drug-driving and money laundering.

He was taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre, where he currently remains for questioning.
