Police are urging residents to be vigilant after a distraction burglary that took place in Mildenhall.

It occurred at a property on Wake Avenue in the town yesterday (Monday 7 January) at about 12.20pm where a man claimed to the elderly couple who lived at the property that his dog was lost.

The suspect entered the property via an insecure door and made a search of the address whilst the occupant sat in the living room.

He proceeded to steal a quantity of cash and items of jewellery from the property.

The suspect is described as a white male, clean shaven, dressed all in blue, of slim build and possibly wearing gloves.

Anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity at around the time stated in the area, has knowledge of the incident or has knowledge of a similar incident recently should contact Bury St Edmunds CID on 101, quoting crime reference 37/1280/19.

Alternatively, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.

The forceâ€™s a new crime prevention initiative, known as 1st Principle, which highlights that simple, inexpensive measures can easily be undertaken by anyone in the community. Further tips and guidance on how to deal with cold callers or rogue traders can be found here
