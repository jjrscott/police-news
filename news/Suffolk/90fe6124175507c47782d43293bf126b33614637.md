Police are appealing for information following a theft from a lorry on the A12, parked on the Southbound carriageway in a layby area between Capel St. Mary and East Bergholt.

On Monday 11 July, between 1am and 5am, offenders accessed the lorry by damaging the fabric side of the trailer. A number of aluminium bars were removed from the side of the lorry and a large quantity of packages containing clothes taken from within the vehicle.

The missing clothing is thought to be around 60 to 70 packages containing mens’ jumpers, with labels inside featuring the brand name "Pescecane Rosso” and an image of a red shark.

Police would like to speak to anyone who may have witnessed this incident, or who may have been offered any men’s jumpers matching this description for sale.

Anyone with any information should contact Suffolk Police on **101** or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on **0800 555 111.**
