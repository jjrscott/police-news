Officers are appealing for witnesses or information following a robbery in Haverhill.

The incident took place on Mill Road in the town on Friday 19 January at around 10.30am.

A woman pedestrian, in her eighties was approached by a man who pushed her against a wall and stole her handbag. The offender then fled the scene, possibly in the direction of Chauntry Road or Camps Road. The suspect is described as a person, 5’7” tall wearing a brown coat or hooded top. The Marks & Spencer carrier bag contained a brown purse described as of Spanish design. The purse had reward cards and cash inside.

The woman sustained a sore shoulder and was very shaken as a result of the incident.
