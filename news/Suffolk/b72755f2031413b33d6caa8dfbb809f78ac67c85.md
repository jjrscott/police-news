Police are appealing for witnesses to an incident in Ipswich that took place in the Belstead Road area of town last Friday (8 March).

Officers were called at 3.50pm by a member of the public reporting they had seen someone walking down Belstead Road with what they believed to be a gun in their hand which they pointed at their vehicle.
