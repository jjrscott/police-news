## Previous release | Monday 5 November

Suffolk Police are appealing for help in tracing a missing 30-year-old man from Gisleham, near Lowestoft.

Scott Head was last seen on Friday 2 November at an address in Southwold and was reported missing when he failed to turn up for work on Saturday 3 November.

Scott is a white male, 5 foot 9 inches tall, of medium build and has short, mousey coloured hair. He was last seen wearing a navy blue puffa jacket and jeans, brown boots and was carrying a black satchel and carrier bag.

Officers believe he may have travelled to Norwich on Saturday and are concerned for his welfare.

Anyone with any information should contact Suffolk Police on 101.
