Police are appealing for witnesses and to remain vigilant after a series of metal thefts in the Beccles, Bungay and Debenham areas.

The first was reported at Debenham where around 100kg of copper and 50kg of bronze were stolen from a workshop premises on Kenton Road on Thursday 31 December – the total value stolen was £650. (crime number: 37/75342/20)

On Thursday 7 January at Crowfoot Garden in Beccles at about 2pm there was a report of two males and a female attempting to steal copper cable, although nothing was stolen. A grey/silver Ford Ranger was seen in this incident. (c/n: 37/1092/21)

On the same afternoon police received a report at about 2.25pm of a similar incident on Lower Olland Street in Bungay where two males were seen loading a silver Ford Ranger with copper cable which then drove off, taking approximately 50-100m worth £1,000. (c/n: 37/1085/21)

For guidance on metal theft please read the below:

\- Make your premises secure using gates, fencing and locks and don't leave any scrap materials lying around to tempt thieves
\- Install vandal resistant ‘dawn to dusk’ sensored security lighting and consider installing CCTV
\- Guttering, drainpipes and other climbing aids can be coated in anti-climb paint, which marks clothes and skin, often helping police to identify offenders.
\- Consider using a forensic property marking solution, such as SmartWater or SelectaDNA to security mark your property.

Anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity or knows who was responsible should contact Suffolk police, quoting the relevant crime number.
