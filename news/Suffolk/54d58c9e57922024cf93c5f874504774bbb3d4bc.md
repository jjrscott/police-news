Police are appealing for witnesses and advising van owners to increase vehicle security following seven incidents of theft of power tools from vans in east Ipswich & Felixstowe.

The crimes occurred between 7pm on Monday 27 February and 8.25am on Wednesday 1 March in Selkirk Road, Felixstowe Road, Roundwood Road, Mildmay Road and Nansen Road in Ipswich; and Kiln Field and Grange Farm Avenue in Felixstowe.

It is essential to lock your vehicle at all times, activating the alarm and immobiliser. You may also wish to consider the following additional steps:

• Fitting aftermarket locks and alarms (see www.thatcham.org)

• Secure storage vault within the vehicle.

• Removing tools from the vehicle.

• Overtly marking tools & registering them for FREE at www.immobilise.com

• Parking your vehicle within a secure building or compound.

• Parking your vehicle with the doors against a wall or garage to restrict access.

• Installing CCTV that sends a notification to you when activated.

Officers are keen to hear from anyone who may have noticed any unusual activity or suspicious vehicles in these areas around the times of these incidents. If you have any information, please contact Suffolk Police on 101 or www.suffolk.police.uk using the link ‘report something’.
