Police are appealing for witnesses after a series of motor vehicles were damaged in Lakenheath.

During the early hours of the morning on Monday 30 April, an offender has damaged a number of vehicles parked in several locations around the village.

Details of the incidents are as follows:

• An unknown suspect smashed windows on multiple vehicles in Eriswell Drive. Vehicles included a Chrysler, Ford Transit van, Ford Focus, Lexus and BMW, among others.

• A suspect smashed the front nearside passenger window of a Nissan Qashqai that was parked on the driveway of a property in Victoriana Row. A Ford Focus also had its windscreen smashed, a Toyota had a rear window smashed and a Honda CR-V was damaged.

• A suspect smashed a window of a van that was parked in High Street.

• The rear windscreen of Seat Altea was smashed while it was parked on a driveway in North Road.

• A window of Jeep Cherokee in Back Street was smashed.

• A Volvo was also damaged in Undley on the same day.

Officers investigating the series would like to speak to a male who was seen walking along Eriswell Drive at around 12.30am carrying what was thought to be a baseball bat. He was wearing a black coat with the hood up.

Anyone who witnessed any of the incidents or saw any suspicious behaviour should contact Suffolk police on 101, quoting crime reference 37/23195/18 or call the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
