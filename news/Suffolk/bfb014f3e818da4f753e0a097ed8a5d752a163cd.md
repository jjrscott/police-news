Police are appealing for witnesses after a vehicle failed to stop following a collision in Thorpe Morieux last week.

The incident occurred at around 7pm on Wednesday 22 May in Bury Road between Hitcham and Old Buckenham Hall school.

A black metallic Range Rover was involved in a collision with a bicycle, resulting in a 14-year-old male cyclist being thrown over the bonnet into the road. The boy sustained bruising and other minor injuries.

The car, which was travelling in the direction of Thorpe Morieux, failed to stop and drove away.

The driver is described as female, white, aged between 35 and 40 and with long blonde hair. The Range Rover may have sustained damage to its front offside area.

Police would like to speak to anyone who witnessed the collision or directly after it, or anyone who saw a black Range Rover in Hitcham or Thorpe Morieux between 7pm and 8pm.

Anyone with information should contact PC Ashley Sochon on 101, quoting CAD 72 of 23 May or email [email protected]
