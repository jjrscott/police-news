Police are appealing for witnesses and information after three firearms were stolen during a burglary in Swilland last night.

The break in occurred at some point between 6:45pm and 8pm yesterday, Tuesday 26 September, at a house in a rural location along Clopton Road, north of Tuddenham.

Access to the property was forced, with offenders smashing a window to gain entry, and most rooms were searched.

A gun cabinet was removed from the premises, which contained two shotguns, including a Browning shotgun, and a rifle. A quantity of jewellery and a wallet were also stolen.

Anyone who witnessed the burglary, saw any suspicious activity during the times stated or has knowledge of the current location of the firearms should Ipswich CID at Suffolk Police on 101 quoting crime number 37/63453/17, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 55511.
