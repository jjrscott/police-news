Detectives are continuing to investigate the circumstances surrounding a man who died after being found barely conscious in a field in Bury St Edmunds last week, but have yet to find any evidence to suggest the cause of his death was suspicious.

Police were called by the ambulance service at 9pm on Tuesday 22 August, to reports that a man aged in his 20s had been found barely breathing in a field near to West Suffolk College in Out Risbygate.

The man was taken to West Suffolk Hospital for treatment, but subsequently died on Friday 25 August.

A Home Office post-mortem examination carried-out yesterday, Tuesday 29 August, found the cause of death to be subdural haemorrhage.

At the present time his death is not believed to be as the result of any suspicious circumstances and a file will now be prepared for the coroner.

A 22-year-old woman and a 17-year-old girl, who were both arrested on suspicion of robbery by officers investigating this incident, remain on police bail until Tuesday 19 September pending further enquires.

This relates to the theft of the deceasedâ€™s mobile phone, which is believed to have been stolen from his person at some point on the evening of Tuesday 22 August, prior to his admittance to hospital.

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to contact West CID at Bury St Edmunds Police Station on 101 quoting reference CAD 455 of 22 August.
