Police are appealing for witnesses following a hare coursing and fail to stop incident.

At approximately 12.25pm on Sunday 16 August, a group of males were witnessed hare coursing in a field in Raydon but they then drove away when they were noticed.

Officers attended and pursued the vehicle from Hadleigh to Higham, before the vehicle, a black Mercedes 4X4, was abandoned by the occupants, along with a number of dogs.

Officers managed to restrain two of the dogs but were unable to catch the others. The suspects were also not located.

The first two suspects are described as being two white males with shaved heads. Both males were wearing white t-shirts and blue jeans.

Two other younger males, who with the other two males, possibly teenagers, were wearing yellow t-shirts.

Officers would be keen to speak to anyone who may have captured any dash-cam footage of the pursuit in the Hadleigh area. Particularly, anyone who may have captured the oncoming black Mercedes travelling towards them in the other lane.

Further enquiries still continue to be carried out regarding the dogs and anyone with any information or who may have found a lost dog in the Higham area, is asked to contact police.

Anyone with any information that they believe could assist officers with their enquiries, is asked to contact Pc 1293 Johnson of Hadleigh Safer Neighbourhood Team, quoting crime reference: 37/47456/20
