Police investigating following a fatal collision on the A12 at Martlesham on Thursday are appealing for the driver of a slate grey 4x4 vehicle to come forward.

A 20-month-old girl died in Addenbrookes hospital on Friday following the collision that happened on the southbound dual-carriageway, between the Tesco and BT roundabouts, around 1.45pm on Thursday 11 February.

The driver of the large 4x4 – thought to be a woman, described as white, in her 40s to early 50s with blonde hair – is being sought as a potential witness as this vehicle is thought to have been behind the two cars involved in the crash.

It is possible the driver may not have initially realised the seriousness of the incident and police are urging her to get in touch. If this was you, or if you saw the collision and have not yet spoken to police, please call PC Barry O’Neill by dialling Suffolk Police on **101** quoting CAD number 187 of Thursday 11 February.
