Police are asking anyone who may have seen a road traffic collision on the B1112 at Lakenheath yesterday to come forward.

The collision happened around 5.20pm yesterday, Tuesday 2 August, just south of the roundabout at the junction with Lords Walk when a Rover 75 collided with a Mini Cooper.

The driver of the Rover, in his late teens, sustained a hip injury and bruising while the Mini driver, in his 30s, sustained serious internal injuries.

Police are asking anyone who may have seen the collision to contact Roads Policing officers by dialling Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting CAD number 289 of yesterday, Tuesday 2 August.
