Police are appealing for witnesses following a serious road traffic collision at Reydon near Southwold.

Officers were called just before 1.50pm this afternoon, Thursday 15 February, to reports of a two-vehicle collision between a black BMW 118 and a black Mercedes C180 on the A1095 Halesworth Road, near to the Adnams distribution centre.

Fire and ambulance crews were also in attendance, with the fire service having to extricate both drivers from their vehicles.

The male driver of the BMW was flown by air ambulance to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital with injuries which are described as potentially life-changing.

The female driver of the Mercedes has sustained suspected pelvic injuries and has been taken to the James Paget Hospital for treatment.

The A1095 has been closed at the junction with the A12 whilst a collision investigation takes place and traffic is being diverted via the next junction at Wangford. This is likely to remain in place during this evening.

Any witnesses to this incident are asked to contact the Serious Collision Investigation Team on 101 quoting reference CAD 214 of 15 February.
