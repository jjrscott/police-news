Four men from London have been arrested in connection with a burglary incident in the Stoke Park area of Ipswich.

Police were called at 2.35am yesterday morning, Wednesday 10 October, to reports that four men were in the process of trying to break-in to a communal area at a block of flats in Montgomery Road.

Once inside the communal area they then attempted to force the door of an individual flat, but this was unsuccessful and abandoned when police arrived.

Officers were at the scene within a matter of minutes, at which point the offenders ran away. A search of the area then took place and two people were arrested in Wherstead Road, with a third detained in Prince of Wales Drive, all just before 3am. A fourth suspect was arrested at 4.20am, also in the vicinity of Prince of Wales Drive.

The four men were all arrested on suspicion burglary and their details are as follows: a 26-year-old man from the Tottenham area; a 20-year-old man and a 19-year-old man, both from the Enfield area; and a 20-year-old man from the Wembley area.

They were all taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning and have been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to contact South CID at Landmark House in Ipswich on 101 quoting reference 58380/18, or the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
