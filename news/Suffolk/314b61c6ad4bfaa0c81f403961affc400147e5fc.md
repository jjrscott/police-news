Police are issuing an appeal to trace the owner of a bicycle which was recovered following a theft in Ipswich.

The incident occurred at 1.45am on Saturday 7 November in Dogs Head Street, when officers were contacted by CCTV operators reporting that a male was in the process of stealing a bike, which had been left outside Sin Bar.

Officers on patrol in the town centre arrived at the scene within a couple of minutes and subsequently arrested a 25-year-old man on suspicion of theft. He was taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning and later released under investigation.

The bicycle – a black Voodoo BMX bike – had been left secure but the lock was snapped. Officers recovered the bike for safe-keeping, but as yet the owner has not made contact to report that it has been taken.

The owner of the bicycle, or anyone with information about this incident, is asked to contact Ipswich Neighbourhood Response Team, quoting reference: 64611/20.
