Those interested in joining Suffolk Constabulary as a Police Officer are reminded that tonight, Thursday 16 March 2017, there will be an opportunity to speak with a serving Police Officer through Facebook Live.

The event will take place at 7.30pm where viewers will get the chance to ask any questions they may have about what it's like to be a police officer, about the recruitment process or any concerns they may have about why they might not be accepted to join.

We will attempt to answer every question asked during the event, however, if this is not possible those who pose the question will be responded to shortly after.

To view the Facebook Live follow our page which can be found at: www.facebook.com/suffolkpolice
