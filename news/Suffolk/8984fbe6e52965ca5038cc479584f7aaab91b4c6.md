Police are appealing for witnesses after four teenagers were arrested in connection with a robbery in Bury St Edmunds at the end of March.

Around 1.20pm â€“ 1.30pm on Wednesday 29 March a 17-year-old boy was attacked in St Olaves Road. His mobile phone was stolen before a teenage girl bravely intervened, challenging the attackers who then ran away.

Four teenage boys - a 14-year-old, two 15-year-olds and a 16-year-old, all from Bury St Edmunds - were subsequently arrested on suspicion of robbery. All have now been bailed to return to police on 14 or 15 June, pending further enquiries.

Detectives investigating the robbery are asking anyone who may have seen the incident to come forward. Anyone who was there is asked to contact west Suffolk CID by dialling Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting crime number 25817/17.
