Police are appealing for witnesses following an attempted robbery in Beck Row.

The incident occurred between 9.25am and 9.30am on Wednesday 9 January in Skelton’s Drove, near to the junction with Rookery Drove.

The victim – a man aged in his 50s – was approached by another man who threatened him with a three-inch flick knife and demanded he hand over his mobile phone. When the victim refused this demand the suspect then ran off.

The suspect is described as white, aged between 20 and 25-years-old, around 5ft 10in tall, of slim build and with blond hair. He was wearing a charcoal puffer jacket with rectangular stitching, a black beanie hat and dark denim trousers. He spoke with a local accent.

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to contact West CID at Bury St Edmunds Police Station on 101 quoting reference 1748/19. Alternatively contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
