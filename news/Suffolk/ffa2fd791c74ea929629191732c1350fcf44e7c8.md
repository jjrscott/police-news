Police are appealing for information after a sexual assault in a car park at Robert Boby Way in Bury St Edmunds.

The incident happened around 6pm on Friday 26 August. A woman in her 20s was walking across the Waitrose store car park when she was approached by a man who engaged her in conversation. He then took her hand and placed it onto his groin. The woman walked away from him.

Police need to trace the man involved who is described as black, of slim build, around 5ft 7ins â€“ 5ft 8ins tall, possibly in his late 20s to 30s, and was wearing a black suit and black shirt.

Anyone who saw the incident or the man in the area around this time, or anyone with information about who he is, should call PC Kelly Evans at Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting crime number 52043/16.
