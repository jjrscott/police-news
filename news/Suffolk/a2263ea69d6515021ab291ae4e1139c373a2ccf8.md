Police are appealing for witnesses after a large quantity of goods and cash were stolen from a convenience shop in Ipswich.

The incident took place between 10pm and 10.30pm on Monday 1 February at the premises in Grimwade Street.

Three males broke into the building and proceeded to steal £2,000 - £3,000 worth of items, including cigarettes, alcohol, cash and food. The offenders carried some of the items out of the shop in boxes and also filled up a wheelie bin to remove other stock.

The suspects were all wearing padded coats with hoods and tracksuit bottoms.

Officers would like to hear from any witnesses who may have been in the area at the time and in particular, anyone who may have driven along Grimwade Street between 9.45pm and 10.45pm on Monday night and has a dashcam fitted in their vehicle.

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to contact South CID at Landmark House, quoting reference: 5204/21.
