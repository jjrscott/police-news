Police are appealing for witnesses after an assault in Bury St Edmunds.

The incident took place on Friday 31 July on Western Way in the town. Police were called by the East of England Ambulance Service at 5:25pm to reports of an unconscious man in the street who had been assaulted.

The victim, a man in his 50’s had been assaulted at a bus stop, near to the Council offices. He was taken to hospital having sustained bruising and grazing to his forehead. He has now been released from hospital.

Police attended and spoke to one member of the public on the scene but are looking to trace other witnesses who may be able to assist their enquiries.

Officers arrested two men in their 40s a short time later in connection with the assault. They were taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre for questioning and have been bailed to return to police on 28 August.
