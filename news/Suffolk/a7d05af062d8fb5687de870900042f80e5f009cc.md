Police are appealing for information following burglaries at three properties.

The break-ins, at two properties in Kesgrave and one in Ipswich, all took place on Wednesday 2 May between 7.40am and 5.20pm.

Burglars smashed a rear door window at a property in Martinet Green, Ipswich, and stole an unknown amount of jewellery.

A rear conservatory door was smashed by intruders at a property in Fox Lea, Kesgrave and items of jewellery were moved around but it is not known at this stage if anything was stolen.
In Century Drive, Kesgrave, burglars broke a side door window to gain entry to the property but it is not yet known if anything was taken.

Police are linking the burglaries and have asked anyone who saw any suspicious activity during the times stated or believes they have information relating to the incidents to contact CID at Ipswich on 101, quoting crime references 37/23846/18, 37/23862/18 or 37/23850/18. Alternatively, they can call the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
