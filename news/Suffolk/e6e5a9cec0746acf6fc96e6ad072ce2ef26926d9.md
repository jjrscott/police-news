Police are appealing for witnesses after two people made-off from the scene of a road traffic collision in Mildenhall.

Officers were called at 11.10pm last night, Tuesday 28 March, to reports of a collision between a silver BMW 3 Series and a blue Ford Focus on the A1065.

Ambulance and fire crews were also in attendance and the male driver of the Ford Focus had to be extracted from the vehicle, but did not suffer any serious injuries.

Two people â€“ believed to be male - are reported to have got out of the BMW and made-off from the scene of the collision, possibly into nearby woodland. One of these people was said to have been assisting the other to walk, so it is likely at least one of them has sustained an injury.

A search of the area was carried-out, assisted by the police dog unit, but the BMW occupants were not located. The road remained closed until 2am whilst both vehicles were recovered and oil and debris were cleared.

Police would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the collision, or who may have any information relating to the occupants of the BMW.

Anyone with information is asked to contact the Bury St Edmunds Roads Policing Unit on **101** quoting reference CAD 485 of 28 March.
