Police are appealing for witnesses and asking communities to be vigilant after batteries were stolen from speed indicator signs in four Suffolk Coastal villages.

The thefts occurred between Monday 11 June and Monday 18 June in the following locations:

 * Alderton Road, Hollesley (between 11 June and 13 June)
 * Woodbridge Road, Tunstall (between 13 June and 14 June)
 * The Street, Chillesford (between 15 June and 18 June)
 * Bridge Road, Snape (where batteries were stolen from two signs between 14 June and 18 June)

Officers are appealing for anyone who witnessed any suspicious persons or vehicles in the vicinity of the signs between the dates stated above to make contact.

Members of the public who live, or regularly travel through, other villages with speed indicator signs are asked to be vigilant to any activity around them which appears out of the ordinary.

Anyone with information about these thefts is asked to contact the Incident and Crime Management Hub on 101 quoting reference 33171/18.
