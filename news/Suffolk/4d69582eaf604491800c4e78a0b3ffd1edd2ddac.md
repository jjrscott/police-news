Officers are appealing for information following an assault in Bungay.

The incident took place on Tuesday 5 September at around 2.30pm. A teenager sitting by himself on a bench on Castle Hills in the town was approached by two boys. The teenager tried to run away but one of the boys grabbed his hood and then punched him in the face, leaving a slight mark on his cheek.

The first offender is described as white with a tanned complexion, 11-14 years of age, approximately 5 feet 6 inches tall, with brown hair close shaved at the back and sides but long on top, and was wearing a blue puffer style jacket. The other is described as 10-11 years old, about 5 feet 5 inches with mousy hair and was wearing a grey tracksuit.

Witnesses or anybody who has any information are asked to call Suffolk Police on **101** quoting reference 58929/17.
