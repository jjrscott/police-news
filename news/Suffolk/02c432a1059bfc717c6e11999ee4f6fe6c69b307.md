Police are appealing for witnesses following an armed robbery at a convenience shop on the outskirts of Ipswich.

The incident occurred at around 9.45pm last night, Thursday 5 April, at the Co-op in Laburnum Close, Pinewood.

A man entered the store brandishing a knife and approached a member of staff, demanding that they open the till and give him money. His demand was refused and another member of staff managed to get into the safe room and activate the panic alarm. The offender then left the premises and made off in the direction of Belmont Drive.

The suspect is described as white, around 6ft 2in tall, wearing a black hooded top, grey jogging bottoms and a red face mask.

Any witnesses are asked to contact South CID at Landmark House on 101 quoting reference 18456/18. Alternatively contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
