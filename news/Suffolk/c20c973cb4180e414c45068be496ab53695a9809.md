Police are appealing for witnesses following a burglary in Lowestoft last week.

The incident took place within a property in Churchill Close at 6.10am on Friday 5 July, when an occupant was awoken by a noise in his bedroom.

The man then noticed his bedroom drawers were open, his mobile phone was missing and an unknown female was crouched down on the floor at the foot of his bed with his phone, which she subsequently returned.

Once the woman left the property by the back door, the man realised that an amount of change and a lighter had been taken from a window sill. His bathroom window had also been left open and a number of other items had been left behind in a laundry basket.

The woman is described as white, aged in her mid to late 20s, 5ft tall, of a medium build and with collar length blonde/ginger hair. She was wearing dirty white trainers, black leggings and a dull pink top with embroidery on the front.

Anyone with any information about this incident is asked to contact Suffolk police quoting reference number 37/39262/19
