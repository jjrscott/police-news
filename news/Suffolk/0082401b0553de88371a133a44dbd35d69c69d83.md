Police are appealing for witnesses following a road traffic collision in Carlton Colville last week.

The incident occurred at around 5.55pm on Thursday 19 September on the A146 Beccles Road, between the junctions of Ivy Lane and Burnt Hill Way (almost opposite the filling station).

A car was involved in a collision with a bicycle which was travelling towards Beccles, resulting in the cyclist being knocked to the ground.

The cyclist – a man aged in his 50s – sustained a broken and dislocated elbow, along with multiple cuts and bruises. He was taken to hospital by an ambulance which was a couple of vehicles behind when the collision occurred.

The driver of the car involved failed to stop or report the collision and officers are appealing for this person to come forward.

Any witnesses to this collision, or anyone with any information, is asked to contact the Neighbourhood Support Team at Lowestoft Police Station on 101, quoting reference CAD 85 of 20 September.
