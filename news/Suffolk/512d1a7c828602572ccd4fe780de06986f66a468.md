Officers are appealing for witnesses or information after two men were assaulted in Ipswich in the early hours of this morning.

Police were called at 01:45am today, Thursday 16 August, to reports of a fight taking place on Bond Street near to the junction of Eagle Street in the town. Suspects used a metal pole and a wooden stick to assault the two victims.

It is believed that an altercation had taken place between the two victims and a group of three men on Rope Walk just beforehand.

One man has sustained head injuries as a result of the incident and remains in hospital and the other man received minor injuries.

The first suspect is described as black, 5 feet 10 or 11 inches tall, in his 30s, of big build, with short hair, who was wearing a turquoise top and dark trousers. The second suspect man is described as Asian, 5 feet 10 or 11 inches tall, in his 30s, with a close beard and short hair who was wearing a dark jacket. The third man is described as black and of a similar height.

Two roads were closed to allow a police investigation into the circumstance to get underway, but have since reopened.

Witnesses or anybody with any information are asked to call Ipswich CID on 101 quoting reference 46545/18. Alternatively, contact the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
