A quantity of alcohol and cigarettes have been stolen after a group of men broke into a store in Selkirk Road in Ipswich in the early hours of this morning.

Police were alerted just after 4.15am today, Tuesday 18 October, to a break-in at Rushmere Food Store.

Four men, all dressed in dark clothing smashed the front window of the premises to gain entry and steal the items before making off from the area in what has been described as a white saloon car – possibly a Ford Sierra or similar.

One of the men is described as wearing a black hooded top with a white stripe.

Officers investigating the incident are asking anyone who may have been in the area around 4am – 5am this morning to come forward if you saw anything suspicious. Anyone who can help is asked to call Ipswich CID by dialling Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting CAD 22 of today, Tuesday 18 October.
