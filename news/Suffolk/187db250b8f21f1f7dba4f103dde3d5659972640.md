Police are appealing for witnesses or information following a road rage incident in Stowmarket.

The incident occurred around 10.20am on Wednesday 21 October on the A1120, just off the roundabout at Tesco.

A man, aged in his 30s, was driving a silver Volkswagen Golf on the A1120, towards Stowupland and the A14, when a green Vauxhall Vectra behind him began flashing its lights and tailgating him.

The man then stopped and got out of his vehicle to speak to the other driver. The other driver then accelerated and pinned the man against his own car.

As a result of the incident, the man sustained a dislocated knee and was taken to West Suffolk Hospital for treatment.

Officers would be keen to speak to any motorists who may have captured any relevant dash cam of the incident or who may have witnessed the manner of driving shortly before the incident.

Anyone with any information about the incident or who saw anything suspicious at the time is asked to contact Suffolk police, quoting crime reference: 37/61310/20
