A man has been arrested following two separate incidents of assault at Haverhill bus station in Lordscroft Lane last week.

The first attack occurred at around 1.20pm on Wednesday 3 February when a man aged in his 40s was punched in the head by another man.

Between 4.50pm and 5.10pm the following day, Thursday 4 February, the same victim was again assaulted by being pushed up against the bus shelter. His partner – a woman aged in her 50s – who was also present, was then punched and fell to the floor, sustaining head and facial injuries.

Officers are treating these incidents as linked and the victims and suspect are understood to be known to each other.

On Friday 5 February, a 37-year-old man from Haverhill was arrested in connection with these incidents and questioned by police at Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre.

He was subsequently released on bail until Thursday 25 February, pending further enquiries.

Anyone with information about these incidents is asked to contact Haverhill Neighbourhood Response Team, quoting reference: 5900/21.
