Police are issuing an e-fit likeness of a man they would like to speak to in connection with incidents of stalking in Ipswich.

A man is alleged to have walked past the victim’s home in the vicinity of Norwich Road on several occasions, loitered and peered into their windows.

The suspect is described as white, aged between 30 and 34 years of age, of a stocky build, approximately 5ft 10ins, with short dark blond hair and a round face. The victim also believes he is Eastern European.

He wears dark tracksuit bottoms and dark trainers and is often seen walking what is believed to be a small Yorkshire terrier-type breed dog on an extendable lead. The dog has dark black or brown fur.

Anyone with information relating to this crime, who recognises the man from the description or from the e-fit likeness, should contact Suffolk police on 101 quoting crime reference 37/23972/18.

Alternatively, contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Stalking is repeated unwanted contact from one person to another, which demonstrates either a fixation or obsession and causes the victim to feel alarm, distress or fear of violence. It may involve personal contact but also via the phone, email, letter or social media.

**Types of stalking behaviour:**
Taken in isolation, events might seem unremarkable. But in particular circumstances, and with repetition, they take on a more sinister meaning.

Unwanted communications may include telephone calls, letters, emails, faxes, text messages, messages on social networking sites, graffiti or sending or leaving unsolicited gifts.

Unwanted intrusions include following, waiting for, spying on, approaching and going to a person's home. A stalker may also order or cancel goods or services, make complaints (to legitimate bodies), damage property or follow and try to talk to you online (cyberstalking).

**Advice for victims:**
• Keep a record of what happened, where and when you were followed or telephoned, or when you received post or email messages
• Details of people who may have seen these events
• Write down information as soon as possible when events are still fresh in your mind
• Tell the police if any neighbours or others saw or heard what happened
• Record how the suspect looked or sounded - what they were wearing and the make, number plate of any involved car
• Stay alert and aware of your surroundings at all times.
