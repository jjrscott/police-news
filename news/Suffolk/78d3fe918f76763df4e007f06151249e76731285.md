A 44-year-old man has been given a suspended sentence after pleading guilty to the indecent assault of a young girl.

Lalson John, from Ipswich, appeared at Ipswich Crown Court for sentencing on Tuesday, 10 October, after previously pleading guilty to one count of indecent assault by touching.

The offence was committed between 2012 and 2013 and relates to a girl who was under the age of 13 at the time.

The victim disclosed the incident to her family in April 2016 who alerted police and John was arrested and subsequently charged.

He initially denied the offence, but later changed his plea to guilty on his first day of trial on Monday 11 September 2017.

John was given a two year suspended sentence and given a Sexual Harm Prevention Order for a period of 10 years. A second charge of indecent assault by touching will remain on file.

> **Detective Constable Hayley Kennedy from the Suffolk Police Safeguarding Unit said:** "We know this process has not been easy for the victim, but she has been very brave in both reporting the offence and seeing this investigation through. We are pleased that John changed his plea to guilty to save her from having to go through a trial.
>
> "As with any report of this nature we are committed to supporting victims, regardless of the passage of time passed.”
