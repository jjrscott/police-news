Officers are appealing for witnesses following an incident of indecent exposure in Woodbridge.

The incident took place last night, Tuesday 31 October at around 6.45pm on Beresford Drive in the town.

Two girls walking down the road saw a man leaning against a lamp post who had his trousers and boxers shorts pulled down to his thighs and was carrying out a lewd act. The man did not talk to the girls or engage with them and they ran off. The victims although unharmed as a result of the incident, were however very shaken-up.

The suspect is described as a white man in his twenties, approximately 6 feet tall with slightly curly blonde hair. He was wearing a brown, or dark coloured, waist length jacket, possibly leather, a yellow or orange t-shirt, dark trousers and stripey/multi coloured boxer shorts. It is thought that he had a mountain bike with him.

Anybody who witnessed the incident or who has any information is asked to contact Suffolk Police on 101 quoting reference 37/70641/17.
