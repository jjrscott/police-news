Police are appealing for witnesses following an assault in Ipswich.

Officers received a report shortly after 1.05am today, Thursday 27 August, that a man had been injured in Bilberry Road, following an altercation with four other males.

The man, aged in his 20s, had sustained a puncture wound to his buttock, an injury to his groin and bruising to his face and he was taken to Ipswich Hospital via ambulance. His injuries were deemed to be non-life-changing or life-threatening.

Four males then ran from the scene.

A cordon has been put in place while officers continue to carry out forensic work, along with CCTV and house-to-house enquiries.

Officers believe that this was a targeted attack and as such there is no wider threat to the community.

Enquiries are ongoing and the public can expect to see reassurance patrols conducted in the area over the coming days.

Anyone who has knowledge of the incident, saw any suspicious activity or may have captured CCTV footage in the area should contact South CID, quoting crime reference 37/49814/20
