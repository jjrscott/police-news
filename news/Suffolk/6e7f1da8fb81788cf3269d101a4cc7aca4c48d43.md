Police are appealing for witnesses after a road traffic collision in Lowestoft, following which one vehicle failed to stop.

The incident occurred at around 11.35am on Friday 6 November on the A1117, where a red Kia Ceed was involved in a collision with a silver Renault Clio.

The Kia Ceed failed to stop, but is believed to have sustained damage to the offside wing mirror and bodywork.

Officers are appealing for any witnesses to the collision, or anyone aware of a red Kia Ceed which has sustained damage to the offside since Friday morning.

Anyone with information is asked to contact the Joint Norfolk and Suffolk Roads and Armed Policing Team at Acle Police Station, quoting reference SC-06112020-140.
