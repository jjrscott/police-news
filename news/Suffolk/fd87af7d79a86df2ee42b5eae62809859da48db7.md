Officers are appealing for witnesses or information following a robbery in Lowestoft.

The incident occurred at some point between 8:30pm and 9:30pm on Friday 22 September, during which a man in his 40s was approached by approximately 10 teenagers – a mixture of boys and girls – as he walked from the off-licence shop in Hollingsworth Road.

Initially, the group are said to have engaged in friendly conversation with the man as they walked in the same direction. However, as they entered an alleyway off Montgomery Avenue, he was assaulted by the group who punched and kicked him, demanding he hand over his belongings.

The offenders stole the victim's wallet, containing a quantity of cash, who was then able to free himself to flee the scene. He sustained a broken tooth, bruising and scratches to his face and body.

Detectives investigating the robbery are asking anyone who may have been in the area around this time, or anyone who may have seen the offenders, to come forward.

If you saw anything or have any information that may assist in identifying the suspects please call East CID at Lowestoft on 101 quoting reference 62705/17, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
