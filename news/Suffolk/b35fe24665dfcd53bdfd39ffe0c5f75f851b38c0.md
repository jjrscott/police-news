Police are appealing for witnesses after a robbery at a convenience shop in north Suffolk last week.

The incident occurred at around 6.55pm on Friday 14 September at the premises in Thelnetham Road, Hopton.

A man entered the shop and threatened a staff member with a knife, demanding money from the till. A quantity of cash was handed over and the offender then left. The victim was left shaken by this incident but was otherwise unharmed.

The suspect is described as white, aged 19-20 years-old, around 5ft 6in tall, of slim build and with short, fair-coloured hair. He was wearing a grey hooded top with the hood up.

Detectives would also like to trace a male seen standing in the bus stop near to the shop just prior to the offence occurring.

They are also appealing for any witnesses who may have seen a male who was taking photographs outside the shop entrance, between 4.30pm and 5pm on Wednesday 12 September. He is described as being all dressed in grey and on a bicycle.

Any witnesses who believe they saw any suspicious activity in Hopton either during the afternoon or evening of Friday 14 September, or on the afternoon of Wednesday 12 September, is asked to contact police, as is anyone who drove through the village at these times and has a dash cam fitted in their vehicle.

Anyone with information is asked to contact West CID at Bury St Edmunds Police Station on 101 quoting reference 52858/18. Alternatively contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
