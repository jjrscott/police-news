Police are appealing for witnesses to two burglaries that took place in Ipswich.

The first happened at a property on Rushmere Road at some point between 9.45 and 5.30pm on Tuesday 23 January.

Access was gained via a locked back gate at the side of the property that was empty at the time. The offender(s) smashed a double glazed patio door to gain access. They conducted a search of the master bedroom, drawers and cupboards. Items of jewellery and a black leather jewellery box were stolen from the master bedroom and further items of jewellery were taken from the spare bedroom.

Police are looking at links to another burglary that took place the same day at some point between 10am and 2.30pm at a property on Colchester Road in the town. The offender(s) entered the property by smashing a rear patio door window and stole jewellery from the master bedroom and a canteen of cutlery from lounge.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or saw any suspicious activity in relation to either incident should contact Ipswich CID on 101 quoting crime reference 37/4376/18 or 37/4314/18 respectively or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
