Police are urging vigilance and appealing for information after a bogus caller visited an address in Lowestoft offering to carry out work.

The incident took place yesterday, Monday 29 June at just after midday at a property on Prospect Road in the town. A man claiming to be from a double-glazing company called at the address offering to clean the gutters. The man had no proof of identity and occupants of the house refused the offer. The man then left on foot in the direction of Hall Road.

He is described as in his late 60s, 5 feet 7 inches tall, balding and walked with a limp. He was wearing a dark zip-up jacket, jeans and slip-on trainers.

Witnesses or those with any information or dash cam footage are asked to contact police. Officers would also like to hear from anybody else who has been approached in a similar way by those offering to carry out work.

Police are reminding residents to keep an eye on their neighbours’ homes, particularly elderly neighbours who may be vulnerable to bogus callers or rogue traders.

Anyone with any information about this incident is asked to contact Lowestoft Police quoting CAD number 135 of 29 June.
