Police are appealing for witnesses following a serious road traffic collision in Sutton last week.

The incident occurred just after 5.20pm on Wednesday 31 October in Heath Road, near to Rock Barracks.

A black Vauxhall Vectra was travelling in the direction of Woodbridge when it was involved in a collision with a black motorcycle travelling in the opposite direction.

The rider of the motorbike – a man aged in his 50s – was taken to Addenbrooke’s Hospital by air ambulance having sustained life-changing leg and foot injuries.

A 39-year-old woman from the Woodbridge area was arrested on suspicion of drug-driving in connection with this incident. She was taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning and has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Officers are appealing for any witnesses to the collision to make contact, or anyone who may have any dashcam footage of the incident, or of the vehicles involved immediately prior to it.

Anyone with information is asked to either email [email protected], or call the PHQ Roads and Armed Policing Team on 101, quoting reference CAD 327 of 31 October.
