Police are appealing for witnesses after a number of lorries were shot in Felixstowe with what is believed to have been an air weapon.

The incidents occurred between 9.30pm last night, Monday 22 January and 2.30am this morning, Tuesday 23 January, along Walton High Street.

Five heavy goods vehicles, following a diversion route due to a closure of the A14 Eastbound, reported being shot at between the junctions of Gulpher Road and Church Lane. None of the drivers were injured, but in each case the vehicle cabs sustained damage.

Anyone with information about these crimes is asked to contact Felixstowe Safer Neighbourhood Team on 101 quoting reference 4208/18, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
