Police are appealing witnesses after a woman dog walker was verbally abused in Bury St Edmunds.

The incident took place on Friday 4 September at sometime between 10:00am and 10:20am in Nowton Park, Bury Road. A woman in her 60’s was walking her dog when she was approached by two men who insistently asked for details regarding the dog’s breed etc. The woman declined to talk to the men and they became verbally abusive. The woman then picked up her dog and ran off from the park. She was left very shaken as a result of the incident.

The first man is described as white, in his 30’s, 5 feet 10 inches tall with long greasy hair and was wearing dark clothing. The second man is described as white, in his 40’s, 6 feet tall of slim build with grey hair and was wearing a lime green top and shorts.

Officers are asking that witnesses or anybody who recognises the description of the men to contact police quoting reference 37/51753/20
