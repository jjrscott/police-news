Two men arrested in connection with a serious assault in Sudbury at the weekend have been bailed.

Police were called at 10.40 am on Saturday 11 November, to reports that a man had sustained serious head injuries and was unconscious at a property in Jameson Place in the town.

The man was taken to hospital and is reported to be in a serious but stable condition.

A scene is currently in place at the address whilst enquiries continue.

Two men, one in his thirties and the other in his forties, both from Sudbury, were arrested yesterday on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. Both men have now bailed to return to police on 4 December 2017.
