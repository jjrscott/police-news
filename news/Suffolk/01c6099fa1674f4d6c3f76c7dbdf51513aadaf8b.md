Police are appealing for witnesses, and reminding residents to secure their homes, following a burglary in Ipswich at the weekend.

The incident occurred between 11pm on Saturday 29 September and 7.15am on Sunday 30 September at an address in Pinecroft Road.

Entry was gained via an insecure downstairs front window and a wallet was stolen from inside.

Anyone with information about this crime is asked to contact South CID at Landmark House in Ipswich, quoting reference 56263/18. Alternatively contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Suffolk Police are urging people to get in the habit of completing a #9PMRoutine, with residents asked to conduct the following checks at that time each evening:

• Check your vehicles
• Shut your windows
• Lock your doors
and
• Check your outbuildings
