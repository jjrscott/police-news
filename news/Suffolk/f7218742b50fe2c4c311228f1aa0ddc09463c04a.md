Police are appealing for witnesses and information after an incident of arson in Holton St Mary.

The incident occurred between 8.30pm and 8.40pm on Sunday 28 October at a property in Hadleigh Road.

During the times stated, unknown offender/s set light to a barn and then ran towards a stationary red Escort-type van, which they then used to drive off in the direction of Brantham. Nobody was harmed as result of the incident.

Police are appealing for any witnesses who may have seen anything suspicious to call Suffolk police on 101 quoting reference 37/62414/18. Detectives are particularly keen to hear from anyone who may have dash-cam footage captured in this location between 8.25pm and 9pm.
