Police are appealing for witnesses – and urging communities to be vigilant - following the theft of lead from a church in Preston St Mary last week.

The crime occurred at some time between Sunday 4 October and Thursday 8 October at St Mary’s Church.

A significant quantity of lead was stolen from the aisle roof, causing not only external damage but also internal, as a result of rainwater ingress.

Officers would like to hear from anyone with information about this incident, or anyone who witnessed any suspicious behaviour in the area in the days and weeks prior to the theft.

> Sgt Brian Calver, of the Rural Crime Team, said: “With the nights now drawing in and longer hours of darkness upon us, we would urge people to remain vigilant and report and suspicious activity around churches – especially ones with lead assets – as we often see an increase in these offences at this time of year.
>
> “The damage and losses caused by the theft of lead from church roofs often runs into tens of thousands of pounds. I would encourage church wardens/custodians to review their security and consider installing an alarm, as these have proven to be a successful deterrent.
>
> “Anyone in need of crime prevention advice can either contact their local Safer Neighbourhood Team, or visit the ‘Advice’ section of our website.”

Any witnesses, or who has any information about this incident, is asked to contact the Crime Coordination Centre, quoting reference: 58840/20.
