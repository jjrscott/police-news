Police are appealing for information and dashcam footage, after a car failed to stop for officers in Mildenhall last week.

The incident occurred at just after 9.10pm on Thursday 12 November, in College Heath Road.

Officers had cause to request a silver Vauxhall Vectra to stop, the same vehicle having previously failed to comply with a request from police to stop at 6am that morning.

The car drove off at speed, overtaking other cars in the process and driving at 60mph in a 30mph zone. It was pursued by police through Mildenhall and then into Beck Row, where it was abandoned in a field off Snare Drove.

The area was searched with the assistance of the Dog Unit, but the occupants of the car were not located.

Anyone who was driving in the area at the time and witnessed this incident – in particular anyone with a dashcam fitted in their vehicle – is asked to contact the Sentinel West Team, quoting reference: 65826/20.
