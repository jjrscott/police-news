Police are appealing for witnesses following an attempted robbery in Ipswich.

The incident took place at approximately 2pm yesterday, Tuesday 10 September, in meadowland near to the Ravenswood area.

The victim – a woman aged in her 20s – had been walking with her child along a footpath behind the Gainsborough Sports and Community Centre fields, and as she reached an open meadowland, behind a residential area, a male approached her and demanded money. He also claimed that he was in possession of a knife but no weapon was seen.

The woman then passed him a child’s plastic toy which the male then used to assault the woman, before running off in the direction of the wooded area.

As a result of the incident, the woman was left shaken and with minor facial injuries.

The male suspect is described as white, aged between 30 and 40-years-old, tall, of a slim build, with short brown shaven hair, patchy stubble and he had a large nose. He was wearing an oversized green or brown coloured coat and black fingerless gloves.

Officers will be carrying out patrols and further enquiries in the Ravenswood area today, Wednesday 11 September.

Detectives are also keen to speak to anyone who may have been in the area at the time of the incident, particularly any dog walkers who may have seen a male matching this description between 1pm and 2.30pm yesterday.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has knowledge of it should contact Detective Inspector Holly Evans at South CID by quoting crime reference: 37/54741/19
