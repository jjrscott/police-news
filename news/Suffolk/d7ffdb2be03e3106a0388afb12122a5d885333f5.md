Police are appealing for witnesses after a man was subjected to racial abuse in Beccles.

The incident occurred at around 1.45pm on Friday 25 November in Sheepgate.

The victim was walked from New Gate into Sheepgate, where he met another family member. As they walked along Sheepgate they encountered the suspect, who began to make racially abusive remarks towards him.

This abuse continued for around two to three minutes until they reached the junction of Hungate and Blyburgate, at which point the suspect began to walk away from them.

The suspect is described as white, aged in his thirties, of average height and stocky build and with a ginger/brown beard. He was wearing a green wool beanie hat with a shield motif on the front, a zip-up fleece jacket, dark cargo-style trousers, and ‘work’ boots. He spoke with a local accent.

Officers are appealing for anyone who may have witnessed this incident, or who has any information regarding the suspect, to contact the East Neighbourhood Support Team at Lowestoft Police Station on **101** quoting reference 68329/16, or Crimestoppers anonymously on **0800 555 111**.
