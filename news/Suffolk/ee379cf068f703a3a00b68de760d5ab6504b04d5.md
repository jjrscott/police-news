Suffolk Police are re-appealing for witnesses following a fail to stop collision in Ipswich.

On Sunday 7 January, at approximately 11am, a collision occurred involving a pedal cycle and a vehicle, believed to be a white van, at the Warren Heath and Felixstowe Road roundabout in Ipswich.

The cyclist, a woman in her 40s, was knocked unconscious and taken to hospital for treatment for a serious head injury.

Police are now able to release an image of the yellow cycle jacket and helmet photo that the victim was wearing that may help jog the memories of any witnesses to the incident..
