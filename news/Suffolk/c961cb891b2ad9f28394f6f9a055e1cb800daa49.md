Police are appealing for witnesses following an incident involving a dog in Glemsford near Long Melford.

The incident occurred at around 6.20am on Saturday 18 April within recreation ground near the library and skate park off Hunts Hill.

The victim – a woman aged in her 40s – was jogging when a black and white Border Collie breed dog approached her and persistently nipped her on her calves, leaving a bruise and a mark on her calf muscle.

The owner of the dog, described as being a tall, white man who was approximately aged in his 60s or 70s and was possibly wearing glasses, shouted at the dog but the dog continued to nip the woman.

The woman verbally challenged the man about the dog’s behaviour and it being off the lead.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Suffolk police, quoting crime reference: 37/21857/20
