Police are appealing for witnesses after an attempted robbery in Ipswich.

The incident took place at around 5.45pm on Friday 25 May in an alleyway near Morrisons supermarket on Sproughton Road.

A 15-year-old boy was on his bicycle with a younger boy, in the alleyway which is close to the Co-op Funeral Services offices, when he was approached by a man who had a knife in his waist band.

The suspect demanded the older boy hand over the bike before punching him in the head and then running off empty-handed.

The suspect is described as a white male, aged in his 20s and wearing a black hoodie, black baggy jeans and black trainers.

Police would also like to trace two other people who it is believed may have witnessed the incident. They are a woman aged 40 to 50 who was walking a small white dog and a man aged in his 20s wearing dark blue work-wear and carrying a drawstring bag.

If you have any information which could help in the investigation contact Ipswich CID Suffolk police on 101, investigation reference 37/28561/18 or the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
