Police are appealing for information after a woman in her 20s was robbed in Norwich Road in Lowestoft yesterday.

The incident happened around 6.30pm yesterday, Sunday 5 February, as the woman walked towards the town centre. She was near the Walton Road junction when she heard footsteps behind her and then felt someone pulling her hair. She was then grabbed and threatened with a knife before the offender took her purse and stole a quantity cash. The purse was discarded before he fled.

The suspect is described as white, male, in his mid to late teens, around 5ft 3ins tall, of slim build with what have been described as protruding teeth. He wore a dark Puffa-style jacket and dark baseball cap.

Anyone who may have seen the incident, or the teenager in the area, or who may have any information about the offender, is asked to contact Lowestoft CID by dialling Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting crime number 16098/17. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers, anonymously if required, on **0800 555 111**.
