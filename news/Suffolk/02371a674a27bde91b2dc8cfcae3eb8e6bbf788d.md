Police are appealing for witnesses after a man indecently exposed himself in Stowmarket.

The incident took place between 9.25 and 9.55am on Wednesday 22 February on the Chilton Hall estate.

The victim – a woman in her 30s – was walking through the estate when she became aware of a man following very closely behind her.

He continued to follow her for a short while and then as they approached Delius Close he indecently exposed himself.

The suspect is described as white, aged in his 30s or 40s, around 5ft 8in tall, and of stocky build. He was wearing a dark hooded top, with a chequered black and white scarf around the bottom half of his face.

Officers would like to hear from anyone who may have seen a man matching this description walking in the Chilton Hall area that morning.

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to contact the Stowmarket Neighbourhood Response Team on **101** quoting reference 19053/17, or Crimestoppers anonymously on **0800 555 111**.
