Police are appealing for information or witnesses following a fail-to-stop road traffic collision near Hintlesham.

The incident occurred on the A1071 as the road becomes Thorpe’s Hill, near to the junction with Pigeon’s Lane, at approximately 6pm on Wednesday 18 October.

A black Mitsubishi Outlander car was travelling towards Ipswich when it was involved in a collision with an oncoming vehicle. The driver of the Mitsubishi Outlander sustained minor injuries but did not require medical treatment.

The second vehicle failed to stop and is believed to have sustained damage along the offside (driver’s side).

Anyone who witnessed the collision, has dash cam footage of the incident, or who has information regarding a car with damage to its offside panels is urged to contact Suffolk Police on 101 quoting CAD 166 of 18 October.
