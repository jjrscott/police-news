Police are appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Haverhill.

The incident occurred at around 3pm, yesterday, Sunday 17 February, in a park off School Lane.

The victim, a 39-year-old woman, was sitting near to the newt pond, when she was approached by three unknown males who asked her if she had any money.

One of the males then grabbed the womanâ€™s handbag and as she tried to pull away, the male stole an amount of money from her purse. The woman sustained cuts to her hands and her mobile phone was also damaged as a result of the incident.

The first suspect is described as male, 6ft, black with a stocky build.

The second suspect is described as having a slim build and was not as tall as the first male.

The third suspect is described male, approximately 5ft 7ins and was wearing a blue jacket.

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to contact West CID on 101, quoting reference 37/9591/19.
