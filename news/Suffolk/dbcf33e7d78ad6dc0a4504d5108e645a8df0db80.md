Police are urging vigilance after reports of a woman calling at properties in Ipswich asking for help and money.

The incidents took place in the Clarkson Street and Christchurch Street areas of the town prior to 25 July. A woman knocked at a number of doors saying that she needed help and asked for a lift or money for train travel. One of the residents gave the woman £20 and a coat.

Officers are concerned for the welfare of the woman and would ask that anybody who is approached in this way to contact Ipswich police to assist, quoting reference 514 of 25 July.
