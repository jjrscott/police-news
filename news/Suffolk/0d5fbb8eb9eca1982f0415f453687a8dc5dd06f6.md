Police are urging vigilance after spate of burglaries that took place in Sudbury.

The eight burglaries have taken place in recent weeks in the Sudbury area and surrounding villages.

A number of properties in the area of Park Road and surrounding streets have been targeted between Sunday 21 February and Monday 8 March

Acting Inspector Matt Gilbert from Haverhill and Sudbury Safer Neighbourhood Team said: "We are putting additional resources in those key areas of Sudbury where our officers are required and they are conducting patrols in the area, conducting reassurance activity by engaging with residents. Meanwhile, officers from CID continue to conduct enquiries into the burglaries as a priority as we are determined to identify the people responsible.”

"We acknowledge that burglary can have a devastating impact for the victims concerned and we urge residents to do all we can to prevent being a victim - this includes actively encouraging residents to invest in enhanced security measures, especially modern technological solutions such as CCTV, doorbell cameras and alarms.

"Residents should also consider crime prevention measures as opportunist thieves are often looking out for lapses in security - such as doors and windows left open or property left on display in vehicles. This is especially true as the days get milder to ensure windows and doors are kept locked and outbuildings left secure.”

If you see suspicious activity and a crime of burglary in action then please call us on 999.
