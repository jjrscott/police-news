A man arrested in connection with a robbery that occurred in Ipswich last month has been released from police custody.

The incident took place at approximately 6.25pm on Saturday 21 September in Westbury Road.

The victim – a woman aged in her 60s – was reversing her car onto a driveway in Westbury Road when two boys approached her car. One of boys then opened the door, demanded she got out and threatened her with a knife.

The victim got out of the car and the suspects then got in and drove off towards Rushmere Road.

As a result of the incident, the woman was left shaken but was physically unharmed.

The car - a Mazda 5 Takara - and the knife were recovered later the same day (21 September).

A 29-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of assisting offenders on Thursday 24 October. He was taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning and will face no further action at this time.

Enquiries are ongoing in relation to tracing two outstanding suspects described as being approximately aged seven and 12.

Detectives would be keen to speak to anyone who may have seen the victim’s five-door maroon Mazda 5 Takara, or a similar coloured vehicle, being driven in Westbury Road and Rushmere Road on Saturday 21 September between 6pm and 6.30pm.

Anyone with any information about this incident or anyone travelling in the area that may have captured relevant dash-cam footage should contact South CID by quoting crime reference 57286/19.
