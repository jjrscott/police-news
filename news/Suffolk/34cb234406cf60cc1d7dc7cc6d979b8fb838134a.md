Officers are appealing for witnesses or information after a serious road traffic collision involving a van and a cyclist in Helmingham.

Police were called today, Monday 22 June, at just before 1:10pm to reports of a collision involving a woman cyclist and a Ford Transit van on the B1077, approximately a mile south of Helmingham village.

Emergency services attended the scene, and the cyclist, a woman in her 40s was taken by Air Ambulance to Addenbrooks hospital having sustained serious head injuries as a result of the collision. She remains in hospital at this time and her condition is described as critical.

The van involved was a white Ford Transit van with a distinctive orange light on the roof which was travelling southbound towards Ashbocking/Ipswich.

Police arrested the two occupants of the van at the scene on suspicion causing serious injury by dangerous driving. The man and woman have been taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre where they will be questioned by officers.

The road was closed for several hours to allow an investigation into the circumstances of the incidents to get underway and has now re-opened.

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone who was driving in that area today, either immediately before or after the collision, and who has a dashcam fitted in their vehicle to contact the Roads and Armed Policing Team quoting CAD 199 of 22 June via
