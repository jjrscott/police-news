Officers are appealing for witnesses following an assault in Lowestoft.

A teenage boy sitting on a bench with a friend, was approached by a group of three other teenaged boys. One of these boys spoke to the teenage boy on the bench before hitting him twice in the face. A scuffle then took place between both boys in which the victim was kicked in the face.

A member of the public intervened and told the suspect to stop assaulting the victim. The suspect and the other two boys then walked off towards the Britten Centre.The victim sustained bruises, scratches and swelling.
