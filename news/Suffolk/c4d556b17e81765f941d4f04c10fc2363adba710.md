Police are urging residents to lock up their vehicles after several recent theft incidents in south-east Suffolk.

There have been 20 incidents of theft from or interference with motor vehicles since the start of the month with seven of these in the Felixstowe area between Tuesday, 19 July, and yesterday morning, Thursday 21 July. Four of these seven thefts were from insecure vehicles with a wallet, handbag, cash, sunglasses and clothing among the items taken.

Police are continuing to urge drivers not to leave items in their vehicles and to remember to lock – and check you have locked – your car or van before leaving it unattended.

## Top tips

 * Don’t leave anything on display in your car, thieves can sometimes mistake them for valuables.
 * Take all your belongings with you when you leave the car.
 * CD Players and Stereos – remove them if you can, get them security marked and keep a note of serial numbers.
 * Sat navs – remove unit and holder from windscreen, wipe the residue circle from the screen (this could indicate to a thief you have hidden the unit in the car).
 * Fit security devices - electronic immobiliser, mechanical immobiliser, locking wheel nuts, vehicle alarm.
