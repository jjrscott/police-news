Police in Lowestoft are asking a woman to come forward following an incident at the Morrisons supermarket in Tower Road last night.

Officers were contacted just after 9.30pm yesterday, Monday 30 January, by a member of staff at the store who reported a man had sat in a customer’s car and was acting suspiciously. Police attended and the 29-year-old man from the Lowestoft area was arrested a short time later on suspicion of assault, criminal damage and driving whilst unfit through drink/ drugs.

It’s thought the man was not known to the driver of the car he was sitting in, and that this prompted the call to police, however there are no details of the woman customer whose car it was and officers need to speak to her.

If this was you, or you know who it was, please contact the Great Yarmouth Custody Investigation Unit by dialing **101** , and quoting CAD number 403 of yesterday, Monday 30 January, or crime number 15025/17.
