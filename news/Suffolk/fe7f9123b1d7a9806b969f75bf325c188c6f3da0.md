An 18-year-old man is due to appear before Ipswich Magistrates Court this morning charged with a home burglary and a theft from a vehicle in Sudbury.

Zak Kelly, of Park Crescent in Manchester, was arrested on Saturday, 11 February, and brought into custody in Suffolk, where he was interviewed by detectives.

He was subsequently charged with burgling a home in Waldingfield Road on 14 November 2016, where a purse, a wallet and a blue VW Polo were stolen, and with stealing keys and a portable radio from a vehicle in Park Road in Sudbury on November 13 last year.

He has been detained in custody overnight to appear before Ipswich Magistrates Court this morning, Monday 13 February.
