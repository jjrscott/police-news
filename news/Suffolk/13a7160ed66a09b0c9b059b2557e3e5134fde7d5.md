A 23-year-old man from Lowestoft has appeared before magistrates today, Thursday 9 November, charged with drug offences.

Toby Crossman, of Beaconsfield Road in Lowestoft, was arrested yesterday afternoon after officers from the pro-active Scorpion Team executed a warrant at the address under the Misuse of Drugs Act.

A quantity of drugs wraps, cash and two mobile phones were seized and Crossman was taken into custody at Great Yarmouth Police Investigation Centre where he was charged with two counts of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs, namely crack cocaine and heroin, and one count of possession of cannabis.

He appeared before Norwich Magistrates Court earlier today where he was remanded in custody ahead of his next court appearance at Ipswich Crown Court on Thursday 7 December.
