On Christmas Eve, Ipswich and Martlesham volunteer police cadets spread Christmas cheer with the delivery of Christmas presents to children at Ipswich Hospital.

The Ipswich unit of the volunteer police cadets, consisting of young people between the ages of 13-18, have raised funds in order to provide a Christmas Cadet giveaway of presents to other children and young people who will be in hospital over the Christmas period.

PC Trevor Spinlove, a cadet leader, had the initial idea, and on Saturday 17 December a number of leaders and cadets purchased the presents from The Entertainer toy store on Carr Street and wrapped them in preparation to deliver them to the children's ward at Ipswich Hospital on Christmas Eve.

The Suffolk Police and Crime Commissioner has donated towards the cause along with the Suffolk Constabulary Sports and Social club.

Cadet leader, PC Glenn Perkins had spoken to his wife, also a Special Constable within Suffolk Police, who works at The Entertainer toy store, Carr Street, Ipswich who has kindly negotiated the store offering a discount on the purchase allowing more presents to be available to the children. The Martlesham Cadet unit have also contributed to the idea.

Suffolk Police and Crime Commissioner, Tim Passmore said, "I am a great supporter of the Police Cadets and was very pleased to hear they are thinking of others less fortunate than themselves at this time.

"I can’t imagine what it is like to be a child caught up in domestic abuse but I am sure that the kindness of the Cadets have made a huge difference to the children staying in the Lighthouse refuge over the Christmas period.

He added, "I am very impressed by the kindness of the cadets and congratulate them on their thoughtfulness. I hope they have all had a lovely Christmas too.”
