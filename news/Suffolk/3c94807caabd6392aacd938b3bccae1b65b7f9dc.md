Officers are warning people to be vigilant following a number of distraction burglaries in Ipswich last Friday, 12 May.

This follows recent five reports that a gang of suspected ‘rogue’ tree surgeons have been cold calling residents, primarily targeting homes with older occupants, and carrying out work to remove trees and branches for a nominal sum. Residents have later discovered property, particularly jewellery and cash, has been stolen from their homes.

The details of these incidents in Ipswich are as follows:

 * Between 12pm and 1pm at a property in Stonechat Road a man knocked on the door and offered to cut some branches from a tree in the back garden, assisted by three other men. The victim later found jewellery, a quantity of cash including foreign currency and personal documents had been stolen.
 * Around 1pm, three men approached a home in Waltham Close and advised there had been complaints regarding some trees in the garden. The victim consented and left the property to withdraw cash from her bank account and paid the men. She later discovered the front door had been tampered with, her property disturbed and jewellery stolen.
 * Between 2pm and 3pm, a man knocked on the door of a second home in Waltham Close with four younger men offering their services to remove some green waste. The victim consented, but later discovered a quantity of jewellery was missing from the home.
 * At approximately 3:15pm, a man approached a home in The Lawns and requested access to the garden, alleging that he and a second man were working at a neighbouring address and needed to ensure their work would not disturb the victim’s garden. The victim later found a quantity of jewellery missing from the home.
 * Around 4pm, up to eight men approached a man in his 30s and a woman in her 60s as they returned to a home in Curlew Road, claiming they were from the council and had been tasked to cut down the trees in the front garden. The men avoided showing ID and, without consent, proceeded to cut the trees down. They left the property as the victims called police. It is believed that no property was stolen.
 * Around 4:30pm, a man knocked on the door of a property in Holcombe Crescent. He had completed some garden work the previous day with four others, and was returning for alleged mislaid property. The victim went to the garden with the man but became suspicious. Back inside, the victim noticed his property disturbed, and a quantity of cash and a black starting pistol missing.

On each occasion the suspects are believed to have been travelling in a white transit van. Some victims have recalled a trailer containing an orange wood chipper. A further report has suggested the van was a white tipper-style lorry, with a black tilt.
