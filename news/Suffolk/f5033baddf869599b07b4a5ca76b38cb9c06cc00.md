A 45-year-old man, of no fixed address, and a 25-year-old man, from Ipswich, were both arrested in connection with four incidents of vehicle crime which occurred over the weekend.

The details of the incidents are as follows:

• At some point between Saturday 27 January at 7pm and Sunday 28 January at 12pm, while a car was parked on a driveway in Everton Crescent, Ipswich, a black men’s New Look coat was taken from the boot by unknown means.

• On Sunday 28 January, a wallet containing a small amount of cash was stolen from an insecure vehicle in Castle Road, Ipswich.

• A car was broken into on the driveway, also in Everton Crescent, at some point between 27 January and 28 January, whereby a number of items were stolen including a Tom Tom sat nav.

• At some point on 28 January, during the hours of darkness, the two males are alleged to have forced entry into a vehicle where they stole two handbags in Chesterfield Drive, Ipswich, before running off. The two males were subsequently detained and arrested on Sunday 28 January, after being located upon police arrival nearby.

The 25-year-old man was released under investigation pending further enquiries in connection with the theft from vehicle incidents, but he has since been re-arrested today (Tuesday 30 January) and is currently in custody at Martlesham Police Investigation Centre in relation to other incidents of theft.

The 45-year-old man has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.
