Suffolk Police are urging residents to remain vigilant following incidents of doorstep crime in the Saxmundham, Leiston and Beccles areas.

Police have received six reports today, Monday 7 August, of rogue traders cold calling residents and demanding cash to repair alleged electricity faults.

There have been reports of a white van seen in the vicinity of some of the homes targeted.

Elderly and vulnerable people are typically targeted by rogue traders, however police are urging residents to also educate children enjoying the summer holidays to:

 * Use the door chain or door bar when answering your door.
 * Ask to see the caller's identity card and check it thoroughly. If you feel unsure, ask the caller to wait on the doorstep while you phone the company to check.
 * Lock the door whilst you go and phone. Don't open the door until you are absolutely sure. Anyone who is genuine will not mind you doing this.
 * Ask them to return at an agreed day and time when you have someone with you. Don't let callers put pressure on you to let them in.
 * If in doubt - keep them out.

If you suspect a crime is in progress always dial 999. If you would like to speak to someone about rogue traders, please contact your local Safer Neighbourhood Team on 101 or Suffolk Trading Standards.

Anyone with information regarding the todays incidents are urged to contact Suffolk Police on 101 quoting CAD 148 of today, 7 August.
