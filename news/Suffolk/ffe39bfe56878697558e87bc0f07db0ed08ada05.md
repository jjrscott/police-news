Police are appealing for witnesses after a public order incident in the Whitton area of Ipswich.

The altercation occurred at around 4.40pm yesterday, Thursday 1 September, in Spenser Road.

A man and a woman were involved in a verbal dispute with two other men, with allegations from both parties of weapons being brandished. One of the men then reported being punched in the face.

Police were called and subsequently arrested two men from Ipswich in connection with this incident: an 18-year-old on suspicion of affray and assaulting a police officer; and a 32-year-old on suspicion of affray.

Both men were taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning where they have been bailed to return to on Friday 28 October pending further enquires.

Sgt Joe Askham, of the Ipswich West Safer Neighbourhood Team (SNT), said: "We are appealing for anyone who witnessed this incident to contact us and assist with our enquiries.

"This is being treated as an isolated dispute between two parties and as such there should be no cause for alarm to the wider community. However, we will be carrying-out extra patrols in the area to provide reassurance.‚Äù

Anyone with information regarding this incident is asked to contact the Ipswich West SNT on **101** quoting reference 53166/16, or Crimestoppers anonymously on **0800 555 111**.
