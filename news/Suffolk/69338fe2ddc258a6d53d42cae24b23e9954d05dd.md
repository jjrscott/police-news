Officers are appealing for witnesses following an assault in Lowestoft.

The incident took place at the childrenâ€™s play in Kirkley Fen Park, Southwell Road on Saturday 4 March at around 4.45pm. A group of three teenagers, two boys and a girl, were approached by three boys, also thought to be teenagers. One teenager accused the group of laughing at him and without warning punched one of the boys in the face a number of times. The victim managed to run off towards his home.

The same suspect then assaulted the other boy in the group before leaving the scene.

The girl in the group had left during the incident but returned with a woman member of the public. The boys who were with the offender then also left the area.

Both victims sustained injuries as result of the assault and were taken to hospital for treatment. The first boy suffered facial bruising and swelling. The second boy sustained facial and eye injuries. Both boys were very shaken up after the incident.

The main suspect is described as being white, aged between 16 and 18 years of age, about 5 feet 9 inches tall, with a stubble moustache and a strong defined jaw line. He was wearing an emerald green tracksuit, black coat and a baseball cap. The two other boys are described as being younger than the main offender and were both wearing black tracksuits with their hoods up.
