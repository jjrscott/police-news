Police are appealing for witnesses to a burglary in Ipswich.

It happened at some point over from Monday 10 December to Tuesday 11 December at a property on Rosecroft Road.

The occupants, both in their 50s, woke at about 2am on 11 December and an hour or so later they decided to go downstairs to have a hot drink. When they got downstairs they saw the internal porch door was wide open and the coats in the porch were scattered on the floor.

They then went into the living room and the female victim saw that the contents of her handbag had been turned out. They then realised their blue Transit van parked in front of the house and his black Renault Clio, which had been parked on the driveway had both been stolen. Other items including phones, tablets and a wallet were also stolen from the address.

Officers would like to speak with anyone who saw a blue Transit van being driven around the Whitton estate between 2am and 5am and appeal to anyone passing Congreve Road or Elmcroft Road junction and Whitton Church Lane or Old Norwich Road between 4am and 5am,and who may have relevant dash cam footage to come forward.

Any witnesses to the incident, anybody with information or persons who were in the area is asked to contact South CID at Landmark House on 101 quoting crime reference 37/71472/18.

Alternatively contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
