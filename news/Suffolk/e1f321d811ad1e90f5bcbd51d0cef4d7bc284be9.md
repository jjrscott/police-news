Police have arrested two people in Ipswich in connection with county lines related drugs offences.

At 10am this morning (Friday 16 October), officers from the South Scorpion team and Ipswich Central SNT executed a section 23 misuse of drugs act warrant at an address on St Helen’s Street in Ipswich.

Officers seized class A drugs believed to be worth £1500 and approximately £1000 in cash.
