Police are appealing for the owner of two Jack Russell terrier type dogs to come forward after a woman in her 30s was bitten in an incident in Palgrave earlier this month.

The woman, in her 30s, was out running with a friend in the Lows Lane area of Palgrave around 11am on Sunday 19 March when the two dogs ran up to her and one bit her on the leg.

The dogs appeared to be with a group of four people â€“ a man and a woman both described as white who were with a young child and a woman who is described as being of Chinese Asian appearance.

One of the terriers is described as having tan spots and the other had grey/ black spots.

Police are asking any member of the group or anyone with information about who they are to come forward. Anyone who can help is asked to call Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting crime number 24102/17.
