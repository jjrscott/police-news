Detectives are appealing for witnesses to an incident on the A1088 at Fakenham Magna near Thetford this morning.

Police attended promptly and conducted a search of the area, including SULSAR and the police helicopter but found no trace.

The woman is described as white, approximately mid to late 20s, approximately 5 feet 5 inches tall and of slim build, with blonde shoulder length dreadlocks. She was reportedly speaking with a man with a beard in a silver car, described as an old silver 5 seater hatchback style.
