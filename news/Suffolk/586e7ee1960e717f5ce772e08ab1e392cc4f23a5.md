Police are appealing for information following a harassment incident in Ipswich.

On Thursday 11 October at 4.15am, a woman was driving her car close to the Queen’s Way and Rands Way junction, when three men approached her car and asked her for a lift, one standing in front of the vehicle.

The driver refused their request and managed to drive around the men and leave the scene, but was left shaken by the incident.

The three men are described as aged in their 30s and spoke with foreign accents.

A Suffolk Police spokesman says:

“It is important to be mindful of personal safety at all times when out and about. If you are approached whilst in your vehicle by people you do not know, do not feel obliged to stop if you feel unsafe. If you feel in danger or require urgent assistance, call us on 999, otherwise report any incidents to police on 101, or use the online form on our website.”

Any witnesses or information to Suffolk Police on 101, quoting reference number 37/58963/18.
