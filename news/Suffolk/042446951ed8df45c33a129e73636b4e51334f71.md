**The RSPCA is asking residents in Ipswich to come forward with information after a cat named 'Lola' was found near her home on 8 Feb with both ears cut.**

The grey and white rescue cat, believed to be four or five years old, was discovered in Cavan Road with one ear cut off and the other partially cut. She was taken to the vet for treatment by the owner’s neighbour and is recovering from her injuries at home.

RSPCA inspector Jason Finch said: “This was a shocking attack on a beloved family pet. At the moment we have very little information as to who did this, so the Police and I are urging anybody who may know something, to get in touch.

“It’s completely horrific to carry out such a nasty act of cruelty on this poor cat.”

Anyone with any information can contact the RSPCA on **0300 123 8018** , or Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting reference 16751/17.
