Police are appealing for witnesses after receiving reports of two incidents where children were approached by people in cars in Ipswich last week.

The first incident occurred at around 3.35pm on Monday 12 March in Park Road.

Two eleven year-old boys were walking along the road when they were approached by a blue medium-sized car, with tinted/reflective windows. The male driver stopped beside the boys and gestured to them to come to him, but they kept their distance and he drove away.

The second incident took place at around 3.50pm on Friday 16 March in Sherrington Road. An 11-year-old girl and two friends aged 10-years-old were walking down the hill towards Norwich Road and as they passed the library, became aware of two cars in the car park near to Broomhill Pool.

The cars were circling round in the car park before stopping and the occupants got out and shouted at the girls to get in, but they turned around and walked back up the hill. The suspects then got back in the vehicles and drove up the hill past the girls.

One of the cars was blue and the other one was black. One of the occupants is described as a white man, aged in his 30s, 5ft 8in tall, of average build, with short dark brown hair. There were also two other males and a female present, the only description being that the female had long brown hair.

Anyone with information about either of these incidents is asked to contact the Incident and Crime Management Hub on 101, quoting 14547/18 in connection with Park Road, or 14539/18 in respect of Sherrington Road.
