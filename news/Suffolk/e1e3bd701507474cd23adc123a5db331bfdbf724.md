Suffolk Special Constabulary will be hosting a ‘drop-in’ style recruitment event next Saturday (3 March) in Beccles.

On the day, which will run from 10am until 4pm and take place at Beccles Town Hall, attendees will have the chance to find out more about the rewards and challenges of policing.

If you are 18 years or older, in good health and of good character, you can apply. You will get full training to become part of a team that deals with a variety of incidents and events across Suffolk.

At the recruitment event interested applicants can ‘drop in’ at a time that suits them and speak to various members of Police and Support Staff about particular aspects of becoming a Special Police Constable.

Attendees will be able to follow the ‘applicants journey’ from start to finish, including how to complete an application form, what happens at assessment centres, details of the training programme, what personal safety training officers receive and speak to Special Officers to find out exactly what it’s like as a Special with Suffolk Constabulary.

If you intend to go along to this event, please confirm your attendance by e-mailing [email protected]. If you cannot attend but would like more information please go to our website www.suffolk.police.uk
