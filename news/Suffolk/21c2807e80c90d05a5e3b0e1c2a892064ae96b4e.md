Two 14-year-old boys have been arrested following two robberies in Ipswich last night.

Police were contacted around 11.30pm on Wednesday, 15 February, to reports two men had been threatened at gunpoint and ordered to hand over cash in the Princes Street area.

Officers immediately began enquiries and the two teenagers â€“ one from Ipswich, the other from County Durham - were arrested on suspicion of robbery around midnight.

Both have been taken into custody at Martlesham Police Investigation Centre where they are being interviewed by detectives in connection with this incident and another robbery around 9.10pm yesterday in Old Foundry Road.

Anyone who may have seen either incident is asked to call Ipswich CID by dialling Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting crime number 17883/17.
