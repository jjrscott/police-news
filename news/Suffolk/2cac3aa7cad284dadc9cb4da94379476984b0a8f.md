Police are appealing for information and attempting to trace a potential witness in connection with an incident of arson in Clopton.

The crime occurred at around 8.35pm on Wednesday 27 September at an address in Otley Road.

A car parked on a driveway was deliberately set alight which then spread to an adjacent shed containing wood. This in turn resulted in fascia and guttering on the house itself being burnt, before the fire service attended and extinguished the blaze.

Detectives are appealing for any witnesses to this incident to come forward, in particular a member of the public who stopped to alert the victims about the fire.

Anyone with information is asked to contact South CID at Landmark House on 101 quoting reference 63663/17.
