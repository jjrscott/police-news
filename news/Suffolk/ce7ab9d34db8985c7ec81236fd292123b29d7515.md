Police have arrested a 19 year old man in connection with an assault that took place in Ipswich.

Officers were called at around 6.40pm on Saturday 25 February 2017 by the East of England Ambulance Service to reports that a 14 year old boy had been assaulted in Norwich Road.

On police arrival the boy was taken to Ipswich Hospital with superficial cut injuries to the face.

The 19 year old man from Ipswich was brought into custody at Martlesham Police Investigation Centre yesterday, Monday 27 February, where he was interviewed by officers. The man has now been bailed to return to Police on 1 May 2017.

Shortly after the incident police arrested a 29 year old man on suspicion of assault but he has now been eliminated from the inquiry.
