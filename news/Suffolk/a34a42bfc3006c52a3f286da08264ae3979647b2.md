Police have arrested three people in connection with the supply of class A drugs in Ipswich.

Yesterday, Sunday 9 September at approximately 4.30pm officers attended an address on St Matthewâ€™s Street in the town.

An 18 year-old-man from Ipswich and a 17-year-old boy from Essex were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of class A drugs. A third teenager, a 16-year-old boy from Essex, ran from police and jumped off a balcony at the property and landed on a flat roof. He sustained minor injuries as a result of the fall and was taken by land ambulance to hospital for treatment but was later discharged.

A quantity of cash and drugs were recovered from the scene.

Police served a closure notice at the address, which prevents any person, other than the lawful occupant to enter the premises, and anyone who does is liable to arrest.

All three people are currently in custody at Martlesham Police Investigation Centre where they will be questioned by officers.
