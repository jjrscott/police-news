Two teenagers have been released under investigation following an incident in Bury St Edmunds.

Officers were called shortly after 6.40pm on Tuesday 21 July, following reports that a male had thrown an unknown liquid in the face of a man, aged in his 20s, while he was in the car park in St Olaves Precinct.

Emergency services were called to the scene and the man was taken to hospital for treatment after he sustained minor injuries. He was discharged from hospital the same evening.

Three teenagers aged 16, 17 and 18, were arrested on suspicion of assault and were questioned at Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre.

The 16 and 17-year-old teenage boys were initially released on bail but have since been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Kyelan Conaty, 18, from Elm Drive, Walsham-le-Willows was charged with two counts of administering a noxious substance with intent to cause injury. He appeared before Ipswich Magistrates’ Court on Thursday 23 July and is next due to appear at Ipswich Crown Court on Thursday 20 August.
