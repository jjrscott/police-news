Police are appealing for public support to trace a man who approached a 17-year-old girl in Lowestoft.

The incident took place around 12:25pm on Thursday 6 October at Station Square.

The girl was walking alone when the man approached her and tried to encourage her to go with him to find a lost puppy, which he described as a ‘rainbow-coloured dachshund’.

The girl felt uncomfortable about the situation and walked away unharmed.

Police would like to speak to the man, who is described as white, in his 20’s and with long blonde hair. He is of small to medium build and was wearing jeans and a hoody.

Anybody who saw anything suspicious at the time, or believes they may know the identity of the men, are asked to call Suffolk Police on 101 quoting 59565/16. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
