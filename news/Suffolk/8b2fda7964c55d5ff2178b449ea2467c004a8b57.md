Police can confirm that a 20 year-old-man wanted in connection with burglary offences has been arrested.

Ricky Watson was detained earlier this morning, Tuesday 27 June, at an address in Newton Road, Stowmarket. Officers from Stowmarket Response and the Scorpion Team discovered Watson hiding within a divan bed.

He has now been brought in Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation centre where he will be questioned by detectives.
