Police are appealing for witnesses to a burglary that took place in Ipswich.

It happened on Thursday 17 January at a property on Eccles Road in the town at some point between 6.15pm and 7pm.

An untidy search took place in the property and electrical items, watches, jewellery, car keys and the occupant’s black Ford Focus ST were stolen.

The car was found a short while later abandoned in Downside Close in Ipswich. Two suspect males were seen in the area of Woolverstone Close/Eccles Road at around 6.15pm hours loitering near a silver Mercedes estate car. One was wearing a grey tracksuit with a black ‘beanie’ type hat and the other was dressed all dark clothing.

Police would be keen to speak to anybody who saw any persons matching those descriptions and/or any similar vehicles at the junction of Woolverstone Close/Eccles Road area at the time stated.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or saw any suspicious behaviour or has knowledge of the incident should contact Ipswich CID, quoting crime reference 37/3389/19
