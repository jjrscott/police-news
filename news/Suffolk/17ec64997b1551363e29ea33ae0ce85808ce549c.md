Officers are appealing for information or witnesses after a serious collision in Lakenheath.

The incident took place yesterday, Monday 7 January at 5:45pm on the B1112, Eriswell Road, near to Lakenheath playing fields.

A silver Renault Scenic car travelling south towards Lakenheath collided with a woman pedestrian who was crossing the road. The woman was taken by ambulance to Addenbrookeâ€™s Hospital with life-threatening injuries.

The road was closed to allow an investigation into the circumstances of the collision to take place but has since reopened.

Witnesses or anybody who may have dash-cam or mobile phone footage captured in the vicinity around the time of the collision are asked to call the Bury St Edmunds Roads Armed Policing Team on 101 quoting reference CAD 311 of 7 January.
