Police are appealing for witnesses after a ram raid incident in Kedington.

The incident occurred shortly after midnight this morning, Thursday 24 August, at a convenience store in Silver Street.

A vehicle, believed to be dark in colour and possibly a SUV, was used to ram through the security shutters of the store. The suspects, thought to be up to four people, then forced entry into the store and stole a quantity of cigarettes before leaving the scene in the vehicle.

Police are carrying out enquiries and are investigating whether this crime is linked to the ram raid incident in Red Lodge last Saturday, 19 August.

Officers would like to hear from anyone who has not yet been in touch and who has knowledge of either raid or who believes they witnessed any suspicious activity in the vicinity of the incident.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Bury St Edmunds CID on 101 quoting reference 56496/17, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
