Police are appealing for witnesses and information following a robbery in Ipswich in the early hours of this morning.

The incident occurred shortly after 1am today, Friday 29 September, at the top end of Portman Road in the vicinity of Barrack Corner, where two teenage boys were approached by two people walking towards them.

One of the victims was grabbed in a bear hug from behind by another unknown person and his wallet was forcibly removed from his pocket. The teenager struggled against the suspect(s) and fell to the floor, at which point the offenders are believed to have taken his backpack and fled in the direction of the town centre.

The victim was uninjured but was unable to describe the suspects on this occasion.

Detectives would like to hear from anyone who may have information to assist the investigation.

If you can help, please contact Ipswich CID at Suffolk Police on 101 quoting reference number 63885/17 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 55511.
