A 32-year-old man from Ipswich has been jailed for the robbery of an elderly woman in the town in 2017.

Rhys Burroughs, of Colchester Road, was sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment at Ipswich Crown Court yesterday, Thursday 25 April, following a three-day trial.

He had denied the charge of robbery against a 79-year-old woman, but was found guilty by a majority verdict.

He had previously admitted a separate charge of burglary relating to an incident at a house in Cemetery Lane, Ipswich, on 27 May last year, where a bag containing a wallet and bank cards was stolen, along with a MacBook Air and an iPad.

The robbery offence took place at around 7.35pm on Sunday 5 November 2017 in Victoria Street.

The victim - who was aged 79 at the time of the offence, but is now 81-years-old - had parked her car at the end of the road where it meets the pedestrian cobbled area outside the Westgate Ward Social Club, which was where she was heading to play bingo as she had done for the previous 25 years.

She got out of her car and put her handbag over her shoulder and across her body, when she was approached from behind by Burroughs, who put his arm around her neck, pushed her against the car and grabbed hold of her bag.

The suspect continued to pull at the bag resulting in the victim spinning around and falling to the ground. He then forced the bag off her and ran off towards London Road.

The incident was captured on CCTV and following an extensive search of other cameras in the area, a man matching the appearance of the suspect was located walking towards the vicinity of the attack and near to the Co-op on Handford Road around nine minutes afterwards.

This suspect was identified as Rhys Burroughs and he was found to have used the victims’ bank card, making a number of contactless purchases and even buying credit for his own mobile phone.

A distinctive bag Burroughs was carrying at the time of the offence was also discovered discarded nearby and contained documents relating to him. The victim’s mobile phone was located near to this bag.

> Detective Sergeant Craig Powell, of the Serious Crime Disruption Team, said: “Rhys Burroughs will now have plenty of time in prison to contemplate his deplorable and cowardly actions on that November evening in 2017.
>
> “I cannot imagine what goes through the mind of a man aged in his 30s to assault and rob a woman aged in her late 70s, it was a despicable act targeting an entirely innocent lady on her way to bingo.
>
> “The impact on the victim’s life has been significant. She suffers from bad dreams and paranoia and no longer feels safe in her own home. The attack shocked not just the victim, but also her family and friends and she feels that her life will never be the same again, as her confidence has been destroyed. I am really grateful the victim has found the courage to share the effect this incident has had on her and her family.
>
> “The likes of Rhys Burroughs should heed these words and realise the lasting and often irreversible effect their actions have on their victims. We will continue to pursue the perpetrators of these crimes and bring them to justice.”

Police investigating a robbery of a woman aged in her 70s in Ipswich earlier this month have arrested a man in connection with the incident.

The crime took place at around 7.35pm on Sunday 5 November in Victoria Street.

The victim, aged 79, had parked her car at the end of the road where it meets the pedestrian cobbled area outside the Westgate Ward Social Club.

She got out of her car and put her handbag over her shoulder and across her body when she was approached by a male who then grabbed hold of the bag. The suspect continued to pull at the bag resulting in the victim falling to the ground. He then forced the bag off her and ran off towards London Road.

Yesterday, Tuesday 21 November, officers investigating this offence arrested a 30-year-old man of no fixed abode on suspicion of robbery. He was questioned by detectives at Martlesham Police Investigation Centre and has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Detectives are continuing to try to trace four potential witnesses. One of these is believed to have walked past the victim’s car and the suspect just before the robbery takes place. They are described as: male, wearing trainers, black baggy trousers/jogging bottoms, a large black coat and a black baseball cap.

The other three people walked across Victoria Street moments after the incident. They came from the direction of the social club in Prospect Street and walked beside the Masons PH into Ainslie Road. They can be seen in CCTV footage of the robbery which was previously released by police.

The victim’s handbag has also still not been recovered. This is described as a non-leather brown bag, containing a phone in a glittery case, brown-framed bifocal glasses in a red case, and a brown purse with a zip in the middle and a trinket on the zip.

Any witnesses who may have seen a male in the area of the attack between 7.25pm and 7.45pm, or anyone with information about this crime, is asked to contact South CID at Landmark House on 101 quoting reference 71642/17, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Detectives are renewing appeals for information and issuing a description of a witness they are trying to trace after a woman aged in her 70s was robbed in Ipswich.
The incident took place at around 7.35pm on Sunday 5 November in Victoria Street.

The victim, aged 79, had parked her car at the end of the road where it meets the pedestrian cobbled area outside the Westgate Ward Social Club.

She got out of her car and put her handbag over her shoulder and across her body when she was approached by a male who then grabbed hold of the bag. The suspect continued to pull at the bag resulting in the victim falling to the ground. He then forced the bag off her and ran off towards London Road.
The suspect is described as a male wearing dark clothing.

Officers investigating this incident have conducted numerous enquires this week, including reviewing hours of CCTV footage from the wider area near to where the crime occurred.

Following this work another potential witness has been identified. This person is believed to have walked past the victim’s car and the suspect just before the robbery takes place. They are described as a male, wearing trainers, black baggy trousers/jogging bottoms, a large black coat and a black baseball cap.

The victim’s handbag has also not been recovered. This is described as a non-leather brown bag, containing a phone in a glittery case, brown-framed bifocal glasses in a red case, and a brown purse with a zip in the middle and a trinket on the zip.

Police are continuing to try to trace three people seen on CCTV walking across Victoria Street moments after the incident. They can be seen in footage of the robbery which was previously released by police.

Detective Chief Inspector Nick Power said: "This was a despicable and cowardly crime and we are appealing for anyone with information about it to come forward and help us to catch the person responsible.

"In addition to the three people who walked through the area shortly after the robbery, we now believe another person walked directly past the victim’s car and the suspect just moments before it occurred.

"This person in particular could provide us with vital information regarding the suspect and I am urging them, and anyone else who was in the area around the time of the incident on Sunday evening, to call us without delay.”

The incident took place at around 7.35pm on Sunday 5 November in Victoria Street.

The victim, aged 79, had parked her car at the end of the road where it meets the pedestrian cobbled area outside the Westgate Ward Social Club.

The suspect is described as a male wearing dark clothing.

This weekend officers conducted checks in the vicinity of Victoria Street one week on from the incident, between 6pm and 9pm on Sunday 12 November. Over 100 members of the public were spoken to and leaflets with information about the robbery were handed out.

Officers have continued searching through CCTV footage from the wider area near to where the crime occurred and have identified two further images of the person who they believe to be the suspect. This person walked along London Road, into Surrey Road, turning right at the end into Prospect Street, then towards the social club and Victoria Street.

Detectives are also continuing to try to trace four potential witnesses. One of these is believed to have walked past the victim’s car and the suspect just before the robbery takes place. They are described as: male, wearing trainers, black baggy trousers/jogging bottoms, a large black coat and a black baseball cap.

Detective Chief Inspector Nick Power said: “Our officers are following a number of lines of enquiry to identify the person responsible for this horrendous crime and I am certain that several people will have passed him on his way to commit the robbery.

“We are grateful to all the members of the public who took the time to speak with officers on Sunday, but we have still not yet traced those witnesses that we know were in the area immediately before and after the attack.

“I am urging anyone who believes they may have been in the area, or who has any information regarding the suspect, to contact us immediately.
