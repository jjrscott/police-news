Police are appealing for witnesses following a serious road traffic collision in Eye.

Officers were called by the ambulance service shortly after 6.30pm on Thursday 26 September following reports of a collision in Cranley Green Road, involving a single-vehicle – a Volkswagen Golf – which left the road, collided with a tree and caught fire.

Emergency services attended the scene and the driver - a man aged in his 40s - was flown to Ipswich Hospital by air ambulance after sustaining potentially life-changing injuries.

A woman in her 30s, who was also in the vehicle, was taken to Ipswich Hospital after she sustained non-life-threatening or life-changing injuries.

Anyone who may have witnessed the collision, saw the manner of driving of the vehicle prior to the collision, or who may have captured any dash-cam footage of the incident is asked to contact Sergeant 1178 Paul Jackson of the Joint Roads and Armed Policing Team quoting CAD 384 of 26 September.
