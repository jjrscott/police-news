Police can confirm that a woman has died following a serious collision on the A1071 at Hintlesham.

Officers were called shortly after 5.35pm yesterday, Monday 29 March, to reports of a collision involving a Honda motorcycle and three cars – Ford S Max, Ford Mondeo and Mini Cooper.

An ambulance and air ambulance were also in attendance and the motorcyclist – a woman aged in her 30s – was sadly pronounced deceased a short time later at the scene.
