Police are releasing a CCTV image of a man officers would like to speak to after another man was subjected to racial abuse in Beccles.

The incident occurred at around 1.45pm on Friday 25th November 2016 in the town centre.

The victim walked from New Gate into Sheepgate, where he met another family member. As they walked along Sheepgate they encountered the suspect, who began to make racially abusive remarks towards him.

This abuse continued for around two to three minutes until they reached the junction of Hungate and Blyburgate, at which point the suspect began to walk away from them

A similar incident occurred later in the afternoon in another part of the town centre when a man, believed to be the same suspect made racially abusive remarks towards another victim

Police are keen to speak to the man seen on CCTV and are asking anyone who may recognise him to come forward.

The suspect is described as white, aged in his thirties or forties, of average height and stocky build and with a ginger/brown beard. He was wearing a green wool beanie hat with a shield motif on the front, a zip-up fleece jacket, dark cargo-style trousers, and ‘work’ boots. He spoke with a local accent.

Officers are asking anyone who may recognise the man in the image to come forward. If you have any information about who he is or if you witnessed the incident itself please call Suffolk Police by dialling **101** , quoting crime number 68329/16.
