Police were called on Sunday 9 December at 2.45 pm to reports of hare-coursing in progress in a rural location near Burgate.

Officers were quickly despatched to the location and arrested a 33-year-old man from the Surrey area on suspicion of offences under the Hunting Act. He was also arrested on suspicion of driving with excess drugs, possession of an offensive weapon and driving a vehicle with no valid motor insurance. Officers also seized a Toyota Hilux vehicle, under the Hunting Act.

The man has now been released under investigation whilst enquiries continue.

Sergeant Brian Calver from the Rural Policing Team said, “I would urge the public to be vigilant and report any suspected incidents of hare-coursing in progress by calling 999. Members of the public should not to place themselves in danger. The persons involved in this kind of criminality are often dangerous offenders who are willing to use violence upon anybody to assist their escape, with no regards for the welfare of those that may try to stop them.”

Witnesses or anybody with any information are asked to call Police on 101 quoting reference 71199/18. Alternatively call the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
