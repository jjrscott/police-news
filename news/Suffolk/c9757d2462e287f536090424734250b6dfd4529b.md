Police are appealing for witnesses or information following an attempted burglary near Bury St Edmunds earlier today, Thursday 17 August.

The incident took place at a property on Woodland Place, Great Barton, at around 12:30pm. It is believed that the offender(s) attempted to break-in via a door at the back of the house but were unable to gain access.

This incident follows a burglary at the same address, which occurred at some point between 28 and 31 July, where a television was among the items believed to be stolen.

Police are investigating a possible link between the incidents and are urging witnesses or those with information to come forward.

Anybody who may have witnessed either incident, saw anyone acting suspiciously or who has information that may help with enquiries are asked to call West CID at Suffolk Police on **101** quoting reference 55332/17. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on **0800 555 111** or through their online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
