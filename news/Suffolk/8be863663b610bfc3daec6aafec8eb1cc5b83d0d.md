A 26-year-old Ipswich man has been sentenced to over five years in jail after an attempted stabbing in the town earlier this year.

Luke Mason of Old Norwich Road, Ipswich was sentenced to 66 months in prison for attempted grievous bodily harm, intentionally threatening a person whilst in possession of a knife in a public place, and assaulting an emergency worker.

Police were called on Friday 18 July at 8:45pm to reports of a man holding a knife, chasing another man in Dickens Road in the town. Police were on the scene quickly and arrested a man. He was brought to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning. The victim, a 29 year old man, didn’t sustain any injuries in the incident.

Mason was subsequently charged with the offences and was sentenced at Ipswich Crown County on Thursday 3 December after pleading guilty to the three offences.

Investigating Officer Detective Inspector Craig Powell of Ipswich CID said: "The victim was incredibly fortunate not to have sustained any injuries in this incident and must have been truly horrifying for him to experience.

"We carry out regular proactive operations across Suffolk as part of our ongoing commitment to take as many knives and weapons off our streets as possible.

"This sentence should act as a reminder that knife crime does not pay and that anyone considering carrying a knife to think long and hard about the consequences. If you injure or kill someone with a knife it will be both detrimental to the victim and their families as well as to the family of the offender.”

Anyone with information on knife crime in their local community is asked to contact Suffolk Police on 101, or pass information to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
