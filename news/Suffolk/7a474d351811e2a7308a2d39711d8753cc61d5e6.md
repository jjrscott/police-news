Police are appealing for witnesses following a single vehicle collision in Frostenden.

Officers were contacted shortly after 3:45pm on Sunday 23 July to reports a car, a blue Jaguar, had come off the road and collided with a tree on the southbound A12.

The driver and one passenger sustained minor injuries, however medical treatment was not required.

Police are particularly keen to trace three motorists - of a red car, a silver BMW and a motorcycle - who are believed to have been in the area at the time of the incident and who may be able to assist with enquiries.

Any other witnesses to the collision, or anyone with information about the incident, are asked to contact the Roads Policing Unit at Suffolk Police by calling 101, quoting CAD 266 of 23 July. Alternatively, this can be reported online via the ‘Report Something’ page on the Suffolk Police website: www.suffolk.police.uk.
