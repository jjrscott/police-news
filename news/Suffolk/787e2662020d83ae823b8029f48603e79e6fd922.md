Police are appealing for information after a boy was bitten by a dog in Newmarket.

The boy was walking with his father near Co-op in Elizabeth Avenue at approximately 4pm on Wednesday 5 September, when the boy, who placed his hand out, was bitten after a dog jumped up, causing a minor injury to his lip and bruising to his nose.

The dog, which was tied-up unsupervised outside the supermarket, has been described as large, with brown fur and with a long face. It is believed the dog was retrieved by a man who is described as white, middle aged, with dark hair. He was wearing a white t-shirt with a logo on the front.

Anyone who may have witnessed the incident, or anyone with information, should contact Suffolk police on 101 quoting reference 37/51137/18.

Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
