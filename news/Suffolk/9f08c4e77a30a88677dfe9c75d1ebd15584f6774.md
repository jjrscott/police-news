A 16-year-old boy has been given a Criminal Behaviour Order banning him from entering the borough of Ipswich for 18 months after pleading guilty to a series of crimes in the town.

The teenager, who can’t be named because of his age, appeared at Ipswich Youth Court last Thursday, 15 June, and was sentenced after pleading guilty to theft of a motor vehicle, aggravated vehicle taking and four charges relating to driving a vehicle with no licence and no insurance.

The sentence included an 18-month community order, a three-month curfew between 7pm and 8am, a driving disqualification for 18 months and the Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) which prohibits him from entering Ipswich unless he is under the supervision of a parent/ foster carer.

The CBO also bans him from being in possession of any motorised vehicle in a public place unless he is the legal owner, that he is legally entitled to drive and that the vehicle is registered with the DVLA, with road tax and insurance, and not to associate with three named individuals.

He was also ordered to pay £200 compensation.

The aggravated vehicle taking and theft of motor vehicle crimes both relate to mopeds being stolen in the Ipswich area – one in April, the other in May this year.
