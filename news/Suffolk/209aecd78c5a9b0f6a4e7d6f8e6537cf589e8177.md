Police are appealing for witnesses following a distraction burglary in Haverhill.

The incident occurred at around 2.30pm yesterday afternoon, Wednesday 8 November, at an address in Sorrel Walk.

The victim, a woman aged in her 80s, received a call at the door from a man claiming there was a water leak outside and he needed to run her taps.

This man kept the victim occupied in the kitchen for around 30 minutes and after he left, she then realised that during this time a second person had entered the house, gone upstairs and stole a large amount of jewellery from the bedroom.

The suspect is described as white, aged in his 40s, approximately 5ft 10in tall, of medium build, with dark stubble and a distinctive scar on his lip. He was wearing a dark grey jacket, a dark peak hat and spoke with a northern accent.

Detectives are appealing for anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area yesterday afternoon, particularly between 2pm and 3pm, to make contact.

Anyone with information about this crime is asked to contact West CID at Bury St Edmunds Police Station on 101 quoting reference 72255/17, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
