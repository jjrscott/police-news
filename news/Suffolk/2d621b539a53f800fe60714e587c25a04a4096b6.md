A man has been jailed for over three years following a burglary in Lowestoft.

47 year old Mark Taylor of no fixed abode was jailed after being sentenced at Ipswich Crown Court on Tuesday 15 January. At an earlier hearing Taylor pleaded guilty.

It follows a burglary at a property on St Peter’s Street in the town that took place on 10 December at some point between 8.30am and 6pm.

The female victim had returned home that day to find that her house, which had been left locked and secure, to discover the rear downstairs window of the property had been smashed and the property entered and searched. Various electrical items and jewellery had been removed from the property. These included a 40inch TV, a Sky box , a DVD and items of jewellery.

Enquiries by officers led them to arrest Taylor on 17 December where he was taken to Great Yarmouth Police investigation Centre for questioning and subsequently charged with burglary.

DI Matt Adams from Lowestoft CID said: "The victim was left very distressed when she returned home to find her home ransacked. Burglary, which is a horribly intrusive crime, causes great upset and I can fully understand the devastating effect this incident would have had on the victim.
"We are determined to continue to bring those who are responsible for this type of crime to justice.”
