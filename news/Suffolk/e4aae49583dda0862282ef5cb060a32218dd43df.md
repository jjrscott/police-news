A 25 year-old-man has been charged following an incident in Bungay at the weekend.

The incident began at around 2.40pm, on Saturday 12 May, when a vehicle failed to stop for officers in Trinity Street, Bungay. A brief police pursuit then took place and officers located the vehicle a short time later in Garden Close.

The single occupant of the BMW 520 car then decamped from the vehicle and officers attempted to detain him. A second person, a teenage boy, approached officers and assisted the first man to break free. During this, an officer was assaulted and sustained facial injuries.

Both people then ran into a house and a short time later the man came to the door with a knife and made threats to officers.

A number of officers from the roads policing and firearms unit (RPFOU) attended the scene and after a short negotiation with the occupants in the property, two people were arrested at the scene.

Luthfur Ahmed of Garden Close, Bungay, has now been charged with assaulting a police officer and using threatening/abusive behaviour towards two police officers.

A 17-year-old boy from Bungay arrested on suspicion of obstructing police, was released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Ahmed has been bailed to appear before Great Yarmouth Magistrates Court on 13 June 2018.
