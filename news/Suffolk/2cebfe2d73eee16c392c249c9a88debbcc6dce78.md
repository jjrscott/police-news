More than 2,400 motorists were caught speeding in Norfolk and Suffolk during a week-long enforcement campaign.

Officers from the roads policing unit and vans from the Norfolk Safety Camera Partnership and Suffolk SafeCam were deployed across both counties to increase checks

During the campaign, a total of 2,493 were caught speeding, 2,227 of which were caught by fixed/mobile cameras while the remainder were caught by police officers on patrol.

In Norfolk police officers on patrol issued 153 Traffic Offence Reports for speeding and while 103 were issued in Suffolk.

Chief Inspector Kris Barnard, head of the Norfolk and Suffolk Roads Policing and Firearms Operations Unit, said: "Speeding is recognised as one of the ‘fatal four’ offences which leads to people being killed or serious injured in a collision along with drink driving, using a mobile phone and not wearing a seatbelt.

"We target these and other types of offences all year round but these campaigns allow to raise awareness among drivers and explain the consequences of speeding.

"Drivers should adjust their speed to suit the conditions on the road and be aware of hazards. The higher your speed, the less time you have to react. Think…could you stop in time if something unexpected happened in front of you?”

The Europe-wide campaign, co-ordinated by TISPOL, the European Traffic Police Network, ran from 18-24 April.

Motorists caught speeding face a £100 fixed penalty notice and three points on their licence, or may have the option to complete a Speed Awareness course. Under certain circumstances drivers could be taken to court where they may face larger fines and disqualification from driving.
