Police are appealing for witnesses following a burglary at a sports and social club in Trimley St Martin last week.

The incident occurred at around 11.30pm on Tuesday 7 October at the premises in High Road.

Entry was gained by smashing the glass in a rear door and once inside the offenders forced open the bar shutters, stealing a number of bottles of alcoholic and soft drinks.

Officers were called and arrived shortly afterwards, but the offenders had left the scene.

There were at least three suspects using a small dark-coloured vehicle which made-off in the direction of the roundabout junction with Howlett Way.

Significant damage has been caused to the building, which is estimated to cost several thousand pounds to repair.

Any witnesses, or anyone with information about this crime, are asked to contact the Neighbourhood Response Team at Rhodes House on 101 quoting reference 57911/18, or the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
