A 16 year old boy from Haverhill has been arrested on suspicion of drug offences in the town.

The teenager was arrested on Thursday 15 November on Camps Road and detained under the Misuse of Drugs Act. Following a search he was found to be in possession of a knife, a small amount of cannabis and a small quantity of cash.

He was arrested on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon and suspicion of possession of drugs and taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre for questioning. Upon a further search at the custody suite he was found to be in possession of over 100 wraps of class A drugs.

He was subsequently released under investigation pending further enquiries.

The supply and dealing of illegal drugs will not be tolerated and residents can be reassured that any information passed to police will be acted on.

Anyone concerned about drug related activity in their neighbourhood should contact police on 101, or you can provide any information anonymously by calling the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.
