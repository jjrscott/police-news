Police are appealing for witnesses following a serious road traffic collision in Ipswich.

Officers were called shortly before 1.40pm yesterday, Thursday 9 August to reports of a collision involving a car and a pedestrian in Burrell Road. A silver Rover 25 travelling east on Burrell Road collided with a pedestrian at the junction of Princes Street.

Ambulance and air ambulance crews were also in attendance and the pedestrian – a 21-year-old man – was airlifted to Addenbrooke’s Hospital having sustained serious head injuries.

Road closures were put in place whilst a collision investigation took place.

Any witnesses to the collision are asked to contact Suffolk Constabulary’s Roads Policing and Firearms Operations Unit on 101 quoting reference CAD 215 of 9 August. Officers are particularly keen to hear from anyone who may have dash cam footage.
