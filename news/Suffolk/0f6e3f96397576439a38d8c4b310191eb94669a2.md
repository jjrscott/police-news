Detectives are appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Lowestoft

The incident took place last night, Tuesday 26 September, at around 11.30pm. An elderly man walking in Spurgeon Score in the town was struck from behind by a person. As a result the victim fell to the floor and lost consciousness, during which time his wallet was stolen from his jacket pocket.

The victim has been extremely shaken as a result of this incident. He has sustained a suspected fractured hand and has cuts to his face, hands, knees and ribs which required medical treatment.

Witnesses to the incident or anybody who saw anything suspicious at the time are asked to call Police on 101 reference 63471/17. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
