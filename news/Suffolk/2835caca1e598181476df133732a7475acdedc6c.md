Police are appealing for information after a burglary at a shop in Malting Lane in Clare earlier this morning.

Officers were alerted at 4.50am today, Tuesday 16 May, to reports a black Jeep-style 4x4 vehicle, with a large radiator panel and a bull bar on the front, had been driven into a side door at the shop, triggering an alarm.

Police arrived and discovered two cabinets had been smashed open and a quantity of jewellery had been stolen.

Itâ€™s thought at least two men, dressed in dark clothing, were involved and the vehicle appeared to drive off in the direction of Stoke-by-Clare following the incident.

Officers are also looking at whether the crime may be linked to an attempted burglary in Glemsford around 4.25am yesterday, Monday 15 May, where a 4x4 vehicle was driven at a store in Hunts Hill. Damage was caused to a window and a bollard but no entry was gained to the premises.

Police are asking anyone who may have been in either area around the relevant time who may have seen the vehicle, or anyone with information about the burglary or those involved to call Suffolk Police on 101, quoting crime number 35321/17. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers, anonymously if required, on 0800 555 111.
