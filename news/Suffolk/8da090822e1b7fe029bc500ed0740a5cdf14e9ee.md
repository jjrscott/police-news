Police are appealing for witnesses or information after a male approached a school girl in a park in Lowestoft.

The incident occurred approximately between 3.50pm and 4pm on Tuesday 16 March in Fen Park, in Martins Avenue.

A 12-year-old girl was walking through the park when an unknown male approached her and put his arm across loosely on her shoulder. The girl then moved her body away from him, causing the male’s arm to fall. He then asked the girl a number of personal questions but the girl did not answer and she continued to walk away. The male then left the park in an unknown direction.

As a result of the incident, the girl was left shaken but was not physically harmed.

The suspect is described as male, white and was approximately 5ft 8/10 ins tall. He was wearing a dark coloured beanie hat, a black puffer coat, black Adidas joggers with three white stripes half way down each leg and an Adidas face mask. He also appeared to have very dry and red hands.

Officers have been carrying out enquiries and further patrols in the area.

Anyone with any information about this incident or who saw a male matching the description above, should contact Suffolk police, quoting crime reference number: 37/12962/21
