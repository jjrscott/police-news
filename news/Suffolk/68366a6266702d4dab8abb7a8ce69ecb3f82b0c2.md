A 55-year-old man has been charged with a number of voyeurism offences following an investigation by Suffolk Police.

Martin Thrower, of Church Street, Hadleigh, was arrested at the Buttermarket in Ipswich on August 4, on suspicion of voyeurism. He was interviewed and was bailed to return to police, to allow further enquiries to be carried out.

Yesterday, Tuesday 15 November, he was brought back into custody at Martlesham Police Investigation Centre to be formally charged with eight voyeurism offences.

These relate to incidents dating back to 2014 including six offences this year, on March 20, April 20, May 26, June 29, July 20 and August 4, where males were filmed while in public toilets in Suffolk.

He is now due to appear before Ipswich Magistrates from 9.40am on Monday 19 December.
