Police are appealing for help to trace a prisoner from Hollesley Bay who has absconded.

34 year old Klojan Hodaj did not report for a lunchtime roll-call this afternoon (Sunday 18 October).

He is serving a 10 year sentence for drug offences.

He is described as of slim build, is about six foot one inch tall and has a tattoo on the side of his left leg.

Enquiries are on-going to locate Mr Hodaj and anyone who has seen him shouldnâ€™t approach him but call police, quoting CAD 155 of 18 October 2020.
