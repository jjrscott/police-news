Officers are appealing for witnesses after an attempted aggravated burglary in Mildenhall.

The incident took place yesterday, Tuesday 29 January, at around 11pm on Bunbury Avenue in the town. A man knocked at the front door of a property and tried to barge into the house when the door was opened. It is reported that he had a knife. However, the occupants of the house, a man and a woman, managed to close the door on the suspect preventing him from entering and he left.

Two other men were waiting outside the house during the incident.

Nothing was stolen and nobody was harmed.

The suspect is described as a white man, 20-25 years of age, around 6 feet tall, with short scruffy hair, a goatee beard, tattoos on his arm and spoke with a local accent.

Witnesses or anybody with any information are asked to call Bury St Edmunds CID on 101, quoting reference 5817/19. Alternatively, contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
