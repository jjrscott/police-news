“All Temporary Event Notices are judged on their merits and it is up to individual premises to decide if they wish to apply for one.

“The Station Hotel in Ipswich facilitates all away teams throughout the year, has an experienced licensee and a previous record of good conduct, so there were no grounds for Suffolk Police to reject the application. The first train into Ipswich from Norwich that morning does not arrive until after 7.40am.

“It is up to individual premises to decide if they wish to cater for away supporters and no one can be, or is, compelled to do so.

“The date and time that the match takes place is a matter for the local Safety Advisory Group (which the police attend along with numerous other relevant bodies and the event organiser) and there have been no representations made to the SAG for the kick-off to be moved from the now established time of midday on a Sunday.”
