A man aged in his 20s has been arrested after a collision involving a van and a number of stationary vehicles in Newmarket.

Police received multiple calls from members of the public at around 1.40am this morning, Friday 12 May, reporting the collision in Churchill Court.

Officers arrived at the scene shortly afterwards and discovered that a silver Ford Transit van had collided with five parked vehicles, comprising three cars and two vans.

A 27-year-old man from the Cambridge area was subsequently arrested on suspicion of driving with excess alcohol. He was initially taken to hospital for a check-up and then brought to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre, where he currently remains for questioning.

Any witnesses to this incident are asked to contact the Forest Heath Neighbourhood Response Team at Mildenhall Police Station on **101** , quoting reference CAD 12 of 12 May.
