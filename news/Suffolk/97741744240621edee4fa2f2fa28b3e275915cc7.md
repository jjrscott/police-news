Police have arrested a man in Kesgrave on suspicion of theft.

It follows an allegation that over £1000 raised via a ‘Go Fund me’ page had been stolen. The online appeal had been set up under the premise that it would raise money to buy hot meals for hospital staff who were serving on the NHS frontline, in the wake of the Covid pandemic.

A man in his 30s was arrested on suspicion of theft and on suspicion of harassment and malicious communications on Tuesday 7 July and taken to Martlesham Heath Police Investigation Centre for questioning.

He was subsequently released under investigation pending further enquiries.
