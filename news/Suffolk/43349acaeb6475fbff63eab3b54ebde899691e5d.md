Officers are reminding Ipswich residents to keep their garages locked and secure after two burglaries where garages were broken into.

Both took place in a residential cul-de-sac off Woodbridge Road, near Alexandra Road, at some point between 6pm on Saturday 1 and 8am on Sunday 2 April.

Offenders forced entry into the garages and police are treating these as linked incidents.

In the first a search was made but nothing was stolen, however a charcoal-grey ladies touring bicycle was taken from the second garage. The bicycle is described as having a solid black and grey rear top box.

Witnesses or anyone with information to help identify those responsible are urged to call Suffolk Police on **101** quoting reference 26510/17. Alternatively, for those who wish to remain anonymous, contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
