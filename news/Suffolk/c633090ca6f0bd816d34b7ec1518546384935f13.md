Two men have been arrested following a break-in at a business premises in Stowmarket.

Police were called at 12.30am this morning, Monday 9 November, to reports of a burglary in progress at a retail unit in Wilkes Way.

Officers arrived within a matter of minutes and discovered a window at The Trade Inn had been smashed to gain entry. The burglar alarm had also been activated and a number of electrical items stolen, including Apple iPads and iPhones.

At 12.50am police located a suspect vehicle exiting the A14 westbound at Rougham and shortly after this detained two men. A bag of electrical items was also recovered.

The two men, a 42-year-old from Cambridge and a 46-year-old from Harlow, were both arrested on suspicion of burglary and taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre, where they currently remain for questioning.
