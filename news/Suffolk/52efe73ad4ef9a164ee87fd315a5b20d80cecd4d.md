Police are appealing for witnesses after an incident of affray in Ipswich.

Officers were called to London Road, Ipswich, at the junction of Yarmouth Road and West End Road, at around 7.20pm on Sunday 22 April to reports of a road traffic collision and a subsequent altercation.

In what is believed to be a targeted attack, a silver Vauxhall Corsa is reported to have been deliberately driven into a black Mercedes, which was waiting at traffic lights, which in turn then struck a blue Toyota RAV4.

The male driver of the Corsa got out of the car and made threats to an occupant of the Toyota while holding what is believed to be a machete before getting back into the now damaged vehicle and driving into West End Road.

The Corsa stopped near to the entrance to the EMC Motor Group in West End Road where two males got out of the car and then got into a grey Mini described as having dark tinted front windows. The machete was subsequently recovered near to the scene.

The Corsa driver is described as a white male aged in his 20s who was wearing a tracksuit and the second male as being white and wearing a baseball cap.

Police are appealing to anyone who has information relating to the incident, in particular anyone who may have any CCTV or dash-cam footage, to contact Suffolk Police on 101 quoting crime reference 37/21671/18. Alternatively, they can call the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
