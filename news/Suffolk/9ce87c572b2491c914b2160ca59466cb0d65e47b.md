Police are appealing for witnesses to two incidents of crime related to churches.

The first was reported to police on Thursday 26 October in a church on The Street in Burstall where an attempt was made to remove the roof lead but the offenders failed to do so but caused damage to the church roof in the process.

The second incident was an attempted burglary at a church at Wingfield on Vicarage Road at some point overnight between Tuesday 24 October and Wednesday 25 October. In this incident an attempt to force open the door of the north entrance had been made but failed, causing damage to the door and stone masonry in the process. Nothing was stolen in this incident.

Police are keeping an open mind as to if these two incidents are being linked and also if they are linked to a previous recent theft of lead from a church in Sproughton and which was reported to police on 17 October.

Members of the public should report anything suspicious activity seen around churches and police also ask for scrap and antique dealers to be wary of any silver, lead or other artefacts offered in suspicious circumstances.

Anyone who has knowledge of either incident should contact police on 101, quoting crime reference 37/69625/17 for the Burstall incident and crime reference 37/69570/17 for the Wingfield incident, or they can phone Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
