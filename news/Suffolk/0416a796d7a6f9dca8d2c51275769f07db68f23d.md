Officers in Sudbury are holding a free catalytic converter marking session to help reduce further crime.

The event is taking place on Tuesday 15th November at Setyres, Woodhall Business Park, Sudbury CO10 1WH between 9.30am – 11.30am.

Members of the public are invited to attend during the day to get their catalytic converters marked free of charge by officers to reduce the chances of becoming a victim of crime. No appointment necessary – just bring your vehicle along on the day.

 **Vehicle owners can also follow these tips** **:**

 * Keep private vehicles in a well-secured garage where possible, and if no garage is available, in a well-lit public area.
 * Park vehicles in such a way as to make access to the catalytic converter difficult or parallel with another vehicle if you own one.
 * Keep commercial vehicles in a locked building or compound.
 * Use alarms, lighting and CCTV to deter thieves.

For further information, please contact Sudbury Safer Neighbourhood Team by calling **101**.
