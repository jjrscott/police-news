Police are appealing for witnesses following burglaries that have occurred over the last weekend in Barham, Polstead Heath and Westerfield.

Between 2pm and 6pm, on Saturday 30 January at an address on Tuddenham Lane, Westerfield, the back door was forced and offender(s) made an untidy search of the bedrooms upstairs. The garage was also entered. Whilst it is believed items were stolen, at this stage, it is not known what these items were.

Between 10:30am to 7.30pm, on Monday 1 February at an address on Norwich Road, in Barham, the rear door was forced and the offender(s) made an untidy search of upstairs drawers. A handbag containing the victim’s passport, driving licence and £30 in cash were stolen, along with a bag containing an unknown quantity of £1 coins.

Sometime between 8am and 4.30pm, also on Monday 1 February at an address on Straight Road in Polstead Heath, a rear window was broken to obtain entry. An untidy search was made of the rear living room and bedrooms. It is not known exactly what was stolen but a number of items of jewellery in particular were taken.

At this stage the three burglaries are not being linked.
