Officers are appealing for witnesses after an incident of criminal damage in a Hadleigh carpark.

At around 9.15am on Friday 29 June at the Morrison’s carpark on Calais Street, a black BMW car was deliberately ‘keyed’ causing significant damage. When the victim returned to the car, a witness came forward and reported that he had seen a man damaging the car.

Unfortunately the contact details of the witness were not recorded correctly so police are appealing for him to come forward. Any other witnesses are also asked to contact police on 101 quoting reference 35914/18.
