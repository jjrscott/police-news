Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman in her seventies was robbed in Felixstowe.

The incident occurred at around 11am yesterday morning, Wednesday 16 November, in Vicarage Road.

The victim was walking with her husband when they were approached from behind by a male who grabbed her handbag off her shoulder, pulling her to the ground in the process. She initially hung on to her bag and was dragged a short distance along the grass verge before letting go.

The suspect then ran off into Oak Close pursued by the victim’s husband - who is aged in his eighties – before heading into an alleyway leading into Wadgate Road.

The suspect is described as being aged in his late teens or twenties, of medium build, and with short dark hair. He was wearing black ‘below the knee’ shorts, a black t-shirt and black trainers.

Any witnesses, or anyone with information about this robbery, is asked to contact Southern Area CID on 101 quoting reference 66599/16, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
