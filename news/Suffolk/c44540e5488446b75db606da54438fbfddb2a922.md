Police are investigating following a serious road traffic collision at Stanton.

The incident happened around 9.35pm last night, Thursday 8 September, when a BMX cycle was in collision with a Ford Focus on Bury Road.

A 25-year-old man who was driving the car was arrested on suspicion of driving while under the influence of cannabis. He has now been bailed to return to police on October 29, to allow further enquiries to be carried out.

The cyclist – thought to be in his mid teens – was taken to the West Suffolk hospital with a fractured skull and a broken leg.

Police are asking anyone who may have seen the cyclist or the silver Ford Focus in the area prior to the incident, or the crash itself, to call PC Mike Geeson at Suffolk Police’s Bury St Edmunds Roads Policing team, by dialling 101 and quoting CAD number 444 of yesterday, 8 September.
