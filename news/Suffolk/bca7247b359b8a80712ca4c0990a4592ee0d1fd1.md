Police have arrested two men in connection with drug offences in Ipswich.

Officers carried out a warrant under Section 23 of the Misuse of Drugs Act at a property in Woodbridge Road at around 4.45pm yesterday, Sunday 26 April and an amount of cash and suspected Class A drugs were recovered from within.

Two men, aged 45 and 20, were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs and with possession with intent to supply and they were taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre where they were questioned.

The 45-year-old man was released under investigation pending further enquiries and the 20-year-old man was released on police bail and is due to return on Saturday 23 May.
