Police are appealing for witnesses following a single-vehicle road traffic collision at Alderton yesterday afternoon in which a man was seriously injured.

Officers were contacted just after 5pm yesterday, Monday 19 June, to reports that a white Citroen Saxo that has been travelling east had crashed on Ramsholt Road.

Two men were inside the vehicle â€“ the driver, in his early 30s, was taken to Addenbrookes hospital by air ambulance with serious injuries, while the passenger, in his mid 20s, was taken to Ipswich hospital with minor injuries.

The road re-opened around 10pm.

Anyone who saw the vehicle in the area around this time or anyone who saw the collision itself is asked to call the Roads Policing Unit at Suffolk Police headquarters by dialling 101, quoting CAD number 377 of Monday 19 June.
