Police have charged a man in connection with Ipswich based drug offences

Officers arrested a man, aged 24, in Enfield yesterday morning (Thursday 10 December) for being concerned in the supply of a Class A drugs and he was taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning.

24 year old Teric Aroriode-Francis of Turners Hill in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire was charged with concerned in the supply of Class A drugs, namely crack cocaine and heroin.

He remains in custody and is due to appear before Ipswich Magistrates' Court this morning (Fri 11 December) at 10am

The arrest was made as part of Operation Orochi â€“ an operation set up by Suffolk Constabulary with the Met Police to tackle County Lines drug dealing that operate between London and Suffolk.

Since February 2020 Operation Orochi, led by the Metropolitan Police, has been in place in Suffolk. It focusses on analysing the data of mobile phones used to buy and sell crack cocaine and heroin by dealers and controllers. Officers from the team in Suffolk will share this intelligence with a dedicated team at the Met, who will then investigate to identify the line controller and their location.
