A 29-year-old man from Stowmarket has been convicted of three counts of rape.

Carl Tarigha, of Sheringham Court, Milton Road, had denied raping three women, but was found guilty at Ipswich Crown Court on Friday 27 January following a two-week trial.

The first attack occurred on 25 September 2015 at a flat in Harwich, where the 19-year-old victim had got into bed with her grandmother in an attempt to escape him.

The other two crimes both occurred at Tarighaâ€™s flat in Stowmarket: the first on 23 May 2016 against an 18-year-old woman; and the second on 28 July 2016 against a 29-year-old woman.

Tarigha has been remanded in custody and will be sentenced at Ipswich Crown Court on Friday 17 March.
