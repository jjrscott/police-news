Suffolk Constabulary is giving its support to a national fundraising campaign in aid of the new UK Police Memorial.

The campaign is launched nationally today (Wed 17 May) and Chief Constable Gareth Wilson has pledged his support to the campaign, launched just two months after the Westminster terror attack during which PC Keith Palmer was murdered while on duty.

The campaign will help raise funds to build a new UK Police Memorial at the National Memorial Arboretum (NMA) in Staffordshire.

The memorial will be inscribed with the names of more than 1,400 officers and staff from the police service who have died from injuries they sustained while carrying out their lawful duties.

Chief Constable Gareth Wilson said: "This is an extremely worthwhile cause and one that has a clear and powerful relevance and meaning for us all as Suffolk police officers and police staff.

"The memorial will allow for a fitting, appropriate and lasting tribute to be established in remembrance of those police officers and staff killed whilst carrying out their duties.”

Suffolk’s Police and Crime Commissioner Tim Passmore said: "It is all too easy to forget that many members of the police family put themselves at considerable risk each and every day across the UK.

"Tragically, as recent events in Westminster have shown us, this can result in some giving the ultimate sacrifice in order to keep the rest of us safe and secure. This should never be forgotten and this memorial will be a poignant reminder of that sacrifice for which we should all be eternally grateful.”

The memorial will consist of four distinct strands:

 * The creation of a physical memorial inscribed with the names of officers and staff that will be placed within a beautifully landscaped remembrance garden
 * A digital memorial that uses the latest technology for honour and tribute that can be accessed from across the world
 * An education programme – for use by schools and colleges – that tells the story of policing and its place in today’s society, with an acknowledgement to those officers and staff who have died on a specific day
 * A Living Memorial fund that will support the families of officers and staff killed on duty in the future.

The public fundraising campaign has been launched in partnership with LBC and Express Newspapers and the overall project will cost £4million – so far £2.5million has been raised.

Further information about the Memorial, how to make a donation or take part in fundraising activity can be found at the UK Police Memorial website www.ukpolicememorial.org.

Anyone making a donation of more than £20 will receive a black and white chequered wristband inscribed with the words ‘courage and sacrifice’.
