Police searching for a man who had absconded from Hollesley Bay prison in August have located him.

34-year-old Aaron Johnson, serving a nine year sentence for robbery, wounding and assault, was reported missing to police on Friday 17 August. Johnson had been granted a special purpose temporary licence to attend a funeral but failed to return to the prison.

He was detained by police at Heathrow on Friday 5 October and appeared before Uxbridge Magistrates the following day and has now been returned to the prison system.

Police would like to thanks the public and media for their help with this matter.
