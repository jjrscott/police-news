International Women’s Day is celebrated worldwide and Suffolk Police hosted an event today, Thursday 8 March, pledging its commitment to encourage equality in our communities.

Held at Police Headquarters in Martlesham, the ‘Inspiring Women’ conference was held to celebrate both the achievements and progress made by women, whilst also highlighting the ongoing gender inequalities in today’s society.

Officers and staff from Suffolk Constabulary were joined by women from education, business, charities and support services from across the county including Sue Hargadon, (former head of Farlingaye High School), Diana Porter MBE (Fresh Start- New Beginnings) and Karen Hester (Adnams PLC).

More than 120 delegates included representatives from Suffolk Fire and Rescue and East of England Ambulance Service, along with students from Suffolk New College and Lowestoft Sixth Form.

Superintendent Tonya Antonis, said: "The aim of the event was to bring together women to discuss themes of resilience, empathy, wellbeing and confidence building. It was an opportunity to share inspiring personal accounts of overcoming challenges and embracing positive change in women’s lives.”

Police and Crime Commissioner Tim Passmore said: “I was privileged to be asked to open this prestigious event on International Women’s Day. The conference quite rightly provided an opportunity to reflect on the extraordinary achievements of women in society – both past and present, which provides us all with the inspiration and optimism we need for the future.”
