Police are appealing for witnesses to a robbery that took place in Ipswich.

It happened on Saturday 14 April at some point between 8.10pm and 8.20pm on Ainslie Road in the town.

A 55 year old male was walking down the street when he has been approached by three males. They asked for his mobile phone, which the victim has refused.

One of the suspects has then produced a knife and repeated the threat. This time the victim has handed over the i-phone and was also asked to give his PIN code by the suspects which he did. The victim was unharmed in the incident. Officers investigating would like to speak to two black females who shortly after the event approached the victim to see if he was ok.

Anyone who witnessed the robbery, or has knowledge of it should contact Ipswich CID quoting crime number 37/20088/18, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
