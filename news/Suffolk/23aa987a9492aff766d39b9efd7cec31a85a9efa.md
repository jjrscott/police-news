Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was assaulted in Levington.

The incident occurred between 3.15pm and 3.20pm on Saturday 7 November in Strattonhall Drift.

The victim, a woman aged in her 50s, was walking with her friend and their respective teenage daughters who were riding horses.

However, as the group negotiated the double bend near Levington Lagoon, they became aware of a group of three males who began shouting and swearing at them.

The victim then saw one of the males rev their engine, flash his light and sound his horn, and she shouted at him to stop as he was scaring the horses. The woman approached the male and he then pushed her backwards, causing her to fall to the ground.

The male then revved the moped towards her and rammed it into her knee several times before the group sped off.

As a result of the incident, the woman sustained bruising and attended hospital.

The group of three males, are described as all being aged approximately between 16 and 19-year-old. They were all wearing dark clothing and riding mopeds with L plates on.

Anyone with any information about this incident or who saw anything suspicious is asked to contact Suffolk police, quoting crime reference 37/64769/20
