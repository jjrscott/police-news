A man has died following a single-vehicle road traffic collision in Stradishall.

Police were called by the ambulance service just after 11.30am this morning, Sunday 28 June, to reports of a collision involving a motorcycle on the A143, between HMP Highpoint and the Cherry Tree Public House.

The vehicle was a black KTM 1290 Super Duke and the rider â€“ a man aged in his 20s - sadly died at the scene, despite the best efforts of paramedics and a member of the public who came to his assistance.

The A143 was closed between HMP Highpoint and the Wickhambrook crossroads at the B1063 whilst a collision investigation took place, reopening at 4pm.

Officers would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the collision, or who may have seen a motorbike matching the description above riding in the area prior to it. They would especially like to hear from anyone driving along the A143 and who may have captured any footage on a dashcam.

Anyone with information is asked to contact the Serious Collision Investigation Unit on 101, quoting reference CAD 145 of 28 June.
