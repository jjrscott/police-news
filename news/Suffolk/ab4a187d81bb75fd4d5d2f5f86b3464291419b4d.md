Student officers coming to the end of their training period are holding a community engagement day tomorrow, Thursday 4 May, to introduce themselves to the public in Woodbridge.

Between 10am and 3pm, a mobile police station will be positioned outside WH Smith in the Thoroughfare where members of the public can ask for crime prevention advice, including home and personal security, and for guidance against online crime.

As an integral part of their 18-week training course, the 13 student officers will also be undertaking controlled live role play exercises around the town with the assistance of local businesses and retailers. In these instances, there will be ‘police training’ signs clearly displayed.

On completion of their training, the officers will then be posted to different police stations around Suffolk, where they begin ten weeks with an experienced tutor officer. After this they will then be qualified to patrol by themselves and attend police incidents.

PC Julian Fox from the Learning and Development Team at Suffolk Police, said: "The 18-week training is generally held in a classroom environment, so these real-time situations are vital in providing our student officers with a better understanding of how to interact with members of the public and deal with ‘real’ offenders.

"We would like to thank the local businesses who are allowing us to use their premises to conduct our role play activities.”
