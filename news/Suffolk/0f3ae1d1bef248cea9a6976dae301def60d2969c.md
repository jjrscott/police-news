Two 18-year-old men have been arrested following an armed robbery at a shop in Stowmarket this morning.

Police were called around 8.15am today, Sunday 12 March, to reports a man had entered a shop in Ipswich Street and stolen a quantity of cash after showing staff what appeared to be a small axe.

Officers quickly began work to trace the man and an 18-year-old, from Stowmarket, was arrested around 8.45am on suspicion of robbery.

A second 18-year-old man was arrested around 9am on suspicion of conspiracy to commit robbery.

Both are being taken into custody at Bury St Edmunds where they will be interviewed by detectives.

Police are appealing for any witnesses to the incident to come forward. Itâ€™s known there were other people in the shop at the time and officers would like to speak to them or anyone who may have been in the area who may have information that may assist.

Anyone who can help is asked to contact west Suffolk CID by dialling Suffolk Police on 101, quoting CAD 80 of today, Sunday 12 March.
