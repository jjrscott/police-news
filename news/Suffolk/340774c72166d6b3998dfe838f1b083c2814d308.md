## Previous release | 13 October 2017

Police are releasing CCTV images of a man they would like to speak to in connection with an aggravated burglary in Lowestoft.

Officers were called to a property on The Avenue at approximately 10:40am yesterday, Thursday 12 October, following reports of a burglary in progress where a window had been smashed and which had activated the house alarm.

A member of public reported seeing a man carrying a knife exit the property, who shouted threats as he ran towards a parked car, a grey Volvo.

The suspect drove the vehicle towards Blackheath Woods where it became stuck along a bridleway and he decamped.

Detectives are linking this incident to a second burglary in Snape earlier this week, where a car was stolen.

The break in occurred at a home address in Gromford Lane at some point between 6:30pm on Tuesday 10 and 2:30pm on Wednesday 11 October. Access to the property was gained via a window and keys to the grey Volvo were taken.

The suspect left another vehicle, a red Vauxhall Corsa which is also believed to be stolen, in the driveway of the premises.

Anyone with information about who the man is or about either of the incidents should call Suffolk Police on 101, quoting crime number 66624/17. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
