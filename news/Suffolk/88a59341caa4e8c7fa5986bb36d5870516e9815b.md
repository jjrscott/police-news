Following a CCTV appeal issued last week police have identified two men they wanted to speak to following a robbery in Ipswich.

The incident took place on Wednesday 24th June on Blenheim Road in the town. At approximately 8.00pm a woman sitting in her parked car, preparing to drive off, was approached by two men. Standing on either side of the vehicle, one man leant through the open window and held the steering wheel to prevent the car being driven off whilst the other man leant through the passenger window and, following a tussle, stole the woman’s handbag. Both men then ran off. The victim sustained bruising to her arm.

On Monday 20th July police arrested two men in their 30s from Ipswich on suspicion of robbery. One of the men was also arrested on suspicion of fraud by false representation and assault. Both men were taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning. Both men have now been released under investigation whilst enquiries continue.
