A man has been sentenced after being convicted of two firearms offences in Stowmarket.

41 year old David Heath of Lime Tree Place in Stowmarket was today (8 June 2020) sentenced to 17 months in prison after appearing before Ipswich Crown Court.

It follows an incident on Saturday 11 April at about 7.40pm when police received a report of a man carrying a firearm on Station Road in the town. Officers arrested a man on suspicion of being in possession of imitation firearms. He was taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre for questioning.

David Heath was subsequently charged with two counts of possession an imitation firearm with intent. He pleaded guilty to the charges at an earlier hearing.

Today, he was sentenced to 12 months in jail for two counts of possessing an imitation firearm, with intent to cause fear of violence. He was also jailed for a further five months for breach of a suspended sentence order for possession of a knife/blade in February 2019.

Speaking after his sentence DS Paul Cappleman from Bury St Edmunds CID said: "At the time of the offence Heath was walking around the town, dressed in camouflage gear with imitation firearms, which would have caused considerable alarm to those individuals that saw him.

"It was a highly irresponsible act, which he accepted responsibly for at his first hearing, this sentence from the courts will allow him to reflect in prison on the decision he made that day‚Äù
