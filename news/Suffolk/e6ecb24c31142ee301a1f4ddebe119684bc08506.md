Suffolk Police are appealing for witnesses following a road traffic collision in Ipswich yesterday afternoon.

On Thursday 27 July at 1.20pm, Suffolk Police were contacted by the East of England Ambulance Service to attend a road traffic collision at the entrance to Suffolk Retail Park, on Suffolk Retail Park Road, close to the junction with London Road.

The collision occurred between a blue Skoda Yeti and a pedestrian.

The pedestrian, an eight year old girl, sustained a serious head injury and was initially taken to Ipswich Hospital by land ambulance. She was then flown to Addenbrookeâ€™s Hospital by the East Anglian Air Ambulance.

Her condition is described as stable and it is expected that she will be released from hospital over the weekend.

Anyone with any information should contact Roads Policing on 101 quoting incident number 225 of Thursday 27 July.
