Police are appealing for help to identify three people officers want to speak to in connection with an assault in Ipswich.

The incident happened on late evening at 10.45pm on Wednesday 11 July when a male in his mid 30s was assaulted by the bike racks between McGinty’s pub and Yates’ bar at Tower Ramparts.

During the hours of darkness, suspects have assaulted the victim by knocking him unconscious, causing swelling to the victim's left eye and a possible cracked or fractured jaw requiring hospital treatment.

Anyone who recognises the individual should contact Ipswich CID on 101, quoting crime reference 37/38649/18. Alternatively contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
