Police are appealing for witnesses after further incidents of criminal damage to vehicles in Beccles.

At least nine vehicles parked in Denmark Road and St George’s Road sustained deliberate scratches to the paintwork and it is thought the damage is likely to have occurred between 11pm on Sunday 7 and 6am on Monday 8 May. The majority of vehicles targeted were parked in Denmark Road.

These incidents are believed to be linked to at least a further five other incidents of criminal damage to vehicles parked in St Benet’s Drive and Nicholson Drive, which were damaged overnight on Friday 5 to Saturday 6 May with wing mirrors being broken off a number of vehicles.
