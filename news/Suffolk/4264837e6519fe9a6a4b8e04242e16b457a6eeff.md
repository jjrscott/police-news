Police are issuing a warning to residents across Suffolk following an attempted doorstep fraud in Stowmarket.

The incident occurred at 9am this morning, Wednesday 4 November, in the vicinity of Phoenix Way.

Two men knocked on the door of a house in the area and told the occupant that she owed them £100 for unpaid Amazon purchases, which she knew was not true and so the men subsequently left.

Shortly after this, the same woman then received a phone call from an unknown number, with the caller claiming she needed to pay for items bought on her Amazon account. However, she had already double-checked with Amazon that there were no payments outstanding.

The two men who called at the door are described as follows:

\- Male one: white, aged in his 20s, heavy build and blond hair. He was wearing a gold chain and numerous other items of gold jewellery

\- Male two: mixed race, aged in his early 20s, of slim build and wearing a black converse tracksuit

They did not make any threats towards the woman whose house they called at, or make any attempts to enter the property. They walked off along a footpath, heading in the general direction of Mortimer Road.

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to contact Stowmarket Neighbourhood Response Team, quoting reference: 63986/20.
