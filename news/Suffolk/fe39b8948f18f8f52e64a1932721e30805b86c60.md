A 35-year-old man has appeared in court this morning charged with the burglary of a home in Ipswich.

Police were called by a member of the public on Tuesday, 6 June, reporting a suspicious man on a bicycle carrying a large load and cycling away from an address in Westerfield Road.

Adrian Mills, of no fixed abode, was located by officers and arrested a short time later.

He was subsequently charged with burglary – stealing items including a bicycle, jewellery, cash, a games console, clothing and electrical equipment totalling over £3,000 from the Westerfield Road home - and criminal damage of a garden shed.

Mills made his first appearance before Ipswich Magistrates this morning, Thursday 8 June. He has been remanded in custody and is due to appear at Ipswich Crown Court on Thursday 6 July.
