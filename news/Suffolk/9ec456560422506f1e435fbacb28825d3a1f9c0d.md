A 30 year old man from Lowestoft has been convicted of possession of indecent images of children.

Matthew Gilmore of Denmark Road in the town was sentenced at Ipswich Crown Court (Friday 2 November) to a 10 month jail sentence, suspended for 18 months, after pleading guilty.

The sentence comes after concern was raised by a family member of a teenage girl after he found inappropriate text messages on her phone.

Gilmore’s personal computer and mobile phone was seized and following analysis of the content they were found to contain in the region of 150 indecent and offensive images and 39 indecent and offensive films

Following a lengthy and complex investigation Gilmore was charged in April this year for a string of offences, including six relating to possession of indecent images and two counts of possession of extreme pornographic images.

Gilmore has also been made subject of a 45-day rehabilitation order, to be complied with in the next 12 months, will spend 10 years on the sex offenders register, is subject to a 10 year sexual harm prevention order for 10 years and also made to pay costs of £600.

Detective Constable Robert Dakin from the East Safeguarding Investigations Unit said: "Gilmore had in his possession a vast amount of indecent images - internet crimes such as these are far from victimless where every image depicts the very real abuse a young child has suffered. He will be remain on the Sex Offenders Register for the next decade."

"We will do everything within our power to protect victims who are subjected to these acts of indecency purely for the gratification of others. We would also encourage parents to take an interest in their children's online activities - all youngsters have a right to be safe and protected from harm.”
