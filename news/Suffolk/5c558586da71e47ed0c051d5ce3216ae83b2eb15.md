Suffolk Constabulary is marking Disability History Month as the starting point on its journey to become a recognised Disability Confident employer.

The Disability Confident scheme supports employers to make the most of the talents disabled people can bring to the workplace. The scheme is geared at challenging attitudes towards disability, increasing understanding of disability, removing barriers for disabled people or those with long-term health conditions and ensuring that disabled people have the opportunities to fulfil their potential.

One of the pieces of work HR have already begun is engaging with the Business Disability Forum. This organisation is supporti

ng the force in a number of areas regarding disability such as assisting managers in supporting their staff who have disabilities, policy development, guidance on adjustments, disability and the law and recruitment practices and processes.

Chief Supt Tonya Antonis said: “Securing the Disability Confident accreditation will be a significant step forward the force – we want to be leading the way in our community demonstrating how we are making a positive change attitudes, behaviours in relation to disability.

“We absolutely accept we have a long way to go, but that journey begins here. We are by no means perfect, but this piece of work, led by HR, is a clear commitment that we as a force are keen to improve, learn and widen our understanding of disability based topics and issues. I urge everyone to read and watch the features over the coming month, contribute to the discussion board in December and most importantly commit to making a contribution to securing the Disability Confident recognition.”

* Disability History Month runs Friday 18 November until Friday 18 December
