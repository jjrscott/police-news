Police are appealing for information following an attempted burglary at a business address in Stutton.

Officers were called just before 11pm yesterday, Thursday 2 March, by a member of the public reporting that an alarm had been activated at the premises on Manningtree Road.

Police quickly attended the scene and discovered that attempts had been made to force entry to the building via the front and rear door, which had been damaged in the process.

It was reported that two people were seen running from the scene, before getting into a car and driving away in the Brantham direction. The suspects were both wearing dark clothing but no further description was available.

Witnesses or anybody who has any information to help identify the two people are urged to contact Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting reference 20590/17. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on **0800 555 111** or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
