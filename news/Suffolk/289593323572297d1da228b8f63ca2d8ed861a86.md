Police are appealing for witnesses or information after a girl was bitten by a dog in Ipswich.
The incident took place yesterday Tuesday 24 November at approximately 4pm on a piece of common land on Dales Road in the town.

An 11-year-old girl was bitten on the leg by a brown whippet type dog, that was off its lead.
