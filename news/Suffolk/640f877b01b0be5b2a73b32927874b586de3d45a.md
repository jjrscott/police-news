Police are appealing drivers to keep their vehicles locked and to remove valuable items following a spate of overnight thefts from cars across Stowmarket over the last few days.

Nine thefts have occurred in the last three days (since 1 November) and it appears that offenders are targeting vehicles that have been left insecure by their owners. Items taken have included Sat Navâ€™s, purses, wallets, iPads, iPhones, house keys, cash and credit cards.

Officers are urging motorists to lock their car and remove **all** valuables, no matter whether you park on, or off road. Thieves will enter private properties and garages to look for insecure vehicles.

If you witness anyone acting suspiciously around vehicles please report it immediately to Suffolk Police on **101**.
