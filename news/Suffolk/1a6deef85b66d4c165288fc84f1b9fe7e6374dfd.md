Police are appealing for information after an attempted robbery and assault in Mildenhall over the weekend.

A woman in her 30s was walking down an alleyway off Kingsway, towards Peterhouse Close, at some point between 9:30pm and 9:50pm on Saturday, 5 August, when she was approached by two men from behind who pushed her and made attempts to grab her handbag.

The victim clutched onto her bag and fell to the ground as she struggled against the suspects, who then kicked her in her stomach.

As she lay on the ground, the suspects are reported to have fled the scene empty handed. After a few minutes, the victim was able to walk to a business address in Recreation Way where police were called.

The victim of the attempted robbery suffered some minor cuts, scratches and bruising as a result of this incident but declined hospital treatment.

Both suspects are described as white; one is believed to have been wearing a black coat with a fur hood.

Detectives investigating the attempted robbery are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information about the identity of the men to come forward.

If you can help, please contact West CID at Suffolk Police on **101** quoting reference 53005/17.
