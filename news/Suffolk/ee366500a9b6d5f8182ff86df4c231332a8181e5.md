Police are urging residents to be vigilant after a distraction burglary that took place in Ipswich.

It occurred at a property on Hutland Road in the town yesterday (Tuesday 13 November) at some point between 10.30am and 11.30am.

A male suspect attended a property address where an elderly couple lived to carry out some gardening work. The suspect carried out a very small amount of work which involved chopping a few branches down and he charged Â£120.

The man then requested a cup of tea. When this was brought to him he told the victims that he had actually had asked for coffee. During the time taken to amend the drinks order, the offender has stolen the victim's purse from her handbag and left the house with a large amount of cash stolen.

Police would advise residents that they should always ask for identification from unexpected callers and do not let anyone in until you have verified their identity with the company they work for. Trading Standards advice is never to have work done by anyone who cold calls. No reputable trader ever approaches a customer this way.

The force has launched a new crime prevention initiative, known as 1st Principle, which highlights that simple, inexpensive measures can easily be undertaken by anyone in the community. Further tips and guidance on how to deal with cold callers or rogue traders can be found here
