A Lowestoft man has been jailed following two burglaries in the Lowestoft area.

Vincent Day, aged 49 and from Marine Parade in the town was convicted on Monday 20 November at Ipswich Crown Court.

Day had pleaded guilty to the offence and received a jail term of two year and six months.

Day had entered two sheltered accommodation flats in Lowestoft at some point between 27 and 29 May 2017. In the first incident on 27 May the victim, a woman aged in her 90s, discovered Day in her bedroom looking through her chest of drawers. When she asked why he was there he ran out empty handed. In the second incident on 29 May an elderly male in his 80s saw Day walking out of his bedroom. When he was challenged by the male Day said he was looking for some else and left the location, again empty handed.

Investigating officer DC Kim Shrubsall from Lowestoft CID said: "We were able to arrest Day just a few days after the crimes and build a compelling case against him, ultimately leading to his conviction. The judge also took into account the fact he has previous convictions for burglary offences that occurred in 2012 and 2014.

"Burglary is an invasion of people’s homes and their personal space and can be very upsetting and distressing for the victims. Hopefully the sentence given in this case will provide some peace of mind to Day’s victims and also act as a deterrent to other would-be burglars.”
