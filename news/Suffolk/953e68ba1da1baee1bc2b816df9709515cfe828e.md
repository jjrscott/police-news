Following today’s terrorist attack in London, Temporary Assistant Chief Constable Louisa Pepper of Suffolk Police has issued the following statement:

“We would like to offer our heartfelt condolences to the families of those who sadly lost their lives, and to all those affected by the shocking incident in Westminster today.

“We would also like to praise our London colleagues in emergency services for their courage and bravery.

“Whilst there is nothing to suggest that Suffolk is under any specific threat, policing in the county is constantly under review. Events like these reinforce the need for us all to pull together, remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity.”
