Police have arrested and charged two men in connection with drug offences in the Haverhill area.

The arrests were made yesterday, Thursday 28 May, as part of ongoing work to ensure the county remains a hostile environment for those involved in the supply of illegal drugs.

Two warrants were carried out at separate addresses in Ilford and Margate, where two men, aged 25 and 32, were arrested by officers from the Metropolitan Police on behalf of Suffolk’s Serious Crime and Disruption Team. The two men were brought into custody at Martlesham Police Investigation Centre, where they were questioned.

Maverick Dwyer, 25, of Alder Walk, Ilford, Essex, was subsequently charged with conspiracy to supply Class A drugs.

Christopher Prosser, 32, of no fixed address, was also charged with conspiracy to supply Class A drugs and with an assault on an emergency worker.

The offences relate to Class A drug supply within the Haverhill area between 1 July 2019 and 28 May 2020.

Both men were remanded into custody overnight and are due appear before Ipswich Magistrates’ Court today, Friday 29 May.
