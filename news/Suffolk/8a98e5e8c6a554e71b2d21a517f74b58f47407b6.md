Police are appealing for witnesses following a fail-to-stop road traffic collision in Aspall.

Officers were called at approximately 4:20pm on Saturday 1 July to reports of the collision between a bus and a tractor at the B1077 Eyke Road.

The bus had been travelling out of Aspall in the direction of Rishangles when it was in collision with a tractor travelling in the opposite direction, which failed to stop.

The tractor is described as green and was reportedly carrying a crop sprayer.

No one was injured in the incident, however police are appealing to the driver of the tractor, or anyone who may have seen the vehicle in the area either immediately prior to or after the incident, to come forward.

Anyone with information should contact Suffolk Police on 101 quoting CAD 264 of 1 July.
