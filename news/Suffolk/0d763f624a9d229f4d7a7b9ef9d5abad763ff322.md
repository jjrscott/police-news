Police are appealing for witnesses to a stabbing on Bramford Road in Ipswich.

On Saturday 1 September at 9.35pm, officers were called to Sirdar Road, following reports of an injured man who had suffered stab wounds to his torso and leg.

It is believed that this was a targeted attack, rather than a random incident and it reportedly occurred on the Bramford Road, close to the junction of Sirdar Road.

The victim was taken to hospital for treatment and his injuries are not believed to be life threatening.

Enquiries remain ongoing and detectives would like to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the incident, or who may have any information, such as dash cam footage, that may be of assistance to the inquiry.

Anyone with any information should contact South CID on 101, quoting crime reference number 37/50281/18, or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org
