Police have arrested two men in connection with drugs offences in Ipswich.

Officers executed a warrant under the Misuse of Drugs Act at a property in London Road this morning, Friday 25 November, during which a large quantity of Class A drugs and cash were seized.

A 22-year-old man of no fixed abode; and a 49-year-old from Ipswich; were subsequently arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs in connection with this incident.

Both men have been taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre where they will be questioned by detectives.
