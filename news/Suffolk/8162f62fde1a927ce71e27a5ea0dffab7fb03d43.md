Police can confirm that a man has died following an incident in Newmarket.

Officers were called shortly before 2.20pm today, Monday 10 August, following reports of a medical emergency, involving a man, in Old Station Road, Newmarket.

Despite the efforts of a member of the public and paramedics the man, thought to be aged in his 40s, was sadly declared deceased at the scene a short time later.

Road closures remain in place while enquiries are carried out.

The death remains unexplained at this time but is not being treated as suspicious.

A file will be prepared for the coroner in due course.

Officers would like to hear from anyone who may have seen a man, who was wearing dark coloured jeans with no top on, walking along Moulton Road towards Newmarket at around 2pm today.

Anyone with any information about this incident or who saw anything suspicious is asked to contact Suffolk police, quoting CAD 241 of 10 August 2020
