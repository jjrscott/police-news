On Saturday 8 July, fifteen Stowmarket Volunteer Police Cadets and their leaders will be walking 15 miles from Stowmarket High School to West Suffolk Hospital, to raise money for the My WiSH charity.

The fundraiser has been organised following the sad news that Cadet leader and PCSO Dave Harvey suffered a heart attack in May, following the death of his father.

Dave continues to make a good recovery following treatment received at the West Suffolk Hospital, and all the leaders and cadets are determined to raise thousands of pounds to say thank you for the care and support he received.

Acting Inspector Andrew Martin says: "Dave cannot speak highly enough of the staff at the Cardiac unit at West Suffolk Hospital; the care he received from there was impeccable and Macmillan has supported all of us over the last twelve months. This is the unit’s first charity event and I know they are keen to raise as much as possible, so if you have a few spare pounds please consider making a donation.”

My WiSH is the registered charity of West Suffolk Hospital, and the money raised from the trek will be split between the Cardiac & Macmillan Units at the hospital.

Supporters can donate through the team’s Just Giving page:
