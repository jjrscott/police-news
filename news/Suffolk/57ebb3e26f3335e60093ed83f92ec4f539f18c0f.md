Police are appealing for witnesses after three lambs were attacked by what is believed to have been a dog in Playford.

At some point between 7.10am on Friday 7 September and 7.30am on Saturday 8 September, it is believed a dog entered a remote grass field and attacked the lambs. One of the lambs was subsequently found dead, a second lamb was injured and a third lamb had damage to its fleece.

Officers would like to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the incident or who may have been walking on a nearby footpath.

Police are also reminding dog owners to take appropriate steps to keep their pets under control as they are responsible for them and their conduct when out walking.

Witnesses or anybody with any information are asked to contact Suffolk police on 101 quoting reference 37/51560/18 or use the online reporting link - http://www.suffolk.police.uk/contact-us/report-something
