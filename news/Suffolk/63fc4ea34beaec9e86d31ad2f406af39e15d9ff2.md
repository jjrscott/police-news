Police are appealing for the driver of a mobility scooter to come forward after an elderly woman was injured in an incident in Felixstowe.

Emergency Services were called shortly after 2:20pm on Friday 22 September to reports of a collision between a mobility scooter and a pedestrian on the promenade along Undercliff Road East, near The Fludyer Arms Hotel.

The pedestrian, a woman in her 80s, was knocked to the ground as a result of the collision and suffered a laceration to her lower leg, which was not initially believed to be serious. However, it has since been reported to police that the injuries sustained may be life-changing.

Police would like to speak to the driver of the scooter who failed to stop at the scene. The driver is described as an elderly white woman who was wearing a cream-coloured hat and dark-coloured coat. The mobility scooter is described as medium-sized and blue in colour. It is thought that she continued driving in the direction of the Pier following the incident.

Anyone with information regarding the incident should call Suffolk Police on 101 quoting CAD 245 of 22 September.
