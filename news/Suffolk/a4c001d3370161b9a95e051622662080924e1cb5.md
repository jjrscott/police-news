Police are releasing an image of a man they would like to speak to in connection with three fraud incidents in Suffolk.

All three incidents happened at independent off-licence premises in Ipswich on Bank Holiday Monday, 30 May, and all involved a man posing as a licensing official to con staff into handing over cash.

The first happened around 11am that day, the second around 1.50pm and the third around 3.45pm-4pm.

In each case the man - described as white, around 6ft tall, aged in his 30s to 50s, with dark hair, who was wearing a white shirt, black suit trousers, black shoes and a dark tie – claimed he worked for the council and was there to collect a licence fee that had not been paid. A total of over £500 was handed to the man as a result of the three frauds.

It’s suspected the man may have been involved in other similar offences elsewhere in the country.

Officers are asking anyone who may recognise the man in the image to come forward.

If you have any information about who he is please call Suffolk Police by dialling **101** , or **01473 613500** if you are outside the county, quoting crime number 37/36012/16.
