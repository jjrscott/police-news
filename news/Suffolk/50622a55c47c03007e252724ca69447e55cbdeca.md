A 32-year-old man has been jailed for 876 days after admitting to a burglary in Lowestoft where £3 was stolen.

Toby Mulholland, of Wollaston Road in Lowestoft, appeared at Ipswich Crown Court on Friday, 10 November, where he pleaded guilty to the offence.

Police were called to an address in Alma Street in the town in the early hours of Sunday 8 October after the residents were woken up by the sound of their dog growling and went to investigate. They discovered a window had been smashed and £3 in loose change had been stolen from a handbag.

Traces of blood left at the scene linked Mulholland to the address and he was arrested by officers four days later.

He appeared before Norwich Magistrates’ on Friday 13 October and was remanded in custody before his appearance at Ipswich Crown Court last Friday, where he was given a reduced sentence of 876 days’, equivalent to around two years and four months’, imprisonment for his guilty plea.

Detective Inspector Matt Adams said: "Mulholland is a known repeat offender of burglaries, which the judge took into consideration as he handed down his sentence.
"Whilst the amount stolen was relatively low, the impact it has had on his victims should not be underestimated. Not only had Mulholland broken into their home and stolen their possessions, but he has also caused damage in the process.

"The courts treat home burglary very seriously and our officers will continue to target offenders who are responsible for these types of offences.”
