Police are appealing for a teenage boy to come forward after he approached a 12-year-old girl in the cemetery between Colchester Road and Cemetery Lane in Ipswich.

The incident happened around 3.15pm – 3.25pm on Thursday, 13 July, as the girl walked through the cemetery, near the crematorium. She was followed and then approached by the boy – described as around 14 – 15 years old, with a tanned complexion, dark hair and an English accent, who was wearing a red short sleeved top with black marking on the front and riding an orange mountain bike.

He made several comments which made her feel uncomfortable before he was called away by another teenager and cycled off.

The incident was reported to police on Friday, 14 July.

Officers are asking the teenager or anyone who knows who he is to come forward. If you can help please call Suffolk Police on 101, quoting CAD number 207 of 14 July.
