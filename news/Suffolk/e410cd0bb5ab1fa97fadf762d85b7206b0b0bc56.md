Police are appealing for information after a vehicle stolen from Bull Road in Ipswich was found abandoned in Morland Road.

The white Nissan Juke was stolen from Bull Road at some point after 8.15pm last night, Wednesday 7 June. Just before 3am this morning, Thursday 8 June, the vehicle was spotted by police on patrol, prior to it being reported as stolen, in Sandy Hill Lane and it was then driven off at speed and failed-to-stop for officers in Landseer Road.

Police then found the vehicle abandoned in Morland Road.

Several items were missing from the Nissan including a Mothercare Havana car seat and a Silver Cross Reflex pushchair, each worth around Â£200.

Police are appealing for anyone with information that may help enquiries to come forward. Officers are particularly keen to hear from you if you saw the white Juke in the area after 8.15pm, if you saw it being abandoned, if you have any information about who took the vehicle or if you know where the items that were inside the vehicle are now.

If you can help please contact officers at Ipswich by dialling Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting crime number 40187/17.
