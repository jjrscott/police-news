Police are issuing CCTV images of a man they would like to trace following an assault at a convenience shop in Trimley St Martin.

The incident took place at around 7.15pm on Thursday 28 January at McColls in High Road.

A customer was approached by a man inside the shop who said something to her and then headbutted her in an unprovoked attack. This knocked the victim’s glasses off and resulted in her sustaining bruising to her cheek and nose, along with a headache.

Officers are releasing CCTV images of a man they would like to speak to in connection with the incident.

He is described as white, approximately 5ft 5in tall, with what appears to be pitted acne scars on his face. He was wearing a dark-coloured hooded top, with grey sleeves and had the hood up.

Anyone who believes they know the man pictured in the images, or who has any information about this incident, is asked to contact the Crime Coordination Centre quoting reference: 4839/21.
