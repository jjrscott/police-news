Four men were arrested by police following an allegation of hare coursing in Wortham at the weekend.

Officers were called at 7.55am on Sunday 27 November to reports of a group of men with dogs and a vehicle in a field near to Low Road.

Police units were immediately dispatched, arriving in the village within 20 minutes. A search of the surrounding area was carried-out, but the suspects were initially not located.

Over three and a half hours later at around 11.45am, officers on patrol on the A14 westbound at Rougham stopped a silver Subaru car containing four men and five dogs.

The vehicle and the dogs were seized under the Wildlife and Countryside Act and the occupants were all arrested on suspicion of trespassing in pursuit of game. Their details are as follows:

 * A 29-year-old man from the Stowmarket area of Suffolk
 * A 43-year-old man from the Wallington area of Surrey
 * A 27-year-old man from the Lingfield area of Surrey
 * A 22-year-old man from the Hailsham area of East Sussex

All four men were taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre for questioning, were they have been bailed to return to on Tuesday 10 January 2017 pending further enquiries.

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to contact Suffolk Police on **101** quoting reference 68488/16.
