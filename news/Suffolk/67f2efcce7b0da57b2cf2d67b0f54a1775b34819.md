Police are appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Ipswich last week.

The incident occurred just after 9pm on Thursday 7 February in St Matthewsâ€™ Street.

The victim, a 19-year-old woman, was waiting at a bus stop between the junctions with Westgate Street and Civic Drive, where she was using her mobile phone.

At this point she was approached by a male who grabbed her phone from behind her. The victim shouted out for help and the offender kicked her foot, before dropping the phone on the ground resulting in the screen smashing.

The suspect then ran off towards the underpass at Civic Drive. He is described as black, of slim build, wearing a black hooded top with the hood up, dark-coloured bottoms, trainers and had a rucksack on his back.

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to contact South CID at Landmark House in Ipswich on 101, quoting reference 7600/19. Alternatively contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
