Police are appealing for witnesses following a burglary at a home address in Great Cornard.

The break-in occurred on Friday 24 November between 5.15pm and 9pm at the property in Bures Road.

At some point during the times stated the offender(s) forced open a rear door to gain access before an untidy search was carried out. Various items were stolen including a chainsaw, jewellery, a television and an amount of cash.

It is thought three male suspects were witnessed on the footpath which leads to the property as an occupant arrived home. Shortly after, a vehicle with its lights on pulled up behind them obscuring their view, before it drove off quickly in the direction of Bures.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has any knowledge of it should contact Bury St Edmunds CID on 101, quoting crime reference 37/75629/17 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
