Suffolk Police are launching a new fortnightly police advice surgery in west Ipswich that will give residents the opportunity to meet their local officers and air any concerns they may have within their community.

Starting from Wednesday 7 September **,** anyone wishing to speak to their local team can meet officers from the West Ipswich Safer Neighbourhood Team (SNT) at a new police advice surgery. These will be held at various locations across Whitton, Whitehouse and Castle Hill on the first and third Wednesday of each month.

 **SNT Police Officer Ben Redmond said:** "We hope that by introducing police advice surgeries across these areas we will meet more residents at a time that is convenient to them. We aim to work through any existing issues to build community confidence in the work we do and offer help and advice to anyone who needs us.

"It is an informal, drop-in surgery and we welcome everyone who wishes to stop and have a chat."

The police advice surgery dates and opening times may vary each month. These will be advertised in advance on social media and locally.

The first surgery will be on Anglia Parkway South on Wednesday 7 September between 10am and 1pm.

Follow @IpsWestPolice on Twitter to see when the next surgery is near you.

Alternatively you can email [email protected] or call the team by dialling Suffolk Police on 101.

Locations will be;

 **Whitehouse** – Morrisons, Westbourne, Ulster Avenue, Limerick Close Community Centre

 **Whitton** – Anglia Parkway, Sport Centre, Ormiston, Congreve park

 **Castle Hill** – Fircroft Road, Dale Hall Lane
