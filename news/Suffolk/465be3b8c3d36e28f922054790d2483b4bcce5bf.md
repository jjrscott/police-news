Police are appealing for witnesses or information following a robbery in Ipswich.

The incident occurred in Whitehouse Park, in White House Road at around 2.15pm on Monday 8 February.

The victim, a 15-year-old boy, was cycling through the park, when an unknown person came behind him and pushed him off his bike, causing him to fall. The suspect then picked up the bike and cycled away in the direction of Meredith Road.

As a result, the victim was left shaken but sustained no lasting injuries.

The suspect, who was wearing a face mask, is believed to have been wearing black clothing and grey shoes.

The black Lapierre Xm127 mountain bike had red writing on the frame and front wheel and grey on the rear wheel.

Detectives would like to hear from any witnesses to this crime, or anyone who saw a person matching this description and who may have been riding a bike on Monday afternoon (8 February).

Any witnesses are asked to contact South CID at Landmark House in Ipswich, quoting crime reference: 37/6528/21
