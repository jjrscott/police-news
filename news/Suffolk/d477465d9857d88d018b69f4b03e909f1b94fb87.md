Police are appealing for witnesses after a teenage girl was assaulted in Great Cornard.

Shortly before 10am yesterday, Tuesday 28 March, the teenager was walking along Nursery Road when she became aware of a man standing in front of her. As she walked past him, he is said to have grabbed her left arm and spoken to her whilst holding an unknown object against her back.

The pair walked a short while together before the girl was able to break free and run away. The victim was shaken as a result of the incident but was uninjured.

The man is described as white, approximately 5ft 9ins tall and in his mid-thirties. He was wearing a grey jacket with black jogging bottoms and black shoes, with a distinctive white ‘N’ on the outside of both shoes.

Investigating officers have considered links to an assault of a woman in her 40s in Poplar Road, Great Cornard, earlier this month but do not believe that the two are related. They are appealing for anyone with information on either incident to come forward.

Inspector Danny Cooper said: "While we are aware that incidents such as this can cause concern to the community, I would like to reassure them that a full investigation is underway to determine exactly what happened and to trace those responsible.

"I would urge anyone with information regarding either incident, or who believes they may know the identity of the men, to come forward.”

If you can help please contact Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting crime number 25510/17.
