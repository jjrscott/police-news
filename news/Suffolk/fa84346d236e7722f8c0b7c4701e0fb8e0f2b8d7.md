We are always looking to improve how we interact with our communities.

To help us understand how we can do this better, we have created a survey looking at what you would prefer.

Deputy Chief Constable Simon Megicks, “Understanding how our communities would like to hear from us, and how they would like to contact us, particularly in non-emergencies, is important to us. We would encourage everyone to complete this short survey to give us the best possible insight.”

The survey only takes about five minutes to complete and focusses on key questions like: how you would like to receive updates from us on what we are doing or incidents happening now; to how you would prefer to contact us for non-urgent matters.

You can access the survey here.

We would love to reach all areas of our community and all ages so please let us know if there are more ways we can be doing this.

We are keen to keep you informed of the progress and will provide you with updates on our findings on this page.
