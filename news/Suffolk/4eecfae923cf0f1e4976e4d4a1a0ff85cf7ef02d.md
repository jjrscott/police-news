Two men have been charged in connection with a burglary in Felixstowe that occurred at the weekend.

Police were called just after 9.30pm on Sunday 26 July, by a member of the public who believed there was a burglary in progress at a house in Crescent Road.

Officers arrived at the location within a matter of minutes and detained one suspect at the premises. A second suspect was arrested a short while later, having initially fled the scene.

They were taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning and have subsequently both been charged with burglary in connection with this incident. Their details are as follows:

\- James Regan, aged 36, of Shrub End Road, Colchester

\- Stephen Savage, aged 43, of Grange Road, Felixstowe

Regan was remanded in police custody and appeared before magistrates in Ipswich this morning, Tuesday 28 July, where he was committed to Ipswich Crown Court on remand, pending a next hearing on Tuesday 25 August.

Savage was released on police bail to appear before Ipswich Magistratesâ€™ Court on Friday 28 August.
