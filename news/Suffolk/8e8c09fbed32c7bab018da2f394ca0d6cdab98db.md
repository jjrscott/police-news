A 25-year-old man has been sentenced after committing a number of incidents of criminal damage on the Norfolk and Suffolk border.

Aaron Hurley, of Hardley Road, Langley, Norfolk, appeared at Norwich Crown Court on Monday 18 November, where he was disqualified from driving for 12 months and was given a three-year treatment order. He was also ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £85 and ordered to complete a 20-day rehabilitation activity requirement.

He was charged with four counts of criminal damage to vehicles and four counts of causing a danger to road users on Tuesday 18 June.

Hurley admitted at Norwich Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday 19 June to three counts of causing a danger to other road users in relation to incidents on the A140 at Pulham Market, the A47 Straight in Great Yarmouth and on the A143 at Stockton but he denied a fourth count in relation to an incident on the A143 at Thorpe Abbots in which a Triumph Spitfire was damaged by a rock. The offences occurred between Saturday 25 May and Sunday 9 June 2019.

Between his arrest and sentencing, Hurley chose to work with the Operation Converter Team and went on to admit 91 further offences in relation to criminal damage to vehicles.

Police received reports from motorists that rocks or objects had been thrown at their vehicles from an oncoming car during the period between May an
d June, in various villages and towns along the A146, A143 and the B1062.

Commenting on the sentencing, Detective Constable Barry Simpson from the Operation Converter TIC Unit said: "Hurley was visited while on bail and it was clear that there were numerous police investigations that matched the circumstances of the offences for which he had been charged.

“After the TIC process was explained to Hurley and his family, a lengthy interview was conducted where he made voluntary admissions to further offences, with the vast majority having very limited information or detail from the victims. This was mainly due to them driving on dark roads with the headlights from oncoming traffic when their vehicle was struck by something. Many of the reports to Norfolk and Suffolk police came as a result of the initial media release.

“For the investigating officers to be able to update their respective victims with the news that Hurley had not specifically targeted them or their vehicles, will hopefully provide a conclusion to this spate of identical crimes.”

Operation Converter is an initiative aimed at encouraging offenders to admit their crimes. This has benefits for all – police are able to give victims some peace of mind that an offender has been caught for the burglary of their home or the theft of their property and the individual has the opportunity to clear their slate so they can have a fresh start when they are released from prison, without the possibility they will later be traced for a further offence. Offenders have to give sufficient detail for officers to be sure they have committed the crime and these offences are then ‘taken into consideration’ at sentencing.

Police are continuing to appeal for information following a series of incidents of criminal damage to cars being driven on roads between the Suffolk and Norfolk border.

More than 40 cars have been damaged since police received the first report on Friday 24 May, along roads in various villages and towns along the A146, A143 and the B1062.

Details of six further incidents are as follows:

• On Sunday 2 June, at around 11pm, a car – Ford Fiesta – was travelling on the A146 towards Lowestoft when an unknown object was thrown from another car, which was travelling in the opposite direction. The object caused damage to the front end of the vehicle. (37/32705/19).
• At approximately 10.15pm on Thursday 6 June, a car – Audi S3 – was being driven along the A143 near Ellingham towards Bungay when the car was hit by what is believed to have been a rock, which had been thrown from another oncoming vehicle. The rock caused damage to a wing mirror, wind deflector, dented the body and damaged the paintwork. (Norfolk: 36/38379/19).
• On Friday 7 June at about 5pm, a motorist was driving a Vauxhall Astra along the B1062 at Mettingham when a rock-type object was thrown at the vehicle from an oncoming vehicle, causing significant damage to the off-side wing. (37/33033/19).
• On Saturday 8 June, at some point overnight, a motorist was travelling along the A146, northbound at Hales, near to the petrol station and an object described as being a rock, stone or brick was thrown at the front of the vehicle – a Peugeot 3008 – from the side of the road. The object dented the bonnet, scratched the front and damaged a parking sensor. (Norfolk: 36/38984/19).
• At approximately 5.40pm on Friday 7 June, a motorist was driving along the A143 at Beccles and as they drove down a hill, two cars passed them on the other side of the road and a large object was thrown from one of the cars at the victim’s vehicle – a BMW 320. The object bounced off the bonnet and hit the windscreen which shattered on the passenger side, covering the victim’s passenger with broken glass. (37/32785/19).
• At 10.45pm on Saturday 8 June, a motorist was driving along the A143 between Earsham and Wortwell, when they heard a loud bang as they drove their car – a Vauxhall Insignia – past a vehicle, which was travelling in the opposite direction. An object – a piece of rubble – was found the following morning wedged behind a damaged number plate. (Norfolk: (36/38987/19).

Officers from both Norfolk and Suffolk Constabularies have been carrying out a number of overnight patrols and are exploring the possibility that these incidents are linked.

Inspector Liz Casey for Lowestoft Police said: “These incidents had the potential to cause road traffic collisions and in turn serious injury or damage. All of the incidents have occurred during the evening or overnight when visibility will be reduced for motorists so it is fortunate that no one has so far been hurt and the damage although, will be costly to victims, has not cost them their lives. Such behaviour is extremely irresponsible, throwing any item into traffic puts lives at risk, and anyone found to be doing so will be firmly dealt with.

“Anyone that is caught throwing objects at vehicles could also personally face a criminal conviction for not only criminal damage but could also result in other offences including, among others, causing danger to other road users.”

Police are also urging motorists to report any incidents as soon as possible with the location of travel and with as much detail as possible to assist with enquiries.

Anyone who has been a victim, or has any information about these incidents or who may have dash-cam footage is asked to contact PC Andrew Roberts at Suffolk police or PC Andy Barkway at Norfolk police on 101 quoting the relevant crime reference numbers.
