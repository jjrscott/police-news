Officers investigating an aggravated burglary in Bury St Edmunds have arrested three people.

The incident took place around 10.30pm on Saturday 11 August at a house on Norman Road in the town. It is reported that two people entered the property and demanded that the occupants hand over money and jewellery.

It is believed that one of the suspects had a knife and that a short scuffle took place in which the male occupant sustained a cut to his arm.

Offenders stole cash jewellery and tobacco before fleeing the scene on foot.

Police arrested a 43-year-old man and a 39-year-old woman, both from Bury St Edmunds, and a 29-year-man from Haverhill in connection with the incident. All were taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre and were questioned by detectives.

The two men have been bailed to return to police on 6 September 2018 and the woman has been released under investigation whilst enquiries continue.

Anybody with any information relating to this incident are asked call West CID on 101 quoting reference 45714/18. Alternatively contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
