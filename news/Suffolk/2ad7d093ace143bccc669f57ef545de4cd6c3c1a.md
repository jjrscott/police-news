Police are appealing for witnesses to a robbery that took place in Ipswich.

It happened on Thursday 20 September at about 10pm on Stoke Park Drive at the McColls convenience store.

While the store was still open, a single male suspect has entered via the front door of the store brandishing a knife. He has made his way to the till, and made a demand for money to the two members of staff who were present. He opened the till and took a quantity of money. He then left the premises.

The male is described as white, 5'8" tall, stocky build, grey tracksuit bottoms, wearing a balaclava and had a bag with him. No-one was hurt in the incident.

Officers are keen to speak to a potential witness who may have been a driving instructor and who the shop staff believe was in the store just before the incident and who may have information that could help the investigation. Police also believe there was a member of the public who approached shop staff and who told them they may have seen someone acting suspiciously outside the store before the incident.

Enquiries are on-going into the incident and anyone who witnessed it or saw any suspicious activity should contact Ipswich CID on 101, quoting crime reference 37/54169/18.

Alternatively contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
