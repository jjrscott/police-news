Police are appealing for witnesses following a burglary in Ipswich.

The incident occurred between 7.50pm and 7.55pm on Sunday 1 January at a property in Medway Road.

Two offenders forced entry into the property by smashing a rear door but they were later disturbed by a member of the public as they attempted to climb over the fence in the garden.

The offenders, who verbally threatened the member of the public, then left the property in the direction of Dereham Avenue. Nothing was stolen from inside.

Detectives would like to hear from anyone who may have any dash camera footage captured between the times of 7pm and 8.30pm in the vicinity of Medway Road and Dereham Avenue.

Anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity or heard anything during the evening should contact Suffolk police on 101, quoting crime reference 37/2580/19.

Alternatively, contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
