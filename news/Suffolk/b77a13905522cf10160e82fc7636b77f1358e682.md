Police are issuing CCTV images of four men they would like to speak to in connection with a number of high value thefts from shops in Ipswich and a further incident in Felixstowe.

The thefts have taken place over a 13-month period, between December 2016 and January 2018.

They involve incidents of shoplifting and distraction thefts occurring at Swarovski, Jack Wills and Pandora in Ipswich, during which thousands of pounds-worth of stock were stolen, and also a further incident at Savers in Felixstowe, where medication was stolen.

Police would like to speak to the four men pictured in the CCTV about these incidents. They are described as follows:

 * Male two: white, of large build, with short dark hair and wearing glasses, and around 50 years old. Speaks with a foreign accent.
 * Male three: white, of medium build, with short dark hair and wearing glasses. Also around 50 years old.
 * Male four: white, of slim build and with a shaved head. Approximately 40 years of age.
