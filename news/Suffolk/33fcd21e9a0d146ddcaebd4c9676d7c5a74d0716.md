Two men have been charged with drugs offences following a police raid in Ipswich.

Officers executed a warrant under the Misuse of Drugs Act at a property in Old Foundry Road yesterday, Wednesday 13 July.

A significant amount of Class A drugs were seized and two men and a woman were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of a controlled drug.

They were taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre (PIC) for questioning and the two men were subsequently charged as follows:

Ben Carter, aged 28, of Sprucewood Close, Liverpool; and John-Paul Rolland, aged 24, of Finborough Road, Liverpool; both charged with one count of possessing crack cocaine with intent to supply, and one count of possessing diamorphine with intent to supply.

Both men were remanded in custody and are due to appear before Ipswich Magistrates’ Court today, Thursday 14 July.

The woman – who is aged 20 and from Lowestoft – has been bailed to return to Martlesham PIC on Wednesday 7 September pending further enquiries.
