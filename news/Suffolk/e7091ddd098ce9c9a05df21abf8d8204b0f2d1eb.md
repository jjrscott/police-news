Police are reminding the public to be mindful of carrying out activities that may scare people, as they could be committing public order offences.

Officers were called yesterday to a report that two young girls were approached in Felixstowe by a person dressed in a clown costume. The incident took place at Langer Road on Monday 9 October at around 4.30pm. The girls ran off and were chased a short distance. They were upset and shaken but otherwise unharmed.

The person is reported to have been carrying what is thought to a be a toy knife.

Whilst it is believed that this was a prank incident and nothing more sinister was intended we would remind members of the public to be more aware of how they act in public places. They could be committing public order offences and may be subject to arrest.

Witnesses or anybody who has any information are asked to call Suffolk Police on 101, reference 66062/17.
