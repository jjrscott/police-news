Police are appealing for witnesses to a burglary that took place in Ipswich.

It happened on Saturday 9 June at some time between 10.30am and 11.45am at a property in Sidegate Lane.

Jewellery, bank cards and cash were stolen after a rear window was smashed with a brick to gain entry.

A female suspect is believed to have entered the property while a male suspect was seen outside the front of the home.

The female suspect is described as white, slim, with thick, blonde short hair and around 25 to 30 years old. The male suspect is described as white, aged around 40, wearing dark trousers and a slightly lighter top, and with mid to dark brown hair. They may have been driving a dark blue Ford, possibly a people carrier.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has any information should contact Suffolk police on 101, quoting reference 37/31576/18 or the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
