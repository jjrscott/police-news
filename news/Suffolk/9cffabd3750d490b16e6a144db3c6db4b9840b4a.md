Police are appealing for witnesses after a collision in Ipswich.

The incident took place on Sunday 23 September at around 9pm. A 16-year-old boy riding his bicycle towards the town centre on Handford Road, near to Mariner House was involved in a collision with a grey car. It is reported that the boy was deliberately knocked off his bicycle and the car involved failed to stop at the scene.

Another vehicle, a purple coloured car, possibly a Ford Galaxy stopped to assist the cyclist.

The victim sustained knee and thigh pain as a result of the incident which required medical treatment.

Witnesses, including the driver of the purple coloured car/Ford Galaxy are asked to call Police on 101 quoting reference 37/54953/18 as they may have information that could assist the investigation.
