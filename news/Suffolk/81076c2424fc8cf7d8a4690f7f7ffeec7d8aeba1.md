Police are appealing for witnesses after a robbery in Ipswich.

The incident took place yesterday, Monday 10 December at just before 5.30pm. An elderly woman waiting at a bus stop on Spring Road near to Springhurst Close in the town was approached by a man who snatched her handbag and ran off.

A woman who was passing by saw the suspect running down Springhurst Close and chased after him. She was joined by another woman member of the public who also stopped to assist. The women told the suspect, who was now with another man, to hand the bag back, which they did. Both men then ran off in an unknown direction. A mobile phone, keys and cash were found to be missing from the bag.

The victim was not injured during the incident was left very shaken as a result.

The first suspect is described as white with tanned skin, around 25 years of age, 5 feet 7 inches tall, with a dark beard and was wearing jeans and a black hooded coat. The second suspect is described as shorter than the first man and was also wearing a black coat.

Anybody who witnessed the incident or who has any information are asked to call police on 101 quoting reference 71412/18.
