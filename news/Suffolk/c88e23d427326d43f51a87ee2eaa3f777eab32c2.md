Officers are appealing for witnesses or information following a robbery in Lowestoft.

The incident took place in the very early hours of Thursday 14 June in Edinburgh Road in the town.

The victim, a man in his 50s, was walking home between 00:15am â€“ 00.30am when he was hit on the head from behind. It is believed that at least two people attacked the man who then received further blows to the face and head before he blacked out. When the victim regained consciousness the offender/s had left the scene and the man made his way home.

The next day the victim realised that his bracelet, watch, necklace were missing, presumed stolen during the incident.

He has sustained bruises to his face and scratches and grazes to his back and arms which required medical treatment.

Witnesses or anybody with information should Lowestoft CID on 101 quoting reference 32722/18. Alternatively contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their website at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
