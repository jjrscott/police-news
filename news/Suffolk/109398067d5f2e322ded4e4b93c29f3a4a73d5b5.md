Police are appealing for witnesses to incidents of possible thefts that took place in various locations in the south of Suffolk.

It is thought that residents in properties who had left tips out for refuse collectors may have had them stolen by an unknown offender.

The thefts happened in Stoke By Nayland, Edwardstone, Milden, Groton, Lindsey, Long Melford, Sudbury and Great Cornard.
It is believed that the thefts took place at some point between 17 and 21 December during the hours of darkness.

If people are kind enough to leave out tips, it is suggested that residents hand them to the refuse collectors directly, or ensure they are left out in daylight.

Anyone who saw any suspicious behaviour, has any CCTV footage of suspicious activity that may have captured the incidents or has knowledge regarding the thefts should contact Suffolk police on 101, quoting crime reference 37/73974/18.

Alternatively, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
