Two teenagers who were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter following the death of a 13-year-old boy after an incident at an address in Thurston on 1 May have been told they will face no further action.

Both teenagers were detained as police made enquiries following the death of Ben Wragge.

Police were called by the ambulance service at 1.35pm on Sunday 1 May, to reports that a boy had sustained life threatening injuries. Ben was taken to West Suffolk Hospital in a critical condition, where he died a short time later.

A post mortem examination confirmed that he died as a result of an injury caused by an air pellet.

Following a full investigation into circumstances around his death, police have consulted with the Crown Prosecution Service and no further action will be taken against either of the boys.

They were due to answer bail tomorrow, Thursday 28 July, but this has now been cancelled.

A file will be passed to the coroner for an inquest hearing in due course.
