A man and a teenage girl have been arrested in connection with a robbery that took place in Stowmarket.

Police were called at approximately 3:10pm yesterday, Tuesday 13 June, to reports of a robbery that had just occurred near Station Road West and Church Walk.

The victim, a man in his 20s, had been walking through the churchyard when he was approached by the couple who demanded money and reportedly threatened him with a knife.

The suspects fled on foot after the victim handed over a quantity of cash and police were called.

A 20-year-old man from London and a 16 year-old-girl from Ipswich have been arrested in connection with the incident. Both were questioned by police and have now been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Witnesses or anyone who saw anything suspicious at the time and area indicated are asked to contact West CID at Suffolk Police on **101** quoting reference 41402/17, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
