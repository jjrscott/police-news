Officers are appealing for witnesses or information following a robbery in Great Cornard.

The incident took place at a property on Highbury Way in the village on Monday 11 September. At around 9pm three men entered the house and threatened the four occupants with screwdrivers, demanding cash and property. The victims were made to sit in a room together whilst the offenders searched the house.

One of the men snatched a gold chain from one of the occupants, a woman, and also took her earrings. A large quantity of cash, four iPhones, and a silver ladies Rolex watch were also stolen. The men then left via the back door and are thought to have ran off in the direction of The Drift at approximately 9.45pm.

The victims were badly shaken by the incident but not injured.

Two of the offenders are described as speaking with an Eastern European accent; the third man with an English accent. All three men wore balaclavas throughout the incident.

Anybody who saw anything suspicious at the time stated above or has any information are asked to call DC 1960 Hughes on 101 reference 60183/17. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
