Police are appealing for businesses to stay vigilant after four burglaries and attempted burglaries in the Lowestoft area.

Three incidents took place on Commercial Road in the town with business premises all targeted. One business, reported to police at about 7.15am yesterday (Wed 17 Feb), was broken into but nothing stolen (CAD 34 of 17/2/21), while a second was broken into at about 1030am with copper tubing and brass with an estimated value of £3,000 stolen (CAD 76 of 17/2/21). The third incident was reported later in the day at about 230pm with a Citroen number plate stolen and a rear plate from a Ford Transit stolen. (CAD178 of 17/2/21).

Meanwhile, on Tuesday 16 February at about 630pm on Belvedere Road a lock of a main gate was cut off with an angle grinder with a Ford transit van entering and a forklift and generator stolen. (37/8013/21) Two suspects were seen at the time with the generator loaded into the Ford transit that entered the premises. The fork-lift has since been located in the Carlton Colville area and recovered. The generator remains outstanding.

Anyone who witnessed any suspicious behaviour, has knowledge of any of the incidents, knows who was responsible or knows the whereabouts of any of the items stolen should contact Lowestoft police, quoting the relevant crime number.
