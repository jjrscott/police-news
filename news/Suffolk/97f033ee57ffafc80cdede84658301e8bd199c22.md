Officers from the West Suffolk Scorpion team attended an address in Newmarket on Saturday 21st July 2018, following information received relating to the supply of class ‘A’ drugs.

Police gained entry into the premises and arrested a 29-year-old woman and 42-year-old man, both from Newmarket and an 18 year old man from Hemel Hempstead. All three were detained on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of class ‘A’ controlled drugs.

Officers recovered a quantity of what is believed to be crack cocaine and a large quantity of cash.

The woman and 42-year-old man have now been released under investigation whilst police enquires continue. The 18-year-old man remains in custody at Edmunds Police Investigation Centre.
