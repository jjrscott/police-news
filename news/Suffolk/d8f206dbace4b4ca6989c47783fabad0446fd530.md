Police are appealing for witnesses after two road traffic collisions in Ipswich over the weekend.

The first incident occurred at around 10pm on Friday 14 July in Station Street, where a cyclist travelling down the hill towards the junction with Wherstead Road, collided with a parked red Toyota Corolla.

The cyclist – a man aged in his 20s – was taken to Ipswich Hospital with a serious head injury which was initially treated as life-threatening, but is no longer believed to be so.

The second collision occurred at around 3pm yesterday, Sunday 16 July, in Bramford Road, at the junction with Kingston Road.

A white Suzuki motorcycle was travelling in the general direction of Bramford village when it was involved in a collision with a female pedestrian who was crossing the road.

The pedestrian was taken to Addenbrooke’s hospital for treatment having sustained leg and pelvic injuries and also a minor head injury. The male motorcyclist was not injured.

Officers would like to hear from any witnesses to either of these collisions.

Anyone with information should contact the PHQ Roads Policing Firearms and Operations Unit on 101, quoting references: CAD 471 of 14 July in respect of the Station Street collision; and CAD 260 of 16 July regarding the Bramford Road collision.
