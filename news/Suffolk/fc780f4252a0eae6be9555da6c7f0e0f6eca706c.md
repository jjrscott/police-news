Police are appealing for witnesses to an incident of dangerous driving that took place on the A11 on Friday 9 March near to Newmarket.

The drivers of two silver Renault vans were seen to be driving erratically and at speeds in excess of the limit at about 2.30pm where the A14 meets the junction of the A11. It was reported the drivers were chatting to each other out of their windows, with the vans side by side with each other. They were also seen to be using mobile phones whilst driving.

This behaviour continued at the Five Ways roundabout on the A11 when one of the vans changed lanes, suddenly applying their brakes, and the driver started talking again to the other van driver. This caused a HGV vehicle to take avoiding action, nearly colliding with one of the vans. Both vans continued their journey on the A11 towards Attleborough.

Anyone who witnessed the manner of driving of either van at around the time stated on Friday 9 March or who has dash-cam footage of the driving should contact Suffolk police quoting CAD reference 300 of 9 March 2018.
