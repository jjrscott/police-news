Police are appealing for witnesses to an assault that took place in Ipswich.

It happened on Wednesday 11 July at about 10.45pm on Tower Street.

The two suspects are described as two white males - one wearing a light top, dark trousers and light shoes while the other is described as also wearing a light top and dark shorts.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has knowledge of it should contact Ipswich CID on 101 quoting crime reference 37/38649/18. Alternatively, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
