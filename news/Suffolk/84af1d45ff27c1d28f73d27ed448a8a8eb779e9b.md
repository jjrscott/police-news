Police are appealing for witnesses to an attempted burglary that took place in Saxmundham.

It happened in the early hours of Tuesday 11 September at about 3.15am on the Market Place.

The suspects had attempted to kick the door of the business premises, Saxon Wines, damaging it in the process. They also used a hammer, smashing the front door and window to the shop. No entry was gained and nothing was stolen.

Anyone who saw the incident, heard any strange sounds around the time of the incident, saw any suspicious activity or has knowledge of the incident that may help should contact Suffolk Constabulary on 101, quoting crime reference 37/52052/18.
