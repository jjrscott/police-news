A man has been arrested as police continue to tackle the supply of drugs in Lowestoft.

On Wednesday 28 December, around 3:45pm, plain clothed officers from the East Scorpion team were conducting proactive patrols in the area of Stradbroke Road and became aware of a man acting suspiciously.

A 27-year-old from Lowestoft was arrested on suspicion of possession of a Class B drug with intent to supply.

He has been released on police bail pending further enquiries and is due to return to Great Yarmouth Police Investigation Centre on 2 February 2017.

Police would urge anyone with information about those involved in drug dealing or who witness any suspicious activity to contact Suffolk Police on **101**.
