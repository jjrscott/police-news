Detectives are appealing for public support to trace a motorist who approached a 17-year-old girl in Barham.

Police were contacted on Sunday, 19 February, to reports of the incident which is alleged to have taken place at approximately 10:30pm on Wednesday, 15 February.

The teenager was riding a moped along Norwich Road, heading towards Claydon, when a dark car pulled in front of her, just before the Sandy Lane junction and caused her to stop.

The driver is reported to have approached the girl, holding what was believed to be a knife, and ordered her into his vehicle.

The victim has stated she was sat in the passenger side of the vehicle for between 30 to 45 minutes before managing to free herself after the driver became distracted by an approaching vehicle.

The man is described as being in his late 20s or early 30s, with a tanned complexion, of slim build and approximately 5ft 6ins tall. He was wearing a plain black t-shirt, black tracksuit bottoms or jeans and had short black spikey hair. He is said to have spoken in a foreign accent and, at one point during the incident, is reported to have spoken to someone on the phone in a foreign language.

Police would particularly like to speak to two motorists who are said to have stopped at the scene.

Anyone with information about this incident, or who saw anything suspicious at the time, is asked to call Suffolk Police on **101** quoting 18447/17. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on **0800 555 111** or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
