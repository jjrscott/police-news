Police have arrested three men in connection with drug offences in Ipswich.

It follows a search of a vehicle in Ipswich on Macauley Road in the town earlier this morning (15 January) at just before 1am.

When the search was conducted officers recovered a 10-inch kitchen knife and around 50 to 60 wraps of Class A drugs in the front of the vehicle.

Three people were arrested, a 17 year old male, a 19 year old male and a 22 year old male. They were all arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply drugs and possession of a knife or bladed weapon.

They were all taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning where they remain.
