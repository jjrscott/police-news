A 33-year-old man has been arrested following a burglary in Ufford yesterday, Tuesday 8 November.

Police were called shortly after 1:15pm to reports of a break in at a residential address on Spring Lane, where a back window had been forced open using a garden spade belonging to the victim.

On their arrival, officers saw the suspect inside the property and he then ran away. He was pursued by police and arrested in the village a short time later.

The man, who is from the Woodbridge area, was taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre where he remains for questioning by detectives.

Any witnesses or anyone with information should contact Southern Area CID on **101** , quoting reference 65224/16.
