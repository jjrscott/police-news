Police are appealing for witnesses following a burglary in Barrow, near Bury St Edmunds.

On Friday 10 March at approximately 3.15pm, offenders forced access to a property on Papeley Meadow in Barrow by smashing a glass door pane.

A quantity of jewellery was taken from the property, and police would be interested in speaking to anyone who may have seen any suspicious activity in the area at the time of the offence.

They are particularly keen on hearing from anyone who may have witnessed a green Volvo estate with tinted windows in the area at the time of the offence, or anyone who may have seen three men in dark clothing and woollen baseball caps acting suspiciously in the area.

The men are described as about 5 foot 10 inches tall, of medium build and reportedly had their faces partially covered with scarves.

Anyone with any information should call Suffolk Police **101** quoting crime reference number **** 37/22171/17. ****
