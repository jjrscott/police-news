Police are appealing for witnesses following a serious assault in Haverhill.

The incident occurred in Duddery Road on Sunday 5 August at approximately 4.40am when the victims - four young men - were attacked by another group of males after a verbal disagreement.

As result of the incident, several people within the victim’s group sustained serious injuries including some broken bones.

Officers would be keen to speak to a male and a female who were witnessed sitting on a bench in Ehringshausen Way outside Frankie and Benny’s restaurant shortly before the incident occurred as they may be able to help with the investigation.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has any information should contact Bury St Edmunds CID on 101 quoting reference 37/44227/18 or the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
