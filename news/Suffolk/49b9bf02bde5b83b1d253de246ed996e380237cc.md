Police are appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Lowestoft.

The incident took place in an alleyway behind Sussex Road at around 3.25pm on Monday 29 July.

The victim – a man aged in his 40s – was walking along the alleyway, in the direction of St Margarets Road, when he saw two men walking towards him. One of the men commented on the victim’s watch and the other man then grabbed the victim and pinned his arms around his back.

The second man then punched the victim in the mouth, causing a tooth to fall out and his Tommy Hilfiger watch was taken from his wrist. The two men then ran off in the direction of St Margarets Road.

The first male suspect is described as white, 6ft 2ins, of a slim build and approximately aged in his mid-twenties. He was wearing a t-shirt and blue shorts. He also had tattoos on his right arm.

The second male suspect is described as white, 5ft 6ins, aged in his early 20s, of a stocky build, with spiky blond hair, which was short around the sides. He was wearing a black polo shirt and blue jeans. Both of the men were heard speaking with accents that were described as either originating from either Essex or London.

Anyone with any information about this incident is asked to contact East CID quoting crime reference 37/44709/19
