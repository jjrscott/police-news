Officers are appealing for information or witnesses after an attempted arson in Haughley.

The incident took place at around 3.00am this morning, Tuesday 28 August at a property on Windgap Lane in the village.

The occupants woke to the smell of burning and discovered that a lit piece of paper had been posted through their letterbox. The smouldering paper was extinguished and only caused minor damage to the letterbox and carpet. Nobody was harmed as a result of the incident.

Police are appealing for witnesses who may have seen anything suspicious around this time to call Western Area CID on 101 quoting reference 49219/18. Detectives are particularly keen to hear from anybody who may have dash-cam footage captured in this location between 2.00am and 3.15am. Alternatively call the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
