Police are appealing for witnesses and information following a sexual assault in Ipswich.

On Thursday 14 September, around 8:30am, a woman in her late teens was walking along Foxhall Road, near the Parliament Road junction, when she was approached from behind by a man.

The man greeted her before pushing her into a wall and grabbing her bottom over her clothes.

The victim pushed him back and was able to free herself to run away.

The man is described as white, approximately 6ft in height and believed to be between 20 and 30 years’ old. He was wearing dark clothing and had dark, short hair.

Police are investigating whether this incident is linked to a second incident of sexual assault against the same victim in the town earlier this month.

On Wednesday 6 September, at approximately 5:30pm, the young woman was walking along Camden Road in Ipswich when she approached by an unknown man who grabbed her bottom.

She managed to free herself and ran away but was unable to describe the suspect on this occasion.

The victim was not injured following either incident but has been left very shaken.

Detectives would like to hear from anyone who may have information to assist the investigation.

If you can help, please contact Suffolk Police on 101 quoting reference number 60757/17. Alternatively, this can be reported online via the ‘Report a Crime’ page on the Suffolk Police website: www.suffolk.police.uk.
