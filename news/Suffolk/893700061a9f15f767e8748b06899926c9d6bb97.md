Police are appealing for witnesses after a sexual assault in Ipswich last week.

The incident occurred at approximately 5.10pm on Tuesday 23 July in an alleyway between Vaughan Street and Austin Street.

The victim – a woman aged in her 50s – was walking along the alleyway, when a male approached her, taking his top off as he came towards her. He then grabbed the victim’s bottom as they passed each other and also spoke to her in a suggestive manner.

The victim told the male to stop speaking in that manner and the male then said a further suggestive comment, and as the woman turned around, the male indecently exposed himself. The woman then walked away.

The suspect is described as male, around 14 years of age, approximately 5ft 5ins tall and of a slim build. He was wearing a white t-shirt with a blue motif and dark jeans or trousers.

Anyone with any information about this incident is asked to contact Suffolk police quoting crime reference 37/43882/19.
