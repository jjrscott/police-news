Suffolk Police are appealing for witnesses following reports of an accosting in Ipswich.

On Saturday 14 January, at some point between 10.45am and 11am, an eight year old boy was walking back from shops on Hawthorne Drive when an unknown man, who was using the bottle bank near to the bookmakers, said hello to him.

The boy crossed the road, and the man followed, eventually walking alongside him, past the Methodist church. On reaching the junction of Pheasant Road and Kingfisher Avenue, the man attempted to physically pick the boy up; however he was able to kick himself loose and run away.

The man is described as being a white male, 5ft 7 and in his mid 30s with an English accent. He was wearing dark clothing and was carrying a black rucksack with an orange stripe.

Police would like to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the incident, or who may have seen a man matching this description in the areas mentioned at the time stated.

Anyone with any information that could help the investigation should contact Suffolk Police on **101** quoting reference number 37/12258/17.
