A Beccles man has been charged with making indecent photos and appeared in court yesterday (Monday 4 December).

45 year old Andrew Matthews, of Darby Road in Beccles pleaded guilty at Ipswich magistrates court to three counts of making indecent images of children that took place at some point between 19 February 2012 and 12 June 2017.

He has also been charged with two other counts of arranging/ facilitating the commission of a child sex offence and arranging/facilitating the prostitution/involvement in pornography of a child under 13 years old - both under section 50 of the Sexual Offences Act. No plea was entered by the defendant for these two counts.

He will next appear before Ipswich Crown Court on 8 January 2018 for a Pre-Trial Case Management hearing.
