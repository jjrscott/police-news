Members of the public are reminded to plan their travel in Ipswich ahead of this week’s derby match between Ipswich Town and Norwich City on Sunday 22 October at Portman Road.

Police are encouraging both sets of fans to arrive at the ground early in order to enjoy the fixture safely. Turnstiles and stadium bars will be open from 10.30am with kick-off at 12pm.

Supporters are reminded that due to the high number of away supporters travelling by coach, vehicular access to Portman Road will be restricted before and during the match, and closed for a short period of time after the match. Availability of spaces at the Portman Road Car Park will be greatly reduced.

Due to the high attendance some altered entry and exit arrangements will be in place to minimise bottlenecks and congestion.

Supporters seated in the Sir Alf Ramsey Stand will have the option to exit the stadium post-match via the main drive at the football club into Constantine Road, or via the practice pitch into Sir Alf Ramsey Way. The exit for into Portman Road will also be open for supporters who wish to exit that way.

Road closures will be in place at various times on Portman Road and on Princes Street at the junctions of Civic Drive, Chancery Road, Chalon Street and Commercial Road, Ranelagh Road and Burrell Road. These will remain in place for a short while after the game has ended.

There will be some disruption to public transport as a result of these closures. Buses will be operating on diversionary routes whilst Princes Street is closed. Members of the public are advised to check by telephone or on-line with operators for service details and alternative bus stops.

Bag searches will be taking place for the safety of all spectators at this match and supporters should plan to arrive at the stadium earlier than normal to ease congestion whilst entering the stadium.

Police commander for the match Detective Chief Superintendent Simon Parkes said:

> "As usual for this derby game there will be a high profile police presence to ensure all supporters arrive and leave the ground safely and enjoy the game. We are supported by colleagues from across the east of England as well as horses from the Metropolitan Police.
>
> "I would ask that anyone planning to be in the town centre area of Ipswich on Sunday takes note of the road closures and congestion expected.
>
> "Whilst we will not tolerate mindless anti-social behaviour, violence or racist chanting, we know that true fans attend to enjoy the game and we hope they have a great day. The public are encouraged to approach police if they have any questions on the day. Officers will be on hand to ensure the safety of those attending the game and those members of the public wishing to go about their normal daily business.”
