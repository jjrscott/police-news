Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an incident of indecent exposure whereby a member of the public was threatened in Ipswich.

It happened at approximately 11.25pm on Friday 20 October, within the Orwell Meadow Car Park in Nacton Road.

It was reported that a male driver of an Audi A4 had left his vehicle and acted in a lewd manner before being confronted by a member of the public, which resulted in an altercation.

The Audi driver is then alleged to have threatened the member of public – a man – with a hammer before leaving the scene in his vehicle.

Officers would be interested to speak to a young couple, believed to be in their 20s, who were in the car park at the time and who may have seen the incident take place.

Witnesses should contact the Incident Crime Management Hub on 101, quoting crime number 70739/17 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
