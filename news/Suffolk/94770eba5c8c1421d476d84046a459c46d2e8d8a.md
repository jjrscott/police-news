Police are appealing for witnesses to a robbery that took place in Stowmarket.

It happened at about 10pm on 7 September 2018 at a property on Osprey Drive. The victim, male in his mid 50s, opened his back door to his property and three males wearing balaclavas and gloves pushed their way past the victim.

They then proceeded to punch him in the face and one of the offenders then threatened him with a knife demanding money.

A male friend of the victim, aged in his mid 40s, also in the property entered the living room and was assaulted in the face.

The male victim, aged in his 50s, then left the property, and the second victim, while cleaning his face, heard the two males going through kitchen drawers and then they left the premises. They left with items of jewellery, including Bering mensâ€™ watches and white gold eternity rings with baguette diamonds.

Police believe this was a targeted attack and that there is no wider threat to the community.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or saw any suspicious activity should contact Bury St Edmunds CID on 101, quoting crime reference 37/51658/18. Alternatively contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
