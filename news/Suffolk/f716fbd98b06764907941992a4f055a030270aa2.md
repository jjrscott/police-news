Police have issued a CCTV image of a man they would like to speak with in connection with the theft of scratch cards from business premises.

A man walked into a convenience store in Ipswich Road, Claydon, at approximately 9:50am on Sunday 25 June and asked for a £10 scratch card. He then asked for another item and, while the shopkeeper was distracted, grabbed the scratch card and ran out of the store.

The suspect is described as white, approximately 6ft tall and bald. He was wearing a blue Nike-branded T-shirt with ‘Just Do It’ wording and grey tracksuit bottoms.

Police would like to speak to the man pictured in connection with this incident and are appealing for him, or anyone with information about him, to contact Suffolk Police on 101.

Officers are also investigating links between this incident and another report of theft of scratch cards from a shop in Felixstowe which took place in the High Street later the same day.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact Suffolk Police on 101 quoting 44584 /17. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
