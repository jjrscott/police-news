Police in Suffolk will be targeting speeding drivers as part of a week-long enforcement campaign.

The Europe-wide campaign, co-ordinated by TISPOL, the European Traffic Police Network, begins on Monday 16 April and will run until Sunday 22 April, seeing an increased amount of checks and enforcement across the county.

Chief Inspector Kris Barnard, head of the joint Norfolk and Suffolk Roads Policing Unit, said: "We work closely with our partners all-year round to target speeding drivers and these campaigns allow us to enforce the law while also raising awareness of the dangers and educating motorists.

"Speeding is one of the ‘fatal four' offences which makes you more likely to be killed or seriously injured in a collision - alongside drink driving, driving whilst using a mobile phone and not wearing a seatbelt.

"All too often officers have to deal with the results of drivers speeding, which can be devastating, with families and friends being left behind to pick up their lives after the event. One fatality on our roads is one too many.

"Speed limits are in place for a reason – the limit is set at the maximum safe speed to travel on a particular stretch of road.

"Drivers shouldn't use these limits as targets; there are always other factors to consider including other road users, levels of traffic and weather conditions. The faster you are travelling, the less time you have to react to the unexpected and stop safely."

Suffolk’s Police and Crime Commissioner, Tim Passmore, said: "I fully support this campaign to focus on speeding.

"The safety of all road users in Suffolk is a key priority for me as the county's Police and Crime Commissioner. Speeding wrecks lives and there really is no excuse for it. I find it absolutely staggering that despite all the publicity and numerous warning signs, drivers cannot keep to the speed limit.

"Speed limits are there for a reason. Speed is one of the fatal four causes of serious injury or death on our roads and these thoughtless drivers really do need to wake up to the fact that they are not just risking their own lives, but the lives of fellow road users.”

Motorists caught speeding will be issued with a TOR (Traffic Offence Report) and face a fine, points on their licence or even court action. Some drivers can opt to take part in a speed awareness course.
