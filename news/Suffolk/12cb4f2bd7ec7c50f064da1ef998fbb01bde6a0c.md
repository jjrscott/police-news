A 20-year-old man from the Colchester area has been given a suspended prison sentence, following his conviction for a number of sexual offences relating to children.

Archie Stulpa-McCallum, of Great Bentley, appeared at Ipswich Crown Court yesterday, Tuesday 11 December, where he was given a total sentence of 21 months’ imprisonment, suspended for two years.

Stulpa-McCallum had pleaded guilty to five offences at a previous crown court appearance on Thursday 11 October.

The offences and the sentences given for each are detailed below. All sentences are to run concurrently with the longest sentence of 21 months and are all suspended for two years:

 * Cause/incite a girl under 13 to engage in sexual activity without penetration (21 months imprisonment)
 * Offender under 18 engaging in non-penetrative sexual activity with a girl under 13 (Two months’ imprisonment)
 * Two counts of an adult attempting to meet a girl under 16-years-old following grooming (12 months’ imprisonment for each offence)
 * Making an indecent photograph/pseudo photograph of a child (No additional sentence given)

He was ordered to sign the Sex Offenders’ Register for 10 years’ upon conviction and yesterday was also given a 10 year Sexual Harm Prevention Order.

In addition to the above he must complete 60 days of rehabilitation activities; participate in the sexual offenders’ programme; and have his mobile phones and laptop destroyed.

Stulpa-McCallum was first brought to the attention of police in March 2017 after officers were contacted by a parent of one of the victims who had concerns her daughter - who was aged 12 at the time - was receiving inappropriate messages from an older male.

An investigation was subsequently undertaken by Suffolk Police’s Cybercrime Team and Stulpa-McCallum was arrested and interviewed in June 2017.

Police enquires ultimately found that there were four victims in total, aged between 10 and 15-years-old, with the offences occurring between August 2015 and June 2017.

In the case of three of his victims, Stulpa-McCallum originally made contact with them via the social media app ‘Yellow’ (now known as Yubo) and then moved conversations over to Snapchat.

The Yellow/Yubo app is a social networking site for 13 to 17-year-olds designed to allow them to make new online friends. Stulpa-McCallum entered a false age to allow him to register for the app.

Once Stulpa-McCallum moved the conversations over to Snapchat, he engaged the victims in sexual conversations and encouraged the sending of explicit photographs.

He also made a number of attempts to get two of his victims to meet up with him, but these requests were declined.

During the course of the investigation, officers also uncovered an earlier crime committed by Stulpa-McCallum, where he had sexually assaulted a girl aged under 13.

Charlotte Driver, Suffolk Police’s Cybercrime Supervisor, said: “Archie Stulpa-McCallum has clearly had an unhealthy interest in young girls for some while, committing his first offence when aged 17 against a girl many years his junior.

“After turning 18 and becoming an adult, he then lied about his age to sign-up to the app ‘Yellow’, enabling him to make contact with young girls.

“He knew his victims were all under 16, but despite this he continued to engage them in sexualised and inappropriate conversations. It is fortunate that his offending was discovered when it was and that none of the three later victims met him in person.

“I would appeal to all parents to monitor their children’s online activities and check what apps or messaging platforms they are using. As this case clearly displays, unfortunately so many platforms allow paedophiles to make contact with children and encourage them to send inappropriate messages or even meet up with them.

“Talk to your children openly about online safety and make them aware of the dangers around them.”
