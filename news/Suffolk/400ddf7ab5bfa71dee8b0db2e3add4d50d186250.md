A man who died following a collision at Latimer Close on Ransomes Europark yesterday has been named as Tony Barnes, 33, of Greenfield Close, Eccles in Kent.

Officers were contacted just after 4.40am yesterday, Wednesday 17 February, to reports that a man had been found trapped between a lorry and a gate at the entrance to a site there. Emergency services attended but Mr Barnes was pronounced deceased at the scene.

> His family say; "He was a much loved son, brother and boyfriend – a gentle giant with a heart of gold, who will be missed by all.”

Nobody else was involved in the incident. Police are investigating exactly what occurred and an inquest will be held in due course. Anyone who may have information should call Suffolk Police on 101, quoting CAD 28 of yesterday, Wednesday 17 February.
