An 18-year-old man has been charged following a dangerous driving incident in Lowestoft and Oulton.

At around 3.15pm on Wednesday 3 January officers out on patrol in the Gunton area of Lowestoft became aware of a Ford Fiesta which they believed to have been stolen.

Officers requested the vehicle to stop in Yarmouth Road, but it failed to do so. It was then pursued along Bentley Drive, Millennium Way and Somerleyton Road, before turning into Hall Lane, Oulton, where it finally came to a stop after the car began to spin and then mounted the grass verge.

Tyler Ezobi, of Sands Lane, Lowestoft, was arrested following this incident and taken to Great Yarmouth Police Investigation Centre for questioning.

He has subsequently been charged with the following four offences:

 * Aggravated vehicle taking and dangerous driving
 * Failing to stop for police
 * Driving without insurance
 * Driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence

Ezobi has been bailed to appear at Great Yarmouth Magistratesâ€™ Court on Wednesday 24 January.
