Police appealing for witnesses after an incident of fraud took place at Barton Mills.

The incident was reported to police at about 630am on Thursday 8 October having taken place earlier at the Shell Fiveways Service Station.

The victim, an employee working in service station, was phoned by a man at just after midnight on Thursday morning claiming to be the store manager.

The male on the phone told the member of staff to pack up all the cigarettes in the store, as well a quantity of e-top up vouchers and cash and four crates of Red Bull for two taxi drivers to pick them up. At about 2am, unknown to the victim, a suspect(s) entered the rear of the store taking the items the male had earlier described. No-one was injured or hurt in the incident.

Anyone who has knowledge of who was responsible or saw any suspicious activity should contact police, quoting crime reference 37/58633/20.
