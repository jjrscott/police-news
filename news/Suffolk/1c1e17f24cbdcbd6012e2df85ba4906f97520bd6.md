Police are appealing for witnesses following a burglary at a business premises in Felixstowe.

The incident took place at The Fludyers Arms Hotel on Undercliff Road East, sometime between 11pm on Sunday 26 and 11:30am on Monday 27 March.

A safe was broken into and the cash float stolen, which contained a quantity of cash and debit/credit card receipts.

These receipts are believed to carry card numbers and signatures of customers from takings on Motherâ€™s Day. Police are therefore urging customers of the hotel to contact their bank immediately to report that their accounts may have been compromised.

Officers are keen to hear from anyone who may have seen anyone acting suspiciously and are particularly keen to trace two people seen outside the hotel between 1:30am and 2:30am.

Anyone with information should call Suffolk Police on **101** quoting reference number 25384/17.
