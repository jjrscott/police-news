Police are appealing for information following two burglaries in Ipswich.

At some point between Thursday 18 May at 11.30pm and Friday 19 May at 7.30am, offenders gained entry to a property on Spenser Road via an insecure door and stole a tablet device.

On Friday 19 May at approximately 12.30am, offenders entered a property on Macaulay Road via an insecure door, but nothing was taken.

Police are investigating the possibility that the two burglaries are linked and are issuing home security advice to residents:

Please make sure that your doors and windows are locked to reduce the chances of your home being targeted by opportunist thieves.

Avoid leaving valuables on display on window sills, including electronic equipment and car keys. Ensure that your garden gates, shed and any outbuildings are properly secured.

Police would like to hear from anyone who may have seen or heard any suspicious activity in the area around the times specified.

Anyone with any information should contact Suffolk Police on **101** quoting reference number 37/36039/17.
