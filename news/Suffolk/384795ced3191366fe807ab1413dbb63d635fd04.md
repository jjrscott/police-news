Police are appealing for information after a burglary at the Co-Op store in East Bergholt around 3.10am this morning.

Officers were alerted just before 3.15am today, Friday 1 July, to reports of a break-in at the premises in The Street.

A vehicle – a Land Rover - was left at the scene and this is believed to have been stolen from the Manningtree area after 1pm yesterday, Thursday 30 June.

Three men were seen leaving the vicinity of the store around 3.15am and it’s thought they may have got into a second vehicle nearby.

It’s not clear what, if anything, was stolen from the premises and work continues at the scene this morning.
