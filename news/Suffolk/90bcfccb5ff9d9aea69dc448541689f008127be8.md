Police are urging dog owners to keep their animals under control after two recent attacks on sheep.

A rare breed Hebridean sheep in fields at Heath Road at Upper Hollesley Common is believed to have been attacked around 17 September. This incident was reported to police last week.

The sheep are regularly checked and a ewe was found to have puncture wound to its leg. It had sustained nerve damage and had to be destroyed.

Police have also recently dealt with an incident that occurred at Freston around 8 October, where two lambs had to have veterinary treatment for wounds to their legs consistent with a dog attack.

Officers are urging anyone with information about either incident to come forward by calling Suffolk Police on **101** â€“ quoting crime number 61584/16 for Hollesley or 59842/16 for Freston.

Police are also reminding dog owners that they are responsible for keeping their pets under control and are asking anyone who sees a dog attacking sheep to call police immediately.

A person who owns or is in charge of a dog which worries livestock on any agricultural land is guilty of an offence. This includes attacking livestock or chasing in such a way as may be reasonably expected to cause injury or suffering to the livestock.
