Police are keen to speak to three individuals in connection with an incident of theft in Sudbury.

It happened on Friday 31 August at Boots on Market Hill in the town at about 4.40pm.

Around Â£5000 worth of electrical goods were stolen from the store including toothbrushes and razors with the items placed in a large laundry bag before the offenders exited the store.

It is possible the offenders were in the company of a female.

Officers would like to speak to the three individuals depicted in the CCTV stills in connection with the incident.

Anyone who recognises them, or saw any suspicious behaviour should contact Bury St Edmunds CID on 101, quoting crime reference 37/50067/18. Alternatively contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
