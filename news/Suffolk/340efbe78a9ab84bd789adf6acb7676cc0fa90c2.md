Police are appealing for witnesses following a ram raid at a shop in Long Melford at the weekend.

Officers were called just before 3am yesterday morning, Sunday 14 October, to reports that a digger was trying to remove a cash machine from the wall of McCollâ€™s in Hall Street.

Upon police arrival at the scene a Claas telehandler was found abandoned in the street outside the premises, which had suffered extensive damage and as a result is considered unsafe and will require a full building survey.

Initial reports from witnesses stated that five males, wearing dark clothing with their faces covered, used the telehandler to remove the cash machine from the wall and then placed it onto the back of a black Nissan Navara. This vehicle then made off in the direction of Sudbury, closely followed by what is believed to have been a blue Audi saloon.

It transpires that the Claas telehandler was stolen earlier the same morning from a farm in Pentlow, Essex.

Any witnesses, or anyone with information about this incident, is asked to contact West CID at Bury St Edmunds Police Station on 101 quoting reference 59252/18. Alternatively contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
