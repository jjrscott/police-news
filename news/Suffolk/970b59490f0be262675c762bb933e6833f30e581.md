Police are reminding residents to be alert for telephone scams following reports that a number of residents have been contacted recently by a caller claiming to be a Metropolitan Police officer.

Fraudsters are typically stating that they have a suspect in custody that has a number of credits cards with their details on. The caller then asks the person on the telephone to confirm their credit card details over the phone.

Residents should remember the following:

Your bank or the police will never ask you to withdraw money or purchase items.

Your bank or the police will never ask for your PIN, bank card or bank account details over the phone – never give these details out.

If you receive such a call leave the landline for at least five minutes to make an outside call. Fraudsters will keep the line open and have been known to play ring tones, hold music and a recorded message down the phone so the victim believes they are making a call to a legitimate number.

Use a friend or neighbour’s telephone instead.

Friends, family, carers and neighbours are asked to spread the word to ensure everyone is aware of this scam and what they should do
