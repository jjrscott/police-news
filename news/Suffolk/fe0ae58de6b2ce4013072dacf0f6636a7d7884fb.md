The vehicles involved were a blue Peugeot 206 and black Isuzu D-max.

The female passenger in the Peugeot, Charlotte Oakes, aged 22 and from Saxmundham, died at the scene.

The female driver of the same vehicle was airlifted to Addenbrookes hospital for treatment to her injuries.

The male driver of the second vehicle, the Isuzu, suffered minor cuts and bruises.
