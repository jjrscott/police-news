A 22-year-old man has been charged in connection with two recent burglaries in Lowestoft and Brampton, where cash and jewellery were stolen on both occasions.

The first incident occurred on Thursday 26 July at a house in Commercial Road, Lowestoft, where entry was gained via an insecure front door whilst the owners were outside.

The second burglary occurred on Wednesday 1 August at a property in Moll’s Lane, Brampton, with entry gained via an insecure window.

Michael Bramble, of no fixed abode, was arrested by detectives investigating these crimes on Thursday 9 August and taken into custody for questioning.

He was subsequently charged with two counts of burglary and released on bail to appear at Great Yarmouth Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday 29 August.
