Police are keen to speak to a man in connection with an incident of theft from an Ipswich store.

It took place at a jewellery store Boreham Christopher on Upper Brook Street in the town on Friday 3 August at about 12.30pm.

A man asked to view a ladies bracelet worth around Â£900 from the counter. The store worker took the bracelet from the counter and passed it to the suspect to view. The suspect has then taken the bracelet and ran from the store making no attempt to pay.

Anyone who recognises the individual in the CCTV stills should contact Ipswich police on 101, quoting crime reference 37/43770/18. Alternatively contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
