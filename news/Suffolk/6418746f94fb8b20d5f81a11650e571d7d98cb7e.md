Suffolk Constabulary cadets have been giving back to their community by helping to clear the gardens of those less able.

Cadets from Ipswich and Martlesham attended Stratford Court in Whitton, Ipswich, on Sunday 28 October to take part in a community project to assist with gardening for those residents who were unable to due to physical or mental disabilities.

Thirteen cadets and three leaders turned up on the day for what described as a daunting task by cadet leader PC Trevor Spinlove, as some of the gardens were very overgrown.

Housing association manager Maureen Gladwell said she was very pleased with the work completed as were the residents themselves.

She said: “Thank you to the cadets for their sterling efforts. It was a bit chilly and the rain threatened most of the day, but in spite of this it looks as if there was a lot of work done and the tenants I have seen are very pleased.”
