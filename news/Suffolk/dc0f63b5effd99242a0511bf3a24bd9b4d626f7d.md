Police are appealing for witnesses to an assault that took place in Lowestoft.

It took place on Sunday 8 October at about 4.30pm on St Peterâ€™s Street near to the Tudor Rose pub.

A male wearing a white and blue puffa jacket and about five foot, nine inches tall punched a 13 year old teenage male in the right eye causing him blurred vision and a cut to the tongue.

The offender then ran off laughing towards the town centre.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or who has knowledge of it should contact PC Samantha Plummer at Lowestoft police on 101 quoting crime reference 37/65941/17 or call Crimestopers anonymously on 0800 555111.
