Officers are appealing for witnesses after a burglary where a car was stolen in Creeting St Peter.

The break in occurred at some point between 5.30pm on Monday 6 February and 7:45am on Tuesday 7 February, in the vicinity of Pound Road.

Access was gained to the front of the house and a bunch of keys were removed. A black Volkswagen Touran was subsequently stolen from the property but was recovered in a field in Stowmarket later that morning.

Witnesses or anybody who has any information related to the incident are asked to call Bury St Edmunds CID on **101** quoting reference 16414/17. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on **0800 555 111** or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
