Police are issuing a follow up appeal for witnesses and dashcam footage following an assault in a park in Newmarket earlier this month.

The assault took place at approximately 8.30pm on Friday 2 June in The Severals, a park in Newmarket, when offenders assaulted a man in his 30s, who was sitting in the park with his friend.

The victim sustained serious injuries, including: a fractured skull, a fractured arm and cuts and bruising. He was treated at the scene and at Addenbrookeâ€™s Hospital.

Two men were arrested on suspicion of assault GBH on Saturday 3 June, interviewed and released under investigation.

Police believe that there were a number of people in the area at the time of the incident who have not yet come forward, and are asking anyone who may have been in the following three areas in Newmarket on Friday 2 June between 8pm and 8.30pm to get in touch:

 * The Severals ( the green area bordered by Bury Road and Fordham Road)
 * The Funfair on the Severals (this had been set up for the Newmarket Funday that took place the following day)
 * The BP petrol station on Bury Road.

Police would also be interested in speaking to anyone with dashcam footage who may have been driving in or close to these areas at the time of the incident.

Anyone with any information should contact DC Gavin Hughes at Suffolk Police Western Area CID on **101**.
