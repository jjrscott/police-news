Police are appealing for information after a handbag was stolen from outside an address in Morton Road in Lowestoft.

The theft occurred on Sunday, 14 May, around 4.30pm, after a woman left the backpack-style handbag in a porch area outside the property while she went onto the beach nearby. When she returned the brown canvas Fendi bag was gone. A number of items including iPhone chargers, personal documents, bank cards and jewellery including a Tiffany & Co silver ring and a gold Michael Kors watch were inside.

Police are asking anyone who may have seen anyone with the bag in the area around this time or anyone who may have been offered similar items since to come forward. Officers would also like to hear from anyone who may have any information about the thief or where the items are now.

If you can help please call officers at Lowestoft by dialling Suffolk Police on 101 and quoting crime number 35125/17.
