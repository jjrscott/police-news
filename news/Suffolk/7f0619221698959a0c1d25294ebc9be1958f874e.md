Police are appealing for witnesses after a vehicle failed to stop following a collision in Ipswich last week.

The incident occurred at around 3.20pm on Wednesday 10 October in Nacton Road, just prior to the Murray Road junction (travelling in the direction of Felixstowe Road).

A silver/grey Mercedes or BMW saloon was involved in a collision with a bicycle, resulting in the 16-year-old male cyclist falling onto the pavement and suffering minor injuries.

The car, which was travelling in the same direction as the bicycle, failed to stop and continued along Nacton Road towards the town centre.

Any witnesses to this incident are asked to contact the Neighbourhood Response Team at Landmark House in Ipswich on 101, quoting reference CAD 263 of 10 October.
