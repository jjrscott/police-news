Police are appealing for witnesses to two incidents of indecent exposure that took place in Lowestoft.

The first happened on Sunday 16 September on Tom Crisp Way in the town at about 1.45am â€“ a woman in her late 50s was walking home after a night out when a male stood in the entrance to the park on the road exposed himself too her and ran off.

He was described as white, aged in his mid 30s, wearing a dark hooded top with the hood pulled up, dark trousers and dark trainers. Nothing was said to the victim.

The second incident took place on 17 September at some point between 5.15 and 5.30pm in an alleyway between London Road South and Kirkley Cliff Road in the town. An unknown male indecently exposed himself in front of children and then pulled up his trousers when a male saw him. Officers are keeping an open mind as to if the two incidents are linked.

Anyone who witnessed either incident, has been subjected to a similar incident recently or knows who the suspect may be should contact 101, quoting crime reference 37/53131/18 or 37/53549/18 (second incident). Alternatively contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
