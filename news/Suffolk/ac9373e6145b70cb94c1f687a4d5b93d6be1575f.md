Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward following several incidents of criminal damage to vehicles in Bungay.

At some point between 10pm on Thursday 2 March and 3am on Friday 3 March, a Citroen car parked in St Johns Road, near Lower Olland Street, sustained deliberate scratches to its paintwork.

This is being linked to four other incidents of criminal damage to vehicles in the same location, that are thought to have taken place sometime between midnight and 3am on Friday 3 March.

The vehicles targeted were a Volkswagen Caddy, a Vauxhall Vectra, an Audi Q5 and a Renault van, and in each incident a wing mirror was vandalised; either bent back or kicked with such force that the glass was damaged.

If you think you know the person or persons responsible, or if you or heard anything suspicion in the area between the relevant times, please contact the Lowestoft Response Team at Suffolk Police on 101, quoting reference 21919/17. Alternatively, this can be reported online via the ‘Report a Crime’ page on the Suffolk Police website: www.suffolk.police.uk.
