Two people have been arrested following an offensive weapon incident in Bungay.

The offence occurred at 10.25am yesterday, Wednesday 8 August, in Reeveâ€™s Close.

Officers were called to reports a Vauxhall Astra had pulled up outside a property and a male got out and made threats towards the occupant whilst brandishing a weapon, before getting back in the car and driving off. Both parties are known to each other.

Police units were immediately sent to the area and officers located the suspect vehicle in the town around an hour later. The vehicle was searched and items including a hammer and a baseball bat were seized.

A 17-year-old boy was subsequently arrested on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon; and a 24-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of affray. Both were taken to Great Yarmouth Police Investigation Centre for questioning.

The 17-year-old has been released under investigation pending further enquiries, while the 24-year-old will face no further action at this time.

Any witnesses to this incident are asked to contact Lowestoft Neighbourhood Response Team on 101 quoting reference 44960/18.
