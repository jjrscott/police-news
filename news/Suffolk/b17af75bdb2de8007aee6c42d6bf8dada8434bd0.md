Police and partners in Suffolk are pledging their support of Mental Health Awareness week by highlighting their innovative work.

Through innovative partnership working, Suffolk Police and Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust (NSFT), supported by East Suffolk & Ipswich and West Suffolk Clinical Commissioning Groups, have become the first county to implement a three-branch approach to address mental health related incidents.

The aim of this joint working is to ensure that people presenting to the police in a mental health crisis receive an appropriate and timely response to their needs. This involves referring some people onto health and social care services for support and treatment at the earliest opportunity.

By identifying people who suffer with mental health difficulties and who could be vulnerable or at risk, police and partners are able to provide the right access to support services, reducing the demand on emergency services and improving the services individuals receive.

The three key elements include; introducing mental health nurses into the Constabulary’s Command and Control Room (CCR); the Mental Health Triage Car; and placing Liaison and Diversion Practitioners (L&D) within Police Investigation Centres (PICs).

Chief Superintendent David Skevington, said "A significant part of our work is around understanding our demand and making sure that our resources are in the right places to provide the best response. We know that we receive a lot of calls linked to vulnerable people, many of whom are suffering with mental health difficulties, and initiatives such as this are exactly what we need to help us align our services with our partners to deliver the best response to those who need help.

"Our work with the NSFT will help us not only lower the amount of repeat mental health related incidents from individuals, but start people who need mental health support on a suitable care and treatment pathway. By using this three-pronged approach, we are stopping the cycle for anyone coming into or already in police custody and getting them the help they so desperately need.

"If a person is reported to us as being aggressive and threatening in a town centre, this will first be picked up by the nurses in the control room and flagged as a potential mental health related incident. The Triage Car will take a mental health nurse to the incident to talk to the person, and if they are taken into custody, they will be given support via the Liaison and Diversion Practitioners in a police investigation centre.”

"Using the knowledge and expertise of mental health staff means that those in need of support are receiving it faster at the time when they perhaps most need it, using better placed resources and providing enhanced support.”

 **Mental Health Triage Car**

The Mental Health Triage Car was introduced as a year-long pilot scheme in April 2014, between Suffolk Police and NSFT, along with support from the East Suffolk Clinical Commissioning Group. This has been extended to continue after the scheme was deemed successful.

The car involves a mental health practitioner attending incidents along with a police officer when people appear to be experiencing mental health difficulties. The practitioners can make an initial assessment, and consult any health records to ensure the person’s mental health needs are taken into account.

The triage car is located in Ipswich but available countywide, is available seven-days-a-week to attend incidents where people are experiencing mental health difficulties. The main purpose of this service has been to improve the care and support to individuals who come into contact with the police, at times of crisis, to develop more appropriate pathways of care and reduce the number of people unnecessarily detained under Section 136 of the Mental Health Act.

A Section 136 detention involves the police detaining someone who is deemed to have a mental health need and requires immediate care and control. Since the introduction of the mental health triage car there has been a considerable reduction in the number of S136 detentions.

 **Liaison and Diversion Practitioners within PICs**

From April 2015, NSFT introduced L&D Practitioners across both Suffolk and Norfolk. L&D Practitioners are located in PICs and work alongside custody staff, healthcare providers and other services.

The Norfolk and Suffolk Criminal Justice Liaison and Diversion Service is provided by NSFT and the charity Julian Support. The teams provide support for vulnerable people, including those suffering from mental health problems and a multitude of other issues.

L&D is a process whereby people of all ages with mental health problems, a learning disability, substance misuse problems and/or other vulnerabilities, are identified and assessed as early as possible as they pass through the youth and criminal justice systems. Following screening and assessment, individuals are given access to appropriate services including, but not limited to, mental and physical health care, social care and/or substance misuse treatment.

It can also help the police and courts to do their jobs by providing up-to-date information on a person’s state of mind; as well as benefit the individual’s health, contribute to a reduction in re-offending, and reduce the likelihood that the individual will reach crisis-point.

Information from L&D assessments is shared appropriately with relevant agencies so that informed decisions can be made on issues of diversion, charging, case management and sentencing.

Siobhan Hemmett, Mental Health Co-ordinator in the Community Safety Department of Suffolk Constabulary, added: "Where appropriate, people with mental health issues should be diverted from the criminal justice systems and placed into health or other supportive services. This in turn reduces the likelihood of re-offending and improves access to healthcare.

"Vulnerable people should be kept out of custody as a police cell is not an appropriate place to put someone who is feeling suicidal or suffering with psychosis. Police are often the first port of call in an emergency and we will always respond, but we are often not the most appropriate agency to provide support. Initiatives such as this allow us to provide the most effective response to those in need of specialist services by referring to our partners.”

 **Nurses in the CCR**

Mental health nurses have been introduced into the Suffolk Police CCR to give advice to local officers on the management of incidents concerning people who appear to be experiencing mental health difficulties. This will improve the way these incidents are managed and assist the police in directing people to health and social care services where appropriate.

The nurses will give police officers access to expert advice on how to deal with people with mental health conditions and work to reduce the number of people suffering mental health crisis who are taken into custody. By collaborative working the aim is to make sure people get the right support when they present to the police service in crisis.

Peter Devlin, Mental Health Social Care Lead at NSFT said: "This is an exciting and progressive service development between Suffolk Police and Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust that will see police officers and mental health practitioners working jointly to assess and support the needs of people experiencing a mental health crisis.

"This will help to ensure that people, coming to the attention of the police, receive a timely assessment of their mental health needs and are directed to appropriate services at the earliest opportunity.”

Suffolk Police and Crime Commissioner Tim Passmore said: "I am absolutely delighted to see that Suffolk is leading the way in its approach to mental health support. I fully support this innovative partnership working between the Constabulary and the Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust.

"Protecting vulnerable people is a crucial responsibility in my role as your Police and Crime Commissioner. It is really important that we ensure vulnerable people in our society are receiving the support that meets their specific needs and I am sure this joint project will develop this.

"Our police officers and staff come into contact with people suffering from mental ill health on a daily basis and it is vitally important that we work together to protect the most vulnerable in our society.”
