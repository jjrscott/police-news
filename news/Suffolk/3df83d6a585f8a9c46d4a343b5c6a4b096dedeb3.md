Officers are appealing for witnesses following a collision in Ipswich last week.

The incident took place on Thursday 18 January at just after 2pm on St Helen’s Street, near to the Regent Theatre in the town.

A woman pedestrian in her seventies and a red Vauxhall Vectra car were involved in a collision. Police and the East of England Ambulance Service attended the scene. The woman, who sustained a serious head injury, was initially taken to Ipswich Hospital by ambulance but has since been transferred to Addenbrooke’s Hospital where she remains in a stable condition.

Witnesses to the collision, or anybody who saw the manner of driving prior to the collision are asked to call Suffolk Police on 101 quoting CAD reference 447 of 18 January.
