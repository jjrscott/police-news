> “Our thoughts are with those affected by the tragic incident in Manchester overnight.
>
> Policing in Suffolk is constantly under review, whether due to local, national or international issues.
>
> We are acutely aware of the threat to the UK from international terrorism, demonstrated by the fact officers and staff from Suffolk and Norfolk Constabularies are today taking part in a pre-planned terrorist training exercise.
>
> “We continue to ask members of the public to remain alert, but not alarmed and advise people to report any suspicious behaviour or activity on the anti-terrorist hotline **0800 789 321** or in an emergency always call **999**.”
>
> **Chief Constable Gareth Wilson**
