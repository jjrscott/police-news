Police are appealing for witnesses following an assault in Lowestoft.

The incident took place at around 3:15pm on Wednesday 19 July on Ranworth Avenue.

Two women in their 20s were walking when a vehicle, which was dark in colour, is reported to have driven past them at speed.

A man, also in his 20s, and another woman got out of the vehicle and confronted the victims. Following a brief exchange, the man is said to have grabbed one of the women’s arms causing her to fall on the floor. His female companion is also reported to have assaulted the other woman.

The man and woman have then returned to the car and are alleged to have driven in the direction of the women, who felt threatened but were otherwise unharmed.

Anyone who witnesses the incident is asked to contact Suffolk Police on 101 quoting reference 49587/17. Alternatively, this can be reported online via the ‘Report a Crime’ page on the Suffolk Police website: www.suffolk.police.uk.
