Police are appealing for witnesses to a theft of a JCB forklift truck from near Bury St Edmunds.

It happened at some point between Friday 20 October at 4.30pm and Monday 23 October at 9.15am and was taken from a commercial premises off Newmarket Road in Risby.

The vehicle is described as very distinctive as it has heavily damaged wheel arches all around and is covered in white chalk dust which would be difficult to clean off. The registration is YX62 CCY.

If anybody saw any suspicious activity, sees a JCB fitting this description or becomes aware of one abandoned or sees one appear at a premises where there isnâ€™t normally one located police would like to hear from them.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Sgt Brian Calver at Stowmarket police on 101 quoting crime reference 37/69035/17 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
