Police are appealing for witnesses or information following two incidents along Felixstowe promenade.

The first incident occurred between 11pm and 11.30pm on Sunday 11 October near the pier.

The victim – a man in his 30s – was approached by two males who demanded cash but the man refused and ran away.

A second incident occurred around the same time, on the same day, also along the promenade.

A man – aged in his 40s –was approached by two males and an altercation took place near the beach.

Officers would be keen to speak to a man and woman who were walking along the promenade moments after the incidents and who were approached by one of the victims as they may be able to help with the investigation.

Anyone with any information about the incidents or who saw anything suspicious at the time is asked to contact Suffolk police, quoting crime reference: 37/59254/20
