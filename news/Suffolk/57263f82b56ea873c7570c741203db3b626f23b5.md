Two women from Norfolk have been charged with burglary, theft and fraud offences occurring across the Waveney district and also in Norwich.

Nickie Masterson, aged 20, and Georgina Sugden, aged 21, were arrested in the early hours of Friday 30 March by officers investigating an attempted burglary at Barbrook Stores on Lowestoft Road in Reydon.

At around 2.30am that morning, officers out on patrol in the village saw a Ford Fiesta outside the entrance to the shop and then witnessed two people running away. The door to the premises had sustained damage consistent with attempts to gain entry.

Other officers were called to assist with a search of the local area and surrounding routes and the suspects were arrested in connection with the incident at around 5.15am on the A145 at Brampton by a police dog unit.

Masterson, of Kingsway, Earsham, near Bungay; and Sugden, of Great Ellingham, near Attleborough; were taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning and have subsequently both been charged with the following five offences:

 * Attempted burglary relating to the incident at Barbrook Stores in Reydon on 30 March
 * Burglary relating to a break-in at Pammy’s Store in Beresford Road, Lowestoft, on 13 March where over £500 worth of alcohol was stolen
 * One count of theft and one count of fraud by false representation; in connection with the theft of a card wallet containing bank cards from a woman in a shop in Beccles on 15 January; and 17 subsequent attempts to make contactless payments using the stolen cards in Beccles, Bungay and Halesworth on the same day
 * Theft of a number of items of clothing from Matalan in Albion Way, Norwich, on 19 January

Both women appeared before Ipswich Magistrates’ Court on Saturday 31 March where they were granted bail pending a next hearing at Great Yarmouth Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday 8 May.

The offence of theft relating to the stolen card wallet and bank cards was withdrawn for both defendants at the court hearing on 31 March.
