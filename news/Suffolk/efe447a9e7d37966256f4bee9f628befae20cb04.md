A 20-year-old man has been remanded in custody after being charged with the rape of a girl under 16, sexual grooming and breaching a sexual harm prevention order.

Christopher Neill, of Marsh Road in Great Yarmouth, was arrested by Suffolk Police officers on Monday 27, after the girl reported that she had been raped in Fen Park in Lowestoft on Sunday 26 March after meeting a man she had contact with on Facebook.

He was taken into custody and interviewed before being charged last night with rape, sexual grooming and breaching a sexual harm prevention order made by Norwich Crown Court on 17 November 2016 which prohibited him from contacting any girl under the age of 16 or being in the company of any female under the age of 16.

He appeared before Norwich Magistrates this morning, Wednesday 29 March, where he was remanded in custody pending his next appearance at Ipswich Crown Court on April 26.
