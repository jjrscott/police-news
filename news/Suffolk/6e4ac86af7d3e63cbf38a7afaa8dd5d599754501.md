Police are appealing for information after the burglary of a container on farm land near Bromeswell, where an air rifle was stolen.

The incident happened between 4pm on Tuesday 18 and 7.15am on Wednesday 19 October, when the container off Sutton Road was broken into.

A Crossman 1.77 Nitro gas operated air rifle, two boxes of agricultural bird scaring bangers and a box of 10 large agricultural rockets were stolen.

The bangers are usually used on a rope fuse and spaced out to go off every twenty minutes but should any person hold them and light them the fuse may go wrong and could cause serious injury to the person.

The rockets are black in colour with an orange cap.

Police are asking anyone with information about who stole the items or where they are now to call Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting crime number 61577/16.
