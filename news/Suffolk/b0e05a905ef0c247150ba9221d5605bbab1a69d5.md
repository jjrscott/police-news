Police are appealing for information after two men were stabbed at an address in Bury St Edmunds last night.

Around 9.40pm yesterday, Tuesday 10 January, two men went to the property at Abbots Gate in Bury St Edmunds and forced their way into the home. Two men inside the property â€“ one in his late 20s, the other in his mid 30s - were attacked, one sustaining stab injuries to his arm and shoulder, the other a wound to his back.

Both men were taken to hospital for treatment. The man in his late 20s received stitches and has now been discharged, the man in his mid 30s is in a stable condition but remains in hospital.

The two offenders are described as black and wearing hooded tops.
