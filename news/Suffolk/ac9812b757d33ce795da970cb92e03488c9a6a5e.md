A 53-year-old man is due to appear before Ipswich Magistrates Court this morning charged with two counts of failing to comply with a Serious Crime Prevention Order.

Shane Crossfield, of Cornflower Close in Ipswich, was arrested at an address in Warrington Road in the town yesterday. He was taken into custody at Martlesham Police Investigation Centre and has now been charged with two counts of failing to comply with the order that was made by Ipswich Crown Court in July 2013.

The charges relate to failing to comply with a Serious Crime Prevention Order made under section 1 of the Serious Crime Act 2007 which states he can only use, own, control or have in his possession a single mobile phone and sim card registered in his name at his notified address, and failing to notify police prior to taking up residency or occupation of any mobile or fixed dwelling.

He has also been charged with possession of cannabis.

He has been detained to appear before Ipswich Magistrates Court this morning, Thursday 6 July.
