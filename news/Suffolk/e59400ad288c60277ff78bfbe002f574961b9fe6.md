Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman in a wheelchair was subjected to a common assault in Bury St Edmunds.

As the victim approached the junction with Beetons way, a man walking in the other direction climbed onto her wheelchair and made offensive comments towards her.

The suspect is described as white, aged between 50 and 60 years-old, around 5ft 10in tall and of large build. He was wearing a white t-shirt and light-coloured shorts.

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to contact Bury St Edmunds Neighbourhood Response Team on 101 quoting reference 37660/18, or the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
