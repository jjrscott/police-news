International Women’s Day is celebrated worldwide and Suffolk Police hosted its own event last Friday, 17 March, pledging its commitment to encourage equality in our communities.

The Putting Women First conference celebrated both the achievements and progress made by women, whilst also highlighting the ongoing gender inequalities in today’s society.

Held at Endeavour House in Ipswich, this year’s theme was to ‘Be Bold for Change’.

Officers from the Community Safety team at Suffolk Police were joined by local international community groups, charities and support services from across the county.

Throughout the day, members raised awareness of the ongoing issues women in Suffolk are experiencing, including addiction, domestic abuse, sexual exploitation and modern slavery.

Chief Inspector Jo Garrard, Head of Community Safety for Suffolk Police, said: "The aim of the event was to bring together different organisations that tackle these issues to raise awareness and understanding of the support available to victims.

"Suffolk boasts an ethnically diverse population and it’s important that those from different cultures feel part of and supported by their local community. Encouraging people to report these types of crimes is the first step in tackling it.”
