Three more people have been charged in connection with the robbery of a woman aged in her 70s, which took place in Cavendish earlier this year.

The incident occurred in the early hours of Thursday 16 April at a property in Nether Road.

Three offenders entered the premises just after midnight, where the victim was asleep in her bedroom. She was awoken by a man holding his hands firmly over her mouth and demanding property, while the two other men searched the home.

After a short time, the victim was able to scream for help, alerting a neighbour who came to assist and raise the alarm. All three men then fled the scene. An untidy search of the property had taken place and an amount of cash and jewellery had been stolen from within.

Today, Wednesday 26 August, three men previously arrested as part of the investigation attended Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre to answer bail, and have all subsequently been charged with robbery as follows:

\- Steven Lawson, aged 43, of Frances Green, Chelmsford, Essex. (First arrested on 8 June);

\- Ashton Seymour, aged 46, of New Wanstead, in the London Borough of Redbridge. (First arrested on 13 June);

\- Anthony Cosgrove, aged 44, of Lodge Close, Chigwell, Essex. (First arrested on 4 August).
