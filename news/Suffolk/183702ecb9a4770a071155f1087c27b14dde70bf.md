While a 17 year old female was also arrested on suspicion of possession of class B or C drugs, suspicion of money laundering, suspicion of being concerned in supplying controlled drug and suspicion of possession with intent to supply.

All three were taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre for questioning and subsequently released under investigation pending further enquiries.
