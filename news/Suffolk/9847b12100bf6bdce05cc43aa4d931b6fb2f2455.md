At around 12:30pm officers out on routine patrol in Needham Market had cause to follow a vehicle.

The vehicle, a Fiat 500, was followed along the B1113 towards Stowmarket before stopping at a commercial premises near the A1120 where officers witnessed the driver and passenger swap positions.

The vehicle then failed to stop when requested to do so and a pursuit ensued along the B1113 back towards Needham Market, during which time a member of public reported seeing items being thrown from the vehicle.

The pursuit continued in the vicinity of B1113 Stowmarket Road where the occupants fled on foot.

A search of the area was carried out by officers, assisted by the dog unit and NPAS helicopter. Two knives were recovered during this search and, at around 1:50pm, two men were arrested.

Twenty-two year old Rhys Hennebry, of Gurdon Road Colchester, has subsequently been charged with the following offences: failing to stop for police, possession of a bladed article in a public place, driving without due care and attention, taking a vehicle without the owner’s consent, driving while disqualified and driving without insurance.

James Van Sertima, 20-years’ old and of London Road Ipswich, was charged with possession of a bladed article in a public place, taking a vehicle without the owner’s consent, driving without insurance; and driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence.

Both men appeared before Ipswich Magistrates yesterday afternoon, Monday 3 July, and have been remanded in custody ahead of their next court hearing, at a date to be fixed.
