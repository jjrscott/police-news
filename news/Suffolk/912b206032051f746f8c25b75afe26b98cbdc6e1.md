A 25-year-old man has been arrested by police on suspicion of engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child under 13 following an incident in a play area in Gislingham earlier this month.

Police were contacted after a group of children reported a man had followed them to the play park near the primary school at Broadfields Road on May 19 and had then exposed himself and acted in an indecent manner.

Officers have been investigating reports of a man acting suspiciously in the area and have been making reassurance patrols in the vicinity.

The 25-year-old was arrested by police yesterday afternoon, Thursday 26 May, and has been interviewed in connection with the incident.

He has now been bailed to return to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre on July 28, to allow further enquiries to be carried out.
