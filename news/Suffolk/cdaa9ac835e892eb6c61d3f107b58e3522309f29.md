Police are appealing for witnesses to a fail to stop road traffic collision that took place in Ipswich.

It happened on Sunday 28 October at 12.36am on Star Lane (A1156) at the junction with Fore Street.

A black Vauxhall Astra was travelling along Fore Street towards Star Lane and a blue Toyota Yaris was travelling along Star Lane towards Grimwade Street when they were in collision.

The driver of the Vauxhall Astra failed to stop at the scene. The two people in the Yaris sustained injuires including broken ribs and bruising and were taken to hospital for treatment. The road was closed until about 3.30am while police cleared the road of debris.

Anyone who witnessed the collision or saw the vehicles prior to the collision should contact Roads Policing at Martlesham Police Headquarters, quoting CAD 13 of 28 October 2018.
