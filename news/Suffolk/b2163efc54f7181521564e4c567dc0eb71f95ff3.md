Police are appealing for witnesses following a burglary at a home in Ipswich over the Easter weekend.

The incident took place at some point between 3:50pm and 4:15pm on Saturday 15 April at an address in Heath Lane.

The victim had been in the garden and, on return to the house, felt that something wasn’t right in her home. On noticing that her purse was missing, she walked through the house and saw an unknown man walking down her stairs.

After a brief encounter, the man exited via the front door and left the scene on a blue and white bike in the direction of Foxhall Road

The man is described as white, around 20 years’ old and of thin build. He is approximately 5ft 5ins in height, has very short hair and was wearing a red and blue top. He also had a cigarette in his mouth.

Any witnesses or anyone with information that may help identify this man is asked to Ipswich CID on **101** quoting reference number 29093/17.
