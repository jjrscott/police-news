Officers are appealing for witnesses or information following an incident of criminal damage in Ipswich last night, Monday 26 March.

It happened at around 11.25pm on Holywells Road in the town. A woman driving a black Fiat Punto slowed down to pass a stationary vehicle and four or five men who were standing next to it on the other side of the road. The men then approached her car and attacked it. Offenders smashed the driverâ€™s window, causing the glass to cave in over the woman. The wing mirror was also damaged and the bodywork dented. The men then shouted at the woman before she drove off. It is reported that the men then ran off down Landseer Road.

The men are described as white and in their twenties who were wearing dark suits.

Although the woman was not injured she was very badly shaken up as a result of the incident.

Officers are appealing for anybody who witnessed the incident or who has any information to call Suffolk Police on 101 quoting reference 37/16494/18. Alternatively, call the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
