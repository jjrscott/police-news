Police are appealing for witnesses to an incident of indecent exposure that took place in Lowestoft.

A teenage female and her friend were walking on the Chaukers Crescent estate at about 9pm on Sunday 25 November when they saw an unknown male on three occasions.

On the third occasion the male positioned himself several metres behind the two females, opposite the junction of Pollard Piece, made a loud sound to get them to turn around, and knelt on the grass verge, indecently exposing himself. Both females ran off upset at the male's actions.

The suspect is described as between 19 and 20 years old, of slim build, with short blonde hair or light brown hair and was wearing a black rain jacket and Adidas jogging bottoms with stripes.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has information relating to it should contact Lowestoft police on 101, quoting crime reference 37/65249/18.

Alternatively, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
