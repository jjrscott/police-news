A driver of a grey Hyundai i10 was seen overtaking several stationary vehicles that were waiting to turn into lane one due to a lane closure sign on the carriageway. The driver was then seen overtaking a large number of other vehicles while travelling in the wrong lane, which nearly resulted in a collision with an oncoming vehicle.

Anyone who witnessed the manner of a driving of the Hyundai i10 at around the time stated or who has dash cam footage of the driving should contact the Norfolk and Suffolk Roads Policing team at Suffolk police on 101.
