Four people have been arrested in connection with a series of motorcycle thefts in Ipswich.

The arrests follow an incident that occurred on Wednesday 30 January at an address in Weavers Close.

At some point between 3.30am and 3.50am, a Honda motorcycle was stolen from the address but following a number of enquiries, the motorcycle was subsequently found at another location in the town on Tuesday 16 February, by officers from the Operation Shere team.

Three people, a man aged 23, a 16-year-old boy and a 24-year-old woman, were detained at this address and were taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning.

The 23-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle, possession with intent to supply drugs – Class A and money laundering. He was subsequently released on bail and is due to return to police on Tuesday 16 March.

The 16-year-old teenage boy was arrested on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle. He was later released on bail and is due to return on Monday 15 March.

The 24-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply drugs – Class A and money laundering. The woman was later released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Following enquiries, a further 14-year-old teenage boy was arrested on Tuesday 16 February, in connection with a separate theft of a motorcycle.

A black motorcycle was stolen from the rear of a property overnight between Sunday 7 and Monday 8 February in Norwich Road.

The boy was taken into police custody for questioning and he was subsequently released on bail and is due to return on Monday 15 March.

Two further motorcycles were recovered during the day as part of the ongoing enquiries and attempts will be made to return them to their rightful owners.
