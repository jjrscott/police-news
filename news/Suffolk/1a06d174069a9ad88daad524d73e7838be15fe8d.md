Police are reminding residents to be alert for telephone scams after an attempted fraud was foiled in the Ipswich area.

The incident occurred on Wednesday 9 May when the victim received a call from a person purporting to be from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), stating that he was being investigated for an historic tax fraud.

The suspect then told the victim that as he had failed to respond to letters he had been sent in the post, court proceedings would now begin against him unless he made an immediate cash payment in excess of £4,000, which would be collected by an agent.

The victim went to his bank in Ipswich to withdraw the money, during which time his wife became suspicious about the call and contacted the police. Officers attended the bank and also the victim’s address and ensured that no money was handed over, speaking to the suspect on the phone when he called back and informing him that the matter had been reported to the police.

Suffolk Constabulary are reminding residents that HMRC will never make phone calls, use text messages or email to tell you about a tax rebate or penalty and will never ask for a cash payment in this way.
