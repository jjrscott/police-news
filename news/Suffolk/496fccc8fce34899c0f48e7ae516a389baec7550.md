Police are appealing for witnesses to a burglary that took place at Kessingland

It occurred at the petrol station in the High Street at about 12:45am this morning (Thursday 25 March).

Two offenders, believed to be two males, had broken in the premises by smashing the front door, made of glass. An untidy search was made, with offenders stealing cigarettes, alcohol, the cash till and the mini safe, all from behind the counter.

Enquiries are on-going to locate the suspects and anyone who saw anything suspicious or knows who the individuals are should contact Lowestoft CID, quoting crime reference 37/14559/21.
