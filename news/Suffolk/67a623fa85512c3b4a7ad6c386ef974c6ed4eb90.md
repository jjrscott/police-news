Police are appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Ipswich.

The incident took place on Stoke Street near to the junction with Austin Street in the town at around 2.00am on Saturday 4 March.

A man walking home was approached by a group of four men. The victim was then grabbed from behind and held around the neck before being pulled to the ground. Suspects stole the manâ€™s mobile phone and keys before letting him go. It is understood that the offenders ran off down Austin Street after the robbery. The victim was badly shaken as a result of the incident but was uninjured.

The suspects are all described as being around 18 to 20 years old and of slim build. The offenders were all reported as speaking a foreign language. One suspect is thought to have been wearing a short sleeved red top and two suspects were reported as wearing dark hooded tops.

Witnesses or anybody with any information are asked to call Ipswich CID on **01473 613500** quoting reference number 20927/17. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on **0800 555 111** or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
