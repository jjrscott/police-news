Two people have been arrested in connection with drug offences following a pre-planned operation in Essex by Suffolk Police.

As part of ongoing investigations into the production of Class B drugs in the county, officers from the Serious Crime Disruption Team, assisted by one of the force’s Sentinel Teams, attended Bredle Way, Aveley on Wednesday, 5 August.

At the property, a 38-year-old man and a 39-year-old woman were arrested and subsequently taken to Grays Police Station for questioning.

Officers carried out a search of the property and a number of items were seized including just over £110,000 in cash.

The 38-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of money laundering and on suspicion of the production of Class B drugs. He has subsequently been released on bail and is due to return to police on Tuesday 1 September.

The 39-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of money laundering. She has subsequently been released under investigation whilst enquiries continue

Detective Inspector Mark Pollikett of the Serious Crime Disruption Team said: "These arrests took place after a period of investigation by my team of specialist officers.

"The supply of drugs and the harm they can cause to vulnerable people is a priority for us and we remain committed to targeting offenders and disrupting criminal activity.”
