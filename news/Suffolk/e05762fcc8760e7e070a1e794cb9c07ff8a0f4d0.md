Police are appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Risby.

The incident occurred shortly after 10.10pm on Friday 30 November outside a property in The Green.

The victim - a man aged in his 30s - was disturbed by a noise outside his home and as he went out, he witnessed two males inside his van. The males then attempted to make off in a dark coloured people carrier, possibly a Vauxhall Zafira, and the man then ran after the vehicle and confronted them.

The man then managed to take back a number of his tools which had been stolen from his van but in the process, one of the males punched the man in the head. The victim also sustained scrapes, cuts and bruises to his legs as a result of the incident.

Two power drills were stolen but a number of other tools were recovered by the victim.

Anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity or has information should contact Suffolk police on 101, quoting crime reference 37/69398/18.

Alternatively, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.

Police are also urging motorists to make sure their vans are locked and all valuables are removed, no matter whether the vehicle is parked on or off-road. Thieves will enter private properties, public car parks and garages to look for insecure vehicles and tools.

Van owners are also advised to register their tools for free at www.immobilise.com by taking note of the serial numbers and models, and to use ultraviolet pen to (invisibly) mark their property, which increases the chances of having them returned to the owner in the event of property being lost or stolen.

Van drivers should also consider the following measures to reduce the risk of being a victim of crime:

• Always lock all doors and shut windows, physically checking van doors are locked.
• Park in a garage or secure area where possible.
• Park with the doors against a wall.
• If you park on your driveway, consider installing motion activated CCTV.
• Be particularly aware when unloading.
• Remove tools from the van if possible.
• To increase the security of tools, you can bolt either a cage or box to the base of the van which should be secured with a sturdy close shackle padlock to reduce and deter further incidents.
• Setting an alarm or immobiliser will make it more difficult for the offender.
• Consider upgrading locks/fitting additional protection.
• Information on police approved products can be found at www.securedbydesign.com
