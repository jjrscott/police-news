Police are appealing for help to trace a man who was seen acting in an indecent manner in The Street, Rushmere St Andrew, on Thursday.

A woman in her 40s was inside her home around 5.45am on Thursday, 1 September, when she looked out of a window and saw the man stood on her driveway watching her. He then put his hands down his trousers and appeared to be acting indecently.

Police need to trace the man, who is described as white, wearing a dark coloured hooded top and dark grey jogging bottoms. He was on a silver hybrid-type bike with either white lettering or a stick along the side.

Anyone with information about the man involved is asked to call Suffolk Police on 101, quoting crime number 53474/16.
