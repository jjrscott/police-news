Police are appealing for witnesses following a car fire in Lowestoft earlier this month.

Officers were called by Suffolk Fire and Rescue Service at 1.50am on Saturday 8 September, to a report that a silver Vauxhall Corsa was alight on a driveway in Durban Road.

The cause of the fire has not been determined and it is possible that it was started deliberately. A witness reported seeing someone running away from the scene at the time the fire service were called.

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to contact Lowestoft Neighbourhood Response Team on 101 quoting reference 51502/18, or the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
