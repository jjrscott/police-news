Police have arrested and charged a 44-year-old man with theft and racially aggravated behaviour.

It follows an incident in Ipswich on Wednesday 1 August when a male was detained by police for theft of goods, a four pack of beer and a bottle of water, from the shelves at Waitrose in Princes Street. He then became verbally abusive towards a member of the security staff using racial abuse towards the member of staff. He was then taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning.

44-year-old Toby Millett of Bridge Street in Halesworth has since been charged with theft and racially aggravated behaviour and was remanded to appear before Ipswich Magistrates’ Court today, Friday 3 August.

In the nearby area, officers have also issued eight Community Protection Notices due to persistent anti-social behaviour such as urinating, verbal abuse, noise, littering and alcohol related violence at The Old Cattle Market Bus Station in the town.

Sgt Vicky McParland of Ipswich Central SNT said: “Put simply, we will not tolerate anti-social behaviour in the community. The community protection warning letters have been issued to individuals in order to prevent unreasonable behaviour that has a negative impact on the quality of life in an area. Any breaches of these warnings can lead to fines or court appearances
