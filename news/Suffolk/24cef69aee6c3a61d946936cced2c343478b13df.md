Police are appealing for witnesses following a serious road traffic collision in Trimley St Martin.

Officers were called by the ambulance shortly after 9.20pm on Saturday 28 September following reports of road traffic collision in High Road, involving a single-vehicle – a Chrysler Grand Voyager – which left the road and collided with a garden fence.

Emergency services attended the scene and the driver – a woman aged her 60s – was taken to hospital with potentially life-changing injuries.

Three passengers, who were also in the Chrysler Grand Voyager, did not sustain any injuries as a result of the collision.

Anyone who may have witnessed the collision, saw the manner of driving prior to the collision, or who may have captured any dash-cam footage near to Trimley Sports & Social Club in High Road at around 9.10pm, should contact Pc O’Neill of the Joint Roads and Armed Policing Team quoting CAD 437 of 28 September.
