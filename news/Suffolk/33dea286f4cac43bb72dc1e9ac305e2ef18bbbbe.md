A 40-year-old man from Ipswich has been sentenced to 11 years’ and one-month in custody with an extended licence period of three years imprisonment after pleading guilty to 20 sexual offences against nine boys.

He was also made the subject of a sexual harm prevention order for life and ordered to sign the sex offenders’ registry indefinitely when he appeared before Ipswich Crown Court today, Friday 21 August.

David Brown, formerly of Duke Street, Hintlesham, Ipswich, was arrested by officers in January 2019 on suspicion of a sexual assault of a boy under 13 years of age. Following a police investigation Brown was subsequently charged in March 2020.

He pleaded guilty to six counts of intentional sexual touching of a boy under 13, four counts of causing or inciting sexual activity with a boy under 13, and one count of sexual activity with a 14-year-old boy, three counts of taking indecent images and six counts of voyeurism. All offences took place between July 2017 and January 2019.

Speaking after the sentencing, Detective Constable Elizabeth Smy said;

"These were horrific offences against very young boys who were purposefully groomed and sexually assaulted by Brown. It was clearly an emotive investigation for all those involved and I would like to thank officers and the safeguarding team for their dedication and professionalism.

"I would also like to pay tribute to the victims’ families for their courage in supporting the investigation and hope that the court result will bring some measure of closure and allow them to move forward positively in their lives.”
