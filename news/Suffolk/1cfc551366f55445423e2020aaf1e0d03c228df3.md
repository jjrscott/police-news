Police are appealing for witnesses and warning people to be vigilant, following a distraction theft in Martlesham.

The incident occurred between 4.05pm and 4.10pm on Tuesday 1 December, at the Tesco car park in Anson Road.

The victim was returning a trolley to the trolley park after unloading shopping into her car, when she was approached by a man who blocked her way and asked her questions about whether there were any parking fees for the car park.

When she got home she realised her purse had been taken out of her handbag by a second man, whilst she was returning the trolley. It was then later used to make two large cash withdrawals.

The victim had withdrawn cash from the ATM at Tesco before going shopping & also used her card in store, and so it is believed one of the offenders observed her entering the PIN number from over her shoulder at one of these points.

The suspects are described as follows:

 * Male one: white, aged in his 20s-30s, 5ft 8in tall, with dark hair and wearing a grey bomber jacket
 * Male two: white, aged in his 20s-30s, of slim build and wearing a peaked cap

Anyone with information about this incident, is asked to contact the Crime Coordination Centre, quoting reference: 69791/20.
