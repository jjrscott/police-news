Police are appealing for witnesses to a burglary that took place in Great Wenham.

It happened at some point between 10.15am and 4.50pm on Thursday 15 February at a property on Raydon Road.

The victim left her house at 10.15am and when she returned she has found a glass panel of her rear window had been smashed. An untidy search has taken place with a quantity of cash and jewellery stolen, including a gents watch, a brooch and bracelet.

Anyone with information or saw any suspicious behaviour or has knowledge of the incident should contact Ipswich police on 101, quoting crime reference number 37/8959/18.
