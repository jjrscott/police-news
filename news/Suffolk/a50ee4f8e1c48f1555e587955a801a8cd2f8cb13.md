Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman aged in her 70s was robbed in Haverhill.

The incident occurred just after 12.20pm yesterday afternoon, Wednesday 31 January, in Mill Road near to Shearman Court.

The victim was walking along the road when she was approached by a man who pushed her sideways, grabbed her handbag and then ran off with it.

A member of the public who was driving past as the incident occurred, stopped his car and began to reverse, at which point the suspect threw the bag into an alleyway. He then ran off down Mill Road, turning into the area of a disused warehouse and a footpath that runs parallel to Mill Road.

The victim was left shaken by this incident, but was otherwise unharmed.

The suspect is described as white, aged over 40, between 5ft 9in and 6ft tall, of heavy build and with a stubble beard. He was wearing a green parka-style jacket with the hood up and light-coloured fur trim to the hood.

Any witnesses, or anyone with information about this incident, is asked to contact West CID at Bury St Edmunds Police Station on 101 quoting reference 5883/18, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
