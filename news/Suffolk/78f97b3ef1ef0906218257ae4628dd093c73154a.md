Police are appealing for information following a burglary in Ipswich.

On Monday 13 February at approximately 12.30pm, offenders accessed a home on Clapgate Lane by breaking a window.

An untidy search of the premises was carried out, before the offenders were disturbed and left through the back door. It is unknown whether any items were stolen.

Police would like to hear from anyone who may have seen two men in the area close to the time of the offence. The first man is described as of mixed race appearance, aged between 20 to 25 years old, about 5 feet 6 inches tall, of slim build, wearing a hood and walking with a stoop. The second man is described as black, aged between 20 and 25 years old, taller and stockier than the first man, and wearing dark clothing.

Police would like to speak to anyone who may have seen or heard any suspicious activity in the Clapgate Lane or Landseer Park areas at the time of the offence. Anyone with any information should contact Suffolk Police on **101** quoting crime number 17488/17.
