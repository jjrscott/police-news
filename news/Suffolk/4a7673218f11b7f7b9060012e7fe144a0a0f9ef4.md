Officers are appealing for witnesses following an incident last night in which a man was stabbed in Ipswich.

Police were called by East of England Ambulance at 10.10pm on Wednesday 6 September, reporting that a man had been stabbed on Dickens Road. Officers swiftly attended the scene.

The victim, a man in his thirties from Ipswich, reported that he was walking along Dickens Road near to the junction of Kelly Road, with his girlfriend, when he was approached from behind by a man. The suspect shouted before stabbing the victim in the thigh with what is thought to be a small knife. The victim sustained a single puncture wound and was assessed by ambulance staff but was not taken to hospital.

The suspect fled the scene and ran off in the direction of Kelly Road. He is described as white man, in his twenties, 5 feet 6 inches tall and was wearing jeans and a black hooded top with camouflage sleeves.

Anybody who witnessed the incident or who has any information are asked to contact Ipswich CID on 101 reference 59266/17. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
