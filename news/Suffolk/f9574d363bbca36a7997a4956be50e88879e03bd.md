Police are appealing for the driver of a small grey hatchback car to come forward following an incident on Marine Parade in Lowestoft.

The incident happened around 6.10pm on Thursday, 28 July, when the rider of a blue motorcycle fell off as the grey car overtook it while negotiating a right-hand bend.

The motorcycle and car – possibly a Renault Twingo or similar – had both been waiting at traffic lights near Notleys before driving onto Marine Parade where the incident happened.

The 46-year-old man riding the motorcycle suffered a minor injury to his leg which was treated at the James Paget hospital before he was discharged.

Police are asking the driver of the vehicle or anyone who saw what happened to call PC Nic Metcalf at the joint Suffolk & Norfolk Roads Policing team by dialling 101 and quoting CAD number 324 of July 28.
