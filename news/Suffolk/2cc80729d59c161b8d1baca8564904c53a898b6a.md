Police are appealing for witnesses after a sexual assault in Ipswich.

The incident took place on the railway bridge near the junction of Wellesley Road and Marlborough Road on Sunday 1 July at 6.45pm.

A 15-year-old girl was walking across the bridge towards Marlborough Road when she was grabbed from behind by her attacker who grabbed her chest. She shouted out before freeing herself and ran back along Wellesley Road while her attacker walked off in the opposite direction.

The victim had been walking from Ipswich town centre when the incident took place. She noticed a boy behind her near to Suffolk New College in Rope Walk and saw the same person behind her when she reached Grove Lane. She then walked along Woodville Road, then possibly Roseberry Road, to reach Wellesley Road.

The suspect is described as a white teenage boy, aged 16 to 18, skinny build, and 5ft 5ins to 5ft 8ins tall. He had untidy ginger hair around 2ins to 3ins long, was clean shaven and wearing a short sleeved T-shirt and possibly shorts.

Anyone who may have seen a person fitting the description above in the area, or anyone who witnessed the incident, should contact Suffolk Police on 101 quoting reference 36417/18. Alternatively contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form at crimestoppers-uk.org
