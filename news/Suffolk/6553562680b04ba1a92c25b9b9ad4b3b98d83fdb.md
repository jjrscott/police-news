Police are appealing for witnesses after a man was attacked at The Severals – in the park on Bury Road in Newmarket - on Friday evening.

The man in his 30s sustained serious injuries including a fractured skull, a fractured arm, cuts and bruising and was taken to Addenbrookes hospital for treatment. He is now in a stable condition. Two men have been arrested in connection with the incident, which happened between 8pm and 8.40pm on Friday, 2 June.

The victim had been sitting on the grass with his female partner, enjoying a drink when he was approached and then attacked.

A 50-year-old man and a 21-year-old man from Ely in Cambridgeshire were arrested on suspicion of assault GBH on Saturday afternoon, 3 June, and both were taken into custody at Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre where they were interviewed before being released under investigation.

Officers are making enquiries and are keen to speak to anyone who may have been in the area around 8pm – 8.40pm on Friday who may have seen any part of the incident.
