Police are appealing for witnesses after, what is believed to be, brown sauce was thrown from a moving vehicle at another motorist in Ipswich.

The incident occurred along Woodbridge Road East, near the Heath Road roundabout, at some point between 5:30pm and 5:45pm on Saturday, 19 August.

The victim, driving a silver vehicle, had been travelling in the direction of Rushmere St Andrew along the short dual carriageway section when a black Vauxhall Corsa drew alongside it and threw something from the window.

It is thought this was brown sauce, which had spattered across the door and dashboard.

Police are treating this as a racially aggravated crime, which caused distress to the victim, and would like to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the incident.

Anyone with information should call the Incident and Crime Management Hub and Suffolk Police on 101 quoting reference 55811/17.
