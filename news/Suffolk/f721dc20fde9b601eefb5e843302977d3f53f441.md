A 58-year-old man has been remanded in custody after appearing before magistrates this morning charged with the attempted abduction of a child in Lowestoft.

Paul Andrews, of no fixed abode, was arrested yesterday, Thursday 15 June, following the incident at North Quay Retail Park on Saturday 10 June.

A woman reported that a man had approached her nine-year-old daughter as both of them stood outside the front of a store there around 8.10pm.

Paul Andrews was taken into custody where he was interviewed by detectives in connection with the incident. He was charged with attempting to take the child from her mother and was detained in custody pending an appearance before Norwich Magistrates this morning, Friday 16 June. He has now been remanded in custody pending his next court hearing, on a date to be confirmed.
