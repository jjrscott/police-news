Police are warning motorists in north-west Ipswich with catalytic converters on their vehicles to take precautions following a number of recent thefts in the area.

Between Monday 2 and Wednesday 4 May there were five catalytic converter thefts in the Castle Hill ward of the town – with four being stolen from Ford Galaxy vehicles and the fifth from a Seat Alhambra.

Police are urging drivers with catalytic converters on their vehicles to take precautions -

If you have a garage please use it to keep your vehicle out of sight – and secure the garage itself to prevent thefts.

If you don’t, try and park your vehicle in such a way that make access to the converter difficult – reversing up against an obstacle, or parallel with another vehicle if you have one, for example.

If possible keep parking areas well lit and consider installing CCTV to deter thieves.

Mark your catalytic converter - etching the part to make it identifiable if it is removed.

Officers are also urging all motorists to ensure they don’t leave items on view in their vehicles – and to make sure you lock up your car or van before leaving them unattended.

If you notice any suspicious activity near vehicles and suspect a crime may be in progress please call police immediately using 999.

Anyone with information about the recent thefts should contact the South West Ipswich Safer Neighbourhood Team by dialling Suffolk Police on **101**.
