A man has been jailed for more than seven years after a serious assault in Beck Row.

Wesley Temple, aged 28 and from Willow Park in Beck Row, appeared before Ipswich Crown Court on Wednesday 28 October where he was sentenced to seven years, four months after pleading guilty to grievous bodily harm with intent.

It follows an incident that took place on Thursday 6 August 2020 at about 6.45pm where a man suffered serious injuries after being assaulted with a machete outside the Londis Village Store in Holmsey Green in Beck Row. A 33-year-old man sustained a serious wound to his hand. Paramedics attended and the victim was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital by ambulance for treatment.

A 30-year-old man was also punched during the incident, suffering minor injuries, while a shop window was also damaged.

Police arrested Temple later that evening, 6 August, in Beck Row and he was taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre for questioning.
He was subsequently charged with GBH with intent.

DC Claire Wright of Bury St Edmunds CID said: "This was a serious assault and the victim has suffered life changing injuries and he continues to have treatment on his hand. The consequences of knife crime can be severe, even fatal, which is why we take any offences involving bladed weapons extremely seriously. If you are found illegally in possession of a knife you will be arrested, put before the court and brought to justice as Temple has found to his cost.‚Äù
