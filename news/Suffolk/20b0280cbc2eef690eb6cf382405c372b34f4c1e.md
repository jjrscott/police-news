Police were called to reports of an attempted robbery on the outskirts of Ufford.

On Friday 23 June at approximately 11.40pm, the victim was walking with his dog along the B1438 Yarmouth Road from Ufford to Wickham, when he was approached by three males on pushbikes.

The victim was struck on the head from behind with an unknown object and then the offenders attempted to grab the dog’s lead. The victim was knocked to the ground, but fought back and may have caused an injury to one of the attackers’ faces.

The three offenders are described as aged between 16 to 20 years old. The first is described as a white male, between 5’8” and 5’10” inches tall, with very short shaved hair. He was wearing a zip up white jumper with three black stripes on the sleeves, light blue jeans and white trainers. The second male is of slim build, and wore dark jeans and a dark hoodie with a black cap. The third male is of slim build, with dark medium length spiky hair, wearing dark jeans, a puffy black bomber jacket and dark trainers.

Police would like to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the incident, seen three males on pushbikes in the area around the time of the offence, or who may have any information to assist the enquiry.

Anyone with any information should contact Police on **101** quoting crime reference number 37/43734/17.
