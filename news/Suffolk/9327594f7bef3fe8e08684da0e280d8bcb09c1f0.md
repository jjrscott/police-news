Police are appealing for witnesses and information following a fail-to-stop collision in Mildenhall.

The incident occurred on the new crossing in Kingsway at some point between 7am and 7:30am last Wednesday, 18 October, when a car – thought to be a small, light-coloured car with round headlights – was in collision with a teenage pedestrian.

She was initially knocked unconscious and was treated in hospital for minor injuries, but has since been discharged.

Police would like to thank the members of public who stopped at the scene to assist the girl, and are making enquiries to trace the vehicle involved.

Officers are keen to speak to anyone who have seen the collision and anyone who may have information about the vehicle or driver involved.

If you can help, please contact the roads policing team at Suffolk Police on 101 quoting CAD 48 of 18 October
