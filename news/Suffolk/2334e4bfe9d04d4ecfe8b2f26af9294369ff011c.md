Police are appealing for witnesses after a male sexually assaulted a teenage girl in Ipswich.

The incident took place at around 4pm on Sunday 26 April, when the victim – a 16-year-old teenage girl – was waiting outside of Tesco Express in Norwich Road.

An unknown male approached her and asked if she wanted to go to his house and look at some puppies. The victim tried to ignore him but the male continued to talk to her.

The victim then decided to cycle away as she felt uncomfortable but she was unaware that she was being followed by the male and his companion.

As the victim reached the junction with Highfield Road and Highfield Approach, the male caught up with her and he held onto her bike, preventing her from leaving before touching her bottom.

The victim felt distressed but moved towards some people she knew who she saw walking towards her. The male then walked away and the victim returned home.

The male suspect is described as mixed race, of medium build, approximately 6ft 1ins tall, with black hair and facial stubble. He was wearing a red cap and had a black rucksack on his back.

The other unknown male, who was with the suspect, was black, of slim build and was wearing a white tracksuit.

Officers are also keen to speak to anyone who may have captured any relevant dash-cam footage while driving along Norwich Road between 4pm and 5pm on Sunday.

Anyone who may have heard anything or anyone with any information is asked to contact Suffolk police, quoting crime reference: 37/23352/20
