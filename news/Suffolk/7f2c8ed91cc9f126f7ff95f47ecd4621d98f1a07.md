Police are appealing for witnesses following a serious two-vehicle road traffic collision in Ipswich.

The incident occurred at 9.25am this morning, Friday 16 October, on the A1214 Valley Road, between the junctions with Henley Road and Westerfield Road.

A black XGJao Silsoe motorcycle was involved in a collision with a silver BMW 520.

Ambulance crews were also in attendance and the motorcyclist – a man aged in his 30s - was subsequently taken to Addenbrooke’s Hospital having suffered a suspected fractured pelvis.

Any witnesses, or anyone who was driving in the area with a dash cam fitted in their vehicle at the relevant time, is asked to contact the Roads and Armed Policing Team at Martlesham PHQ, quoting reference: CAD 69 of 16 October.
