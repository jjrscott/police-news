Suffolk Police are calling on local communities to help tackle incidents of lead theft from churches.

The advice follows reports of attempted theft in Ipswich and Woodbridge in recent weeks; however there are concerns that some incidents are not being reported which limits the Constabulary’s ability to take action.

Police work in close partnership with churches to help detect and deter crime, and encourage all to consider the installation of lighting, CCTV and/or roof alarms.

Rural churches, in particular, are often targeted due to their isolated locations so members of the public are asked to report any suspicious activity they see. Stealing a large amount of lead takes time and a reasonably large vehicle to transport it, so any early reports will assist police in locating the offenders.

Chief Inspector Stuart Grimsey said: "We are asking local people to take an interest in their local church whilst they are out and about. If you take the dog out for a walk, or go for a stroll, don’t ignore anything that you think looks out of place - report anything you think may be suspicious to the police.

"Communities can act as our eyes and ears, and by pulling together to note suspicious activity, we can deter thieves and help keep these historic buildings safe.”
