Two men have been charged in connection with a burglary at a convenience shop in the Chantry area of Ipswich.

The incident occurred at around 4.30am yesterday, Sunday 25 February, at the Co-op in Sheldrake Drive.

A paving slab was thrown through the front door of the shop to gain entry and a quantity of cigarettes and alcohol were stolen from inside.

Following initial police enquires yesterday morning, officers attended an address in the Woodbridge area at around midday and subsequently arrested two men.

They have both been charged with burglary and their details are as follows:

\- Darrell Lambert, aged 31, of Hawke Road, Ipswich

\- Kyle Beard, aged 29, of Church Lane, Eyke

Both men have been remanded in custody and are due to appear before Ipswich Magistratesâ€™ Court today, Monday 26 February.
