Police are appealing for witnesses after a teenage girl suffered a serious injury during a road traffic collision in Holbrook, which occurred in the early hours of this morning, Thursday 15 October.

Police were called by the Ambulance Service at just after midnight, to a report of a single-vehicle collision on the B1080 Primrose Hill, where a black Ford Ka collided with a telegraph pole.

Suffolk Fire and Rescue Service were also called to extract a casualty from the vehicle.

The front seat female passenger was taken to Ipswich Hospital having sustained a serious leg injury. The driver was also taken to hospital for treatment to a suspected broken wrist.

A third occupant of the vehicle - who was a rear seat passenger - sustained minor injuries only.

A 17-year-old boy was subsequently arrested at the scene in connection with the incident, but was later de-arrested and will be interviewed by officers in due course.

Any witnesses to the collision, or who may have seen a vehicle matching the description above being driven in the area prior to it, is asked to contact the Roads and Armed Policing Team at PHQ Martlesham on 101, quoting reference: 59904/20.
