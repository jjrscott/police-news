A 22 year old man has today (Wed 5 September) been convicted of grievous bodily harm following an incident in Stowmarket.

Joshua Williams of Kent Road in Stowmarket was jailed at Ipswich Crown Court for nine years and another three years on extended licence after he pleaded guilty to GBH at an earlier hearing.

The incident happened on Saturday 30 June at about 7.25pm when a 15 year old male was assaulted at the recreation ground on Recreation Road.

The victim suffered serious head and facial injuries and was taken to hospital by ambulance for treatment to his injuries and released on 2 July.

Williams was arrested later in the evening on 30 June and taken to Bury St Edmunds police investigation centre for questioning and was subsequently charged.

DC Victoria Keeble from Western Area CID said: "This was a particularly nasty unprovoked attack on a juvenile in a public place during a summer evening. Williams walked up to the victim, kicked him from behind and once on the ground, kicked him to the head and repeatedly punched and stamped on the head causing extensive facial injuries and the victim to lose consciousness.

"He sustained multiple facial injuries including fractures. Considering the extent of his injuries this could have been so much worse and to see Williams behind bars for 12 years is extremely satisfying. He will now have plenty of time to reflect on his actions that have caused his victim and family great pain, discomfort and distress.‚Äù
