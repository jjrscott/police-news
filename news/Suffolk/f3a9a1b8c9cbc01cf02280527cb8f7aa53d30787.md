Suffolk Police are appealing for witnesses following a burglary in Ipswich and an aggravated burglary in Felixstowe.

The first incident happened on Friday 10 November at approximately 5.50pm, when offenders gained access to a property on Woodrush Road, causing damage to a door and window.

The second incident occurred on Friday 10 November in Felixstowe between 6pm and 6.40pm, when three offenders forced access to a property on Valley Walk and threatened a resident with a screwdriver.

An untidy search of the property was conducted and the offenders stole a silver necklace with a gold pendant, some cash and a mobile phone before leaving the property.

Police are looking into the possibility that these two incidents are linked, and would like to hear from any witnesses who may have seen any suspicious activity in the areas at the times mentioned.

Anyone with any information should contact Suffolk Police on 101 with crime reference number 37/72672/17 for Ipswich and 37/72693/17 for Felixstowe.
