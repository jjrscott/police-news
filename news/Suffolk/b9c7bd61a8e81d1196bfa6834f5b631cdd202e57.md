Police investigating an attempted armed robbery in Beccles have issued stills of two they want to speak to in connection with the incident.

Officers were called to Oliver & J Jewellery LTD on Blyburgate at just before 4.30pm on Tuesday 18 December 2018 after two men with their faces covered with scarves entered the store and threatened two members of staff with a knife before leaving without taking anything.

If anyone recognises the individuals depicted in the stills they should contact police.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or saw any suspicious behaviour should contact Suffolk Constabulary on 101, quoting crime reference 37/73095/18.

Alternatively, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
