Police are appealing for witnesses following two burglaries in Rendlesham.

At approximately 12:50am on Tuesday 4 April, two business properties in Rendlesham Mews were broken into.

Offenders forced entry into the first premises via the front door. Items stolen include a compact camera and tripod, a tablet computer, three hammers and a small quantity of cash.

This incident is being linked to a second break-in in the same area where forced entry was gained via the front door. A quantity of cash was stolen along with the cash register.

Witnesses or anyone with information to help identify those responsible are urged to call Suffolk Police on **101** quoting reference 26982/17 (camera, tablet and hammer thefts) or 26993/17 (cash register theft). Alternatively, for those who wish to remain anonymous, contact Crimestoppers on **0800 555111** or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
