Police are appealing for witnesses following an incident where a vehicle evaded police in Kessingland yesterday.

On Sunday 22 November at approximately 1.30pm, police had cause to stop a white BMW close to Pontins on London Road, however the vehicle made off from officers.

The vehicle was later recovered, but the occupants were not located and no arrests have been made.

Officers would be interested in hearing from witnesses who may have dash cam footage of the white BMW, or who may have any information about this incident that could assist the investigation.

Anyone who saw anything suspicious at the time is asked to contact PC 1858 Chris Smy at Suffolk Police quoting reference number 37/67892/20.
