Police are appealing for witnesses to a burglary that took place in Ipswich.

It happened at a property in Dale Hall Lane yesterday afternoon (Thursday 6 December) when the suspect entered the property using a jemmy to force the metal patio door open. Once inside an untidy search of the two bedrooms has taken place. The occupant arrived home at about 5.15pm, having left the house at about 1.30pm. She may have disturbed the offender as no other rooms have been targeted.

At this stage it is thought a wedding ring and diamond necklace was taken.

Anyone who witnessed the incident, saw any suspicious behaviour or has knowledge of the incident should contact Ipswich CID on 101, quoting crime reference 37/70578/18.

Alternatively, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
