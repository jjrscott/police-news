Suffolk Police are warning residents to remain vigilant following reports of rogue traders operating in Newmarket.

Police, working with Trading Standards Officers, were called to the town on Monday, 17 July, to concerns that vulnerable and elderly residents were being targeted by cold callers offering roof and gutter repairs at high cost.

A 48-year-old man from Cambridgeshire was arrested on suspicion of fraud and forgery on Monday afternoon and taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre for questioning. He has been released under investigating pending further enquiries.

A person who comes to your house without an appointment who is selling something or offering work on your house or garden is a cold caller and police are advising residents to:

 * never agree to buy goods from, or have work done, by someone that calls unannounced at their door, or approaches them on the street
 * always get a written quotation for any work to be undertaken
 * ensure the business is reputable by checking local media publications and the internet

Officers are also reminding traders that contracts over £42 agreed in a customer’s home are subject to a 14-day cooling off period. Written confirmation about their rights to cancel, the identity of the trader completing the work and the total cost must also be provided to the customer.

Anyone seeking reputable companies can access The Suffolk Trader Scheme which promotes the use of Checkatrade's directory of local tradesmen who have been verified by Suffolk Trading Standards and are committed to treating their customers fairly. For further advice please visit the website: https://www.suffolk.gov.uk/community-and-safety/trading-standards-for-consumers/what-is-the-suffolk-trader-scheme/

If you are unable to access the online directory please call 0845 408 4866.

If you suspect a crime is in progress always dial 999. If you would like to speak to someone about rogue traders, please contact your local Safer Neighbourhood Team (SNT) on 101, or Suffolk Trading Standards.
