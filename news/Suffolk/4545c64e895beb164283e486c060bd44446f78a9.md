New Suffolk Police Community Support Officers will be out and about in Wickham Market tomorrow as they put their training into practice in a variety of scenarios.

The day being held tomorrow, Thursday 23 March, will see the new recruits put the skills they have learnt over their eight weeks of training into practice.

The PCSOs and trainers will be based at the village hall and there will be six scenario sites around Wickham Market. Each location will involve a different theme and members of the public as well as police officers and police staff will be involved.

Any residents who would like to speak to the officers are welcome to talk to those taking part.
