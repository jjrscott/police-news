A 27 year old man from Ipswich has been sentenced after pleading guilty to robbery offences.

Peter Price, of Gippeswyck Road has been sentenced to 4 years and 8 months in prison following his appearance at Ipswich Crown Court yesterday, Tuesday 14 March. He pleaded guilty to robbery and possession of an imitation firearm.

Officers were called on Wednesday 21 December at around 1.15pm to the Co-operative shop on Woodbridge Road in Ipswich.

A man entered the business and waited until a customer had left before approaching a shop worker. He held something which appeared to be a gun, concealed beneath a sock, and demanded money. An undisclosed quantity of cash was then stolen and that the offender then fled the scene on foot in the direction of the town centre. No one was injured in the incident.

Detective Chief Inspector Matthew Connick said,

"Today should act as a warning that anyone committing this kind of crime can expect to spend a long time behind bars. It would have been a very frightening experience for those involved.

"I’d like to give praise to the officers that were able to locate the man so soon after the incident, as well as all those who helped secure today’s successful conviction.”
