Police are appealing for information following the attempted robbery of a woman in a wheelchair in Lowestoft.

The incident happened on Horn Hill around 12 midnight yesterday, Tuesday 19 July (Monday 18 into Tuesday 19), as the woman, in her 50s, made her way home. Three males – two white and one black with dreadlocks, all in their late teens to 20s – approached her and tried to take her handbag from her lap. She managed to hold onto the bag and one of the men struck the woman in the face before all three fled.

The woman sustained bruising and swelling to her eye, but nothing was stolen.

Anyone with information about the incident is asked to contact Lowestoft CID by calling Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting crime number 45293/16. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers, anonymously if required, on **0800 555 111**.
