A 30-year-old man has been charged with criminal damage and assaulting two police officers following an incident in Brandon.

Police were called at 11.35pm on Tuesday 20 October to reports that the door to a room at the Valbri Motel in London Road, Brandon, had been kicked and damaged.

Officers attended the scene and a short while later arrested a man on suspicion of criminal damage. Whilst conveying the suspect to custody, two police officers were spat at and kicked. Damage was also caused to a police vehicle, with two windows smashed.

Lee Emery, of William Kett Close, Norwich, has subsequently been charged with the following four offences:

 * Two counts of assaulting an emergency worker
 * Two counts of criminal damage

He has been remanded in custody and is due to appear before Ipswich Magistratesâ€™ Court today, Thursday 22 October.
