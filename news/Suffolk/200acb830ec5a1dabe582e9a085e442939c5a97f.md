Police are appealing for witnesses after a Land Rover was stolen following a burglary in Benhall.

The incident occurred at around 1.35am on Saturday 14 January at a property in Silverlace Green.

The victims were woken-up by their dogs barking in the garden and then heard footsteps on the driveway. The back door was discovered to be ajar and the indicator lights on their Land Rover then illuminated.

One of the victims then ran over to the vehicle and as they got it front of it, the male suspect drove at them, forcing them to jump out of the way. The Land Rover stopped a few yards up the road to pick-up a second man, before driving off towards the A12.

Police were immediately called and a number of units and were sent out in search of the vehicle, which was located in Henley shortly after 2am. It was pursued down Mill Lane, continuing into Coopers Road, at which point it rammed the police car, before continuing onto a dirt track and across a field in the direction of Barham.

Despite a continued search by police units assisted by the NPAS helicopter, officers were not able to locate the vehicle again. The stolen vehicle is a green Land Rover Defender, registration number LA55 BYH.

Police would like to hear from anyone who believes they may have seen this vehicle, or anyone with information about this crime. Calls should be made to Lowestoft CID on **101** quoting reference 12209/17, or Crimestoppers anonymously on **0800 555 111**.
