Officers are appealing for witnesses or information after three premises were burgled overnight.

Police were called at around 11.10pm last night, Sunday 17 December to reports of a break-in at the Spar shop in Barningham. Offender/s stole bottles of alcohol and ran from the premises down Church Road before getting into a vehicle and making off.

Officers were called at 2.20am, earlier this morning, Monday 17 December to reports of a burglary at Martinâ€™s shop on The Street in Melton, near Woodbridge. Offender/s used a breeze block to smash the glass of the front door of the shop and stole cigarettes and alcohol from within before driving off in a car in the direction of Woods Lane.

Police were then called at 3.10am to reports of a burglary in progress at Bramford village hall, Ship Lane in which entry had been forced and alcohol stolen from the bar area. Offenders left the scene in a vehicle which was driven off towards The Street.

Following a short police pursuit through Sproughton the vehicle joined the A14 area and has not been located.

Officers are investigating possible links between the three incidents and are asking witnesses or anybody with information to call West Suffolk CID on 101 quoting reference 72695/18 (Barningham) 72697/18 (Melton) or 72702/18 (Bramford)

Alternatively call the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
