Officers are appealing for witnesses and urging vigilance after the theft of power tools from a vehicle in Ipswich.

Police on patrol in the early hours of yesterday, Sunday 7 October, came across a parked van on Macaulay Road that had been broken into. Sometime between midnight and 2.30am suspect/s forced entry to the white Citroen van and stole a Panasonic Impact driver and Festool power drill, router and planer worth in total approximately £1700.

Anybody who witnessed the incident or who saw any suspicious activity at the time are asked to call Police on 101 quoting reference 57725/18.

If you are offered tools in suspicious circumstances, please do not buy them and let police know immediately via 101. You can also contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Police are urging motorists to lock their car and remove all valuables, no matter whether you park on, or off road. Thieves will enter private properties, public carparks and garages to look for insecure vehicles.

Van owners are also advised to register their tools for free at www.immobilise.com by taking note of the serial numbers and models, and to use ultraviolet pen to (invisibly) mark their property, which increases the chances of having them returned to you in the event of being lost or stolen.

Van drivers should also consider the following measures to reduce the risk of being a victim of crime:

• Always lock all doors & shut windows, physically checking van doors are locked.
• Park in a garage or secure area where possible.
• Park with the doors against a wall.
• If you park on your driveway consider installing motion activated CCTV.
• Be particularly aware when unloading.
• Remove tools from the van if possible.
• To increase the security of tools, you can bolt either a cage or box to the base of the van which should be secured with a sturdy close shackle padlock to reduce and deter further incidents.
• Setting an alarm or immobiliser will make it more difficult for the offender.
• Consider upgrading locks/fitting additional protection.
