Police are urging residents to be alert for telephone scams following reports that a number of residents, particularly in the Newmarket and Mildenhall areas, have been contacted by a caller claiming to be from the tax office, HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), this week.

Fraudsters are typically contacting the elderly, intimidating victims with threats of arrest for alleged outstanding debts or unpaid taxes in their name.

Suffolk Constabularly would like to thank those who have reported the incidents and remind members of the public that HMRC will never make phone calls, use text messages or email to tell you about a tax rebate or penalty and will never ask for payment in this way.
