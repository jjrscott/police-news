A 36-year-old man has been arrested in connection with burglary, theft and drug offences.

Over a period of three nights, between Saturday 28 November and Tuesday 1 December, a locked warehouse in Great Blakenham, was entered and a number of toys and homeware items were stolen from within.

Officers executed a warrant at an address in a nearby village, on Thursday 3 December, and numerous boxes of stolen items were seized and later returned to the owner.

Following the warrant, officers from the Operation Shere team, arrested a man on suspicion of burglary.

The man was further arrested on suspicion of possession of a Class B or C drug and theft in relation to a separate incident.

He was taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning and has subsequently been released under investigation pending further enquiries.
