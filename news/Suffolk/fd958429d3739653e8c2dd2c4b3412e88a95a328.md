Police in Lowestoft have recently carried out an investigation into a large number of bicycle thefts in the town and as a result have successfully recovered at least 40 cycles and parts.

Members of the public, who have had a bicycle stolen and have not already been contacted by police, are invited to view the recovered items in order to potentially identify their property. Viewings will take place at Lowestoft Police Station on Sunday 15 April 2018 between 9am and 4pm. If you are interested in attending please bring photographic identification.

Previously identified property will be not be on display and before property is returned there would need to be some corroborative evidence in the forms of crime reports, photographs, or full descriptive information provided before viewing.

Property will not be returned until the conclusion of these cases.

Officers cannot provide appointment times but the process will be completed as promptly as possible.

Access for this viewing will be via the rear basement gates in Christ Church Square, off Whapload Road, Lowestoft NR32 1XD on the east side of the police station building.
