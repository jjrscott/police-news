A 49 year old Ipswich man has been convicted after pleading guilty to harassment.

Colin Rivers of Hogarth Square in the town appeared before Ipswich Magistrates Court on Tuesday 21 November where he pleaded guilty to causing harassment, alarm or distress to a 36 year old woman using social media.

He was arrested on 6 January 2018 and following subsequent investigations by police he was summonsed to court to answer a charge that between 11 December 2017 and 16 December 2017 he pursued a course of conduct which amounted to the harassment of a woman.

Rivers received 16 week imprisonment, suspended for 2 years. He also needs to pay £900 costs and has had a five year restraining order imposed.
Investigating Officer PC Neil Partridge said: "Harassment can be any repeated behaviour that is unwanted and makes the victim feel threatened, scared or upset and the behaviour of Rivers was such that we were able to bring a prosecution.

"Greater use of social media and digital technology means that offenders now have many additional ways to harass their victims. In this case there was significant emotional impact on the victim.

"Be assured that we take stalking very seriously and urge you come and talk to us or a third party support groups if you have concerns, as we can help. You’re not wasting our time or over-reacting.”
