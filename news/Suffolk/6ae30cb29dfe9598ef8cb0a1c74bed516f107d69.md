Police are appealing for witnesses to a single vehicle road traffic collision that took place in Wickham Market at the weekend.

It happened on Saturday 16 September at 10 minutes past midnight on the B1438 opposite a cemetery.

A black Ford Fiesta was travelling on the road when it struck a kerb and went down an embankment striking a tree in the process.

The 28 year old driver from Ipswich sustained internal injuries and broken ribs in the collision and was taken to Ipswich hospital for treatment.

Anyone who witnessed the collision should contact Suffolk police's Serious Collision Investigation Team on 101 quoting CAD 9 of 16 September.
