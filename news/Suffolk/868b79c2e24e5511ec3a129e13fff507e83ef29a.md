Police are appealing for witnesses following a burglary in Lowestoft in which a quantity of power tools was stolen.

The break-in occurred at some point between 2:30pm on Wednesday 13 and 11:15am on Friday 15 September, when entry was forced into a garden shed to the rear of a residence in Gorleston Road.

A number of tools were stolen, including a MIG welder, a pressure washer, several drills (including Black and Decker and Titan drills), a chop saw, a Black and Decker heat gun, a blow torch, jump leads and various other tools.

Given the quantity of items taken, it is believed the suspect(s) may have used a vehicle to remove the items.

Police are urging anyone who may have seen a vehicle, any suspicious activity or has knowledge of the whereabouts of the items stolen to contact the Suffolk Police Neighbourhood Response Team in Lowestoft on 101 quoting reference 37/62241/17.
