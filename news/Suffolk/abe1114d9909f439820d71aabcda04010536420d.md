Police are appealing for witnesses following a burglary in Ipswich.

The incident occurred at 5.45am on Friday 21 September at a property in Edward Close.

Two unknown offenders forced entry by smashing a window with a brick. A set of keys belonging to the victim’s vehicle – a grey BMW - were stolen from inside. The keys were then used to drive the vehicle away from the drive and in the direction of Kingston Road.

A short time later, after encountering a police patrol vehicle, two offenders decamped from the vehicle and fled in the direction of Bramford Lane. Despite attempts to track the offenders, officers were unsuccessful on this occasion.

Anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity or who has any information about the crime is asked to contact Suffolk police quoting reference 54220/18

Alternatively, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org
