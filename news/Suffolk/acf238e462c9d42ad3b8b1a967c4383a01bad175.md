Police are appealing for witnesses and issuing crime reduction advice following a number of burglaries in Great Barton.

At some point between 28 July at 9am and 1 August at 7.50pm, offenders forced entry to a property on The Coppice. Items stolen include: jewellery, a watch and a wallet.

At some point between 28 July at 3pm and 31 July at 11.30am, offenders forced entry to a window of a property on Conyers Way and caused damage to an internal door. It is believed that jewellery and a watch were taken.

At some point between 30 July and 3 August, offenders forced entry to a property, also on Conyers Way, and have taken items, including: a laptop, rings, gold earrings, a coffee maker, sound bar speaker and a silver Citroen C3 parked on the driveway.

Police are offering crime reduction advice in order to reduce the likelihood of becoming a victim of crime over the summer months:

 * Install alarms and security lights
 * Ask a neighbour to collect your post if you are going away
 * Use timer lights
 * Report any suspicious activity
 * Do not leave valuables on display
 * Lock away tools and gardening equipment

Detectives are investigating whether these crimes are linked and would be interested in hearing from anyone who may have seen any suspicious activity in these areas at the times stated.

Anyone with any information should contact Suffolk Police on 101 quoting crime reference number 37/51942/17.
