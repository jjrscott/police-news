Suffolk Constabulary is today, Wednesday 11th May, opening its doors to new recruits to join the organisation as Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs).

The Constabulary is looking to recruit 22 additional PCSOs who would begin their initial training in September this year.

Vacancies are available in positions across the county, working within Safer Neighbourhood Teams to make a difference in local communities.

In April the Constabulary launched its new county policing model and as part of this, new roles, locations and working patterns for PCSOs were agreed. The work of PCSOs centres on four key areas:

 * Protecting and safeguarding vulnerable people
 * Community Engagement
 * Demand Management / Preventing community problems
 * Crime Reduction

The application process is open from today and will close on the 27th May. For further information and to apply, visit www.suffolk.police.uk/joinus.

Information events will be held on:

 * Thursday 12th May between 6.30pm and 7.30pm at the Kirkley Centre in Lowestoft
 * Tuesday 17th May between 6pm and 7pm at the ISCRE Building, St Matthewâ€™s Street, Ipswich

PCSOs and Constabulary representatives will also be out in the town centres in Lowestoft (London Road North) and Ipswich (Giles Circus) on the afternoon of these events to speak with local people about these opportunities.

A web chat will be held on Wednesday 18th May from 6pm-7.30pm, during which questions can be asked on the role of PCSOs and the application process. The web chat can be accessed on the day via the homepage of the Constabulary website.

Suffolk Constabulary serves a diverse community and we seek to develop a workforce which reflects this, Black, Asian and other Ethnic Minority groups in our community are currently under-represented within our workforce and we therefore welcome applications from these groups.
