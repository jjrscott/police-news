A 49-year-old man has appeared in court charged with four home burglary incidents in Lowestoft in May.

Police were called to reports of an intruder inside a flat at Manor Court around 1pm on May 29. During enquiries into the incident further crimes became apparent and officers investigating arrested the 49-year-old on suspicion of burglary yesterday, Thursday 1 June.

Vincent Day, of Marine Parade in the town, was subsequently charged with three burglaries with intent to steal and one attempted burglary, all at separate properties at Manor Court between 27 and 29 May.

He was detained for court and appeared before Norwich Magistrates this morning, Friday 2 June. He has now been released on conditional bail to appear at Ipswich Crown Court on 30 June.
