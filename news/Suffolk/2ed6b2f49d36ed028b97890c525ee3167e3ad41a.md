Police are appealing for witnesses to an assault that took place in Lowestoft.

It happened on Thursday 25 January at about 9am when a 12 year old girl was walking along a footpath between St Margaretâ€™s Road and Church Road. She was approached by three males who were wearing black hooded tops and described as very drunk who then proceeded to grab her. They then used a broken piece of glass to cause scratches to her face, arms and wrist that caused superficial cuts. She managed to free herself while the males staggered away.

Anyone who witnessed the incident, saw any suspicious activity around the time stated or has knowledge of it should contact Lowestoft police on 101, quoting crime reference 37/4698/18.
