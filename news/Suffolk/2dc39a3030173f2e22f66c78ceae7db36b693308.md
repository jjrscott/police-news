Police are appealing for witnesses to a fail to stop road traffic collision that occurred in Barrow near Bury St Edmunds.

It happened yesterday evening (Wednesday 16 August) at about 6.35pm when a Landrover Freelander was in collision with a HGV lorry on Coalpit Lane. The driver of the HGV failed to stop at the scene. No-one was hurt in the incident.

Officers are keen to trace the driver of the lorry or anyone who witnessed the collision. They should call Suffolk police on **101** quoting CAD 410 of Wednesday 16 August 2017.
