Police are appealing for information after two men were admitted to Addenbrookes hospital with stab wounds.

Officers received two calls from members of the public around 11.20pm last night, Monday 13 February, reporting suspicious behaviour – including a possible altercation - in the Marlborough Court and Wellington Terrace area of Haverhill.

Police immediately attended the area and a search was made but no one was located. Officers began preliminary enquiries and a short time later – just after midnight - Suffolk Police became aware that Cambridgeshire police had been called to Addenbrookes hospital to reports that a man had been admitted with stab wounds. Officers attended and discovered two men – one in his late teens, the other in his mid 20s - had been admitted with stab injuries. Both men are currently said to be in a serious but stable condition.

Detectives are currently investigating what has occurred and anyone who may have seen anything suspicious in this area of Havehill last night or anyone with information about those involved should call Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting crime number 17558/17. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers, anonymously if required, on **0800 555 111**.
