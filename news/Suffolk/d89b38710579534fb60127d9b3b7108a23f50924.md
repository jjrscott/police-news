Police are appealing for witnesses or information following an incident in Friston.

The incident occurred at around 3.10pm on Tuesday 12 January in a field near Aldeburgh Road.

Two dogs were running loose and entered a large flock of pregnant ewes, causing some of them to fall over and be distressed.

The owner of dog is described as male, aged in his 20s to 30s, approximately 6ft tall and of slim build. He was wearing jeans and a wooly hat.

One of the dogs was black and the other dog was black and white. Both were described as being a mixed terrier-type breed.

Police are reminding dog owners to take appropriate steps to keep their pets under control as they are responsible for them and their conduct when out walking.
