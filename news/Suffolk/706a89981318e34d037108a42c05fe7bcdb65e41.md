Police are releasing two CCTV images of a woman officers would like to speak to following a burglary at a home in Bungay in early February.

Someone gained entry to the home in Staithe Road between 6pm on Thursday 2 and 3pm on Saturday 4 February and stole a wallet containing cash and bank cards.

The cards were later used in several stores in the Bungay, Norwich and Great Yarmouth areas.

Police are keen to speak to the woman pictured in connection with the incidents. She is described as white and possibly in her 20s.

Anyone with information about who she is should call Waveney CID at Lowestoft by dialling Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting crime number 15940/17.
