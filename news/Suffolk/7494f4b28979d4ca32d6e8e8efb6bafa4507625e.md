Police are appealing for witnesses following an attempted robbery in Barton Mills.

The incident occurred at around 1.10pm on Monday 12 November, along a path between Jubilee Car Park and Mildenhall Road.

The victim – a man using an electric wheelchair – had come from the direction on Mildenhall, crossed the bridge over the River Lark and was on the boardwalk section of the path.

At this point a man standing in the middle of the path asked the victim for money and when he refused the man grabbed the victim by the top of his coat. A member of the public then shouted at the suspect and he ran off in the direction of Worlington Road in Mildenhall.

The suspect is described as being aged in his 30s, just under 6ft tall, and of medium build. He was wearing a blue hooded jumper, dark blue beanie hat, black jeans, gloves and boots. He spoke with a foreign accent.

Detectives are particularly keen to trace the member of the public who came to the victim’s assistance, as he is an important witness.

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to contact West CID at Bury St Edmunds Police Station on 101 quoting reference 65565/18, or alternatively the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
