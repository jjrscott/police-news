Police are appealing for witnesses following a serious road traffic collision in Elmswell.

The single-vehicle incident occurred at around 4.55pm yesterday afternoon - Thursday 10 May - in Ashfield Road, around 170 yards after the Norton Road junction, heading towards the village.

A blue Dacia Sandero left the road, collided with a tree and then caught fire. Members of the public stopped and helped to free the driver - a man aged in his 40s.

Ambulance and fire crews were also in attendance and the driver was airlifted to Addenbrookeâ€™s Hospital having sustained potentially life-threatening and life-changing injuries. He remains in a critical condition.

The road remained closed until just after 10.30pm whilst a collision investigation took place.

Any witnesses, or anyone who may have seen a car matching the description above immediately prior to the collision, are asked to contact the Bury St Edmunds Roads Policing and Firearms Operations Team on 101 quoting reference CAD 271 of 10 May. Officers are particularly keen to hear from anyone who may have dash cam footage.
