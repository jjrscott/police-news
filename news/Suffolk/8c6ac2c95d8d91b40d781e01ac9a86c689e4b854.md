Police are reminding residents to consider the security of their outbuildings following a series of break-ins in north Suffolk.

Since the end of March, there have been 10 reports of outbuilding burglaries in Aspall, Wingfield, Palgrave and Fressingfield where offenders have been targeting power tools and sporting equipment.

Police are urging members of the public not to forget about the security of their sheds and garages and to report any suspicious behaviour in their local community.

Anyone with information about these crimes, or who believes they may have witnessed any suspicious activity in their local area, is asked to contact the Halesworth Safer Neighbourhood Team on 101, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

 **Tips to secure your outbuildings:**

• Avoid storing valuable items like power tools and sporting equipment like fishing rods and golf clubs in your shed. These should be kept inside your home or in a secure garage.
• Chain items such as bicycles, ladders and lawnmowers to a strong anchor point or to each other using a closed shackle padlock.
• Register your property at www.immobolise.com which is a free web-based property registration service.
• Remember to lock your shed or garage after use.
• Secure shed doors by fitting a strong hasp and staple (or ‘padbad’). Secure this with coach bolts and lock the hasp over the staple with a closed shackle padlock.
• Secure shed door hinges with coach bolts of non-returnable screws (screws which can only be screwed in and not back out again).
• Replace any rotten door or window frames.
• Fit a good quality battery-operated alarm to your outbuilding.
