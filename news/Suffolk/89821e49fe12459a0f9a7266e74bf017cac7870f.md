The first male is described as wearing a grey raincoat with black shoulder panels, light grey trousers, black footwear and black gloves. He covered the lower half of his face.
The second is described as wearing grey tracksuit bottoms, a black top and black gloves; the third as wearing all black clothing, with a white stripe down the side of his bottoms.
