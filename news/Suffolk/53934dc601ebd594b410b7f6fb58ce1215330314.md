Police are appealing for witnesses to a single road traffic collision in the early hours of this morning in Ipswich (Thursday 7 September).

It happened at 1.14am on the A1214 London Road next to Ranelegh Primary School. A silver Honda Civic was traveling from Hadleigh Road along London Road when the vehicle mounted a kerb and collided with a fence.

The driver of the car, a 26 year old male, sustained a fractured skull, while his male passenger sustained a broken leg.

Police are appealing for any witnesses who may have seen a silver Audi being followed by the Honda Civic from Cardinal Park to London Road at about 1am, prior to the collision. Anyone with information should contact Suffolk police on 101 quoting CAD 7 of Thursday 7 September.
