Police are appealing for witnesses following a fail to stop incident and the theft of a JCB forklift.

The incident occurred shortly before 12.30am today, Tuesday 25 August, when a group of unknown males forced entry into a building site in Bull Lane, Long Melford and stole a JBC forklift from within. They then drove away while towing the forklift.

A short time later, officers on patrol on the A1092 noticed a 4x4 Toyota vehicle in the road and a forklift and truck in a nearby field.

Between two or three unknown males then ran towards the Toyota, drove away and failed to stop for officers. Officers followed the vehicle but stood down near a field in Cavendish.

The Toyota was later recovered in a field but there was no trace of the suspects. The other vehicle and the forklift were also recovered.

Officers would be keen to speak to anyone who may have captured any relevant dash-cam footage of the pursuit in the Cavendish area. Particularly, anyone who may have captured three males witnessed in the Peacocks Road area of Cavendish between 12.30am and 1.30am.

Anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area between the times stated should contact Suffolk police, quoting crime reference: 37/49362/20
