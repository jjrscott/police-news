Officers are appealing for information or witnesses after lambs were stolen in Rougham.

Six lambs have been stolen from a field off Moat Lane, Rougham, sometime overnight between Wednesday 30 May and Thursday 31 May.

The lambs had been weaned but had not been tagged. The owner has been distressed by the loss of the animals, which has also damaged her livelihood.

Officers are keen to hear from anybody who may have seen either a suspicious vehicle or person in the vicinity during the time above. Anybody with any information is asked to call 101 quoting 30325/18. Alternatively contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.

Police would urge other livestock farmers to remain vigilant at this time and to call officers if they have concerns. If a crime is in progress always call 999.
