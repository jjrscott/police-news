Police are appealing for witnesses to a serious road traffic collision that took place yesterday (Wednesday 18 April) on the A14.

It happened at just before 1.10pm on the westbound carriageway at Beyton, about 300 yards beyond the Beyton off-slip road.

It’s thought a male, aged in his 40s, had left his vehicle, a grey BMW, that was parked up in a layby. The man was then in collision with a grey Volvo HGV, travelling in lane one of the A14. The victim sustained serious injuries and was taken to Addenbrookes’ hospital by air ambulance for treatment. He is in a critical but stable condition.

The westbound carriageway of the A14 was closed as officers carried out their initial investigations and the road was fully re-opened at 7.45pm.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or was travelling along the route and who has dash-cam footage of it should contact the Serious Collison Investigation Team on 101, quoting CAD 146 of 18 April 2018.
