Two men have been arrested in connection with drugs offences in Leiston.

Officers stopped a suspicious vehicle as it pulled into a car park on the High Street at approximately 6:30pm on Thursday 17 November and seized a quantity of cannabis, a powdered substance and a quantity of cash.

A 27-year-old man from Saxmundham was subsequently arrested on suspicion of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply. A 24-year-old man, also from Saxmundham, was arrested on suspicion of supplying a controlled drug.

Both have been released on bail pending further enquiries and are due to return to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre on Wednesday 18 January 2017.
