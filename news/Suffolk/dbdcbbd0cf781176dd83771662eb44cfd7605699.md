Police are appealing for witnesses to an assault that took place in Lowestoft.

It took place at around just after midnight on Sunday 28 January when a 21 year old woman was assaulted.

She was leaving the Shish Meze Bar & Restaurant when she was challenged by four females on the Esplanade. After being knocked to the floor she was kicked and hit and bitten on the left shoulder. She was picked up off the floor by friends while the group of four females left the scene. In another incident a 22 year old female was also punched and had her hair pulled.
