Two men have been arrested in connection with the theft of copper pipes from a van in Woodbridge.

Police were called at around 12.25am this morning, Wednesday 28 February, by a member of the public reporting they believed items were in the process of being stolen from a van parked in Tennyson Close.

Officers arrived at the scene within 10 minutes and the area was searched with the assistance of police dog units.

A short while later police detained two men in connection with this incident: a 27-year-old man located in Tennyson Close; and an 18-year-old man in Hasketon Road.

The men – who are both from Ipswich – were arrested on suspicion of theft from a vehicle and taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre, where they remain for questioning. A third suspect made off from officers in the direction of the A12 and was not located.

A Peugeot 206 found in Tennyson Close was searched and found to contain items of copper piping and was subsequently seized by police. Further lengths of piping were located discarded near to a hedge in the close.

Anyone who witnessed any suspicious persons or activity in the vicinity of Tennyson Close, either late last night or in the early hours of this morning, is asked to contact the Neighbourhood Response Team at Rhodes House on 101 quoting reference 11312/18, or alternatively contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
