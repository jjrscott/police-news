Police are appealing for witnesses or information following an assault which took place on St Margaretâ€™s Road in Lowestoft.

The incident happened around 6:30pm on Thursday 9 February. An altercation took place between a couple in their late 50s/early 60s and a group of teenagers, two male and two female.

A verbal dispute became physical and the man sustained bruising to his face and head.

Officers are particularly keen to trace a man in a red car who is reported to have stopped and shouted to the group, and a woman member of the public who attempted to intervene.

Witnesses or anyone with information are asked to contact the Lowestoft Neighbourhood Response Team on **101** reference, quoting reference 16857/17.
