Police are issuing a warning for the public to be vigilant for distraction thefts following an incident in Stowmarket that was reported to police.

At approximately 12.10pm on Tuesday 29 August a shopper left her handbag on the seat of her car, a blue Renault Clio, that was parked in Asda car park in the town whilst she filled the car boot with shopping.

As she was returning the trolley to the trolley-bay a male came and asked for directions. When she got home she realised her purse had been taken from her handbag. She later discovered that Â£300 had been withdrawn from her account using a card from the stolen purse.

The suspect is described as male, aged in early 50s with a large face. It is thought that offender had an accomplice who removed the purse whilst the victim was being distracted at the trolley bay.

Police are taking this opportunity to remind the public never leave bags unattended or your car unlocked, even for only a short time. Anyone who has knowledge of the incident should contact Suffolk Police quoting CAD 371 of Tuesday 29 August.
