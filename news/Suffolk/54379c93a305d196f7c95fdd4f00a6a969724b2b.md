Police are appealing for witnesses after a motorist was robbed in Metfield.

The incident occurred at around 5.10am yesterday morning, Monday 11 September, on Fressingfield Road.

The victim - a man aged in his 30s - was driving his black Ford Mondeo from the direction of Metfield towards Fressingfield when he came across a Renault car stopped in the middle of the road.

After waiting for a couple of minutes for the vehicle to move out of the way, the victim then got out of his car and started walking towards it, and at the same time a man got out of the other car and walked towards the victim.

At this point the victim was then pushed from behind by another person and then pushed up against the Renault by the two suspects. He was punched and struck on the head with an object which left him dazed.

The suspects then stole a quantity of cash from out of his wallet and drove off towards Fressingfield. The victim suffered minor injuries and was taken to hospital for a check-up.

Anyone who saw a Renault car - believed to be dark in colour - in the area yesterday morning, or who has any information regarding this incident, is asked to contact East CID at Lowestoft on **101** quoting reference 60101/17, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
