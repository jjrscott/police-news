Officers are appealing for witnesses or information after a serious collision in Ipswich.

On Friday 12 October at around 6.10pm a white LDV van travelling away from the town on Tuddenham Road was involved in a minor collision with another vehicle but failed to stop. The van then continued into Humber Doucy Lane before coming to a stop and ending up on its side.

The three occupants of the van left the scene on foot. One man was located by police nearby a short time later and was taken to hospital having sustained a life-changing injury to his arm. The NPAS (National Police Air Service) helicopter was deployed to assist in the search for the two other people but they are outstanding at this time and police are concerned for their well-being.

The white van was displaying registration plate number KM56 ELV.

Witnesses or anybody who may have dash-cam or mobile phone footage captured in the vicinity around the time of the collision are asked to call the Roads and Armed Policing Team on 101 quoting reference CAD 387 of 12 October. Alternatively, email PC Hurry at [email protected]
