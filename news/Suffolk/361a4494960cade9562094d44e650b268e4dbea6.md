A 45-year-old man from Bury St Edmunds has appeared at court after being charged with two burglary incidents in the town.

Justin Bond, of Tayfen Road, stands accused of one count of burglary and one count of attempted burglary.

The first incident occurred at around 9.50am on Friday 21 July, when police were called to an address in Cullum Road by neighbours reporting they had heard glass being broken.

When officers arrived they discovered that the rear patio doors had been smashed and traces of blood had been left at the scene. An electronic car key fob valued at £1,000 had been stolen from inside. The area was searched, but a suspect was not located.

The second crime took place at 2.20pm on Tuesday 25 July in Hardwick Lane. Police were called by the residents of a house reporting that a man had tried to force their front door open and then broke a window, but had not gained entry.

Officers arrived at the scene within minutes and Justin Bond was subsequently arrested on suspicion of the crime shortly after.

Bond appeared before Ipswich Magistrates’ Court yesterday, Wednesday 26 July, where he was remanded in custody to appear at Ipswich Crown Court on Wednesday 23 August.
