Two paintings based on Suffolk amnesty knives and decommissioned guns seized by the Constabulary are to go on display in a gallery in Bath.

Watercolour artist Lillias August, a member of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours (RI), visited Suffolk Police headquarters early in 2016 to draw knives which had been seized as part of a weapons amnesty in the county. She also returned to do a second painting, this time using guns that had been cut up after being seized.

Now both paintings – entitled ‘Amnesty’ and ‘Decommissioned’ will go on display at The Beaux Arts Gallery in Bath in their mixed exhibition, ‘Still’.

Lillias, who asked for the opportunity to use the items before they were sent for final destruction, used light coming through vertical blinds in a room at police headquarters to highlight the seized weapons.

> **Lillias said;** “Last year I went to visit Suffolk Constabulary headquarters as I wanted to paint a picture of the knives that had been handed in during a knife amnesty.
>
> While I was there, there was news of some firearms that were going to be decommissioned and I asked if I could look at them too. My paintings, ‘Amnesty’ and ‘Decommissioned’ are the result of my time there. There was quite a wait before I could see the result of the firearms decommissioning process – a powerful metal machine had sliced through the guns and rendered them useless. I know knives and guns are disturbing and don’t make comfortable subject matter. I can’t really explain why I wanted to paint them. They are powerful and evocative and will say different things to different people. I suppose that I was primarily drawn to what lies behind them – the stories that they could tell. But I was also drawn to the visual impact of the composition in which items are laid out as if on display, demanding inspection - a format that I have used for several of my more recent still life paintings.”

Three of Lillias’ paintings will be included in Beaux Arts’ still life exhibition in Bath. The exhibition, ‘Still’, is open Monday to Saturday 10am – 5pm between 22 May and 17 June
