Police are appealing for help to identify a man officers want to speak to in connection with an assault.

It happened on 9 May this year at about 11.50am at the Currys/PC World at Copdock Interchange in Ipswich.

A male has entered the store and picked up a Dyson hoover. Staff have confronted him and took the hoover from the male and then in the process of him attempting to leave the store he has pushed one member of staff and head butted another then ran off out of sight.

Anyone who recognises the individual in the still should contact Ipswich police on 101, quoting crime reference 37/25324/18. Alternatively contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
