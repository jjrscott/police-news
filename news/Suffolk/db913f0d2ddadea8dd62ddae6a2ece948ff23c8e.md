A man has had his prison sentence extended – by four years and six months - after a successful challenge by Suffolk Police and the Crown Prosecution Service.

Police and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) had challenged the sentencing of Mark Lee, after he was given a 54 month concurrent sentence for a robbery in Southwold in March 2015, on the basis that it had been unduly lenient.

The sentencing came about after Lee, of Romany Lane, Kessingland, committed separate offences in Norfolk and Suffolk.

On 1 October 2015 Lee had appeared at Lowestoft Magistrates charged with the robbery in Southwold, that happened on Tuesday 3 March 2015 – where between £8,000 and £10,000 had been stolen after two men forced their way into the home of a disabled man in his 60s and pushed him around before stealing a holdall containing the cash.

However Mark Lee had also been charged with other offences in Norfolk and he was jailed for five years at Norwich Crown Court on 22 December 2015 for two counts of penetrative sexual activity with a child, assault by beating the same child, and possession of cocaine.

On May 3 this year, the first day of his scheduled trial at Ipswich Crown Court, he pleaded guilty to the Southwold robbery. At this stage he was sentenced to 54 months imprisonment but this was ordered to be concurrent – to run at the same time as the five-year sentence he was already serving for the Norfolk offences.

Suffolk Police made representations to the Crown Prosecution Service and it was agreed that the sentence should be referred for review on the basis that it had been unduly lenient.

The appeal was heard at The Royal Court of Justice in London today, Friday 15 July, where it was agreed that the 54 month sentence should be consecutive to the existing sentence – effectively adding four years and six months to the term Lee will now have to serve in prison.

Detective Inspector Simon Bridgland said; "Both the sexual activity and the robbery were serious crimes and we felt the concurrent sentence was unduly lenient under the circumstances. The robbery was fully investigated, leading to prosecution of Lee who admitted stealing the resident’s cash. Officers liaised with CPS to carry out a joint challenge and we’re pleased with the decision today.”

Detective Sergeant Matthew Adams said; "Because Lee’s 54 month sentence for the robbery had been ordered to run concurrently to the one he was already serving, he was effectively given no additional punishment for the robbery offence.

"We believed that he should face further imprisonment due to the serious nature of the offences committed and, with the support of CPS, this has been successfully challenged, resulting in Lee being ordered to serve the 54 months as well as the five years given for the Norfolk offences.

"While three people - two men and a woman – were also previously jailed for conspiracy to commit robbery in connection with the Southwold incident, there remains one unidentified male who carried out this crime and we would urge anyone with information regarding who that other male was to call Lowestoft CID on 101 quoting crime reference BE/15/264.”
