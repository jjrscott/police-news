Officers are appealing for witnesses or information following an accosting that took place in Ipswich on Thursday 20 April.

At around 10.50am a woman walking alone along Portman Road noticed that a car was driving slowly alongside her. The man driving the car called out to the woman and tried to engage her in conversation but she ignored him. He then pulled his car onto the pavement blocking her path before eventually driving off.

Nobody was injured as a result of this incident.

The vehicle is described as a silver coloured estate type car in a ‘scruffy’ condition which had a distinctive star-shaped orange coloured sticker on the rear. The driver is described as a white man in his fifties who was wearing a brightly coloured beanie style hat.

Anybody who witnessed the incident or who has any information relating to the driver or the vehicle are asked to contact Suffolk Police on 101 quoting reference 30133/17. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
