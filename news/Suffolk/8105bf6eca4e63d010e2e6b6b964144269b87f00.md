Police are appealing for witnesses or information following an incident involving a dog in Glemsford.

The incident occurred shortly after 9.20am yesterday, Monday 30 November in Silk Factory Row.

A woman, aged in her 30s, was pushing a pram, when she stopped to allow an older couple with a black and white collie-type breed dog to walk past her. The dog then bit the woman on her bottom, which caused piercing to her skin and damage to her clothing.

The woman did not attempt to speak the couple due to shock but she heard one of them speak to the dog.

The couple, a man and a woman, were wearing dark clothing and are described as being aged approximately in their 60s.

Police would like to speak to the couple as they may able to help with the investigation.

Anyone with any information about this incident or who may be able to assist is asked to contact Suffolk police, quoting reference number: 37/69374/20
