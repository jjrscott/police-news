Police are appealing for witnesses following an attempted robbery in Trimley yesterday.

The incident took place at just after 7pm on Tuesday 27 December in St Maryâ€™s Close, Trimley St Mary. A woman parked her car and was standing next to the vehicle when she was approached from behind by a man who demanded her car keys. The victim pushed the man away but he then grabbed her around the neck. The woman screamed and the suspect ran off empty-handed in the direction of Station Road. The victim was shaken as a result of the incident and sustained scratches to her neck.

The suspect is described as being a white man, six feet tall, of slim build with a deep voice who was wearing dark clothing.
