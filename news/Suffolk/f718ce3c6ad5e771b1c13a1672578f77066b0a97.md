Police are issuing an E-fit of a man they would like to speak to following a burglary in Ipswich on Monday, 10 October.

The incident took place at a residential address on Oxford Road, at approximately 11:15am. The offender smashed a rear sash window, unlocked the latch and entered via the dining room.

The victim was home at the time and, upon hearing banging and scraping noises, went to investigate.

As she stood at the top of the stairs, she saw the suspect look up at her. He apologised and exited the house via the front door.

The victim’s purse was stolen from her handbag, containing her bank card, licence and a quantity of cash.

Police are now releasing an E-fit likeness of the man they would like to trace. He is described as white, of average build, with black short hair and aged in his 30s. He wore a light grey sweatshirt with light denim jeans and was carrying a white bag, diagonally across his back, with the word ‘Adidas’ embroidered in blue.

If you recognise him or have any information about that may help with enquiries, please contact Ipswich CID on 101 and quoting crime reference number 60123/16.
