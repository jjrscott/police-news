Police are appealing for witnesses following a serious road traffic collision on the A145 in Brampton.

Officers were called by the Ambulance Service at 1.25pm yesterday, Wednesday 27 January, to reports of a collision at the crossroads with Station Road and London Road, involving a motorcycle and a car - a blue Vauxhall Meriva.

The motorcyclist, a man aged in his 20s, was treated at the scene by paramedics and a volunteer Suffolk Accident Rescue Service (SARS) team. He was then flown to Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge by Air Ambulance after sustaining potentially life-threatening injuries. He remains in a critical but stable condition in hospital.

The driver of the car, a woman aged in her 60s, sustained a minor injury and was not required to attend hospital.

Road closures were put in place while the car and motorcycle were recovered and an investigation was carried out. The roads reopened shortly after 7.10pm.

Any witnesses – including anyone driving in the area at the time with a dashcam fitted in their vehicle – are asked to contact the Roads and Armed Policing Team at Police Headquarters, Martlesham, quoting reference: CAD 149 of 27 January 2021
