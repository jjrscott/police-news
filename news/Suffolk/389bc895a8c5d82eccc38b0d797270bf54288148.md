Emergency services are currently on the scene of a collision near Nacton.

Police were called at approximately 5:30pm today, Friday 22 September, to reports a lorry had overturned at the roundabout near the John Grose car dealership.

The road is partially blocked, impacting traffic heading to and from Ipswich from the Nacton junction of the A14, and is expected to close later this evening to enable recovery works to take place.

Motorists are advised that the Orwell Bridge is scheduled to be closed from 8pm this evening for overnight roadworks. Diversions will be put in place if this occurs.

The lorry driver, a man in his 50s, has been arrested on suspicion of drink driving and has been taken to hospital as a precaution.
