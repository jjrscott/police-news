Police are releasing a CCTV image of two individuals they would like to speak to in connection with a burglary at Lloyds Pharmacy in Hawthorn Drive, Ipswich.

The incident occurred between 10.50pm and 11pm on Saturday 1 September.

Two offenders used a garden spade to smash a glass pane in the door. Once inside, medication and a quantity of cosmetics were stolen.

Police are also linking this incident to two other recent burglaries at the pharmacy.

The most recent incident occurred between 2.20am and 2.35am on Friday 7 September

It is believed an offender forced entry by throwing a paving slab through the front door of the business.

A third incident took place shortly before 1.30am on Monday 27 August, when an unknown offender forced entry by smashing glass in the front door. It is believed perfume and medication may have been stolen.

Anyone who recognises the individuals in the CCTV image, or anyone with dashcam footage captured on the dates and times stated, should contact the Neighbourhood Response Team (NRT 1) at Landmark House, Ipswich, on 101 quoting reference 37/51292/18 (7 September), 37/50305/18 (1 September) or 37/48972/18 (27 August).
