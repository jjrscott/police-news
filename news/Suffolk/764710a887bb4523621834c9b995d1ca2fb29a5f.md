Police are appealing for information after an attempted robbery in Lowestoft earlier this month.

A 20-year-old man was walking along Surrey Street around 2.15am - 2.20am on Sunday 9 July when he was approached by a man who initially asked if he could borrow his mobile phone. When the 20-year-old said no, the man then demanded other items from him before making an attempt to take the rucksack he was carrying off his back. The 20-year-old kept walking and nothing was stolen.

The suspect is described as wearing dark bottoms and a lighter coloured - possibly grey or silver with two white stripes on the arm â€“ jacket or hooded top over a shirt which was not tucked in but hanging out underneath.

Detectives investigating the attempted robbery are appealing for information and are particularly keen to trace two men and two women who were seen on CCTV walking just behind the offender in London Road North just moments before the incident.

If this was you or if you were in the area around this time or have any information about the man involved please contact Lowestoft CID by calling Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting crime number 47209/17.
