Police are renewing an appeal for witnesses to come forward following a serious road traffic collision in Badwell Ash yesterday.

Officers were called shortly after 10.30am yesterday, Thursday 30 July, following reports that a van – a white Ford Transit - had left the road and collided with a tree in Badwell Road.

Emergency services attended the scene and the driver, a man aged in his 20s, was flown by air ambulance to Addenbrooke’s Hospital after sustaining life-threatening injuries. He remains in hospital in a critical condition.

Following initial enquiries into the collision, police believe several vehicles may have travelled between Badwell Ash and Walsham-le-Willows shortly after the collision. Officers would be keen to speak to anyone who may have driven along this route as their help will greatly assist the investigation.

Any witnesses or anyone who was driving in that area who may have seen the manner of driving, either immediately before or after the collision, and who has a dash-cam fitted in their vehicle is asked to contact the Roads and Armed Policing Team, quoting CAD 116 of 30 July via
