Police are appealing for witnesses following a two-vehicle collision near Diss yesterday, Tuesday 12 September.

A blue Mazda and a silver Peugeot 206 were involved in the collision on the B1111 Bury Road, in Market Weston, around 8.45pm.

Police and ambulance personnel attended the scene and the road was blocked while an investigation got underway at the scene. The road fully reopened in the early hours of this morning, Wednesday 13 September, around 1:45am.

Three men were taken to West Suffolk Hospital by land ambulance. One man from the Bury St Edmunds area sustained serious injuries including a fractured hip and a facial fracture, while another man from the Diss area sustained injuries to his wrist and hand. The third man, also from the Diss area, was taken to hospital as a precaution and has since been discharged.

Anyone who saw the collision is asked to the Roads Policing Unit by dialling Suffolk Police on 101, quoting CAD number 417 of 12 September.
