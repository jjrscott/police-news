Police are appealing for witnesses following a collision in Newmarket late on Friday night.

Officers were called by the East of England Ambulance Service shortly after 11pm on Friday, 11 August, to reports of a collision on the A1304 Barbara Stradbroke Avenue, close to the Links junction.

The collision occurred between a blue Jaguar car and a pedestrian.

The pedestrian, a man in his 30s, sustained head, facial and chest injuries and was taken to Addenbrookeâ€™s Hospital.

His injuries are not believed to be life threatening or life changing.

The road was closed to allow for investigation work to be carried out and reopened shortly around 2:15am on Saturday.

Anyone with any information should contact Serious Collision Investigation Team at Suffolk Police on 101 quoting CAD 522 of Friday 11 August.
