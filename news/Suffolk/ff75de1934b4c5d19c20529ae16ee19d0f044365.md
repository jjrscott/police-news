Officers are urging people to be vigilant following recent reports of rogue traders in the Somersham and Little Blakenham areas.

Residents are being encouraged to be on the lookout for doorstep rogue traders who may offer garden maintenance services, such as lawn cutting and hedge trimming, and then deliberately overcharge for the work.

Elderly and vulnerable people are typically being targeted and police are reminding residents to:

\- never agree to buy goods from, or have work done, by someone that calls unannounced at their door, or approaches them on the street

\- always get a written quotation for any work to be undertaken

\- ensure the business is reputable by checking local media publications and the internet

Residents seeking reputable companies can access The Suffolk Trader Scheme which promotes the use of Checkatrade's directory of local tradesmen who have been verified by Suffolk Trading Standards and are committed to treating their customers fairly. For further advice please see our website: https://www.suffolk.gov.uk/community-and-safety/trading-standards-for-consumers/what-is-the-suffolk-trader-scheme/

If you are unable to access the online directory please call 0845 408 4866.

If you suspect a crime is in progress always dial 999. If you would like to speak to someone about rogue traders, please contact your local Safer Neighbourhood Team (SNT) on 101, or Suffolk Trading Standards.
