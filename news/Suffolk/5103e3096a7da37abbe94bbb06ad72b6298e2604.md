Police are appealing for anyone who may have witnessed a rape in Newmarket to come forward.

Officers were called on Sunday evening, 9 April, to reports that a young woman had been raped at some point between 2am and 3:45am the same day, in an alleyway off the High Street, near Church Lane.

A 21-year-old man was arrested in connection with the incident yesterday morning, Monday 10 April, and has been released on bail pending further enquiries. He is due to return to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre on Thursday 4 May.

The victim, in her late teens, is being supported by specialist trained officers as enquiries continue.

It is thought a man may have approached the suspect and victim in the alleyway and spoke to them. Police would like to speak to this man and anyone else who may have witnessed the incident.

If this was you, or if you have any information that could assist enquiries, please call the Bury St Edmunds Safeguarding Unit by dialling Suffolk Police on 101, quoting reference 27991/17.
