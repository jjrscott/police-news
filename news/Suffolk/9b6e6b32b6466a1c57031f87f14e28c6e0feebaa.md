Police are reminding dog owners to take appropriate steps to keep their dogs under control after two incidents in the West Suffolk recently.

The first took place on Monday 7 January in a field near to Waldingfield aerodrome sometime between 6:00am and 10:00am. A sheep was found injured after trying to get through an electric fence. It is believed that the sheep was being chased by a dog.

The second incident took place on the same day in the vicinity of Powney Street in Milden. A sheep in a pen sustained serious injuries after it was attacked by a dog.

Sergeant Brian Calver from the Rural Crime Team said, "Despite repeated appeals, attacks on sheep and livestock by dogs continue happen across our county. We recognise that the vast majority of dog owners are responsible and take appropriate action to keep their pets under control around livestock. Farmers have a right to shoot any dogs that are attacking livestock and nobody wants to see this happen. I would remind dog owners or those walking dogs that they are responsible for any damage that the dog in their care may commit.

Anybody with any information that could identify the dog and person/s involved in these incidents are asked to call 101, quoting reference 1687/19 (Waldingfield) of 37/1722/19 (Milden)
