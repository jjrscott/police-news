Suffolk Police are advising motorists of potential traffic delays in and around Nacton during rush hour tomorrow morning, Friday 17 March, due to a funeral in the area.

A funeral procession will be travelling in the Nacton area, and temporary road closures will be in place which may cause some disruption to traffic on the route.

Police are asking drivers to be aware and, along with the family, thank members of the public for their patience and co-operation in advance.
