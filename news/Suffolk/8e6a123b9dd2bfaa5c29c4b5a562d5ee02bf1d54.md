A woman has been sentenced to four weeks in prison for the theft of perfume from a shop in Ipswich.

Chantelle Kerry, aged 39 years, from Unity Street in Ipswich appeared at Virtual Court today (Friday 12 March) where she was sentenced to four weeks' imprisonment. This also activated a 12-week suspended sentence, resulting in a total custodial sentence of 16 weeks.

It follows an incident that took place on Wednesday 3 March where Kerry entered Boots chemists in Tavern Street, selecting four boxes of perfume worth a total of Â£82.50 before leaving, making no attempts to pay for the items.

Following enquiries by officers, Kerry was arrested on Thursday 11 March and taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre, where she was subsequently charged with theft from a shop.
