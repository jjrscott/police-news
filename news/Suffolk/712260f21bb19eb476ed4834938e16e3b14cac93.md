Police are appealing for information and asking residents to be vigilant after a number of outbuilding burglaries in Brandeston.

The incidents occurred overnight between Sunday 4 March and Monday 5 March at six properties in the village.

At one of the locations several insecure outbuildings on a farm were entered, before entry was forced to a secure building, from where two hedge cutters and a chainsaw were stolen.

The five other incidents involved forced entry being gained to either garages or other outbuildings, and further items were stolen including another chainsaw and hedge cutter, along with at least three strimmers.

Officers are appealing for anyone who witnessed any suspicious persons or vehicles in the village - particularly in the early hours of Monday 5 March - to make contact.

Anyone with information about these burglaries is asked to call the Incident and Crime Management Hub on 101, quoting reference 12172/18, or alternatively contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Police are advising people to review the security of their outbuildings and also to mark valuable pieces of equipment by etching a postcode on them, as well as registering any serial numbers on www.immobilise.com.
