Police are investigating a robbery at Ladbrokes on London Road in Pakefield on Friday 18 May 2018 at 7.15pm.

Two white males, aged between 30 and 40 years, entered the shop with an older white male that was referred to as ‘dad’. One of the males has then jumped across the counter and snatched a quantity of cash from the till. Offenders attempted to assault the manager of the store, who was uninjured, when he intervened. Both males then left the shop walking up London Road South.

Police are appealing for witnesses and ask that anyone with any information about this crime please call Lowestoft CID on 01986 835117 quoting ref 37/27121/18, 101 or the charity Crimestoppers 0800 555111.
