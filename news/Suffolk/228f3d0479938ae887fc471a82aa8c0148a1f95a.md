Police are appealing for witness to report of an attempted robbery in Newmarket.

It happened on Sunday 12 August at approximately 10.50pm on Yellow Brick Road in the town.

Two males on pushbikes stopped a lone 17 year old female walking along the road and demanded money. When she refused one of the males punched her in the face and forces her to the floor where he continued to assault her. A witness shouted and the two males made off towards the town centre. The victim sustained a black eye and bruising and was very shaken by the incident.

Anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity or has information should contact police on 101, quoting crime reference 37/45917/18. Alternatively, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
