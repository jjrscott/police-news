Police have charged two people in connection with firearms offences in Woodbridge.

It follows a police search warrant conducted at an address on Bridgewood Road in Woodbridge on Friday 16 October. It follows a licence visit and check on Thursday 15 October to the same premises.

Two men aged 58 and 24 were arrested on suspicion of firearms offences and were taken to Martlesham police investigation centre for questioning.

58 year old Crispen Richards of Bridgewood Road in Woodbridge was charged early this morning (Sun 18 Oct) with possession of a disguised firearm - namely a walking stick - and possession of a shortened shotgun in contravention of section 4(1) of the Firearms Act 1968.
24 year old Philip Richards of the same address was also charged with the same two offences.

They have been remanded to appear before Ipswich Magistrates Court tomorrow (Monday 18 Oct) at 10am.
