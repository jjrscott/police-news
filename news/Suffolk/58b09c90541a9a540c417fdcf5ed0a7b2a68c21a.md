Police are warning farmers or smallholdings with livestock to be vigilant to suspicious activity as officers believe offenders, who slaughtered sheep on two previous occasions, may still be operating in Suffolk.

The first discovery was made on Saturday 23 December about 5pm in Sproughton by the owner who found the remains of one of the sheep by a stream. The carcass had been taken, leaving the remainder of the animal behind.

The second incident happened at some point between Wednesday 21 February and Thursday 22 February, when an unknown offender had cut the throats of three sheep that were grazing in a field situated off Berners Lane, near Chelmondiston, before removing the carcasses and leaving them in a small wooded area next to the field where two of three sheep were also left partially skinned.

Yesterday, Monday 9 April, officers recovered a bag close to a flock of sheep in Tattingstone and believe the contents within may be linked to this type of illegal activity.

Anyone living in areas where sheep graze should report any out of the ordinary activity such as individuals handling livestock. Members of the public should also be mindful of being offered meat for sale in suspicious circumstances.

To report anything suspicious contact Suffolk police on 101.
