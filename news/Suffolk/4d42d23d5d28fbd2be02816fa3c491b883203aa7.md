Police are appealing for help to trace three males that officers want to speak to in connection with an incident of theft from a motor vehicle.

The incident took place at around 11.15pm on Friday 19 October in Long Bessels, Hadleigh.

An amount of cash, held inside a small black bag, was placed on the driverâ€™s seat of a vehicle. The owner left the vehicle insecure and walked to a nearby premise.

Three males were seen to walk past the vehicle before returning and then running away in the direction of Angel Street. The bag was subsequently found to have been stolen.

The males are described as being in their late teens, of slim build and all with their hoods up.

Anyone who saw the incident, or has knowledge of it, should contact Suffolk police via 101 quoting crime references 37/60596/18. Alternatively contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
