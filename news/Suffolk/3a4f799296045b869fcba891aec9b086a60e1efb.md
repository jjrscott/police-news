Police **** are issuing CCTV images of two men they would like to speak to in connection with two thefts in October.

The first incident took place at approximately 1pm on Wednesday 12 October at a supermarket carpark on Goddard Road, Ipswich; the second at the North Quay Retail carpark in Lowestoft on Friday 14 October at approximately 12:20pm.

In both instances, the victims were approached by a man asking for directions and it’s thought a second man has then stolen their purses whilst they had been distracted. Money was subsequently withdrawn from both victims’ bank accounts.

The first man is described as white, between 5ft 10ins and 6ft tall, and in his late 30’s. He is of medium to stocky build, has dark hair and spoke with the foreign accent.

The second man is also described as in his late 30’s with light, brown hair. He is slightly shorter and of smaller build to the first man.

Do you recognise either of these men?

Anyone with information, or who knows the identity of the two men, is urged to contact Lowestoft Neighbourhood Response Team on **101** quoting reference 60874/16. Alternatively call Crimestoppers anonymously on **0800 555 111**.
