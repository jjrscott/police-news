Police are appealing for witnesses or information following the theft of a trailer in Nacton.

The incident occurred between 7am on Monday 1 February and 4pm on Thursday 4 February in a field at a farm in Ipswich Road.

At some point during the times stated, unknown offender/s entered the field and then removed a bolt securing a gate and chain. Once inside, an Ifor Williams trailer (12 x 6 silver galvanised tipping trailer with solid sides and an electric winch) was stolen.

It is believed the trailer was towed by an off-road vehicle and then driven through the gate. Officers would be keen to speak to anyone who may have witnessed a trailer matching this description in the area between Monday morning and Thursday afternoon.

Anyone with information about the incident, or who believes they may have seen suspicious activity in the area, is asked to contact Suffolk police, quoting crime reference: 37/6174/21
