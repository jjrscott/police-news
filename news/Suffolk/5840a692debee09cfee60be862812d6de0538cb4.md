A man has been jailed for six years following a robbery that took place in Lowestoft.

25 year old Sean Dickson from Worcester Way in Gorleston received the prison sentence following a two day trial at Ipswich Crown Court after he pleaded not guilty. It follows an incident on Saturday 15 April at about 10.30pm where Dickson assaulted the 50 year old male victim in an alleyway near to a shop on London Road South in Lowestoft. The victim was a vulnerable individual with a significant hearing impediment and had general poor physical health.

The victim was struck to the head causing him to fall to the ground with Dickson continuing to assault him by kicking and punching. The victim sustained injuries to right ear, a broken nose and left eye as well as visible swelling and bruising and was taken to the James Paget hospital for treatment. Following the assault Dickson also then stole an envelope containing various bank cards belonging to the victim.

As well as the jail sentence Dickson also received a restraining order lasting until further notice not to contact the victim.

DI Matt Adams from Lowestoft CID said: "The victim had known Sean Dickson since a child so to suddenly turn on this vulnerable individual in such an aggressive and violent manner causing such injuries is particularly despicable. He has a history of violence and was convicted in 2013 for a robbery of a wheelchair bound woman when he stole her necklace. It is very satisfying to see Dickson behind bars for some time and will mean his victim can work on rebuilding his life after what has been a traumatic time for him.‚Äù
