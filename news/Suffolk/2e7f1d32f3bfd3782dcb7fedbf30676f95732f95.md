An Ipswich man has been sentenced to 6 years and 9 months in prison at Ipswich Crown Court today (Wednesday 30 September) following a stabbing in Ipswich in May of this year.

Officers were called to the defendant’s home address on Wherstead Road at around 6.35pm on 11 May, to reports that a man had been stabbed at a social gathering.

Following an argument at the address, Phillip Manning picked up a knife from the kitchen and stabbed the victim in the abdomen, causing a puncture wound requiring hospital treatment.

The 55-year-old was sentenced to 6 years and 9 months after pleading guilty to the offence of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.

DC Emmamdeen from South CID at Suffolk Police said,

“This incident has left the victim with a serious physical injury, as well as significant mental trauma.

I hope that this sentence will serve as a strong deterrent to all those engaged in knife crime, as well as providing some reassurance to the general public that these types of incidents are treated with the utmost seriousness and severity.”
