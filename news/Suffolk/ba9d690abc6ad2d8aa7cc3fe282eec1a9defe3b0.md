Additional officers will be on patrol in the Portman Road area of Ipswich on Saturday as thousands flock to the ground to see Elton John in concert.

Visitors to the event are being advised that extra security measures will be in place and police are advising those attending that there will be bag searches and a visible officer presence in the vicinity of the venue.

Police have been working with venue and security staff and there will be additional officers on duty as well as armed police in the area before, during and after the event.

> **Superintendent Jon Dodman, who is overseeing policing at the ground, says planning for the concert has been underway for some time, and this was reviewed in light of terrorist incidents in London and Manchester.**
>
> “We have been liaising with organisers to put sensible measures in place to ensure concert goers can have a safe and enjoyable evening.
>
> “We know that armed officers can be an unusual sight on the streets of Suffolk, but please don’t be unduly concerned. Armed officers will be supporting uniformed patrols and all are there to provide reassurance. We would ask concert goers to remain vigilant but not to be alarmed. Please be alert for any suspicious behaviour and talk to police or security staff if you have any concerns.”
>
> As per guidance from organisers, police are urging concert goers not to bring large bags with them, and to only bring a small bag if really necessary, as there will be searches for those heading into the ground.
>
> As the area is expected to be busy officers are also urging everyone to allow extra time for their journey, to arrive in plenty of time or to find alternate routes if you’re not heading to the concert.
