Police are appealing for witnesses following a burglary at a home address in Haverhill.

The break-in occurred on Friday 1 December between 8:10am and 4:30pm at the property in Ruffles Road.

At some point during the times stated the offender(s) forced open a rear patio door by smashing the glass with an unknown object before an untidy search was carried out.

Various items were stolen including an Acer laptop and bag, an iPad Air, sets of keys and a quantity of jewellery.

Police are keen to gain further information following suspicious activity in and around the times of the burglary in which a man, who was wearing all black, was witnessed knocking on a door to another property within the same road. He then spoke to an occupant asking for another name, to which the occupant replied, before the man promptly left and ran back to a black Seat Leon. The vehicle was then driven off at speed by an unseen driver.

The suspect is described as being a white male, aged around 25 years old, approximately five foot 11 inches tall, with a slim build, pock marked facial skin and having a strong accent.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has any knowledge of it should contact Bury St Edmunds CID on 101, quoting crime reference 37/76970/17 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
