Police have arrested two men as part of proactive work to tackle the supply of drugs in the Lowestoft area.

Officers from the pro-active Scorpion Team became aware of the men acting suspiciously in the area of Fir Lane and Normanston Drive around 1:20pm on Friday 16 December.

A 51-year-old man from Lowestoft was arrested on suspicion of possession of a Class A drug with intent to supply.

A 19-year-old man from the Middlesex area was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to supply controlled drugs.

Both have been released on police bail pending further enquiries and are due to return to Great Yarmouth Police Investigation Centre in early February 2017.
