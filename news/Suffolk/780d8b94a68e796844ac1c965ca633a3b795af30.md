Police are appealing for information after a cashpoint machine was stolen from Lloyds bank in Lakenheath High Street.

Officers were alerted around 3.50am this morning, Friday 23 June, to reports the ATM had been smashed out of the wall of the bank. A JCB was used to get the machine and this was left in the middle of the road.

At least three people wearing dark clothing were seen in the area and it’s thought they fled the scene in two vehicles – possibly a white car and a red pick-up style vehicle.

Police took a further call around 4am from a member of the public who reported the pick-up appeared to be pulling the ATM. A search of the area was carried out and work is underway to trace those involved in the incident.

The road is currently closed while a full investigation gets underway at the scene. A large part of the wall of the bank has been ripped out.

Anyone who saw any vehicles or any suspicious activity in the area around this time this morning if asked to call west Suffolk CID by dialling Suffolk Police on 101, quoting CAD 40 of today, Friday 23 June.
