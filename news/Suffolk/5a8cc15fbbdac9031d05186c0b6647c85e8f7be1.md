Police are appealing for witnesses following a distraction burglary in Lavenham.

It happened at a property on Sudbury Road yesterday (Wednesday 16 January) at about 4.50pm.

A male rang the doorbell of the bungalow where two elderly residents live, and then he entered the property without being invited. He then proceeded to claim he was a police officer, demanding money from the female resident before he went into the bedroom of a bed-bound elderly male. The female occupant then went to phone a relative and the suspect has left. Nothing was stolen and no force used and no-one was hurt

If someone calls claiming to be a police officer, ask for their identification number and police force. Hang up and call 101 using a different phone. A genuine police officer will not mind waiting while you check.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has reported a similar incident recently should contact Bury St Edmunds CID on 101, quoting crime reference 37/3158/19.

Alternatively, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org

The forceâ€™s crime prevention initiative, known as 1st Principle, which highlights that simple, inexpensive measures can easily be undertaken by anyone in the community.
