Nine drivers were stopped and one vehicle was seized as part of a roadside operation in Stowmarket.

Special officers from the Special Constabulary Roads Policing Unit and an officer from Norfolk and Suffolk Roads and Armed Policing Team carried out an evening of action between 6pm and 12.30am at various locations on Saturday 20 October.

A total of seven vehicles were brought to the site on the A1038 as part of the evening held in a bid to tackle anti-social driving.

A total of nine traffic offence reports were produced relating to various offences. Among these included (one) for no MOT, (two) for no insurance, (one) for a defective tyre. One Prohibition Notice was issued and the vehicle was seized and recovered.

Three vehicles were recorded under the Vehicle Defect Rectification Scheme for the following: For having excessive noise from the exhaust, for having a front anti roll bar fault and another vehicle was reported for having defective offside headlights.

Stowmarket Safer Neighbourhood Team Sergeant, Lisa Vaughan said: “This was a positive operation which sends a clear message to motorists that dangerous vehicles will not be tolerated on the county’s roads and that the police and partner agencies will take action where necessary.”
