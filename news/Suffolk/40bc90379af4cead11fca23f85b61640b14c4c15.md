Police are appealing for witnesses to an incident where a dog fatally attacked a swan.

The incident happened at Martlesham Creek off Sandy Lane at Martlesham on Saturday 27 February at about 1.40pm.

A member of the public states that while walking on a footpath he saw a dog off its lead in the river. The witness said it then chased a young swan and fatally injured it.

The dog was described as a dark Labrador believed to be called ‘Chester’. His owners are described by a witness as being a white male in his 60s with a walking stick and wearing a brown coat and a white female of similar age with long black hair and a green coat. They were seen to walk off along the footpath in the direction of St Mary’s Church.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or knows the owners of the dog responsible should contact Suffolk police, quoting crime reference 37/9937/21.
