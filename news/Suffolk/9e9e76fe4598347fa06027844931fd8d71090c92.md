Two 29-year-old Ipswich men arrested after a vehicle was stolen and then set alight have now been bailed to return to police in September.

The two 29-year-olds were arrested yesterday morning, Thursday 28 July, after a vehicle was found on fire close to the A14 around 5.40am.

The vehicle is thought to have been stolen from the Nacton Road area on Wednesday evening and police enquiries are ongoing.

Both 29-year-olds were detained on suspicion of theft of motor vehicle, dangerous driving and drink driving and were taken into custody at Martlesham Heath Police Investigation Centre where they were interviewed by officers.

Both have now been bailed to return to police on September 20.

Officers are asking anyone with information that may help the investigation to call Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting crime number 47054/16.
