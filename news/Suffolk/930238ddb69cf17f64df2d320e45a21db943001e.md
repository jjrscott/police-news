Police are issuing CCTV footage of a man they would like to trace following an attempted knifepoint robbery in Stowmarket.

The incident happened at a retail premises in the town centre 12.45pm on Sunday 30 August, when a man entered a shop and after waiting for other customers to leave, he approached the counter whilst brandishing a knife.

A short struggle with a member of staff then followed before the offender left empty-handed, dropping the knife as he made off. Fortunately, the victim was not injured during this incident.

Detectives have undertaken a number of enquiries since the incident occurred and in September arrested a 38-year-old man on suspicion of robbery. He was taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre for questioning and was subsequently released under investigation, pending further enquiries.

Officers are now releasing a short piece of CCTV footage of a man they would like to trace in connection with the investigation.

> PC Thomas Handley-Howard, the Officer in the Case, said, “This was a serious confrontation which could have easily resulted in the victim sustaining a nasty injury.
>
> “We are releasing this CCTV footage of a man we would like to speak to about this incident. Although his face cannot be seen in the clip the man has a distinctive gait, walking in such a way that I believe could easily be recognisable to anyone who knows him.”

Anyone who believes they recognise the man in the CCTV footage, or who has any information about this crime, is asked to contact West CID at Bury St Edmunds Police Station, quoting crime reference: 50456/20.
