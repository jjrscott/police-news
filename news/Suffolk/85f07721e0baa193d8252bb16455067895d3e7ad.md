Police are appealing for witnesses after an elderly woman was the victim of a rogue trader.

The incident occurred between 11.45am and 12.15pm yesterday, Wednesday 1 March, in Shannon Close.

The victim received a call at the door from a man who claimed to be in the area doing roof repairs following the storm last week. The suspect said he could check the roof for any damage which the victim agreed to.

He took some ladders off his van and went onto the roof where he lifted up some ‘loose’ tiles. He said he could repair the damage for just over £2,000, but would require the payment up front.

The victim went and got the cash out to pay him and the suspect then said he needed to go and get the materials for the job, driving off and not returning.

He is described as white, aged in his 30s, around 5ft 5in tall, of medium build, with short brown hair. He was wearing a green sweatshirt with ‘Robocover’ in white letters on the left chest. He was driving a white ‘transit-style’ van, also with ‘Robocover’ on the side, in green writing.

Police are appealing for anyone who may have seen a van or a man matching this description in the Haverhill area yesterday.

Any witnesses, or anyone with information about this crime, is asked to contact Bury St Edmunds CID on **101** quoting reference 20338/17, or Crimestoppers anonymously on **0800 555 111**.
