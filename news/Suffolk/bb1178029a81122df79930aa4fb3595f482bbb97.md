Police are investigating an isolated incident of milk being tampered with at Lakenheath Community Primary school.

The school has swiftly introduced additional security measures including adding locks to classroom fridges, and disposing of all unused and non-sealed produce daily.

Thanks to the vigilance of staff no milk was given to any staff or pupils and no threats have been made.

The incident happened at some point between Friday 6 October and the morning of Monday 9 October. It was discovered by staff on the Monday that two half-empty bottles of milk left in fridges had been tampered with.

The tampering was quickly identified and analysis of the bottles has established they were filled on the school premises with a cleaning product.

No further incidents have been reported to the school or others in the area. The school and the police are treating this as an isolated incident.

The school are supporting police with their investigation and officers are keeping an open mind as to the motive as they continue enquiries.

Anyone who has any knowledge of the incident or witnessed any suspicious activity should contact Suffolk police on 101 quoting crime reference 37/66067/17.
