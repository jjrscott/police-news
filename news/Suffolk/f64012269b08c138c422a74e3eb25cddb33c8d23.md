Police need to trace a man who approached a 16-year-old girl as she walked in Sheldrake Drive in Ipswich on Saturday.

Around 8.35am on Saturday, 18 March, the teenager was walking close to the bus stop near the junction with Dunlin Road when a man in a navy blue car pulled up alongside her and tried to engage her in conversation. He asked her to go with him and she repeatedly had to tell him no.

Police need to trace the man involved who is described as black, of thin build, possibly in his late 20s to 40s, with dreadlocks down to his chin. He was wearing a gold chain and gold bracelets on his wrist, a black T-shirt with a picture and writing on and jeans.

If this was you or if you have any information about who the man is, or if you were in the area around this time and saw the incident, please call Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting crime number 23759/17.
