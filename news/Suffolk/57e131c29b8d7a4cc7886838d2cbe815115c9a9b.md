A 45-year-old man has been jailed for five years for firearms offences after police recovered weapons from a boat in Beccles in March.

Pepe Flynn, who was living on a boat moored on the River Waveney at Beccles, appeared at Ipswich Crown Court on 21 April where he was jailed for a total of five years after pleading guilty to a series of offences - two counts of possession of a shotgun when prohibited for life, two counts of possession of a prohibited firearm of length less than 30cm / 60cm, possession of ammunition for a firearm when prohibited for life and possession of ammunition for a firearm without a certificate.

He was also ordered to forfeit the seized weapons – including a black harpoon gun, a double-barrelled shotgun, two handmade pipe guns and a black revolver style handgun - and ammunition and to pay a victim surcharge of £170.

Police became aware that the occupant of a boat moored at The Quay in Beccles may be unlawfully in possession of firearms. Officers attended and arrested Flynn on 18 March. A search was completed of the boat and a number of items were seized including shotgun cartridges and other live ammunition.

Flynn had previously been jailed for offences and was prohibited from possessing firearms or ammunition. He did not hold a certificate for either the weapons or ammunition and was charged with firearms offences on 19 March. He made his first appearance before Norwich Magistrates on 20 March where he was remanded in custody.
