Three people have been arrested after police received reports that motorcycles and quad bikes were being driven in an anti-social manner around the Chantry area in Ipswich.

Officers from the Operation Shere team in conjunction with Ipswich South West Safer Neighbourhood Team, the Neighbourhood Response Team, the Roads and Armed Policing Team and a dog handler, carried out a search and three people, two men aged 21 and 18, and a 19-year-old woman, were detained shortly after 10.45pm near Salmet Close on Friday 19 February.

All three were arrested on suspicion of taking a vehicle without consent and the 21-year-old man was further arrested on suspicion of possession of a Class B drug – cannabis.

They were taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning and were later released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Officers seized two quad bikes from the vicinity of Salmet Close and attempts will be made to return them to their rightful owners.

Officers are urging motorists to be mindful of any suspicious activity surrounding vehicles and motorcycles in the Ipswich area.
