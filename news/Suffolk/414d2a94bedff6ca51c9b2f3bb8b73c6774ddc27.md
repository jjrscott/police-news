Police are appealing for witnesses following reports of an assault in Waldingfield.

The incident took place shortly before 7pm on Sunday, 11 June, in Bantocks Road.

A teenage girl was cycling near Lynns Hall Close when she approached two men standing near a silver vehicle. As she passed them, one man has grabbed her shoulder causing her to fall from her bike and graze her knee. No further contact or exchange was made and the girl got back on her bike to cycle home where police were called.

The first man is described as being well-built, of tanned complexion and in his mid-30s. He was wearing a green t-shirt and had a tribal tattoo on his upper left arm.

The second man is described as white, of slender build and in his early 20s. He is described as tall and has bleached blonde hair and a thin face.

Police would like to speak with the men in connection with the incident and are asking for anyone with information, or who knows the identity of the men, to get in touch.

If you can help, please call Suffolk Police at **101** quoting reference 40992/17.
