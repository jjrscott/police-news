A 19-year-old man has pleaded guilty to 12 charges relating to sexual activity with children, the sexual grooming of an underage girl and possession of indecent images.

Kameron May, of California, Wickham Market, appeared at Ipswich Crown Court on Friday, 17 June, where he admitted a total of 12 offences against eight girls aged between 12 and 15, including six counts of sexual activity with a child, four counts of causing/ inciting a child into sexual activity, one count of sexual grooming and one count of possession of indecent images of children, relating to his possession of more than 1,000 images.

In July 2015 police received an initial allegation via the Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hub (MASH) and a joint enquiry got underway.

A comprehensive investigation was launched, leading to the identification of a number of other victims.

Kameron May is now due to be sentenced on or around July 15.
