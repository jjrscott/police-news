Police are appealing for witnesses to a road traffic collision that took place in Barningham today (Friday 19 January).

It happened at 8.55am on Bardwell Road when a blue Vauxhall Zafira was being driven from Barningham in the direction of Honington. The vehicle lost control on a bend and struck a tree before coming to a rest in a ditch.

The male driver was unhurt as was the female front seat passenger. A two year old girl, a passenger in the vehicle, sustained a serious head injury and was taken to Addenbrookes hospital for treatment. Her injuries are not thought to be life threatening. Two other young children were in the car, one of these sustained a cut to the forehead.

Anyone who witnessed the collision or saw the vehicle prior to the collision should contact Bury St Edmunds Serious Collision Team on 101 quoting CAD 109 of 9 January 2018.
