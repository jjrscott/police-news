Volunteers are being sought to join a specialist CCTV team at Sudbury Police station who monitor cameras in the town and also in Hadleigh.

Over the last seven years the team have made a considerable contribution to increasing public safety and detecting crime. In addition to monitoring cameras, the volunteers also view requested footage and communicate with police officers via police radios. They have flagged up many incidents including criminal damage, affray and theft and have deservedly won awards for their valuable input into community policing

If you would like to be part of this friendly team then visit the Suffolk Constabulary website or contact the volunteers coordinator by ringing **101**. If you would like an informal chat first to find out more about the role of a CCTV volunteer, then contact the CCTV Coordinator, Gwen Taylor, by email; [email protected] who would be happy to arrange a meeting with you.
