A man who was arrested for carrying a firearm and a knife in a public place in Kessingland has been released under investigation.

On Thursday 27 September at 10.45pm officers from the rural crime time, engaged in an operation to tackle poaching, had cause to stop a transit van on Glebe Road East. The driver, a 46-year-old local man, was arrested on suspicion of possession of a loaded air weapon and a number of knives. He was also arrested on suspicion of possession of controlled drugs. Officers then conducted a further search at a property in Kessingland and recovered a number of other firearms, a quantity of ammunition and other controlled drugs.
The man was taken to Great Yarmouth Police Investigation Centre where he was questioned by officers but has now been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Police are urging the public to report any information regarding poaching activity. People that may be engaged in poaching are not only breaking the law but they can also put communities at risk as a result of using unlawful firearms.

Officers take all reports seriously and will actively target those involved in poaching. If anybody has information surrounding persons involved in poaching they are encouraged to contact the Rural Crime Team who are more than happy to help by calling 101 or report it on our website http://www.suffolk.police.uk/contact-us/report-something/report-crime
