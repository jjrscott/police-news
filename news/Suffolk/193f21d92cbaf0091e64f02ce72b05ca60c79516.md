Police are appealing for witnesses following an assault in Lowestoft.

Officers received a report shortly after 8.30pm on Thursday 25 July, that a woman had been assaulted while she was outside of Kingsley House in Clapham Road South.

The victim - a woman aged in her 40s – was pushed with force by an unknown woman, which caused her to fall to the floor.

While the victim was on the floor, she was also kicked and punched. The woman then left in the direction of the town centre with another unknown woman.

As a result of the assault, the woman sustained scrapes and grazes to her face, hands and knees and also chipped her tooth.

The first female suspect is described as having shaved hair with a pony tail on top. She was wearing a white top with jogging bottoms.

The second female suspect, who left with the first female, is described as white, with a slim build, around 5ft 6ins tall and had dark brown hair. She was wearing dark three quarter length trousers, with a red and black floral top.

Officers would be keen to speak to members of the public who were witnessed nearby as they may be able to help with the investigation.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has knowledge of it should contact Lowestoft police quoting crime reference 37/43932/19
