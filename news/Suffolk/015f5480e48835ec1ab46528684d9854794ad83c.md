As part of our commitment to keeping the business community informed about relevant police and crime issues, Suffolk Constabulary are launching a business news page on our website, and a Twitter account @SPBusinessNews. This service will replace the monthly business newsletter which was previously emailed to subscribers.

It will bring together news, crime prevention advice, appeals and updates from Suffolk Constabulary and also the Police and Crime Commissioner.

The new business page is now live.

> **County Policing Commander Jennifer Eves said,**

By having a live service on our website we can update the information making it more timely, relevant and useful. In addition the interactive Twitter account will enable more people to join in a conversation and share issues that are important to them. Do sign up and follow us @SPBusinessNews.”

> **Suffolk Police and Crime Commissioner Tim Passmore said,**

> "Suffolk’s business community is crucial to the county’s wellbeing and effective communication with businesses is essential. This new web page is a vital component of business engagement and I am very supportive of this exciting initiative from the Constabulary”.
