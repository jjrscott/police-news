Police are appealing for help to trace three people they would like to speak to in connection with a burglary that took place in the village of Cockfield, near Bury St Edmunds.

The burglary took place between 5.30pm and 6pm on Monday 10 December. A home in Windsor Green was entered by forcing the glass in rear door. An untidy search has taken place in the upstairs rooms. Jewellery and car keys were stolen the home, and a red BMW 320I edition M sport BMW was stolen from the driveway. The vehicle has since been found elsewhere in the county.

Anyone who knows the identity of the individuals depicted in the CCTV still should contact police.

Officers are still keen to speak to anyone who may have dash-cam footage from anyone driving in the area of A134 between Bury St Edmunds and Sudbury between 5:15pm and 6:00pm on 10 December 2018, or on other roads in the area.
