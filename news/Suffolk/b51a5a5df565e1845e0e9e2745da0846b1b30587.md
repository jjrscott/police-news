Police are appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Ipswich.

The incident took place on Spring Road, at the junction with Bartholomew Road, between 11.44pm and 11.52pm on Monday 30 July.

A 20-year-old man was walking his dog on Spring Road when he was approached by four male suspects on bicycles.

The victim was verbally threatened then punched in the face and had cash taken from his wallet before the suspects cycled off.

It is believed two of the suspects were riding Carrera bicycles, one dark in colour and the other white. The ringleader of the group of suspects is described as white, wearing a grey hooded top and speaking with a local accent.

The suspects had their faces covered and the main offenders wore gloves, with one possibly carrying the Nike brand. One suspect is described as mixed race.

Anyone who witnessed the incident, saw any suspicious activity or has knowledge of the incident should contact Suffolk police on 101 quoting crime reference 37/43038/18. Alternatively, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org
