## Previous release | 9 October 2017

Police are appealing to trace a missing 18-year-old man from Bury St Edmunds.

Harry Mills left the Hardwick Lane area of town at approximately 4pm on Saturday, 7 October, and travelled to Cambridge with a friend by car, but has not been seen since. It is believed he made his way to the Islington area of London but could have travelled further afield.

Mr Mills is described as white, 5ft 8ins in height (approximately 1.72m), of slim build and has short, dark brown hair. He was wearing a bright blue coat, green jumper, grey jogging bottoms and trainers.

He is considered to be vulnerable and as such his family and police are concerned for his welfare.

Anyone who believes they may have seen Mr Mills, or who has any information regarding his whereabouts, is asked to contact Suffolk Police on 101.
