Police are appealing for witnesses following an incident of theft in Bury St Edmunds.

The incident occurred at around 8am yesterday, Sunday 4 November, in Beestons Way.

A 17-year-old teenager was walking between the underpass and the entrance to the nature reserve when two unknown offenders approached him from behind and snatched his bag. The black puma bag contained a number of items including, a Sony Experia mobile phone, a brown leather wallet, an amount of cash, various cards, a phone charger and a green insulin pen.

The first suspect is described as male, black, 5ft 8ins and of a slim build. He was wearing a black hoodie, Adidas black tracksuit bottoms and trainers.

The second male suspect, who is described as being taller than the first suspect and also of a slim build, was wearing a black Nike jumper, black Adidas tracksuit bottoms, gloves and trainers.

Both the male suspects, who had their heads and faces covered with balaclavas, then ran off in the direction of County Upper School.

Anyone who may have seen the incident, has any other information regarding the items or has dash-cam or CCTV footage, should contact Suffolk police on 101 quoting reference 63970/18.
