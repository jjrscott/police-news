Police in Ipswich have arrested a 19 year old man from Essex in connection with drug offences.

Officers were on foot patrol in the area of Jubilee Park in the town yesterday (Tues 6 November).

Police had reason to conduct a search of the male on Little Bramford Lane and located a number of mobile phones on him.

A further, more detailed search of the individual was conducted and officers recovered what was believed to be a small package of suspected drugs.

He was subsequently arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply drugs and possession of a class B drug and taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning.

He was later released under investigation pending further enquiries.
