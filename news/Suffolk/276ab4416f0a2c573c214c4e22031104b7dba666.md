A 24-year-old man has been remanded in custody after being charged with GBH with intent and possession of a meat cleaver in a public place following an incident in Lowestoft.

Police were contacted around 1am on Saturday, 17 June, reporting that a young man had been attacked with a meat cleaver in Avondale Road. Police and ambulance personnel attended and a 17-year-old boy was taken to hospital with a serious wound to his shoulder. He has now been discharged from hospital but had to have 17 stitches to suture the wound.

The 24-year-old man was arrested a short time later on suspicion of assault GBH. He was taken into custody and interviewed by detectives.
