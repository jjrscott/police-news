Police have charged a man after a police officer was assaulted in Brandon.

It follows an incident in the town on Wednesday 9 December at about 3.35pm on London Road.

An officer was on the scene of unconnected road traffic collision when she witnessed aggressive behaviour by a male. She approached him and he was verbally aggressive to her when she challenged his behaviour. He then grabbed her and threw her to the floor, sustaining pain in her knee and elbow and she was later discharged. The male was arrested and taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre.

47 year old Jonathan Mcaughtrie of London Road in Brandon was charged with assault on a police officer and also causing harassment, alarm or distress, threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour or disorderly behaviour.

He has been released on bail to appear before Ipswich Magistrates' Court on 23 February 2021.
