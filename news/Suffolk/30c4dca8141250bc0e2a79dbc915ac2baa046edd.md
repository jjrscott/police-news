The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020 (‘the Regulations’) came into force on 26 March 2020, applied to England only, and were updated on Monday 14 September 2020.

The updated regulations included new restrictions relating to gatherings of more than six.

The four Es remain a key part of our response; engaging, explaining and encouraging with enforcement to be used when required.

Commenting on the changes around the limit on all gatherings to six people inside or outside, with a few exceptions, Assistant Chief Constable Simon Megicks, said:

“The pandemic has brought many challenges to our communities and the new laws on gatherings are another change we will all need to adapt to.

“Suffolk Police will continue to work with our partners, our residents, businesses and visitors to ensure this new legislation around gatherings of no more than six people is understood and adhered to.

“Our focus will remain one of reassurance, looking to engage, explain and encouraging people to follow the new regulations. We will enforce where necessary.

"We will always try to disperse people rather than use enforcement but officers will act against those who choose to break the rules and disregard these measures, and put people's lives at risk.

“The demands on the force are now at similar levels to before the pandemic, which makes it crucially important that we all take personal responsibility, protect ourselves and others and help prevent the spread of this deadly virus.

"We need to remember that anyone can spread it, the Public Health England and NHS advice is there for a reason. People in Suffolk have risen admirably to the considerable previous challenges of staying at home and leaving the house as infrequently as possible, let’s not let the side down now, please continue to stay abide by the rules to help us all save lives. We would ask you to stick with it Suffolk and work together to reduce the threat.”
