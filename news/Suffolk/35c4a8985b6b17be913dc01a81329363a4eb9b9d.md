Officers are appealing for witnesses following two burglaries that took place early this morning, Tuesday 4 October in Mendlesham and Ipswich.

The first burglary, a ram-raid, happened on Market Street in Mendlesham at around 2.50am. Suspects driving a silver Vauxhall Zafira car reversed it into the door of the property to gain access. It is understood that a quantity of cigarettes were stolen. The victim was pushed out the way during the burglary but was not injured.

The second burglary took place at a business premises on Woodbridge Road, near to the junction of Schreiber Road, Ipswich at around 3.50am. Suspects forced entry to the building by smashing a glass door. A cigarette cabinet was then damaged and a bottle of alcohol was stolen.

The suspects in both incidents are thought to be four men all wearing face-coverings and possibly gloves who were driving a silver Vauxhall Zafira car, registration mark KL55 TVP, which had been stolen last night from an address in Mendlesham. The car has not yet been recovered. Nobody was injured in either burglary and officers are investigating a possible link between the two incidents.

Detectives would like to hear from anyone who believes they witnessed any suspicious activity in the vicinity of the burglaries or who has seen the Vauxhall Zafira car late last night or since then.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Bury St Edmunds CID on **101** quoting reference 37/58967/16 (Mendlesham) or 37/58965/16 (Ipswich), or Crimestoppers anonymously on **0800 555 111**.
