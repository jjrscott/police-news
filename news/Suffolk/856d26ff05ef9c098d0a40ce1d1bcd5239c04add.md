Police are appealing for witnesses to a fail to stop road traffic collision at Polstead.

It happened at about 12.30pm on Tuesday 28 November on the A1071 near to Potash Lane. A vehicle was travelling westbound when it collided with a cycle also travelling westbound that was being ridden by a woman.

The cyclist was thrown from the cycle and she landed in a hedgerow while the vehicle failed to stop. The cyclist was taken to Ipswich hospital for treatment but was discharged later in the evening.

From a wing mirror left at the scene the vehicle has been identified as a three door Ford Fiesta, manufactured in 2003 with manually operated wing mirrors. The vehicle is also likely to have damage to the front nearside or nearside wing.

Anyone who witnessed the collision, saw a vehicle matching the description given or knows of a vehicle which has sustained the damage described should call Bury St Edmunds Roads Policing on 101, quoting CAD 224 of 28 November 2017
