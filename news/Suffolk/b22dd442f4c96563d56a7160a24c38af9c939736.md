Police are appealing for witnesses to an attempted burglary in Fressingfield.

It happened in the early hours on Friday 25 January at a property on Laxfield Road.

The occupant reported being woken by hearing activity outside in the garden of the victimâ€™s property near to an outbuilding. The suspects then shone a torch towards the house making it impossible for any description of the individuals.

It is being linked to an incident that took place at about 2am where police received a report of two people in tracksuits, one wearing grey and one in dark blue with their faces covered by hoods, looking into cars in a car park area in Fressingfield.

Anyone who has knowledge of either incident should contact Suffolk Constabulary on 101, quoting crime reference 37/4825/19

Alternatively, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
