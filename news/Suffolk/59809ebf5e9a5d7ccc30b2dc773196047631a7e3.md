It happened at about 2.15pm on Friday 23 October on Church Lane.

The two items along with the digger buckets were taken from the property. The estimated value of the items stolen is in the region of £10,000. A large wooden gate that was padlocked was taken off its hinges in the process of the theft. The digger was moved away from the location on the stolen trailer pulled by an unknown vehicle.

Anyone who witnessed an suspicious behaviour, has dash cam footage that may help or has knowledge of either the current whereabouts of the digger or trailer should contact Lowestoft police, quoting crime reference 37/61726/20 (see images below)
