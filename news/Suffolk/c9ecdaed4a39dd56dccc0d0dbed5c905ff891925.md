Police are renewing appeals for witnesses after a young girl and a man were critically injured in a collision on Parkway in Bury St Edmunds yesterday.

Emergency services were contacted just after 1pm yesterday, Thursday 4 August, to reports of a collision involving a BMW car and a lorry.

The man in his 30s, from Mildenhall, who was driving the car and the little girl, believed to be five-years-old and from Newmarket, who was a passenger in the BMW, were both freed from the car and taken by air ambulance to Addenbrookes hospital.

Both sustained serious head injuries and are currently described as being in a critical but stable condition.

Parkway was closed between Kings Road and Risbygate Street while an investigation into what happened got underway. The road re-opened just after 8pm last night.

Police have spoken with, or had contact from, several witnesses and would like to thank those who have been in touch, however officers are still keen to hear from anyone who may have seen the vehicles prior to the crash or collision itself.

If you can help please call Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting CAD number 171 of yesterday, Thursday 4 August.
