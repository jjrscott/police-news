Police are appealing for information after a 13 year old girl was approached by a man in a van in Ipswich.

The incident happened around 2pm on Maidenhall Approach on Wednesday 2 August. The male was driving a white van which was described as having no rear windows with dark lettering on the side. He asked if the girl wanted a lift and then asked her for a kiss and requested she get into the van.

The teenager refused and the van left in the direction of Belstead Avenue.

Police would like to speak to the man, who was alone in the van and is described as mixed race, and was possibly Asian or eastern European. He was in his late 30s and had brown hair and was balding. Anyone who knows who he is, saw a man in the area during the time stated matching the description given or has knowledge of the incident should call Suffolk Police on 101, quoting crime number 37/52324/17.
