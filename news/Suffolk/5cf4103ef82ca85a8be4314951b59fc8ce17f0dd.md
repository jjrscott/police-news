Offices are appealing for witnesses following a sexual assault in Lowestoft.

The incident took place on Monday 7 May, at around 2.55pm, in an alleyway between Field View Drive and Barnards Meadow in the town.

An 18-year-old woman walking down the path was grabbed from behind and knocked to the ground before being sexually touched and physically assaulted by a man. The teenager fought back and during the struggle bit the attacker on his left hand. The offender then made off from the scene on a mountain bike.

The victim required medical treatment as a result of the assault and is being supported by specially trained officers.

The suspect is described as a white man, in his mid 20s to early 30s, of slim build with short dark brown hair. He was wearing wrap around style sunglasses and a bright blue t-shirt which possibly had white markings on it.

Anybody who may have seen a man fitting the description above in the area, or anybody who may have witnessed the incident are asked to call Lowestoft CID on 101 quoting reference 24777/18. Alternatively, contact the charity Crimestoppers on anonymously on 0800 555 111.
