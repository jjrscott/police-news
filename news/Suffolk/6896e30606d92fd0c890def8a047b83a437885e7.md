A man in his 20s has sustained injuries after an attack in Ipswich.

Police were called by the East of Ambulance Service, at just before 1.00am this morning, Monday 11 June to reports that a man had been stabbed at an address in Pauline Street in the town.

Officers were immediately despatched and can confirm that a man in his 20s has sustained several stab wounds and has been taken to hospital. His condition is not life-threatening but is described as ‘serious but stable’ at this time.

Four men are reported to have entered the property shortly before 1.00am and assaulted the victim by stabbing him with a knife, before leaving via a back alley and fleeing the scene in the direction of Station Street. The victim has received more than ten stab wounds to his torso and legs.

The offenders are described as black men who were wearing face coverings.

There is currently a police scene in place at the address. At this very early stage of the investigation officers believe that this was a targeted attack, but are not linking this incident with the murder of Tavis Spencer-Aitkens that took place last weekend. Police are keeping an open mind as they investigate the full circumstances of what has taken place.

Any witnesses to the incident are asked to contact South CID at Landmark House on 101 quoting reference CAD 14 of 11 June. Alternatively call the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on
on 0800 555 111.
