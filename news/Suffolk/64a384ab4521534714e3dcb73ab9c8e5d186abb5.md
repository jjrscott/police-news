Officers arrested a man in his 20s in Ipswich on Friday 3 July on suspicion of handling stolen property, criminal damage, possession with intent to supply Class A drugs, possession of Class B drugs and assault on an emergency worker. The man was brought to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre to be questioned and was subsequently released under investigation whilst enquires continue.
