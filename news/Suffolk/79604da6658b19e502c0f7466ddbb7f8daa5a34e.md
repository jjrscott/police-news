Police are appealing for information and also for possible sightings of a car which was stolen following a burglary in Gisleham. A second vehicle which was also stolen has since been recovered in a village near Norwich.

Officers were called just after 7am yesterday morning, Wednesday 16 May, by the victims who had woken up to discover that two vehicles had been stolen from their driveway.

It is believed their property was entered at around 2.50am, with the offenders managing to open a window to access keys to the back door and once inside they stole the car keys.

The stolen vehicles are: a black Range Rover Sport, registration number 918HLH; and a black BMW X5.

The BMW X5 was located at around 1pm yesterday afternoon, parked in a residential road in Taverham and has now been recovered.

There was a sighting of the Range Rover at around 8am yesterday morning in London Road South, Lowestoft, and there is a possibility that this vehicle has also been left parked up somewhere. The number plates may have been changed since the vehicle was stolen.

Anyone with information about this crime, or who believes they have seen the Range Rover, is asked to contact East CID at Lowestoft Police Station on 101 quoting reference 26654/18. Alternatively contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
