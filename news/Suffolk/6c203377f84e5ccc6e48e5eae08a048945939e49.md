A 33-year-old man has been charged with attempted robbery and burglary, following two incidents in Ipswich last week.

Police were called at 8pm on Friday 17 July, by a woman reporting that she had just been walking in Princes Street, when she was approached by a man who walked alongside her and then tried to steal her phone from out of her hand.

Officers were immediately dispatched to the area and arrested a man in Elliott Street around 15 minutes later. He was taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning, where he was later further arrested on suspicion of a burglary.

This was in connection with an incident which had occurred between 7.30pm and 8.30pm the same evening in Alderman Road, whereby a house was entered and a handbag stolen from inside.

Niall Horn, of no fixed address, was subsequently charged with attempted robbery and burglary in connection with these incidents.

He appeared before Ipswich Magistratesâ€™ Court on Monday 20 July, where he was remanded in custody pending a next hearing at Ipswich Crown Court on Monday 17 August.
