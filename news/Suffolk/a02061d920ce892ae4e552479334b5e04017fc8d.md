Police have increased plain clothed patrols in Lowestoft in a bid to crackdown on drug offences in the town centre, with officers stopping and searching persons believed to be conducting illegal activity, and seizing drugs and quantities of cash.

On Monday 17 October at approximately 2pm in Clapham Road South, a 16-year-old boy from Hertfordshire was arrested on suspicion of money laundering, possession of class A drugs with intent to supply, and possession of class B or C drugs. He was taken to Great Yarmouth Police Investigation Centre (PIC) for questioning and has been released on bail to return on Tuesday 6 December.

A second arrest was made on Monday 31 October in St Peters Street where a 16-year-old boy, from the Middlesex area, was stopped by officers and arrested on suspicion of possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply. He has been bailed to return to the Great Yarmouth PIC on 11 January 2017.

Police would urge anyone with information about those involved in drug dealing or who witness any suspicious activity to contact Suffolk Police on **101**.
