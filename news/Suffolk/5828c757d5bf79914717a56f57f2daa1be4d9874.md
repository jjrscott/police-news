A 20-year-old Lowestoft man has appeared in court this morning charged with possession of heroin with intent to supply and possession of crack cocaine with intent to supply.

Alex Baldry, of Beaconsfield Road, was arrested yesterday, Wednesday 8 March, after he was initially spotted by officers in Kensington Gardens in the town around 2.45pm. He was arrested in Kirkley Cliff Road a short time later. Packages containing a quantity of wraps – believed to be class A drugs - were recovered.

He was taken into custody, along with two other men in their 20s who have now been bailed to return to police on April 20.

Alex Baldry was charged with a number of offences including possession of crack cocaine with intent to supply, possession of heroin with intent to supply, money laundering and possession of an article with a blade or sharp point – a lock knife.

He was detained in custody to appear before Norwich magistrates this morning, Thursday 9 March, where he was remanded in custody pending his next court appearance at Ipswich Crown Court on April 6.
