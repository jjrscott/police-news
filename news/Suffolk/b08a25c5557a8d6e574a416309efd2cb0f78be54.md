Police are reminding dog owners to take appropriate steps to ensure their dogs are under control when out walking.

The advice follows an incident in Brandon when a woman reported a small dog, possibly a Lhaso Apso, behaved in an aggressive manner towards her and her child.

The incident occurred on Heath Road, at approximately 9:50am on Wednesday 27 January.

The woman was walking with her young child when the dog, which was on a long lead, growled at them and attempted to reach out to bite them. Neither were injured, however the owner, a man believed to be in his mid to late 60s, is reported to have made no attempt to control the dog.

While it isn't necessary for dogs to be on a leash at all times, dogs must be kept on a lead in designated pedestrian zones and on land where livestock is present.

Police are urging dog owners to be mindful of their surroundings, and are reminding them that a short lead is always advisable from a safety perspective, as it is easier to control a dog on a short lead, particularly as dogs can be unpredictable around people, other animals and vehicles.
