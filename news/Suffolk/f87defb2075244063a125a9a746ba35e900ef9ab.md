A man has been found deceased at a lake in Needham Market.

Police were called at 6.30am this morning, Wednesday 27 September, to reports that a body had been found by a member of the public at Needham Lake in Coddenham Road.

Emergency services attended and the body of a man believed to be aged in his 70s was recovered from the water.

The death is being treated as unexplained at this time, but detectives do not currently believe there are any suspicious circumstances and a file will now be prepared for the coroner.

A police cordon was in place at the lake but this has now been lifted.
