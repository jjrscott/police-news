One man was arrested and another received a banning notice following an operation at Highpoint Prison in Stradishall last week.

Officers from Suffolk Police, the Eastern Region Special Operations Unit (ERSOU), HMP Highpoint and the Special Constabulary, conducted a joint operation targeting visitors bringing illicit items into the prison on Friday 20 October.

A specialist drugs dog was used to assist with thorough searches of approximately 40 visitors and a wrap containing a suspected controlled substance was seized as a result of these.

A 29-year-old man from the Harlow area of Essex was arrested on suspicion of conveying prohibited items into prison. He was taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre for questioning and has been released under investigation pending further enquires.

The searches also resulted in a second person being banned from entering the prison in the future after being suspected of facilitating the passing of a prohibited item.

Inspector Danny Cooper, Local Policing Commander for Haverhill, said:

> "I am pleased with the result of this operation which is a continuation of the partnership work we are doing with ERSOU and Highpoint staff to tackle the issue of contraband goods in prison. Special Constables from west Suffolk played a key role in searching on the day and their support is really appreciated.
>
> "We will continue to conduct random visitor checks at the prison and hope that these will act as a warning to those thinking of trying to bring illegal items in that it will not be tolerated.”

Garry Newnes, Deputy Governor at HMP Highpoint, added: "The smuggling of illicit items into the establishment poses a significant risk to the safety of those in our care and our staff. We will take every reasonable step to prevent this from happening.

"Visits are provided to maintain positive family contact and aid rehabilitation and should not be used as a conduit for illegal activity. We will continue to work with our colleagues from Suffolk Police to deal robustly with anyone attempting to traffic into the establishment.”
