Police are appealing for witnesses to a robbery that took place in Sudbury. It happened yesterday evening (Friday 2 February) shortly before 6.20pm.

The victim, a male in his 30s, was pushing his black and red ‘Demon X Stomp’ pit bike along an alleyway which runs from York Road to Acton Lane. As he approached the end of the alleyway, his path was blocked by a male on a mountain bike.

The suspect demanded he gave him all his money, which the victim refused. The suspect then grabbed him, and pulled his helmet off and made threats. The suspect managed to remove the male’s helmet and punched him in the face several times causing a suspected broken nose.

The suspect then held the victim down whilst calling someone on a mobile phone, giving their location. The victim also sustained cuts and grazes to his hands and left elbow. A short time later another suspect appeared with what is described as a brown 'Staffie' breed dog.

This male took the victim’s pit bike, walking it away. The first suspect then got back onto his mountain bike with the dog and also left the scene. It is thought there may have been passers-by who saw the incident.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or saw any suspicious behaviour in the area should contact Suffolk police on 101 quoting crime reference 37/6486/18 or call Crimestopers anonymously on 0800 555111.
