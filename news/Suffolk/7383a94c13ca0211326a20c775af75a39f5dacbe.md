Police investigating a series of thefts of power tools from vans and properties across Suffolk have successfully recovered more than 120 items, which are believed to have been stolen and are worth many thousands of pounds.

Officers executed a warrant at an address in Colchester on Wednesday 18 April and arrested a 42-year-old man and a 37-year-old woman on suspicion of handling stolen goods. Both have now been released under investigation whilst police enquires continue.

Detectives are actively working to identify the owners of the recovered property. Members of the public who have had tools stolen and recognise any of the items individually pictured as belonging to them are asked to contact police by sending an email to [email protected] Before property can be returned corroborative evidence such as crime reports, photographs, or other documentation etc would be required.
