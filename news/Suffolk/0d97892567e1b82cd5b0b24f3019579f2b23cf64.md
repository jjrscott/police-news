Two men have been jailed for a combined total of more than 20 years after being found guilty of wounding charges against a father and son in Gislingham last year.

Aidan Talbot and Phillip Jolly appeared at Ipswich Crown Court today, Thursday 23 November, for sentencing after a jury found them guilty at a previous hearing of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.

Police were called around 12:30am on Saturday 11 March 2016 to reports that the victim, a man in his 30s, had been attacked by two masked men in his home in the village with what was thought to be a bat and a metal object, and that his father - a man in his 60s – had also been injured.

Both father and son sustained injuries that required hospital treatment.

Last month Phillip Jolly, aged 24 and of Broadfields Close in Gislingham, was found guilty of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. He was today jailed for nine and a half years.

Aidan Talbot, aged 25 and of Cranley Road in Eye, was found guilty of one offence of unlawful wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and one offence of unlawful wounding. He was also sentenced today and received a jail term of 11 years and three years’ imprisonment for these offences, both to run concurrently.

The Crown Court had previously found both men, along with a third man, not guilty of conspiracy to inflict grievous bodily harm and committing aggravated burglary.
