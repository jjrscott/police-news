Police are appealing for information following a burglary at a home in Newmarket.

Officers were called just after 9pm on Thursday 13 April to reports that two burglars had been disturbed at an address off Granary Road, close to the footpath leading to Park Lane.

The victim returned home, disturbing the men who fled the property, across the railway line and onto Cricket Field Road in the direction of New Cheveley Road. The victim gave chase a short distance and called police.

A search of the area was carried-out, assisted by the police dog unit, but the suspects were not located.

The first suspect is described as white, of slim to average built, and taller than 5ft 5ins. He was wearing a dark blue hoody, with the hood up.

The second suspect is described as white, of similar build and height and was wearing a bright, scarlet-coloured hoody with the hood up. He was also wearing glasses.

As the suspects were disturbed, nothing is thought to have been stolen.

Police are appealing for witnesses or anyone who may have noticed suspicious behaviour in the area around this time to contact west Suffolk CID on **101** quoting reference, 28732/17.
