Police are appealing for witnesses following a fire at a residential building in Sudbury which is being treated as arson.

Officers were called by the fire service at 8am yesterday morning, Tuesday 9 March, to reports of a fire in the stairwell of a block of flats in East Street.

Six residents from the building had to be evacuated and were taken to hospital to be checked over for the effects of smoke inhalation. The fire was extinguished at around 8.30am.

It is believed the fire was started deliberately in the stairwell at some point overnight.

Anyone with information is asked to contact West CID at Bury St Edmunds Police Station, quoting reference: 11621/21.
