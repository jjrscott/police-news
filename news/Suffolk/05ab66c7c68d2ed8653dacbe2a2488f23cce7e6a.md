Police are appealing for witnesses after a robbery at a convenience shop in Brantham.

The incident occurred at around 5.45pm yesterday afternoon, Thursday 22 November, at the Co-op in Acacia Court.

Two men entered the store who were both wearing hooded tops with the hoods up and the draw strings pulled tight, partly obscuring their faces.

One of the men stayed by the door and the other approached the till. This man placed a meat cleaver down on the counter and demanded that the member of staff open the till.

He then went behind the counter and removed money from two tills and stole two bottles of spirits. The two suspects then left the premises.

The male member of staff was not harmed during this incident.

The suspect who approached the till is described as white, aged in his late 30s to early 40s, 5ft 10in tall, of stocky build and with grey stubble. He was wearing a light-grey coloured hooded top, blue jogging bottoms and wearing black gloves.

The second suspect is described as white, aged in his 20s, 6ft tall and of slim build. He was wearing a dark-coloured hooded top and a balaclava which covered his mouth area.

Any witnesses, or anyone with information about this incident, is asked to contact South CID at Landmark House on 101 quoting reference 67639/18. Alternatively contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
