Police are appealing for witnesses following a burglary in Stowmarket.

On Wednesday 1 February just before 4.35pm, offenders forced entry into a property on Danescourt Avenue by breaking a window. They made an untidy search of the property and left empty handed.

Police are interested in speaking to a man who was seen in the area around the time of the offence.

He is described as white, 5’11” tall, late 30s to early 40s, of slim build and with an uneven complexion. He was wearing all black, wearing a motorcycle jacket, carrying a motorcycle helmet, and spoke with a local accent. He left the area in the direction of Finborough Road and may have been walking with a second man, who was wearing a blue top.

Police would like to hear from anyone who saw or recognises the two men in the description, or who may have seen any suspicious activity in the area. Anyone with any information should contact Suffolk Police on 101 quoting crime reference number 37/15366/17.
