Police are appealing for witnesses to an assault that took place in Bury St Edmunds.

It happened on Friday 23 November on Risbygate Street in the town near to the Wilkinsons store.

The victims, a male aged in his late 50s and a female, aged in her late 50s, were walking home from town when a male approached the couple. An argument developed with the lone male, pushing the male in his 50s and then when the female intervened he has also pushed her.

No-one was hurt in the incident.

A 40 year old male was arrested in connection with the incident and was questioned at Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre. He was subsequently released on police bail pending further enquiries until 18 December.

Officers are keen for two witnesses to come forward who may have witnessed the comments or actions of the incident.

Anyone who witnessed the incident should contact Bury St Edmunds police on 101, quoting crime reference 37/68483/18. Alternatively, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
