A 17-year-old boy has been charged with a number of street robberies in Ipswich.

The first incident took place on 25 September on St Stephenâ€™s Church Lane in the town. Two juvenile males were assaulted and a mobile speaker and a cigarette lighter were stolen from them.

A further robbery took place in the same location on 25 October in which a 16-year-old boy was threatened before being punched in the face and having his belt stolen.

Police arrested a 17-year-old boy in connection with the incidents and subsequently charged him with three counts of robbery in addition to two counts of witness intimidation.
The teenager appeared before Ipswich Youth Court today, Thursday 8 November and has been bailed to appear before the same court on Thursday 15 November.
