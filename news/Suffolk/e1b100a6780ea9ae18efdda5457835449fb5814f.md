## Previous release I 16 May 2019

Police are investigating a robbery which happened at Hitcham earlier this afternoon (Thursday 16 May 2019).

Officers were called to the post office at The Causeway at approximately 2.50pm after a man approached the counter making demands for money.

He claimed he had a gun although no firearm was seen.

The suspect is described as about five foot, 11 inches tall, was dressed all in black, as being of stocky build and was wearing a black hooded top and black shoes.

The offender left the premises with tobacco but no cash and fled the scene in a car with another person. No-one was hurt in the incident. A silver BMW believed to have been involved in the incident was later found abandoned in the Beaumont Way area of Stowmarket and has been recovered for forensic examination by police.
