Police are appealing for witnesses and information after two vehicles were stolen following a burglary in Hadleigh.

The incident occurred at some point between 7:30pm on Sunday 23 and 7:30am Monday 24 July at a property in Matilda Groome Road.

Offenders forced entry to the home and removed keys from the property before stealing two cars from outside the home.

The stolen cars are an orange BMW 1 Series Sport, registration EN65 EEU, and a white Fiat 500, registration AV66 PHK.

Anyone who believes they may have seen either vehicle, or anyone with information about this crime, is urged to contact Ipswich CID at Suffolk Police on 101 quoting reference 50524/17.

Police are urging residents to keep car keys hidden and out of sight to minimise the risk of being a victim of car key burglary.
