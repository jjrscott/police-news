Two people from Ipswich have been convicted of theft and jailed for over three months for shoplifting.

33 year old Rachael Snell of Shackleton Square in Ipswich and 34 year old John Monks of Turrett Lane in Ipswich appeared before Ipswich magistrates court on 29 January 2019. Both were jailed for 14 weeks after pleading guilty.

Both were arrested on Monday 28 January on suspicion of theft and taken to Marltesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning. Snell was subsequently charged with seven counts of theft from shops that took place in December last year and January. Snell was also further charged with possession of class A drugs. Monks was charged with seven counts of thefts from shops that took place in December and January.

Sgt Vicky McParland from Ipswich Central SNT said: "Theses two offenders have been prolific in their offending and it took a co-ordinated effort between Ipswich Central and Ipswich East SNTs working with Co-Op Security to collate the evidence against them to ensure they could be dealt with effectively.‚Äù
