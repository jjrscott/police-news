Police are appealing for witnesses or information following a serious road traffic collision in Felixstowe.

Officers were called shortly before 1.50pm on Saturday 1 August, following reports that a motorcycle – a silver Honda NT650 – had left the road on the A14 at the Port of Felixstowe Road.

Emergency services were called to the scene and the rider – a man aged in his 60s – was taken by ambulance to Ipswich Hospital after he sustained broken ribs and grazes. He currently remains in hospital.

The eastbound carriageway between junctions 61 and 62 were closed while an investigation into the circumstances of the collision was carried out.

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone who was driving in that area who may have seen the manner of driving, either immediately before or after the collision, and who has a dash-cam fitted in their vehicle to contact the Roads and Armed Policing Team, quoting CAD 196 of 1 August 2020
