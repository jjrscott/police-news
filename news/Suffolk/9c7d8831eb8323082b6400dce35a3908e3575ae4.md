A 32 year old Ipswich man has been jailed for burglary.

Kearon Braybrook of Station Street in Ipswich was jailed after appearing at Ipswich Crown Court yesterday (Thur 4 January) in relation to three burglaries that took place in Ipswich in October last year.

At court he received a five years and three months sentence after he pleaded guilty to the charges.

The first incident took place on 21 October at a property on Grantham Crescent when a tidy search of the rooms took place during which watches and jewellery were stolen. Braybrook entered the property by a rear wooden framed window which was forced with a blunt object.

The second incident took place a couple of days later on 23 October at a property on Pimpernel Road. In this incident the occupants returned to find the back door glass had been smashed. The shed has also been broken into but nothing was stolen.

The final incident took place on Belstead Road on 25 October. While the occupiers were away he gained entry to a detached house by forcing a rear door and removing the glass with jemmy. Once inside he stole an ipad, ipod and racing bike.

PC Daniel Steel of Ipswich CID said: "To see Braybrook behind bars is of great satisfaction. Burglary is a very intrusive crime which can cause the victims a great deal of distress and upset. This outcome will reassure residents and demonstrate to them that we are determined to continue to bring those who are responsible for this type of crime to justice.‚Äù
