Police are warning members of the public to be vigilant after a woman in Suffolk was targeted by telephone scammers.

On Friday 8 September, a woman from Ipswich, received a telephone call from a man, saying he was a police officer and that he was investigating a fraud and required assistance. The offender then instructed the woman to withdraw £4,600 from her bank account which was then collected by a man later that day.

The victim was then told by the offender to purchase a watch worth £25,500 as he said he was investigating an insurance scam. Fortunately, the transaction was declined in the shop. The woman attended her bank to get the transaction authorised and it was at this point that police were alerted.

Residents should remember the following:

 * Your bank or the police will never ask you to withdraw money or purchase items
 * Your bank or the police will never ask for your PIN, bank card or bank account details over the phone – never give these details out
 * If you receive such a call leave the landline for at least five minutes to make an outside call. Fraudsters will keep the line open and have been known to play ring tones, hold music and a recorded message down the phone so the victim believes they are making a call to a legitimate number
 * Use a friend or neighbour’s telephone instead
 * Friends, family, carers and neighbours are asked to spread the word to ensure everyone is aware of this scam and what they should do
