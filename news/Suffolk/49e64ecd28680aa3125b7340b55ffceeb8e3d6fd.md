Police are issuing CCTV images of a male they would like to speak to in connection with a robbery in Ipswich.

The incident occurred between 1.50pm and 2pm on Thursday 29 October at a bus shelter in Bramford Road.

The victim – a woman aged in her 40s – was sitting at the bus shelter when she was approached from behind by an unknown male. The male raised his arm before snatching the victim’s mobile phone out of her hand. He then ran away in the direction of Mountbatten Court and Maple Park.

The woman was not physically injured but was left shaken by the incident.

The male suspect is described as being aged in his late 20s to early 30s, approximately 5ft 6ins tall, of slim to average build and with black short hair. He also had a tanned complexion.

He was wearing a navy blue adidas-style tracksuit and black Nike trainers with red markings.
