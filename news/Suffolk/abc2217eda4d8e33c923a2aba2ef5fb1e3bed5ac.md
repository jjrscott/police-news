Police are appealing for witnesses after a man was robbed at knifepoint in Beccles.

The incident occurred at around 8.10pm yesterday, Sunday 10 September, at a house in Sir John Leman Road.

Two men with knives entered the property and demanded money from one of the occupants – a man aged in his 20s – before stealing two mobile phones.

A second person present at the address – a woman in her 20s – was not threatened by the suspects and the two victims were left shaken, but otherwise unharmed as a result of this incident.

The suspects are described as follows:

 * Suspect one; white, around 5ft 8in tall, and of medium build. He was wearing grey bottoms, a dark-coloured hooded top and a white mask with painted on eyebrows and moustache. He is believed to be aged between 18 and 24 and spoke with an accent which sounded local.

 * Suspect two; white, around 5ft 8in tall, and of slim build. He was wearing black tracksuit bottoms and a black hooded top pulled up over his nose. He is also believed to be aged between 18 and 24.

Anyone who witnessed any suspicious persons in the area, or who has any information about this incident, is asked to call East CID at Lowestoft Police station on 101 quoting reference 59963/17, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
