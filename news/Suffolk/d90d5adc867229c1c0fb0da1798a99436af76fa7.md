Suffolk and Norfolk Police Joint Dog Section is looking to recruit a new four-legged friend for training as a specialist police dog this summer.

The ideal candidate is a young Springer Spaniel, Cocker Spaniel or Labrador, aged between 10-18 months old, energetic but controllable, with a high play drive.

Dogs are initially assessed in their current environment and then are invited to take part in a training course to assess their suitability. If they are successful then they are signed up to a handler and begin their police career.

A spokesperson said : "Our joint unit comprises 25 dog handlers and we are looking for a fun-loving energetic young dog to join the team. Our specialist search dogs detect explosives, drugs, cash and firearms. The Constabularies use a variety of breeds for this role, however, the majority are Spaniels and Labradors.‚Äù

Many of the specialist search police dogs are either offered to the unit by members of the public or come from rescue centres.

The dogs live with their handler and traditionally serve for about seven years after which they are retired. Normally the bond between handler and his dog is so strong that the handler will keep the dog as a pet, however on other occasions the dog is re-homed to suitable candidates who can fulfil the strict criteria.

If you know of a dog that might be suitable for training then please contact Suffolk or Norfolk Police on **101** and ask to speak to the dog unit.
