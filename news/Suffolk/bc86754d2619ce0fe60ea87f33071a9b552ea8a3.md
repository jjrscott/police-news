Both the Bascule Bridge in Lowestoft and Mutford Lock Bridge in Oulton Broad have been re-opened for pedestrian and vehicular traffic after the high tide passed the area earlier this evening.

The bridges were closed at 8pm as a precautionary measure after advice from the Environment Agency and other local partners.

Some flooding was reported around Oulton Broad, particularly in the Caldecott Road area, however the tidal surge in the coastal town was under the predicted level.

Residents evacuated in Lowestoft are being advised they can now return to their homes if they wish and it is safe to do so after the high tide passed without major issues.

There remains the risk of flooding in areas south of Lowestoft, and residents in those areas are being asked to await further guidance before returning.

## Previous release | 13 January - 19:17

A decision has been made to close the Bascule Bridge in Lowestoft and Mutford Lock Bridge in Oulton Broad from 8pm this evening, Friday 13 January, due to safety concerns as the high tide approaches.

Police have taken advice from the Environment Agency and other local partners, as well as liaising with other emergency services, and it has been decided that the bridges will be closed to all pedestrian and vehicular traffic from 8pm while the danger passes.

The decision has not been taken lightly but is being put in place for public safety as a precautionary measure.
