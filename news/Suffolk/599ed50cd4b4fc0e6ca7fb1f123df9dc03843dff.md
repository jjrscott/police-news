Five men have been arrested on suspicion of vehicle offences in Lowestoft.

Police were called at approximately 2:30am last Thursday, 12 December, following reports that a group of males were attempting to gain access to vehicles parked in the vicinity of Bentley Drive.

Officers attended and conducted a search of the area. The suspects were arrested shortly after 3am on suspicion of interfering with a motor vehicle and theft from a motor vehicle. The men, who are aged between 21 and 27 and are all from Lowestoft, were taken to Great Yarmouth Police Investigation Centre for questioning.

They have all since been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

A quantity of property, that is suspected to have been stolen, has been recovered and police are appealing for anyone who may be missing items from their vehicles or who has noticed damage that may be related to an attempted break-in to come forward.

Anyone with information that may assist with enquiries is urged to contact the Neighbourhood Response Team in Lowestoft at Suffolk Police on 101 quoting reference 79319/17.
