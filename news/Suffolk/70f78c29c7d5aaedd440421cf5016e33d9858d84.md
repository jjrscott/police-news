A man has been arrested and bailed in connection with an incident in Aldeburgh.

Police were called by the East of England Ambulance Service at 8.45am on Wednesday 22 July to a property in St Pauls Close, Aldeburgh, to reports that a 47-year-old woman had collapsed.

The woman was taken by air ambulance to Ipswich Hospital where she remains in a critical condition.

The woman’s family is aware and police are in contact with them.

Officers arrested a 55-year-old man on suspicion of actual bodily harm. The man was subsequently taken to Martlesham Police Headquarters for questioning, where he was further arrested on suspicion of coercive and controlling behaviour. He has since been released on conditional bail to return on 10 August 2020.

Police are exploring links to a call officers received on the evening of 21 July relating to the woman’s welfare at an address in Leiston when she was taken to hospital but later discharged herself.

Investigations are continuing. Anybody with information regarding this incident is asked to contact Suffolk Police quoting 37/41525/20, via:
