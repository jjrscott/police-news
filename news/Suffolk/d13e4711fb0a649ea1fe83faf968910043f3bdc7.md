Police are appealing for witnesses to an incident of indecent exposure in Stowupland.

It took place at about 1150am on Wednesday 4 November on a field near to Thorney Green Road. A 12 year old girl on a run saw a male conducting an indecent act. When he saw the child he asked her to take off her top causing her alarm and distress. She ran home – the male did not follow her – to report the incident to her mother. The suspect was described as in his late 40s, of a large build, with a grey beard that was described as ‘scruffy’ and he was wearing a blue shirt with stains on.

Anyone who knows who was responsible or saw any suspicious activity in the area at the time should contact Stowmarket police, quoting crime number 37/64055/20.
