Police investigating robberies at two convenience stores in Ipswich over the weekend have charged a 29-year-old man in connection with the offences.

The first incident occurred at 5.35pm on Saturday 29 October at a business in Austin Street, where a man entered the store and went round to the side of the till area, which he was told to leave by the victim.

The victim then tried to block the offender from getting to the till, but he pushed her out of the way and forced the till open, stealing a quantity of cash before running off.

The second robbery took place at around 10.30pm yesterday, Sunday 30 October, at a store in Bridge Street.

A man entered the store and asked to buy some cigarettes and as the victim was about to close the till, the offender pulled out a small knife and stole three handfuls of cash from the till before running away.

Iain McCall, of Barnard Square, Ipswich, has been charged with two counts of robbery relating to these crimes. He was remanded in police custody overnight and is due to appear before Ipswich Magistrates’ Court this morning, Wednesday 2 November.

A 25-year-old woman from Ipswich, who was also arrested on suspicion of robbery in connection with these incidents, has been released on bail until Monday 5 December pending further enquiries.

The victim then tried to block the offender from getting to the till, but he pushed her out of the way and forced the till open, stealing a quantity of cash before running off.

The offender was pursued by another witness along Whip Street towards Barnard Square, where he is believed to have been picked-up by someone driving a black Ford Fiesta.

The second robbery took place at around 10.30pm yesterday, Sunday 30 October, at a store in Bridge Street.

A man entered the store and asked to buy some cigarettes and as the victim was about to close the till, the offender pulled out a small knife and stole three handfuls of cash from the till before running away.
