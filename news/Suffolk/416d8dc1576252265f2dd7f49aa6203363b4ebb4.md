Police are issuing an image of two people they would like to speak to in connection with an incident of criminal damage in Wherstead.

The incident took place at 6pm on Monday 4 June at the Suffolk Food Hall in Peppers Lane.

Staff asked four boys on bikes to leave after an incident of anti-social behaviour. They refused and then caused around Â£800 of damage to signs and wooden chairs.

Police have issued a picture of two of the boys they would like to speak to, one of whom was wearing a face scarf with a skull pattern. Witnesses or anyone with information should contact Suffolk Police on 101, quoting reference 37/30535/18, or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form at crimestoppers-uk.org
