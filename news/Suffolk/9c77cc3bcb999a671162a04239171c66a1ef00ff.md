Police are appealing for witnesses to a robbery that took place in Beccles.

It took place at about 10.30pm on Thursday 11 January on Banham Road.

The male victim, aged 17, was walking home when a black Peugeot 206 pulled in front of him with three people inside. One person stayed in the car and two males got out with one carrying a wooden baseball bat. They are described as wearing tracksuits and black balaclavas. They were described as being over six feet tall and of stocky build. They struck the victim in the lower left leg with the bat and then hit him over the side of the head causing a small cut and swelling. They took a bag containing a fluorescent jacket, his mobile phone and a 50gram pouch of amber leaf tobacco from his front jacket pocket.

Anyone with information or who saw any suspicious activity should contact Lowestoft CID on 101 quoting crime reference 37/2210/18 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
