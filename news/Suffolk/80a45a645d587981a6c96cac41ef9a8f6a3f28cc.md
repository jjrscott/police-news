Police have arrested three men following reports of ‘rogue trading’ at two addresses in Gleneagles Drive, Ipswich on Tuesday 19 April at around 1pm.

Police and Trading Standards Officers were called by one of the victims who reported that a group of men had called at their home offering to carry out roof and chimney repairs. Once on the roof the men purported to find damaged tiles and a defective chimney stack then demanded a large amount of cash from the victim to complete the work. The men left the address in a van once they realised that the victim had become suspicious and was reporting the incident.

Two men aged 19 and 21 both from Basildon and another man aged 29 from Purleigh were arrested for fraud by false representation and failing to provide cancellation information offences. The two men from Basildon were also arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and assault charges. The men have been released on bail until June 2016 pending further inquiries.

Trading Standards are also investigating links to other reported incidents of rogue trading in the county. Officers are warning residents to be alert and to get several quotes from reputable companies before you agree to have any work completed.

There are ongoing enquiries and Trading Standards are asking anyone who may have information to call the Citizens Advice consumer service on 03454 04 05 06.
