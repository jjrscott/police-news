Two men have been jailed for their role in supplying drugs in the Leiston area.

Bradley Tanner, 29, of Sylvester Road, Leiston, and Michael Wingrove, 23, of Pembroke Close in Ipswich, appeared at Ipswich Crown Court for sentencing on Thursday, 13 July, after being found guilty, following an earlier trial, of possession of heroin and cocaine with intent to supply.

Both men were jailed for four and a half years for the drugs offences.

Police had gone to Tannerâ€™s home address in Sylvester Road on March 9 last year and seized wraps containing class A drugs, scales and cash.

Wingrove was given a further three month consecutive sentence for the assault of a woman in her 20s, who he had struck in the face in an incident in Portman Road in Ipswich on January 12 this year - a total sentence of four years and nine months.
