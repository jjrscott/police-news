Police are appealing for public support to trace a motorist who approached a 14-year-old girl as she walked in Shotley Gate.

Around 6pm on Wednesday 26 April, the teenager was walking along Kitchener Way, close to the Hervey Terrace junction, when a man in a black 4x4 vehicle pulled up alongside her and asked for directions, which she gave. He then asked her to go with him twice, which she declined, before driving off in the direction of the B1456.

Police need to trace the man involved who is described as Asian, possibly Indian, appearance, and who spoke with an English accent. He is believed to have black hair, which is short at the back and sides but longer on top, and was wearing a grey suit with a blue shirt.

If this was you or if you have any information about who the man is, or if you were in the area around this time and saw the incident, please call Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting crime number 31394/17.
