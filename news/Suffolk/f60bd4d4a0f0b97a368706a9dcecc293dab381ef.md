Police are appealing for the owner of a black Labrador to come forward after a man was bitten in an incident near Felixstowe last week.

The man was walking another dog along a footpath between Hemley and Newbourne at approximately 11:45am on Saturday, 21 October, when the Labrador ran up to him and bit him on the leg.

The dog was not on a lead and the victim reported that he had to kick it in order for the animal to release him. The owner is said to have then grabbed the dog, but refused to give his details.

The owner is described as a man in his 60s, approximately 5ft 9ins and of average build. He was also walking a smaller, golden dog which was also of Labrador appearance.

Anyone with information about this incident, or who believes they may know the owner of the dog, is asked to contact Suffolk Police on 101 quoting CAD 270 of 21 October.
