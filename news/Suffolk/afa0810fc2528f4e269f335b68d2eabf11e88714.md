Police in Ipswich have arrested two people following an attempted robbery in the town.

At around 9pm yesterday evening, Thursday 27 July, officers out on patrol in Austin Street witnessed an attempted robbery.

The victim, a 33-year-old man, was approached from behind by two people who tried to snatch his mobile phone from his hand. The victim managed to keep hold of the phone, but was then pushed to the ground and assaulted.

A number of additional police units were called for assistance and one suspect was arrested within a matter of minutes and a second detained around 20 minutes later following a search of the area.

The two suspects, a 20-year-old man and a 16-year-old boy who are both from Ipswich, were arrested on suspicion of robbery and taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre where they currently remain for questioning.
