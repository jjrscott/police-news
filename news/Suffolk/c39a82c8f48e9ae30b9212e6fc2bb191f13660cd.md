Police are appealing for witnesses following a serious road traffic collision in Lowestoft.

Officers were called at just after 7.15pm on Monday 28 September, to reports of a collision involving a pedestrian and a white Piaggio NRG 50cc scooter, in Montgomery Avenue.

The pedestrian – a man aged in his 40s – was initially taken to the James Paget Hospital for treatment to a head injury, but was later transferred to Addenbrooke’s Hospital.

Any witnesses – including anyone driving in the area at the time with a dash cam fitted in their vehicle - is asked to contact the Roads and Armed Policing Team on 101, quoting reference 56753/20.
