Police are appealing for information after an attempted robbery in Lowestoft.

A man in his 20s was walking along Love Road, near to the junctions of Seago Street and Wollaston Road, shortly before 6pm on Sunday 19 November when he was approached from behind by a man who told him to empty his pockets. As the victim refused, he turned around and was punched in the face causing him to fall to the ground. The suspect then ran off empty handed.

The victim sustained bruising and swelling to his face.

The suspect is described as white, approximately 6ft tall and is of slim build. He was wearing dark colours - possibly black - and had his hood up.

Detectives investigating the attempted robbery are appealing for witnesses who may have seen a man matching this description, who has knowledge of who he is or who have any information that may assist with enquiries.
