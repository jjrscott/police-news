A 25-year-old man has been charged with robbery following an incident in Lowestoft at the weekend.

Police were called to an address in London Road South by the ambulance service around 10.50pm on Saturday, 15 April, to reports a man had been assaulted and had sustained head and facial injuries.

The man, in his 40s, was taken to the James Paget hospital where he was found to have a blown ear drum, a broken nose, trauma to his left eye and bruising and swelling to his face and neck.

It is believed he was assaulted and robbed in the Cleveland Road area of Lowestoft a short time earlier.

Sean Dickson, of Worcester Way in Gorleston, was arrested yesterday, Thursday 20 April, and was taken into custody where he was interviewed in connection with the incident. He has now been charged with robbery - stealing an envelope containing bank cards and other cards â€“ and was detained in custody to appear before Norwich Magistrates this morning, Friday 21 April.

He has now been remanded in custody pending his next appearance at Ipswich Crown Court on May 19.
