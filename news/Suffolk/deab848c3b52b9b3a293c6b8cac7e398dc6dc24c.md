Police are appealing for witnesses following a firearms incident in Lowestoft at the weekend.

Officers received a call from the James Paget Hospital just after 1.40am on Saturday 20 January informing them that a man had attended the hospital having sustained what appeared to be shotgun wounds.

The man – aged in his late teens – was treated for shotgun pellet wounds and has since been discharged.

Following initial police enquiries into the incident, it is believed these injuries were as a result of a firearm being discharged in Normanston Drive – between the Peto Way roundabout and the fire station - at around 12.45am the same morning, when three people were seen to chase two other people down the street.

Detectives currently believe that this was a targeted attack and are appealing for any witnesses to make contact.

They are also appealing to anyone who travelled along Normanston Drive between 11pm on Friday 19 January and 1am on Saturday 20 January and may have dash cam footage that could assist the investigation to contact them.

Anyone with information is asked to contact East CID at Lowestoft Police Station on 101 quoting reference 3715/18, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
