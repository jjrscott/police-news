Police are appealing for help to trace a male officers want to speak to in connection with an attempted robbery in Ipswich.

It took place on Sunday 6 September at about 1.45pm on Colchester Road. A 13 year old boy was cycling on his bike when he saw a man outside the Royal George public house who was also on a pedal bike.

The male suspect then attempted to block the 13 year old from riding on. There was no physical contact, but the suspect asked the boy if he had any money or a phone. The boy replied ‘no’ and the suspect then produced a small kitchen-style knife from a top pocket and was told by the boy he would ‘let him go’. The boy then rode off to report the incident to police.

Anyone who knows who was responsible should contact Ipswich police, quoting crime number 37/51889/20.
