Police are appealing for witnesses after a man exposed himself and committed a lewd act in Beccles.

The incident occurred at around 9.15pm on Wednesday 25 October in an alleyway called Rigbourne Hill Lane that runs between Rigbourne Hill and Banham Road.

The victims, three girls aged between 12 and 15, had entered the alley at the entrance in Rigbourne Hill, opposite to the Co-Op at the junction with High Leas.

When walking along the alley they became aware of a man following behind them, they began to run but one of the girls tripped over and at this point she then saw that he was exposing himself and committing a lewd act.

The victim then shone the torch on her mobile phone in his face and he turned away and ran back down the alley towards Swines Green.

The suspect is described as white, aged between 25 and 30 years old, approximately 5ft 5in tall, of thin build and with short curly light brown hair. He was wearing knee-length navy shorts with a white stripe down the side.

Any potential witnesses who were in the area of the incident between 9pm and 9.20pm, or who has any information about this incident, is asked to contact East CID at Lowestoft Police Station on 101 quoting reference 69612/17, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
