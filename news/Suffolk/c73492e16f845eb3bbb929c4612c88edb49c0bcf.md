Suffolk Constabulary's cadets in conjunction with West Suffolk College have raised nearly £700 for a local charity in west Suffolk.

Cadets from the Stowmarket, Bury St Edmunds, Sudbury, Haverhill and Mildenhall areas, aged 13 to 18 years old, teamed up with the West Suffolk College Public Services students to raise money for MyWiSH during the coronavirus lock-down.

MyWiSH is the official charity supporting West Suffolk Hospital and Newmarket Community Hospital. They seek to support the NHS to further enhance the care and support of patients, their families and the staff that care for them.

Around 40 students and cadets ran, walked and cycled over 1300km over a three-week period from 22 May to 12 June to raise a total of £698 and rising for My WiSH charity, as part of their daily exercise.

Suffolk police's volunteer police and emergency service cadets are an important part of the extended police family. Their role is to help progress current policing initiatives in the local community. They assist with events including the Suffolk Show, town fairs, carnivals and charity events.

They also support the important work of safer neighbourhood teams and are taught basic knowledge in a variety of policing activity.

Temporary Chief Inspector Andy Martin, based at Bury St Edmunds, said: "This has been a fantastic effort from the police and emergency service cadets. It's a great demonstration of what can be achieved by young people from our local community in these uncertain times by raising money for the NHS.

"Such a fund-raising initiative further cements the great partnership that exists between West Suffolk College students on the Public Services course and the Constabulary We look forward to continuing this productive and fruitful relationship in the months ahead.

West Suffolk College Subject Lead for Public Services Clare Fasey said: "Staff and students from Public Services at West Suffolk College have over the last three weeks, walked, run, cycled and even canoed nearly 700 Km.

"This is an amazing effort for all those who have been involved, it demonstrates the optimism and resilience these young people have.

"It has been a fantastic opportunity to work with Suffolk police cadets and we look build this relationship in the coming weeks and months. Thank you to everybody who has supported us by donating to My WiSH Charity JustGiving page.
