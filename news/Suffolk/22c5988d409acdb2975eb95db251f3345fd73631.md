Police are appealing for witnesses following a burglary at a home address in Newmarket.

The break-in occurred between 8:10pm and 8:15pm on Tuesday 30 January at a property in Edinburgh Road.

At some point between the times stated, two offenders attempted to enter through patio doors before climbing on a garage roof and forcing a window.

Once inside, the offenders woke an occupant and asked them where their property was. They searched a box, but left empty handed through the same window. The occupant was left unharmed.

The offenders are described as white males, aged in their twenties, five foot 10 inches and five six inches each in height. They were wearing black clothing and black peaked caps, possibly baseball caps, and had scarves covering their faces.

Officers would be keen to speak to anyone who may have seen anything or captured dash cam footage in the Edinburgh Road, Hamilton Road, Princess Way or Manderston Road areas on 30 January between the hours of 7:45pm and 8.30pm.

Alternatively, anyone who witnessed the incident or has any knowledge of it is asked to contact West CID on 101 quoting reference 5790/18 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
