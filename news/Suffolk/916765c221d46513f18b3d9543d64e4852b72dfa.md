Police have arrested a man in connection with a robbery that took place in Felixstowe last week.

The incident occurred at around 11am on Wednesday 16 November, in Vicarage Road.

The victim was walking with her husband when they were approached from behind by a man who grabbed her handbag off her shoulder, pulling her to the ground in the process. She initially hung on to her bag and was dragged a short distance along the grass verge before letting go.

The suspect then ran off into Oak Close pursued by the victim’s husband - who is aged in his eighties – before heading into an alleyway leading into Wadgate Road.

Detectives investigating the incident yesterday, 21 November, arrested a 25 year old man from Felixstowe. The man has now been bailed to return to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre on 8 February 2017.

Witnesses or anybody else who has any information are asked to call Ipswich South East CID on **101** quoting reference 66599/16.
