Police are issuing photographs of items of stolen property in an effort to return them to the rightful owners.

Following a recent search of an address in the Mildenhall area, officers recovered a number of items of property which are believed to have been stolen. These include watches, jewellery and a plastic pot of collectable coins.

In addition to potentially being taken during burglaries in Suffolk, the items could also have been stolen from properties in neighbouring counties.

Anyone who believes they own any of the items in the photographs is asked to contact West CID at Bury St Edmunds Police Station on 101, quoting reference 57189/18.
