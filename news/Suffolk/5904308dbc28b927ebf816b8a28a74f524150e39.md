Police are issuing CCTV images of two men they would like to trace following a distraction theft outside a supermarket in Ipswich.

The incident took place between 12pm-12.25pm on Monday 8 March at Sainsbury’s in Felixstowe Road.

The victim, an elderly woman, was putting her shopping in her car when a man approached her and started talking to her. As this was happening another man has taken the victim’s card holder, containing banks cards, out of her bag, before both men then ran off.

A short time later the victim’s card was used at a nearby cash machine at Tesco in Foxhall Road, Ipswich, where the offenders withdrew a total of £300. Officers are releasing CCTV images of two men they would like to speak to in connection with the incident.

The first is described as white with a tanned complexion, aged in his 30s to 40s, well built with brown hair and brown eyes. He was wearing a white face-mask with a breather/vent on it. He was also wearing a blue puffer-style jacket and navy-blue jeans.

The other man is believed to be in his late 30s to early 40s and is described as white with a tanned complexion, with short, dark hair. He was wearing blue jeans and a dark-coloured jacket. He was also wearing a dark face-mask.

Anyone who recognises the men pictured in the images, or who has dash cam footage while in the carpark or who has any information about this incident, is asked to contact the Crime Coordination Centre quoting reference: 37/11403/21, via:
