A 46 year old man has been sentenced to 16 weeks in jail following a string of shoplifting offences in Newmarket.

Stewart McLeish of Rous Road in Newmarket was charged yesterday (7 June) with four counts of theft that took place between late April and early June.

The incidents took place on 29 April at Waitrose where a Lavazza coffee machine valued at £69 was taken, on 26 May where a gas stove and butane gas valued at £15.99 from QD Stores was taken, on 30 May where two cheese and ham baguettes were stolen from Greggs and on 7 June a Gillette razor set valued at £25 was stolen on 7 June belonging to Superdrug.

McLeish appeared before Ipswich Magistrates Court today (8 June) and following a guilty plea he was sentenced to 16 weeks in jail.

Sgt Steve Duncan of Mildenhall and Brandon Safer neighbourhood Team said: ”McLeish is a prolific shoplifter so to see him receiving this custodial sentence is very gratifying – he was a persistent offender who choose not to change his criminal behaviour. We continue to work with town centre shops and CCTV in the area to reduce the number of shoplifting offences.”
