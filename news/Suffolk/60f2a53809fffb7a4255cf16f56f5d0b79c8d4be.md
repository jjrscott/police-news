Police in Ipswich have arrested four people in connection with the supply of Class A drugs following raids at flats in the town.

Officers executed warrants under the Misuse of Drugs Act at properties in Shenstone Drive and Old Foundry Road today, Friday 24 March.

A number of wraps of Class A drugs were seized - along with a large quantity of cash - following the warrant in Shenstone Drive and three people were arrested as follows:

A 36-year-old man from Ipswich on suspicion of possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply; a 25-year-old man from Haringey in north London; and a 26-year-old woman from Ipswich; both on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs.

At Old Foundry Road further drugs believed to be Class A were seized and a 26-year-old man, from Enfield in north London, was arrested on suspicion of possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply.

All four suspects have been taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre where they will be questioned by detectives.
