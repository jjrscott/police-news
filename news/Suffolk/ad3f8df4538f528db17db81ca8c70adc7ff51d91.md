Suffolk Police are holding a fraud awareness event in Ipswich this week to warn people against doorstep, online and telephone crime.

Between 11am and 2pm on Wednesday 6 September, a mobile police station will be set up on the Cornhill with officers from the Ipswich Central Safer Neighbourhood Team (SNT) and representatives from Trading Standards on hand to offer advice on how to keep safe and secure against fraud and scams.

Police are hoping the event will raise awareness of the potential risks of internet, doorstep and telephone scams and are inviting residents and shoppers to drop in for advice and support in helping them and their love ones avoid being targeted in the future.

Jonathan Driver, Sergeant at Ipswich Central SNT, said: "It is a sad fact that fraudsters typically target older people, particularly those who may be more vulnerable by living alone. However, it can affect all of us – regardless of your age, background or experience – and this event is part of our ongoing campaign to raise awareness of the different kinds of fraud and scams people fall victim to.

> "We work closely with Trading Standards and are committed to helping communities protect themselves from fraud and the fear of fraud. We welcome anyone to come in and talk to us if they have any concerns or questions about how to spot and avoid scams and rogue traders which operate in Suffolk.”

Fraud affects communities countywide and Suffolk Police are urging residents to remain vigilant and to look out for their neighbours who might be considered as ‘easy targets’.
