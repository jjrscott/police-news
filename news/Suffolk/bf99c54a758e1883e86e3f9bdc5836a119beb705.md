Police are appealing for help to trace a man police want to speak to in connection with an attempted robbery in Haverhill.

It took place on Monday 20 August at about 9.30pm on Primrose Hill outside the Premier store. A female victim in her early 20s was walking from the leisure centre home and was approached by male wearing gloves and balaclava when she was talking on her mobile phone. The suspect then tried to rip her back pack from her shoulder. After a brief struggle the offender then left empty handed and rode bike back towards recreation ground.

Anyone who recognises the individual in the picture should contact Bury St Edmunds CID on 101, quoting crime reference 37/47611/18. Alternatively, call the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
