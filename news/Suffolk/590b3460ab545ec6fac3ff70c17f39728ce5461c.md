Police are appealing for information, and are reminding drivers not to leave valuable items in vehicles, after a series of thefts from vans in the Sudbury and Haverhill area earlier this week.

There were at least six offences overnight Tuesday 21 into Wednesday 22 March. These included;

Numerous power tools, including an angle grinder, drills and a jigsaw, being stolen from a Ford Transit van parked in Hertford Road in Clare

A chainsaw and a torch being stolen after a Vauxhall van was broken into, and a Makita charger, batteries and a radio being taken from a Ford Connect van both at Nunnery Green in Wickhambrook.

A wallet being stolen after a Ford Transit van parked in Hillside Road in Sudbury was broken into

A pair of safety goggles being stolen from a van parked at Teasel Close in Haverhill while a pouch of tobacco was stolen from a van parked in Arrendene Road in the town, but the thief or thieves were foiled in stealing tools from the van as these were secured in a cage inside.

Police are asking anyone who may have seen anything suspicious in any of these areas overnight Tuesday-Wednesday to come forward and are asking anyone with information about those responsible to get in touch. If you can help please call Suffolk Police on **101** quoting crime number 24406/17.

Officers are also urging drivers of vehicles – particularly vans – to remove valuables when leaving them unattended.
