Police were called at approximately 3.40pm on Sunday 23 September following reports of suspected hare coursing taking place in Lidgate near Newmarket.

Officers attended and located a vehicle in The Street. The occupants of the vehicle then drove off and a second police vehicle caught up with it in Orchard Close, where the occupants drove off again before decamping.

Police officers, with assistance from a member of the public, subsequently detained one of the occupants. The other occupants are still outstanding despite attempts to locate them.

A 31-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving, criminal damage and hare coursing.

He was taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre for questioning and was later released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Suffolk police on 101, quoting reference 54797/18.
