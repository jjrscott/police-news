Police are appealing for information following a burglary in Ipswich.

At some point between Saturday 21 January at 11pm and Sunday 22 January at 1am, offenders entered a home on Murray Road through an insecure door and stole a handbag containing car keys.

A silver Renault Clio was stolen and was found a short while later, destroyed by fire on Kesteven Road.

Police would like to hear from anyone who may have seen anyone acting suspiciously in the vicinity of Murray Road or Kesteven Road late on Saturday evening or in the early hours of Sunday morning.

Anyone with any information should contact Suffolk Police on **101** quoting 37/13592/17 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on **0800 555 111**.
