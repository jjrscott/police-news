Police are appealing for witnesses following a burglary at a retail premises in Bury St Edmunds at the weekend.

The incident occurred between 10.35pm and 10.50pm on Sunday 9 September at a store in Easlea Road.

A group of at least four people entered the building after cutting a hole in the rear wall and several thousand pounds worth of stock was stolen.

It is believed that the hole may have been cut earlier in the evening and the suspects then returned later, as the power tools required to do this would have created a lot of noise.

Detectives are appealing for anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious on the Moreton Hall Industrial Estate between 4.30pm and 10.35pm on Sunday 9 September to make contact.

Calls should be made to West CID at Bury St Edmunds Police Station on 101 quoting reference 51839/18, or alternatively contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
