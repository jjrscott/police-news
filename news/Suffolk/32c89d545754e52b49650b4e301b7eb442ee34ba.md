Suffolk Constabulary has raised over two thousand pounds for a local charity following the force’s Family Day.

The annual event for all family and close friends held at Martlesham Heath police headquarters in early September last year raised £2,240 for the ‘Fresh Start – New Beginning’ charity.

The funds were raised through entrance into the event, a barbeque and cake stall run by the force HR Department, a huge raffle of prizes that were kindly donated by businesses and organisations across the region as well as a tombola stall.

Fresh Start-New Beginnings was set up in October 2012 to provide a specialist therapeutic service for children who have disclosed being sexually abused and to provide advice, support and guidance to their families. Since that date over 1,100 children have asked the charity for help.

Chief Constable Gareth Wilson said: "It’s a real pleasure to be able to award this money to ‘Fresh Start – New Beginnings’. They do some amazing and very valuable work with child victims of sexual abuse and it makes absolute sense for us to support this organisation, bearing in mind the contact that we in the police have with such victims from the outset.”

Charity Finance Manager at Fresh Start Brian Paternoster said: "Everyone at Fresh Start is really appreciative of the huge effort made by so many people in order to make the Family Day possible. We are really grateful to each and every person who supported us by contributing their time and their sheer hard work to ensure that it was such an amazing success.”
