Police have issued a CCTV image of a woman they are keen to identify following the theft of a bank card, which was subsequently used to withdraw cash at various ATMs in Ipswich.

It is thought the victimâ€™s purse was stolen from an address on Woodbridge Road in Ipswich on the morning of Friday 3 June. The victim then received a call on her mobile from a man with a heavy accent claiming to work for her bank, advising there had been unusual activity on her account and to verify her Personal Identification Number (PIN). The victim shared her details with the caller; cash was then withdrawn between 11am and 12:15pm.

The woman depicted in the CCTV images who police would like to speak to is described as white, aged between 40 and 50, and approximately 5ft 4in tall. She is of slim build, with long, straight black hair and was wearing jeans with a black and grey blanket jacket.

Anyone who recognises this woman or has any information in connection with the incident is asked to the Incident and Crime Management Hub on **101** quoting reference 37126/16. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
