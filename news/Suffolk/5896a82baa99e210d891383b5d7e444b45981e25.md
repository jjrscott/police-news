Police are appealing for witnesses after an outboard engine cover was stolen from a boat in Carlton Colville.

At some point between 4pm on Sunday 23 March and noon on Saturday 18 April, an unknown offender/s interfered with the engine and removed or stole the outboard engine cover from a BA reg number 1M workboat, which was moored along the River Waveney at Carlton Marshes.

Officers are urging marine businesses and boat users in Norfolk and Suffolk to be vigilant as a number of similar thefts have been reported to police recently.

A number of patrols are continuing to be carried out in the area but police are also keen to hear from anyone who may have noticed anything suspicious.

Anyone who would like crime prevention advice or to purchase an outboard engine cover can email PC Paul Bassham on [email protected] or follow on Twitter @Broadsbeat

Any witnesses or anyone with information should contact Suffolk police, quoting crime reference number: 37/22189/20
