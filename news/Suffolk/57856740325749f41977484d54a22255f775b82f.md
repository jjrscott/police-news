Officers are appealing for witnesses following a dangerous driving incident in Ipswich last month, and are keen to trace two pedestrians who narrowly avoided being struck in the process.

The offence occurred 12.30pm on Sunday 25 October in Ranelagh Road, near to the junction with London Road.

Officers on patrol in Handford Road had cause to request a silver Volkswagen Polo to stop, which it failed to comply with.

The car drove away at speed into London Road, turning left into Ranelagh Road where it then struck the kerb causing a tyre to burst. This occurred near to where two people pushing a buggy were walking along the path, adjacent to the car park for Glasswells Retail Park.

The VW Polo then collided with a red Volvo V70 estate, which was stationary at a red light in the right-hand lane, waiting to turn into the road towards the McDonald’s restaurant. Four people then exited the VW Polo and ran off, three in the general direction of McDonald’s and one back towards London Road.

Shortly afterwards, officers arrested three 18-year-old men from Oldham and a 17-year-old girl from Ipswich in connection with the incident.

They were taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning and all were subsequently released under investigation, pending further enquiries.

Officers are appealing for any witnesses to this incident to make contact with them - in particular the two people who were walking along the path pushing a buggy. One of these individuals was wearing a yellow coat, with the other one wearing a dark-coloured coat.

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to contact the Sentinel Team, quoting reference: 62045/20.
