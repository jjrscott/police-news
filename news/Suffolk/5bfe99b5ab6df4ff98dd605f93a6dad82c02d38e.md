Officers are appealing for witnesses or information after a teenage boy was injured during an incident in Ipswich.

Police were called to Cherry Lane Park at 7.53pm, yesterday, Wednesday 12 August, to reports of a fight in progress between two groups of people.

It is believed that an argument had taken place between two groups of children the day before, 11 August, which then continued yesterday, 12 August, in the park before adult relatives of the two groups became involved.

A 15-year-old boy sustained a minor injury and was taken to hospital by family members.

A group of people were seen to run away from Rushmere Road towards the back of the park.

Witnesses or anyone with dash-cam footage or CCTV from the area around the time is asked to contact Suffolk police, quoting reference 37/46562/20.
