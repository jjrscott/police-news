Police are appealing for witnesses following an assault against an elderly woman in Woodbridge.

The incident took place at around 8am on Monday 24 July in the Thoroughfare.

A woman in her 70s was walking down the Thoroughfare, near to the junction with Doric Place, when a man approached her and shouted at her before reportedly pushing her to the ground. She sustained grazes to her elbows and knees.

The suspect is described as white, approximately 5ft 7ins or 5ft 8 ins in height, with mousey, shoulder length hair and is believed to be in his 40s. He was wearing a khaki-coloured T-shirt and was of unkempt appearance.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or knows the identity of the man is asked to contact the Incident and Crime Management Hub at Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting reference 50636/17.
