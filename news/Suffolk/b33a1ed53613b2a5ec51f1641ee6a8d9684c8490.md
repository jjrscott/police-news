Police are appealing for witnesses after a motorcycle was stolen from a property in Carlton Colville, Lowestoft.

The incident occurred at 6.43am on Sunday 16 August at a residential property in Long Road.

A white Aprilia SR 50, scooter-style motorcycle, registration number LF16 ZWD, was stolen from the driveway of the property.

A man was seen walking away with the motorcycle.

He was wearing light-coloured tracksuit bottoms, a hooded top with the hood pulled up over his head and a mask covering the rest of his face.

A witness saw the man pushing the motorcycle along Long Road before he met with another man. The second man was described as of slim build, with dark hair and wearing a navy, red and white top.

The pair then pushed the motorcycle off the alleyway at the bottom of Long Road and into some bushes after they were spotted by the witness.
