Suffolk Police are appealing for witnesses and information following a road traffic collision on the B1113 at Baylham, near Needham Market.

On Sunday 23 April at approximately 1pm, a light blue/ silver coloured Peugeot 206 and a green Kawasaki motorcycle, both travelling from Great Blakenham towards Needham Market, were in collision on the B1113 at the junction with Mill Lane.

The motorcycle rider was transported to Addenbrookeâ€™s Hospital with a possible life changing leg injury. A passenger in the car was transported to Ipswich Hospital suffering from minor injuries.

The road was closed for a police scene investigation and reopened just after 5pm.

Police would like to hear from any witnesses to the collision or anyone who may have seen the manner of driving of either vehicle prior to the collision.

Anyone with any information should contact Suffolk Police on **101** quoting CAD reference 201 of the 23 April.
