A woman who died in a collision in Barham is being named by police.

Officers were called on Friday 23 October at around 6pm to reports of a collision on Norwich Road involving a Seat Altea and Volkswagen Polo.

The driver of the Volkswagen sadly died at the scene. Subject to confirmation at formal inquest proceedings, she has been identified as 32-year-old Jennifer Baker from Claydon.

Jennifer’s family would like to share the following tribute:

“Jennifer Elizabeth Baker, much loved and respected daughter of Maria and Andrew, was suddenly taken from us on 23 October.

She was a caring and unfailingly supportive sister to Lucy, George and her twin, Catherine. Jen and her three siblings had a very happy childhood together, growing up on the farm, and remained very close into adulthood. Jen was a beloved granddaughter and loving Auntie, who enjoyed cuddles with her niece and nephew.

Jen had settled down close to home and was devoted to her partner. They had found happiness together and had many plans for their future. Jen loved walking their two dogs, Polly and Floss, in the Suffolk countryside.

Jen was so very special to so many, immensely thoughtful, level-headed and always seeming to know the right thing to say. It is utterly impossible to describe how much she meant to us nor the scale of our loss.

Her family are all so proud of her, of the kind, intelligent, strong and beautiful woman she had become, and will miss her beyond measure.”

Jennifer’s close friend Rae Betts would like to share the following tribute;

“Friends since the age of 7 and in contact most days, Jen was by my side through everything in life, a huge support to me and so many. Jen was the most loyal, thoughtful and unique friend. She is truly irreplaceable. She gave each and every one of us so much love and so many wonderful memories and with that, she will continue to live in our hearts forever. “

On behalf of Jennifer’s work colleagues, David McGowan of Woodward Markwell said,

“It is a massive understatement to say that everyone at Woodward Markwell is devastated and heartbroken with the loss of Jennifer Baker. We are extremely fortunate to have worked with Jennifer over the last 15 years. Jennifer worked with us straight from school and rose through the ranks to be one of the management team and an integral part of business.
The pain is deep because she was such a nice person and would go far out of her way to assist anyone. Her loss has not only deeply affected staff and ex-staff but our clients and insurance partners who are also heartbroken.
We are not sure how we will cope with the loss of Jennifer, we don’t think we ever will. However, we will always remember her and her continuous smile and hold this close to our hearts forever.
We send our love to her family and friends at this time along with sending love to her partner and his family.”

The family understands that friends and colleagues may wish to send flowers but would prefer a donation be made to Great Ormond Street Hospital, who helped Jenny at the start of her life, or the Air Ambulance, who came to help on Friday.
