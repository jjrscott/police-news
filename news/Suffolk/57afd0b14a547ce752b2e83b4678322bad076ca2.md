Police are appealing for witnesses or information after a male was witnessed acting suspiciously in Lowestoft.

Between 7.10am and 7.20am on Wednesday 29 July, a 14-year-old boy was walking along Cotmer Road, when he became aware that a male on a bike was following him from a distance. The male continued to follow the boy along Plovers Way, Uplands Road North and Grove Road.

The boy, who felt distressed, then walked towards Spinney Gardens and the male didn’t continue to follow him. The male also didn’t attempt to speak to the boy.

The male suspect is described as being aged in his 30s, had short brown hair and stubble. He was wearing all black and was riding a black mountain bike.

Any witnesses or anyone who may have seen a male matching this description acting suspiciously in this area is asked to contact Suffolk police, quoting reference: 37/43104/20
