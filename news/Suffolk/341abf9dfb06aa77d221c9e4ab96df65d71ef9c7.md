A Hollesley Bay prisoner has been charged with five offences including escaping from lawful custody and aggravated vehicle taking and dangerous driving.

Police were called at 2.10pm yesterday afternoon, Thursday 7 September, to reports that a Daihatsu Fourtrak had been just been stolen off the driveway of a property in Alderton Road, Hollesley.

The vehicle was then located by officers at around 2.30pm travelling on the A12 southbound at Woodbridge, where it failed to stop when requested to do so.

The vehicle was then pursued along the A12 southbound, continuing onto Martlesham Heath residential estate along Eagle Way where it collided with a police vehicle, before re-joining the A12 and eventually being brought to a stop near to the Seven Hills interchange at Nacton.

Soloman Archer, aged 35, was subsequently arrested in connection with this incident and taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning. He has now been charged with the following offences:

 * Escaping from lawful custody
 * Aggravated vehicle taking and dangerous driving
 * Failing to stop for police
 * Driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence
 * Driving without insurance

Archer appeared before Ipswich Magistratesâ€™ Court earlier today, Friday 8 September, where he was remanded into custody to appear at Ipswich Crown Court on Friday 6 October.
