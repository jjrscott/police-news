Police have identified four men wanted following a spate of egg throwing incidents in the Kesgrave area.

After reports that cars were being targeted, with eggs thrown from a moving vehicle, officers have now traced the suspects and seized a large stash of eggs. Three men have received a Penalty Notice for Disorder (PND) for causing alarm and distress to residents and have each been ordered to pay a fine of £80.

The driver of the vehicle was issued a seizure of the motor vehicle warning under Section 59.

A fifth man was questioned but not found to have been involved.

The investigating officer Sergeant Philip Barrett said: “Throwing eggs at cars or houses is a criminal offence, capable of causing damage and injury. We do not tolerate this anti-social behaviour and would appeal to anyone who has witnessed egg-throwing vandalism or who has been a victim, to contact us.”
