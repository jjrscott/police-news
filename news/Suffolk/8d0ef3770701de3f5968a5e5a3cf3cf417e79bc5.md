Alex Turner, aged 20 of Spenser Road, Ipswich was yesterday, Wednesday 14 June, sentenced to a total of 10 years imprisonment and an extended licence period of 5 years.

In October 2016 Turner was charged with a number of sexual offences against two victims during 2015 and 2016. The trial was held in May 2017.

Before the trial Turner pleaded guilty to one rape and sexual activity with child under 16. A jury at Ipswich Crown Court found Turner guilty of 3 further rapes and a common assault.

Turner will be placed on the Sex Offenders Register, and is subject of Sexual Harm Prevention Order .

PC Damian Richer from the Suffolk Police’s Safeguarding Unit said,

"The victims in this case were immensely brave in coming forward and giving their evidence about what happened to them. They have been supported through the investigation by a number of agencies.

"We hope such a result will help to reassure victims that we will always investigate any allegations of recent or historic sexual abuse thoroughly and as a result bring offenders to justice.”
