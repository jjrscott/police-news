A 23-year-old man has been charged in connection with drug, dangerous driving and failing to stop offences in Ipswich.

Officers from the Sentinel South Team had cause to request a driver of a vehicle to stop in Hadleigh Road but he failed to do so shortly before 12.35pm on Wednesday 11 November. The driver was then pursued for a short time before he decamped.

A search of the vehicle was carried out and an amount of suspected cannabis was located within.

The man was arrested and was taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning.

Patrick Casey, of no fixed address, was subsequently charged with possession with intent to supply Class B drugs, dangerous driving and for failing to stop when requested.

Casey appeared at Ipswich Magistratesâ€™ Court on Thursday 12 November and is next due to appear at Ipswich Crown Court on Thursday 10 December.
