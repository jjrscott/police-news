On behalf of the family of Rachael here is the tribute:

Mum was the strongest person I’ve ever known. Mum was so very kind, caring, bubbly, always laughing and always smiling. Mum wasn’t just my mum but my bestfriend too. I speak for everyone when I say mum was always there when we needed her. Mum always wanted to spend time with all 5 of her kids and it breaks everyone’s hearts to know that she’s left us all behind, Rebecca 23, Brendon 21, Tyereke 20, Sara-Leigh 18 and Hayden 15. Us kids were mum’s world and so was her loving husband John. Mum also left behind 3 sisters Leanne, Sara-Jane and Kirsty and 3 brothers Stephen, Kristen and Adam who adored mum very much! Mum loved going out with her parents Clive and Charlene every weekend to the beach, the car boot even garden centres. In memory of you mum, we’ve made a pact that we’ll continue doing what you loved and go where you loved. Mum you were taken away far too soon! You’re never going to get to see us kids all grow up and watch us put our roots down and start our own family. But you will always be in our hearts but we all wish you were here to lead the way. It still hasn’t sunk in for many of us that your gone. But you’re not angel mum, but a butterfly now. We all love you and we all miss you. From your family x
