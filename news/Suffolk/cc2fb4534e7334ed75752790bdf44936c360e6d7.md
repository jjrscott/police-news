A 24-year-old man has been arrested in Ipswich on suspicion of drug offences after the vehicle he was driving was stopped by police.

The incident took place yesterday, Wednesday 27 May, at around 11:00am on Kings Way in the town when officers from the Roads and Armed Policing Team had cause to stop a Vauxhall car. The male driver of the vehicle then decamped but was located in a nearby garden by police a short time later. A package containing a number of wraps, thought to Class A drugs was recovered at the scene.

The 24-year-old man from Luton was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs and taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning.

He has been bailed to return to police on 23 June.
