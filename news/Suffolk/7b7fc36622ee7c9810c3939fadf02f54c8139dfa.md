Police are continuing to investigated an attempted armed robbery in Beccles.

Officers were called to Oliver & J Jewellery LTD on Blyburgate at just before 4.30pm on Tuesday 18 December 2018 after two men with their faces covered with scarves entered the store and threatened a female member of staff in her 60s with a knife before leaving without taking anything.

Police believe that two women spoke with the victim after the offence and told her which way the offenders had ran. Officers are keen to speak to these two people.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or saw any suspicious behaviour should contact Suffolk Constabulary on 101, quoting crime reference 37/73095/18.

Alternatively, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
