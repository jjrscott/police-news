Police are appealing for witnesses after a man had an unknown substance thrown at him in Ipswich.

The incident occurred at around 4.30pm yesterday afternoon, Thursday 27 July, in Gippeswyk Park.

The victim, a 54-year-old man, was asleep on a bench when he had something sprayed on him. At the current time officers believe this may have been bleach, although this has not been confirmed. However, it was not acid.

Paramedics were also in attendance and the victim was taken to hospital for treatment to his eyes, but is not thought to have suffered any permanent damage.

Officers are appealing for anyone who witnessed this attack, or who was in the park at the time and saw anything suspicious, to make contact.

Calls should be made to South CID at Landmark House on 101 quoting reference 51223/17, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
