Police are appealing for information after an attempted burglary at a food store in Lowestoft.

The incident occurred at around 2.45am this morning, Friday 6 July, at Aldi in Millennium Way.

Officers were called to reports that two people were trying to force open the front entrance with a crowbar. Police units were at the scene within five minutes, but the offenders ran off in the direction of the fields behind the store. Entry was not gained to the building.

A search of the area was carried-out by officers, including a police dog unit, but the suspects were not located.

A black Peugeot 207 was left abandoned in front of the entrance and there was a large heavy duty cable attached to the rear of the car. Due to the presence of this cable, it is believed the offenders were targeting the cash machine inside the store.

It has now been established that the vehicle was stolen from a car park in Quebec Road, Norwich, between Sunday 6 May and Tuesday 8 May. It was using number plates which were stolen from a Peugeot 308 overnight between Sunday 13 and Monday 14 May, which had been parked in London Road, Beccles.

Any witnesses, or anyone with information about this incident, is asked to contact East CID at Lowestoft Police Station on 101, quoting reference 37379/18. Alternatively you can contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
