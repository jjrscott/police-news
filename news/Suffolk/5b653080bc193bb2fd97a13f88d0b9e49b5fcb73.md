Detectives investigating a series of home burglaries in the Woodbridge area have arrested a 32-year-old man in connection with a dozen crimes.

The 32-year-old was arrested on Tuesday, 28 June, on suspicion of 11 home burglaries and one burglary of a garage in Victoria Road in Woodbridge.

The incidents occurred between mid-April and early June at properties in Woodbridge, Ufford, Melton and Martlesham.

The man, from Woodbridge, was taken into custody at Martlesham Police Investigation Centre where he was interviewed in connection with the crimes.

He has now been bailed to return to police on Thursday 14 July, to allow further enquiries to be made.

Searches were conducted and items of stolen property have been recovered.
