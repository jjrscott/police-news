Suffolk police and Suffolk County Council are advising motorists to drive with care during today as temperatures slowly start to rise after the recent cold weather.

The overall picture across the county is improving with no further reports of vehicles being stuck in snow, however motorists should still be aware that although all major routes are clear some rural roads will still have snow and ice on them.

As the predicted slow thaw sets in over the weekend, motorists are urged to drive with caution, according to the conditions and remain vigilant to the likelihood of surface water and the potential for localised flooding on many roads. Although a thaw is forecast, temperatures overnight will still struggle to get above freezing point so the threat of ice on many roads remains.

Motorists should also make sure they remain vigilant and aware of what is happening around them. This includes checking speed, their rear vision and side mirrors frequently and look well ahead to try to anticipate problems before they confront them and don't take risks. It is also important to remember that despite the predicted thaw journeys may still take longer.

Police also advise to:

Beware of slippery road surfaces due to the potential of flooded roads, surface water and ice.

Increase stopping distances and make sure that there is enough room between your car and the vehicle in front to allow you to stop suddenly if you need to.

Make sure your windscreen wipers are in good working order and that you keep washer fluid bottles topped up

Members of the public can report any incidents of flooding on the Suffolk County Council website: www.suffolk.gov.uk/flooding

## Previous release I 2 March 2018

Suffolk police are again today working in a multi-agency hub at police headquarters as the subzero temperatures continue.

Representatives from a number of agencies, such as Suffolk Highways, the 4x4 approved volunteer vehicle network and the local authority are at Martlesham Heath co-ordinating resources so they are mobilised in the most effective manner providing support to those in need across the county.

Since 10pm last night there have been around six road traffic collisions, although in the vast majority of these no one is believed to have sustained serious injuries*.

Chief Inspector Matt Rose said: "The multi-agency hub worked very well yesterday so we are continuing the same approach today with agencies coming together at the hub to plan and direct the resources where most need is required.

"The good news is that the A140 re-opened earlier today, however we are still advising motorists against non-urgent travel during today and if they do venture out to drive according to the conditions.

"Drivers please consider the timing of your journeys home. If people are able to avoid the rush hour it helps to keep the traffic flowing and the roads open."

"As we reach the end of the working week I’d like to express our thanks to everyone who has been helping through what have been very difficult and challenging situations. This has been a real partnership approach, including the support we have had from farming and the 4 x4 vehicle communities. We will continue to work together to offer the county support where needed over the weekend.”

"The advice remains the same as yesterday about not being complacent. Your journey may initially be ok with no or little snow, but the threat of snow drifts and ice on the roads still remains. Please take care and if you do feel in danger – please call 101 or 999 so we can help you.”

Drivers who need to travel are advised to:

Plan ahead – check you route on a planner to see the latest traffic updates

Tell friends or family about your travel plans – including route – and let them know when you’ve arrived

Make sure you vehicle is clear of snow/ice, has sufficient fuel and screenwash

Allow plenty of time for your journey

Travel at a low speed avoiding sudden braking/steering moves

Keep a sensible distance between you and the car in front

Use headlights – do not rely solely on daytime running lights

If visibility falls below 100m use your fog lights

Take provisions (blanket, warm clothing, food/water)

Charge your phone before setting off

If you get stuck in the snow stay with your car, but in an emergency if you do need to leave it, park it out of the main traffic route, where it won't cause an obstruction when conditions ease. Leave a contact number on the inside of the windscreen and return to your car at the first opportunity you have

Please follow our twitter (@suffolkpolice) and our facebook page (/suffolkpolice) for updates of any road traffic collisions and areas to avoid.

Suffolk Police is again reminding motorists to only make essential journeys this evening as the temperatures remain below freezing.

During the day police have been working in a multi-agency hub at police headquarters at Martlesham Heath to ensure a co-ordinated approach to using resources effectively and where they are most needed.

Motorists are reminded to be wary on roads in the more rural locations with some areas difficult to pass because of ice and snowdrifts.

At this stage the have been no serious injury road traffic collisions during the day, but driving conditions are expected to remain hazardous as standing water freezes and the threat of drifting snow remains.

Chief Inspector Matt Rose said: "It has been a great team effort during the day with various representatives from a number of agencies, such as Suffolk Highways and the local authority, coming to Martlesham Heath to ensure we are prioritising appropriately across the county.

"Drive to the conditions and I re-iterate only travel if your journey is absolutely necessary.

I would also urge drivers not to get complacent. Your journey may start out ok and relatively clear of snow, but you could soon get into difficulties with the threat of ice and drifting snow. Please take care and if you do feel in danger – please call 101 or 999 so we can help you.

"One of the key routes in the county, the A140 remains closed this evening from Beacon Hill Services, when it meets the A14, going northwards towards Stonham."

Drivers who need to travel are advised to:

Plan ahead – check you route on a planner to see the latest traffic updates

Tell friends or family about your travel plans – including route – and let them know when you’ve arrived

Make sure you vehicle is clear of snow/ice, has sufficient fuel and screenwash

## Previous Release I 1 March 2018

Emergency services have responded overnight to multiple weather related incidents affecting the strategic road network in Suffolk.

Many routes, including main trunk roads, have been blocked overnight as a result of snow drifts.

On the A140 police were notified at 12.40am that vehicles were stranded in snow near Mendlesham, however other stretches were also blocked periodically overnight.

The A14 eastbound is closed at junction 58 from Seven Hills at Nacton due to sudden mass accumulations of snow that was catching drivers out. Other minor routes to Felixstowe are also blocked by snow.

At 4.15am officers were informed that the A144 at Bramfield near Halesworth was blocked.

At 5am police were notified that the A12 between Blythburgh and Wangford was blocked, with snow reported to be up to 18in deep. HGVs are currently blocking the road south of Blythburgh preventing access to the area.

Suffolk Highways have been using snow ploughs and gritting vehicles all night, however these roads remain blocked.

Suffolk Constabulary has received numerous calls concerning abandoned vehicles in snow drifts across the county.

It is strongly advised that the public avoid using the road network this morning where possible. If travel has to be made, expect serious delays.

Ensure your vehicle is cleared of snow, drive to the conditions and take with you food and water provisions, plenty of warm clothing and blankets, shovels and fully charge your mobile phone.

Police are continuing to urge drivers to take care and be cautious of black ice as temperatures drop further.

Driving conditions are expected to worsen as standing water freezes and motorists are still being advised to only make essential journeys.

While the reported number of collisions remains relatively low (since 6am there have been around 30 non-injury or minor injury RTCs) the road conditions are making travel difficult with some journeys near to impossible.

Officers are also urging drivers of HGVs to stick to the left hand lanes on dual carriageways due to the weather conditions.

Police have been liaising with partners including Suffolk County Council and Suffolk Highways throughout the day and will continue to do as we move into the evening.

Chief Inspector Matt Rose from the Contact and Control said: "We've had officers out across the county working to clear blocked roads and our Roads Policing units have been helping motorists who have been involved in road traffic collisions.

"As we move into the evening, drivers need to be cautious of black ice. While the roads may look clearer there will be hidden dangers as any standing water freezes.

"Our advice remains the same - drive to the conditions and only travel if your journey is absolutely necessary.

"Drivers of heavy goods vehicles should avoid using the fast lanes on dual carriageways - our aim is for everyone to get where they are travelling to safely.

Please make sure your vehicle is prepared ahead of your journey:

Always ensure all windows are fully cleared of snow, frost and condensation before setting off on a journey - it is illegal to drive with obscured vision.

Ensure that dirt, salt and snow is cleared away from light fixtures.

Also clear snow from the top of the car as this can fall down and obscure your windscreen while you are driving.

Keep windscreen washer fluid topped up as windscreens quickly become dirty from traffic spray and salt from the roads.

If you get stuck in the snow stay with your car, but in an emergency if you do need to leave it, park it out of the main traffic route, where it won't cause an obstruction when conditions ease. Leave a contact number on the inside of the windscreen and return to your car at the first opportunity you have.

Allow extra time for your journeys

Reduce speed gradually - sharp braking in freezing conditions can result in a skid

Increase distance between you and the vehicle in front

Make sure you have sufficient fuel

Make sure you have plenty of layers and blankets

Take a fully charged mobile phone with you

Take provisions with you for long periods of time in your car

Chief Inspector Rose added: "Please follow our twitter (@suffolkpolice) and our facebook page (/suffolkpolice) for updates of any road traffic collisions and areas to avoid. I would also advise to listen to local radio and tune into weather reports to get an idea of the state of the roads.

"Our priority is those who are already stuck or have been involved in an RTC. Please bear with us, we have to take the same precautions you do and it may take as slightly longer to get to you.

"My final appeal is for you to look after each other. If you have elderly or vulnerable relatives or neighbours, make sure they are ok and have everything they need.â€

Suffolk Police is receiving a high number of calls and we would like to ask the public to report any non-urgent matters online at www.suffolk.police.uk In an emergency please call 999.
