A 28-year-old man has been remanded in custody after being charged with GBH and burglary at a home in Leiston.

Police were contacted around 3.25pm on 23 February to reports that a man had sustained an injury to his leg after an assault involving boiling water. The incident had occurred inside an address in Valley Road. A man in his 30s was taken for hospital treatment after sustaining a large burn wound to his leg.

Scott Abbott, 28, of Valley Gardens in Leiston, was arrested on March 5 in connection with the incident and interviewed. He was then charged with unlawfully and maliciously causing grievous bodily harm and with burgling the home in Valley Road â€“ stealing cash, two mobile phones and keys from the property.

He appeared before Norwich Magistrates on March 6 where he was remanded in custody until his next hearing at Ipswich Crown Court on April 3.
