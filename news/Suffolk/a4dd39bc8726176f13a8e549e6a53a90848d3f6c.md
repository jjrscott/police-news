Officers are appealing for witnesses following a collision on the A14 Orwell Bridge near Ipswich.

Police were called at 10.50am yesterday morning, Tuesday 15 August, to reports of a collision on the westbound carriageway between a lorry and a blue Mazda MX5 in the outside lane.

The lorry failed to stop and continued westbound towards the Copdock Mill interchange, where it is believed to have then turned off onto the A12 southbound. Officers completed a search of this route continuing down to the Essex border, but were not able to locate the lorry.

The driver of the Mazda was left shaken but was otherwise not injured as a result of this collision.

Any witnesses to this incident are asked to contact the PHQ Roads Policing and Firearms Operations Unit on **101** quoting reference CAD 128 of 15 August.
