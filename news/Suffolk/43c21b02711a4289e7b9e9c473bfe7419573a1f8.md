A 45-year-old man has been arrested and charged in connection with burglary and drug offences in Lowestoft.

Between Thursday 18 June and yesterday, Monday 29 June, a property in Cambridge Road was entered on at least four occasions and a number of items were stolen from within including a backpack containing a DSLR camera and lenses, commemorative coins, change, art materials and a Sony DVD player.

A 45-year-old man was arrested yesterday and was taken to Great Yarmouth Police Investigation Centre, where he was questioned.

William Reagan, of Oxford Road, Lowestoft, was subsequently charged with burglary and with possession of a Class A drug.

He was released on bail and is due to appear before Great Yarmouth Magistratesâ€™ Court on Wednesday 5 August.
