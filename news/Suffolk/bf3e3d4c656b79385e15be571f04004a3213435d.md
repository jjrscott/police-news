Detectives have been given more time to question an 18-year-old man from Ipswich in connection with a stabbing in South East Ipswich on Wednesday 13 June and are making a further appeal to members of the public to send in any footage of the incident.

Police were called at around 7.30pm on Wednesday 13 June, to reports that a 16-year-old boy had been stabbed outside the McDonald’s fast food restaurant in Ravenswood Avenue.

The victim suffered serious injuries in the incident but has now been released from hospital and is expected to make a full recovery.

A 17-year-old boy from Ipswich has been charged with possession of a bladed article and possession of cannabis, and appeared at Ipswich Magistrates’ Court this morning.

A 20-year-old man and a 22-year-old man have both been released under investigation, pending further enquiries.

Officers are continuing to follow various enquiries and these will continue in the coming days. Officers are treating it as a targeted attack and believe that the people involved were known to each other. Police are not directly linking it to the murder of Tavis Spencer-Aitkens on Saturday 2 June or to the stabbing in the early morning of Monday 11 June.

Officers are continuing to appeal for anyone with CCTV, dash cams, or mobile phone footage, who were in the area of McDonald’s, between 7pm and 8pm on Wednesday 13 June to make contact.

Senior Investigating Officer Detective Supt. Marina Ericson of the Major Investigation Team said: "We would like to make a direct appeal to members of the public who have seen or who have been sent any photos or video footage in relation to this incident and ask them to send it in to Suffolk Police through our online portal link. Any footage or information could provide vital evidence in relation to this investigation as we continue our enquiries.

This was yet another appalling and shocking attack on a young man, so we urge people who have some knowledge of this incident to come forward and speak to us, or to contact Crimestoppers anonymously.”

The mobile police station will remain in place at the Hening Avenue area of Ravenswood for the next few days and additional high visibility patrols across the town will continue. Our wider work on engaging with community leaders to address the concerns of people living and working in the area and to assist in reassuring the community will also continue over the coming days.

Anyone with information about the incident is asked to contact the Major Investigation Team, preferably by uploading information to the online portal https://mipp.police.uk/operation/814, or failing that by dialling 101 and quoting reference 37/32508/18.
