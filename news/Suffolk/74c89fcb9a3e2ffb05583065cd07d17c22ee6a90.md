Detectives are appealing for information or witnesses following a robbery in Southwold.

The incident took place on Saturday 30 September on Tibbyâ€™s Way in the town at around 10.45pm.

A group of teenage boys were walking when a dark coloured car pulled up and three men jumped out and demanded that the boys hand over property. A rucksack was stolen by the men who then drove off. The suspects are described as wearing hooded tops and balaclavas.

Witnesses or anybody who has any information are asked to call Lowestoft CID on 101 quoting reference 64441/17. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
