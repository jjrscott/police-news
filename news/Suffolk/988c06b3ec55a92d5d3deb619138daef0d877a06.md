A fatal fire at a home in Ipswich is not believed to be suspicious.

Police were alerted by the fire service just after 7.45pm yesterday, Thursday 26 January, to reports of a fire at a property in Reid Close and that one person â€“ a woman - was believed to be inside.

Emergency services attended but the woman was found deceased inside the home a short time later.

Based on the initial findings of a joint police and fire service investigation, the fire is not being treated as suspicious. However, work continues to establish the cause of the fire and a police scene will remain in place at the property overnight.

Any witnesses, or anyone who may have information about this incident, is asked to call Suffolk Police on **101** quoting CAD number 357 of 26 January.
