Police are appealing for information following further dog attacks on sheep in a field at Heath Road in Sutton.

Two incidents have been reported to police, both involving rare breed Norfolk Horn Sheep. The animals had been checked on Sunday 25 June but when a further check was made around 9am on Monday 26 one sheep was found to have injuries to its back leg and three were missing. Although all three of the missing sheep were located at least one has sustained serious injuries.

The flock were then moved to another field but when they were checked again on Wednesday 28 June there was further evidence of a dog attack.

Police are asking anyone with information about the incidents to come forward and are again urging dog owners to keep their pets under control.

Anyone who can help is asked to call Suffolk Police on 101, quoting crime number 45733/17.
