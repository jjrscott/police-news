A 49-year-old man and a 17-year-old boy have been arrested in Bury St Edmunds on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of controlled drugs.

Officers from the proactive Scorpion Team had cause to stop and search a 49-year-old man from Bury St Edmunds on The Vinefields yesterday Monday 11 May at around 12:20pm. A number of wraps of Class A drugs were recovered at the manâ€™s feet and he was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of controlled drugs.

A short time later, a 17-year-old boy from Dagenham was located at an address nearby linked to the man. A quantity of class A drugs were found on him and he was also arrested. Both people were taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre Police to be questioned by officers.

The teenager has now been bailed to return to police on 4 June and the man has been released under investigation whilst enquiries continue.
