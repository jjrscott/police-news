Police are appealing for witnesses to an assault that took place in Leiston.

It happened on Sunday 27 August at about 6.30pm when the male victim and his wife and their five year old son had parked their car on King Georges Avenue near to Yuan Feng chinese takeaway.

The daughter, aged in her early 50s, was shouted at by two males who were being verbally abusive about the manner of their parking. After collecting food from the takeaway they returned to their car when one of the suspects leaned into the driver side window of the car and punched the male, aged 70, in the face. He sustained pain and bruising to his cheek.

The two men then left the scene. The first male who assaulted the victim is described as large, with short grey hair and was wearing a grey polo neck and aged in his late 60s. The second male is described as shorter and thinner than the first male and with a Scottish accent.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has knowledge of it should contact PC Ali Bonham-Carter at Suffolk police on **101** quoting crime reference number 37/57291/17.
