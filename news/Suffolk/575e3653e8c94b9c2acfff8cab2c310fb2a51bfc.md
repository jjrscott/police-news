Police are appealing for witnesses after a vehicle failed to stop following a collision in Lowestoft.

The incident occurred at around 9.15pm on Friday 11 February in Lime Avenue, directly outside the Persimmon Homes site office.

A woman was riding a bicycle from the direction of Sands Lane, when a white vehicle clipped the bike’s rear wheel from behind and caused the cyclist to fall off and hit her head. The cyclist attended hospital to be checked over the following day after feeling unwell, but did not sustain any serious injuries.

Officers are trying to trace the vehicle involved, which failed to stop following the collision.

Any witnesses, or anyone who was driving in the area at the time and has a dashcam in their vehicle, is asked to contact Lowestoft Safer Neighbourhood Team quoting reference: CAD 179 of 12 February.
