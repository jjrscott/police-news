Police are appealing for witnesses to an incident of theft that took place in Beck Row, near Bury St Edmunds.

It took place on Saturday 10 March at Holmsey Green at about 10.20pm when an Ifor Williams trailer worth around £2000 was seen to be driven from the driveway of the victim’s address using a strap.

The trailer then became detached from the offending vehicle, described as a silver Vauxhall Astra, and the trailer then collided with a stationary vehicle, a blue Mazda 6 that was parked in a driveway. Although the damage caused by the trailer was superficial, the Mazda car was badly damaged.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or saw any suspicious behaviour prior to the incident taking place should contact Mildenhall police on 101, quoting crime reference 37/13255/18 or alternatively contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
