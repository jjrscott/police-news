Officers are appealing for witnesses or information after a robbery in Lowestoft.

The incident took place on Sunday 22 July at around 4pm in an alleyway that runs between Notley Road and Kimberley Road. A teenage boy riding a bicycle was stopped by two men who demanded that the boy hand over the bike and threatened to hurt him if he refused. The men then stole the bike and left the scene. The bicycle is described as a Conveyance silver mountain bike.

No weapon was seen and the boy was not injured although was very shaken as a result of the incident.
The men are described as white, between 5 feet 10 inches and 6 feet tall, in their 20s of slim build. One of the men had a ginger goatie and was wearing a black hooded Adidas tracksuit with 3 white stripes down the sides. The other man was wearing jeans, and a hooded black jumper.

Witnesses or anybody who has any information are asked to call Lowestoft CID on 101 quoting reference 41063/18. Alternatively, anonymously call the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
