Suffolk residents are being urged to be vigilant following a report of suspected rogue traders operating in the county.

Police received a call about an incident that happened yesterday, Thursday 21 January, after 2pm in Winchester Gardens in Barham.

A group of three men have cold called at a property, posing as a reputable roofing firm, suggesting that they offer a unique service and pressured the residents into agreeing. The men turned up in a new transit van, with white with signs on it.

The residents paid an amount and the men did some basic work. The workers have then said they will return the next day to finish the work and will require a further payment.

Anyone with information in relation to this crime should call Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting incident 339 of 21/01/16 or Crimestoppers anonymously on **0800 555111**.

## To avoid becoming a victim of rogue traders, follow these simple steps

 * Never agree to have work done by somebody who is just passing or take their word that it needs to be done at all.
 * Never pay for work before it is completed.
 * Do not accept any offer from them to drive you to the bank to withdraw money.
 * If you need work done, then visit www.checkatrade.com or call by phone on 0333 0146 190 or contact your local councils Trusted Trader Service.
