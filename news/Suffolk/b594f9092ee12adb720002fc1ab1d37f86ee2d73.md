Police are urging dog owners to keep their animals under control after a number of Hebridean and Norfolk rare breed sheep were found injured in Hollesley.

The incident took place in fields at Heath Road at some point between 4:15pm on Saturday 20 and 10am Sunday 21 May.

Four sheep sustained injuries so severe they had to be destroyed, and a further 12 are being treated for deep puncture wounds consistent with a dog attack.

Officers are urging anyone with information to come forward by calling Suffolk Police on **101** \- quoting crime number 37537/17.

Police are also reminding dog owners that they are responsible for keeping their pets under control and are asking anyone who sees a dog attacking sheep to call police immediately.

A person who owns or is in charge of a dog which worries livestock on any agricultural land is guilty of an offence. This includes attacking livestock or chasing in such a way as may be reasonably expected to cause injury or suffering to the livestock.
