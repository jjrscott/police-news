A man has been released on police bail following the discovery of a cannabis factory in Tuddenham on Monday 14 May.

Officers from the Neighbourhood Response Team in Mildenhall attended an address in The Green and discovered approximately 100 cannabis plants growing in rooms upstairs at the property.

A 61-year-old man was subsequently arrested on suspicion of the production of cannabis, for abstracting electricity and for money laundering offences.

He was taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre for questioning and has been released on bail until Tuesday 5 June 2018 pending further enquiries.
