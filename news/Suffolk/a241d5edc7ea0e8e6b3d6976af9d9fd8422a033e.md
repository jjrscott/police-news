Police are appealing for witnesses following a burglary in Lowestoft.

On Friday 8 June at some point between 4.30pm and 8.30pm, offenders gained entry to a property on Princes Walk.

An untidy search was carried out and an amount of jewellery, including a silver bangle, was taken from an upstairs bedroom.

Police are keen to hear from anyone who may have seen or heard anyone acting suspiciously in the area at the time of the offence, or who has any other information that may assist the investigation.

Anyone with any information should contact Detective Sgt Steve Bunn at Lowestoft CID on 101, quoting crime reference number 37/31459/18.
