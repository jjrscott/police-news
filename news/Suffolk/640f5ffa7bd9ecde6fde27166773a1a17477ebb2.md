Police are appealing for witnesses to three burglaries that are being linked in Lowestoft.

The first incident took place at some point overnight from Monday 30 July into Tuesday 31 July.

A dental practice on Kirkley Cliff Road was broken into and main office entered but at this stage no items have been taken (c/r 37/42913/18)

A second incident took place over the same period at some point at the model boat club at Kensington Gardens on Kensington Road where a storage shed was broken into by forcing wooden door (37/42928/18). It is not yet clear if anything has been stolen.

The third and final incident took place again overnight at the WDC bowls and tennis club also at Kensington Gardens where the main door to storage shed was jemmied and an untidy search has taken place (37/42922/18). No items appear to have been taken at this time.

Anyone who witnessed either incident, saw any suspicious activity in the area overnight or has knowledge of the crimes that could help police should contact Lowestoft police on 101, quoting the relevant crime number. Alternatively, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
