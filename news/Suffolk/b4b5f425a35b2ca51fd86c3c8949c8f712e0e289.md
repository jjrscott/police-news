Police are appealing for help following an assault in Ipswich.

At approximately 9:50pm last night (Wednesday 22 November), a man in his seventies was assaulted and threatened by another man within the Alderman Road Recreation Park.

The suspect is described as being white, 6ft 3inches tall, aged between 23 and 25 years old, with an English accent. He has blond hair and was wearing skinny jeans and a navy jacket.

Just prior to this assault, it is thought a man fitting this description was reported as having assaulted other members of the public and was seen jumping in and out of traffic.

At the time of the incident, there would have been numerous people in the area on foot and in vehicles as this was shortly after the Ipswich Town Football match ended.

Anyone who witnessed the incident, saw any suspicious activity in the area or has knowledge of the incident should contact Ipswich CID on 101 quoting crime reference 37/75220/17 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
