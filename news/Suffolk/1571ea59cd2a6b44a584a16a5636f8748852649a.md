Police are appealing for witnesses following a road traffic collision in Rougham.

The collision occurred shortly before 5pm on Friday 29 March, eastbound on the A14.

Six vehicles â€“ a Ford Focus, a Volkswagen Move Up, a BMW 523i, a Vauxhall Corsa, a Chevrolet Cruze and Audi TT Quattro Coupe - were involved in the collision in the outside lane.

An ambulance was called and two people were taken to hospital after sustaining minor injuries.

The vehicles were recovered and the carriageway was clear shortly before 7.45pm.

Officers would like to hear from any witnesses to the collision or anyone who saw the manner of driving of any of the vehicles beforehand. Officers would also be interested in hearing from anyone with any dashcam footage.

Anyone with information is asked to either email PC 1880 Kelly on [email protected] or call Bury St Edmunds Roads and Armed Policing Team on 101, quoting CAD 285 of 29 March.
