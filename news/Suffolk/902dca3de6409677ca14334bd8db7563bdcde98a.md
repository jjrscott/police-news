2016 has marked the 100th anniversary since the introduction of British Summer Time, which comes to an end for another year this Sunday, 30 October. As the darker evenings approach, Suffolk Police are reminding residents to take basic home security measures to keep their home safe.

Chief Inspector, Matt Rose, said: "While Suffolk generally has low crime rates, a house in darkness indicates that there’s no one home and could be an invitation to a burglar. There are a lot of simple things you can do, which don’t have to be expensive, such as using a timer so that a light automatically comes on at a time of your choosing when you’re not there.

"It might seem obvious to say, but making sure your doors and windows are locked can be a deterrent for an intruder. Many burglaries are opportunistic crimes, where the offender has identified an open window or insecure door and easily let themselves into your home.”

In September of this year, 40% of burglaries reported to police were at homes where doors or windows had been left unlocked.

"Many people only think about home security after they have been burgled. We want to encourage people to review this before they fall victim to crime. Similarly, valuables left on view on car seats provide an ideal opportunity for a smash and grab.”

Below are some more useful tips to reduce the risk of burglary and car crime. Alternatively, please find detailed crime prevention advice on the Suffolk Police website: https://www.suffolk.police.uk/advice/crime-prevention-z

 **Burglary Prevention Tips:**

 * Always close and lock all windows and doors when leaving your home.
 * As nights get darker earlier, burglary tends to increase. Invest in a light timer and leave lights on inside your house in more than one room.
 * Remove any cover for a burglar to work unseen, such as shrubbery, and give your neighbours every chance to spot something suspicious.
 * Avoid keeping any valuable jewellery in obvious places eg. jewellery boxes, under the bed or at the bottom of the wardrobe.
 * Consider hiding such items in several locations around your home (not a wardrobe).
 * If using a safe please ensure this is secured to a solid floor see www.securedbydesign.com for details.
 * Ensure valuable or sentimental items of jewellery are suitably insured.
 * Take photographs of all such items (laid beside a ruler) & store these in a safe place.
 * Register all valuable items on www.immobilise.com.
 * Large quantities of cash should never be kept at home.
 * Keep keys and valuables out of sight, and reach, from cat flaps, letterboxes, and downstairs doors and windows.

 **Vehicle Crime Prevention:**

 * Remove all valuables and take them with you or locked out of sight.
 * Keep your keys safe with you at all times.
 * Fit security devices such as an electronic immobiliser, mechanical immobiliser, vehicle alarm, or locking wheel nuts.
 * Have your vehicle registration number etched onto all glass surfaces.
 * Mark valuables with your surname, door number and postcode with police approved SmartWater www.smartwater.com or Selecta DNA forensic products www.selectadna.co.uk.
 * Lock all doors and all windows every time you leave your car, even if it is just for a few minutes.
 * Use your garage and always lock it as well as your car. If you do not have a garage, try to park in a well-lit place or somewhere that is in good view of passers-by.
 * If you see any suspicious behaviour, please call 101, or 999 in an emergency. By calling police as soon as possible, it gives officers the greatest chance of making an arrest or preventing a crime from taking place altogether.
