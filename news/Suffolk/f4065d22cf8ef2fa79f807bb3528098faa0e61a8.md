Police are appealing for witnesses or information after a business burglary in Ellough.

The incident took place on Saturday 10 October at around 9:25pm at the Ellough Park Raceway, Benacre Road. A group of between eight or nine people travelling in two vehicles arrived at the address, cut the gate chains and then used one of the vehicles to ram a secure garage door. Between 12-15 electric scooters were stolen from within.

The vehicles involved are thought to be a Suzuki Jimmy 4X4 jeep and a Ford Transit van.

It is believed that during the incident another vehicle drove up to the site but the suspects told them to leave. Police would like to trace the occupants as they could have information to assist the investigation.

Officers are asking these witnesses or anybody else who saw anything suspicious, or drivers who captured any relevant dash-cam footage to contact Lowestoft CID quoting reference 37/59132/20.
