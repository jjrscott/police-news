Police are appealing for witnesses to a burglary at a business that took place at Newmarket.

It happened at some point overnight between Wednesday 14 March and Thursday 15 March at Farrier’s Choice on Oaks Drive in the town.

Offender(s) have broken into the building and have caused significant damage to both the doors. Once inside they have smashed a glass window to the office area. They have then carried out an untidy search of the office and have stolen a large quantity of farrier’s tools and equestrian equipment to the approximate value of £21,000.

Officers are keen to speak to anyone who may have recently been sold any farrier or equestrian equipment in strange or suspicious circumstances.

Anyone who saw any suspicious activity during the times stated or believes they have information relating to the incident should contact police in Mildenhall on 101, quoting crime reference 37/14080/18. Alternatively, they can call the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
