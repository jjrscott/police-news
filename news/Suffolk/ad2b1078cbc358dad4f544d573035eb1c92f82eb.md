A man has been charged with a burglary in Peasenhall that took place last month.

A man was arrested on Friday 1 February at Peasenhall on suspicion of burglary and suspicion of possession of drugs.

It follows a burglary at a property on 15 January where cash and a laptop were stolen during a search of the premises.

The male was taken to Great Yarmouth Police Investigation Centre for questioning.

30 year old Sean Murphey of Langston Hughes Close in London was subsequently charged with burglary, possession of cannabis and aggravated theft of a motor vehicle.

He was remanded in custody and appeared before Norwich Magistrates Court on Saturday 2 February.
