Officers are appealing for witnesses or information after a robbery in Bury St Edmunds.

The incident took place on Friday 18 January at just after 5pm on Mildenhall Road near to the A14 road bridge in the town. The victim, a man in his 30â€™s, withdrew a sum of money from a cashpoint at the train station and was walking home when a number of males approached him from behind. It is reported that one of the males threatened the victim and demanded money. The man handed over a sum of cash and then ran off from the scene. He was not harmed during the incident.

The suspects are all described as white. It is reported that the main suspect spoke with an English accent and two of other males spoke an Eastern European language.

Witnesses or anybody with any information are asked to call Bury CID on 101 quoting reference 37/3582/19. Alternatively call the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
