Police are appealing for witnesses to a reported fail to stop incident that took place in Lowestoft.

A 14 year old boy was in collision with a grey Toyota Yaris whilst cycling across the junction of Jubilee Way and the main roundabout at the end of St Peter Street in the town.

The teenager said that it took place on Friday 2 November at about 3pm to 3.30pm. It was reported to police the following day. He sustained a minor cut to his leg that did not require hospital treatment.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has knowledge of it should contact Suffolk Constabulary on 101, quoting CAD 102 of 3 November 2018.
