Police are appealing for information and urging communities to be vigilant following two burglaries that took place in rural locations.

Officers were called to an address on the main road between Fressingfield and Weybread on Monday 17 April by the victim reporting seeing two people in his house just before 9pm. He shouted out to them and they fled the scene via a side gate. Officers attended and discovered a jewellery box with its contents discarded near the property, which was identified as that of the victims.

The first suspect is described as male, approximately 16 or 17 yearsâ€™ old and of slim build. He has dark hair and was wearing a grey tracksuit top and bottoms. The second suspect was only seen in silhouette.

Police are investigating whether this incident is linked to a second burglary at an address in Laxfield, near Station Road, which occurred at some point between 10:30am on Sunday 16 and 10:30am on Tuesday 18 April. Entry was forced to the rear of the house and jewellery along with a quantity of cash, including foreign currency, was stolen.

Witnesses or anyone with information to help identify those responsible should call Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting reference 29493/17 (Weybread) or 29634/17 (Laxfield). Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on **0800 555 111** or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
