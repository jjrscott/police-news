Two people have been summonsed to court in relation to offences relating to livestock worrying in Brantham near Manningtree.

It follows four incidents last year in the village. On the 9 August last year two sheep were found by a sheep owner in Brantham and were so severely injured they both had to be put down. On 22 August 2020 in Brantham the same victim found two badly injured ewes with one needing to be put down, while at some point between 30 August 2020 and 31 August in Brantham two other sheep were attacked causing serious injuries, resulting in both being put down. Finally, a further incident on 11 September in Brantham saw two badly injured ewes found, with one animal needing to be put down.

Following police investigations by the Rural and Wildlife Policing Team a 40 year old woman and 52 year old man both from the Manningtree area have been summonsed to court relating to four counts each of being in charge of a dog and worrying livestock and four counts of criminal damage.

They are summonsed to appear before Ipswich Magistrates Court on Tuesday 23 March at 12.15pm.
