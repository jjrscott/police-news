A man aged in his 50s has been arrested in connection with supplying cannabis following a police raid in Little Wratting.

Officers executed a warrant under the Misuse of Drugs Act on Friday 15 September at a property in Haverhill Road.

19 cannabis plants and a large quantity of herbal cannabis were seized, along with cultivation equipment and a number of counterfeit DVDs.

A 54-year-old man from the Haverhill area was subsequently arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of a controlled drug and possessing articles for use in fraud.

He was taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre for questioning and has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Haverhill Safer Neighbourhood Team are appealing for members of the public who have any suspicions or information about the production or distribution of cannabis to contact them on 101, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
