Police are appealing for witnesses following an aggravated burglary that took place in Ipswich.

It happened at about 9:25pm on Tuesday 27 March at a property in Shaftesbury Square.

Three unknown masked male suspects forced entry into a property. Once inside, one of the men ordered the male victim to sit down before binding his wrists and covering his head and mouth.

The two other men carried out an untidy search and stole a quantity of cash.

One of the suspects is described as male, white, around 20 to 30-years-old, five feet six inches tall, with an average build and dark coloured eyes. He wore a black mask over his face, a black jacket, black trousers and black gloves.

The other two offenders were also described as wearing black clothing and black gloves.

Officers believe that this was a targeted incident and are appealing for any witnesses to make contact.

Anyone who witnessed any suspicious behaviour at around the time of the incident or has knowledge of the incident should contact Ipswich CID on 101 quoting crime reference 16750/18 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
