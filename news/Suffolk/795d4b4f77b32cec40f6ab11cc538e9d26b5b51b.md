A man has died following a single-vehicle road traffic incident in Darsham.

Police were called by the Ambulance Service at 10.35am this morning, Wednesday 14 December, reporting that a white Ford Transit van had left the road on the A12, around 50 metres south of the level crossing.

The air ambulance was also in attendance but despite receiving treatment, the driver of the van – a man aged in his 50s – sadly died at the scene.

The A12 is currently closed in both directions while a collision investigation takes place. Local diversions are in place, with the road expected to reopen at approximately 6pm.

Any witnesses are asked to contact Suffolk Police on 101 quoting reference CAD 130 of 14 November.
