Police are renewing an appeal for witnesses following an attempted robbery in Haverhill.

The incident occurred at around 1.35pm on Thursday 4 July, near the newt pond in Castle Playing Fields.

The victim – a woman aged in her 40s – was riding a mobility scooter near the grounds of the Haverhill Rugby Football Club when she saw a male on a bike and another male.

One of the males then came towards her and pushed her body onto the handle bars of the scooter. He then threatened her and attempted to grab her bag by the handle.

A member of the public, a man who was with a dog and a younger male, then shouted at the male suspect to let the woman go and the two male suspects then ran off in the direction of Chimswell Way.

The woman was shaken and with bruising as a result of the incident.

The first male suspect is described as black, aged between 20 and 30 years of age, around 5ft 11ins tall, of an athletic build with black curly hair, which was seen just under a hood. He was wearing a black hoody, with black jogging bottoms and red shoes/trainers. The male was heard speaking with what is described as a cockney accent.

The second male suspect is described as white, 5ft 11ins tall and of a slim build. He was wearing a scarf across his face with his hood up. He was also wearing a black hoody and grey joggers and black trainers. He was riding a silver mountain bike.

Officers would be particularly interested to speak to the male bystanders with the dog who came to the woman’s assistance during the incident as they may be able to help with the investigation.

The male bystander is described as being around 60 years of age with a shaved head. He was wearing shorts and a t-shirt. He was walking a German Shepherd-type breed dog, which he let off the lead and the dog chased after the two males as they ran off.

The second male bystander is described as being younger than the other bystander and aged around 25 to 30 years of age. He was wearing jeans, a t-shirt and had a beard. He ran after the suspects into the wooded area.

Anyone with information about incident should contact West CID at Bury St Edmunds Police Station by quoting crime reference 37/38846/19
