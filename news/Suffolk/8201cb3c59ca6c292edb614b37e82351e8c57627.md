## Previous release | 23 February 2019

Police are appealing for help to trace a Hollesley Bay prisoner who has failed to return following a period of home leave.

Sam Claxton, aged 37-years-old, was released on temporary licence to go to an address in Ipswich, today, Saturday 23 February, and was due to return by 8pm today. However, he has failed to return and so has been reported missing to police.

Claxton is serving an eight sentence for possession with intent to supply a Class A drug – cocaine.

He is described as white, 5ft 11ins tall, of a stocky build, with short shaven brown hair, brown eyes, and with tattoos on his lower right arm and on the right side of his neck. He was wearing a grey jumper, grey tracksuit top, grey trousers and blue and white trainers.

Anyone who may have seen Claxton, or who has any information regarding his whereabouts, is asked to contact Suffolk police on 101.
