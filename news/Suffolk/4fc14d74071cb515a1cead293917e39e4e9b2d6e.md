Police are appealing for public support to trace the owner of a musical instrument.

A banjo, in apparent pristine condition and still in its case, has been handed to police at Lowestoft Police Station.

The string instrument had been found in a hedge near Oulton Broad South railway station by members of the public who handed it to police on Saturday 23 September.

Officers have conducted local enquiries but, as there have been no reports of a stolen or lost banjo, would like to appeal to the public for help in hope someone will be able to identify the owner.

If you are the genuine owner, you will be asked questions in order to confirm the instrument as yours.

Anyone with information, or who thinks the banjo may below to them, is asked to contact Lowestoft Police Station on 101, or email [email protected].
