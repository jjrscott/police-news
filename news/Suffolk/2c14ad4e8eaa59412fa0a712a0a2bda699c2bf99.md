A man has sustained serious injuries following a single-vehicle road traffic collision in Foxhall at the weekend.

The incident occurred at around 6.35pm on Sunday 29 April, on Foxhall Road, 100 metres west of the entrance to the recycling centre.

A silver Volkswagen Polo rolled several times before coming to rest in some trees over a ditch.

The 18-year-old rear seat passenger was taken to Addenbrookeâ€™s Hospital by air ambulance after sustaining potentially life-changing injuries. The driver and front seat passenger were both taken to Ipswich Hospital for treatment to minor injuries.

The road was closed between the A12 and Dobbs Labe whilst a collision investigation took place, reopening at around 2.15am on Monday 30 April.

Any witnesses to the collision are asked to contact the PHQ Roads Policing and Firearms Operations Team on 101, quoting reference CAD 306 of 29 April.
