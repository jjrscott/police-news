Two teenagers have been arrested by police investigating a robbery which took place in Ipswich last month.

The crime occurred at 10.15pm on Saturday 18 January at the university car park in Long Street.

A 49-year-old man was surrounded by a group of males and then punched, causing him to fall to the ground and his wallet and phone were then subsequently stolen. He was taken to hospital where he required treatment for injuries to his head.

On Tuesday 11 February officers arrested two 14-year-old boys from Ipswich on suspicion of robbery in connection with the incident.

They were taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning and have been released on bail until Tuesday 10 March, pending further enquires.
