Police are appealing for witnesses following a road related incident in Bungay.

The incident occurred at approximately 1.10pm on Wednesday 12 September, when a driver of a dark coloured hatchback was travelling from the direction of the B1062 Flixton Road on the wrong side of the road, nearly causing a collision with an oncoming black Range Rover.

The Range Rover, which swiftly mounted a nearside kerb to avoid the collision, sustained damage to two tyres and an alloy wheel. Minor damage was also caused to the body of the vehicle. The Range Rover driver and their young passenger were left shaken by this incident but were otherwise unharmed.

Any witnesses who believe they saw the incident during the afternoon of Wednesday 12 September are asked to contact Suffolk police, as is anyone who drove along the B1062 Flixton Road and Hillside Road West in Bungay at this time and has a dashcam fitted in their vehicle.

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to contact Beccles and Bungay Safer Neighbourhood Team on 101.
