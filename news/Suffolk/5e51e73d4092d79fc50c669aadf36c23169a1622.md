Police are appealing for witnesses following a serious road traffic collision in Withersfield.

Officers were called at 8.30am on Wednesday 16 January, to reports of a two-vehicle collision in Skippers Lane, involving a burgundy Ford Fiesta and a white Fiat 500.

Both drivers were taken to Addenbrooke’s Hospital for treatment, with the driver of the Ford Fiesta – a woman aged in her 20s – taken by air ambulance, having sustained a potentially life-changing leg injury.

The driver of the Fiat – a woman aged in her 50s - was taken to hospital by land ambulance having sustained a fractured knee and other injuries.

Officers are appealing for any witnesses to the collision, or anyone who saw either vehicle immediately prior to it, to make contact. They would also like to hear from anyone with dashcam footage of the incident.

Any witnesses are asked to contact the Roads and Armed Policing Team at Bury St Edmunds on 101 quoting reference CAD 63 of 16 January.
