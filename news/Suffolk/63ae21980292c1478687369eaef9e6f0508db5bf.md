Five men – four from London and one from Suffolk – have been charged in connection with Class A drugs offences in Bury St Edmunds.

Officers executed a warrant under the Misuse of Drugs Act at a property in Firtree Close yesterday, Wednesday 5 April, and seized a large quantity of suspected Class A drugs, along with an amount of cannabis.

Police arrested five men as a result of this warrant and they were taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre for questioning. All five have subsequently been charged with two Class A drugs offences – conspiracy to supply heroin and conspiracy to supply crack cocaine. Their details are as follows:

 * Abdulaziz Ali, aged 26, of Curzon Crescent, Barking
 * Asman Osman, aged 18, of Harts Lane, Barking
 * Umar Yusuf-Iya, aged 18, of Whiting Avenue, Barking (also charged with possession of cannabis)
 * Fahad Mbwana, aged 18, of Charter Avenue, Ilford
 * Stephen Wass, aged 54, of Firtree Close, Bury St Edmunds

All five were remanded in custody and are due to appear before Ipswich Magistrates’ Court today, Thursday 6 April.
