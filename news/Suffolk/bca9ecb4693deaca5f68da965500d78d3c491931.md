Three men have been arrested and charged after an aggravated burglary in Ipswich.

The incident took place at approximately 05:45am in the early hours of Saturday 13 June at a residential address on Neath Drive in the town. Three men forced entry to the property, waking the single occupant, a man in his 60s. The men, carrying a knife, demanded that the victim reveal his PIN for his bank card and then stole a quantity of cash and the bank card. A short time later the bank card was later used to withdraw a large sum from a cashpoint. The victim was not harmed as a result of the incident.

Three men from Ipswich, 35-year-old Daniel Tovey of Marigold Avenue, 36-year-old Glynn Davis of Springhurst Close and 47-year-old William Hutchinson of Norwich Road were all arrested by police on the same day and taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning. The three men were charged yesterday, 14 June, with burglary offences. Hutchinson has also been charged with possession of a Class A drug.

The three men appeared before Ipswich Magistrates Court today, 15 June and have been remanded to appear before Ipswich Crown Court on 13 July 2020.
