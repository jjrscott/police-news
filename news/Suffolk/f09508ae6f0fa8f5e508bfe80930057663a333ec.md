Police are appealing for witnesses and information after a fire broke out outside a home address in Franklin Road, Ipswich.

It appears several bags of rubbish and bin liners were set alight deliberately to the rear of the property at some point between 10:30pm and 11:45pm on Tuesday 24 January.

Fortunately no one was injured, although there has been some damage to the property.

The incident is being treated as arson with intent to endanger life and detectives are exploring possible motives for the incident.

Anyone with information about this incident, or who may have seen or heard anything suspicious between the times stated, is asked to contact Ipswich CID on **101** quoting reference 14027/17. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers, anonymously if required, on **0800 555 111**.
