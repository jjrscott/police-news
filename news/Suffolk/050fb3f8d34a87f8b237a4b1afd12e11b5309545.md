A 32-year-old man has been given a suspended sentence after pleading guilty to two burglaries in north-east Suffolk and one charge of handling stolen goods.

Wayne Mills, of Charter Way in Lowestoft, appeared at Ipswich Crown Court on Monday 24 April, after pleading guilty to the three offences earlier this month, and has now been sentenced to 24 months, suspended for two years. He will also need to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work.

The offences included a burglary at a home in Station Road in Brampton in June 2016 where a 65-inch Samsung TV was stolen and a burglary at a property that was under renovation at St Cross South Elmham in May 2016, where items including tools were stolen.

Media appeals including CCTV images were issued in both cases – which led to a number of people contacting officers with information.

Mills also admitted handling goods – including a TV, a games console, a laptop computer and monitors and several vacuum cleaners - that were stolen in a burglary at a property in Westhall in June 2016.

Mills was arrested in mid-September 2016 and, following further work by detectives, was charged in November 2016.
