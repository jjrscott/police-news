A 26-year-old man from Devon has been charged with grievous bodily harm after a teenage girl was stabbed in Bardwell.

The incident occurred between 7.30am and 8.30am yesterday, Thursday 5 October, at a house in School Lane.

The victim, a 16-year-old girl, alleged that a man who had also been present at the address attempted to steal her handbag. An altercation then ensued during which she was stabbed in the shoulder and the arm. The man then ran out into the street with the handbag.

Dimitri Coxon, of Lockyer Street, Plymouth, was subsequently arrested by officers investigating the incident. He has now been charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent and was remanded in custody to appear before Ipswich Magistratesâ€™ Court today, Friday 6 October.

Detectives are appealing for anyone who was in the vicinity of School Lane yesterday morning, between 7.30am and 8.30am, and who may have seen a man run out of a house into the street holding a handbag to make contact.

Anyone with information is asked to call West CID at Bury St Edmunds Police Station on 101, quoting reference 65158/17, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
