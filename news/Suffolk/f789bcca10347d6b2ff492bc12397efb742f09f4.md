Police are appealing for witnesses after a robbery in Ipswich.

The incident took place at approximately 5am this morning, Tuesday 24 October, in Robeck Road.

The victim, a man in his 50s, was walking near the junction with Hawke Road when he was approached from behind by a man who demanded money and threatened him with, what is believed to be, a knife.

The victim handed over a quantity of cash but, when unable to give more, the suspect punched him in the face causing him to fall to the ground, at which point his wallet was forcibly removed.

The victim sustained minor cuts and grazes, redness and swelling as a result of this incident, but did not require hospital treatment.

The suspect is described as a man, dressed in all dark clothing who kept his face covered.

Police are appealing for anyone with information about this crime to contact Ipswich CID on 101 quoting reference 69133/17, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
