Police are appealing for witnesses or information after a burglary at a business premises in Stowmarket.

The incident took place on Tuesday 22 September, sometime between 02:00am and 02:35am at The Trade Inn shop, Meadow Centre, Wilkes Way in the town.

It is believed that two men forced entry the premises, causing significant damage to the front door, and setting off the alarm. The suspects ran from the scene a short time later in the direction of Asda and are thought to have driven off in a white hatchback car, possibly a Mazda.

It is not known at this time what was stolen.

Police quickly attended the scene and conducted an area search but the offenders have not been located.

Witnesses or anybody who saw or heard anything suspicious at the time are asked to contact police quoting reference 37/55185/20
