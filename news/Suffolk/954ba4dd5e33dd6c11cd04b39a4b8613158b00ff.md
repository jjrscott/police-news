A man has been sentenced to 30 months in a young offenders’ institution for committing drug offences in Sudbury.

Jerell Reid, aged 19 and from Batemen Road in London was jailed at Ipswich Crown Court yesterday (Thur 8 October) after pleading guilty at an earlier hearing.

A Misuse of Drugs Act warrant was executed at a property on Suffolk Road on 21 August this year. Once police had entered the property, drugs and cash were located in the lounge. Around £875 in cash and 84 wraps and 25 wraps of class A drugs in cling film were recovered..

He was taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre for questioning and he was subsequently charged the following day with possession of cocaine with intent to supply and possession of diamorphine with intent to supply.

Inspector Kevin Horton for Sudbury said: "This arrest and conviction came about from information given to us by the local community and demonstrates that we will act on such intelligence received. Officers and staff are working hard to ensure all of Suffolk remains a hostile environment for those who think they can come into Suffolk and deal drugs”.

Anyone who has information about drug use in their community is asked to contact their local policing team on 101 or alternatively, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
