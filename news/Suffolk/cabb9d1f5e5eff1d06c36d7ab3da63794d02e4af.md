A 33-year-old man has been jailed for possession of an illegally held firearm in Ipswich last year.

James Logan, of no fixed address, appeared at Ipswich Crown Court today, Friday 17 May, where he was sentenced to three years and eight months imprisonment, after pleading guilty at an earlier hearing.

On Friday 21 September 2018, police received information that Logan was in possession of a firearm and officers attended a property on Allenby Road conducting a firearms operation. Police arrested Logan- who was visiting the property - on suspicion of a firearms offence and he was conveyed to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre.

A search of the property took place during which a double barrelled sawn off shotgun was located in the rear garden, secreted under fence panels and wrapped in two plastic carrier bags. Also located in the rear garden, were five shotgun cartridges, which had been hidden in a T-shirt and placed in a planter.

During the search of the inside of the property police found 95g of herbal cannabis in a plastic bag secreted underneath a snake tank in the lounge, other smaller amounts of cannabis and various mobile telephones and SIM cards.

Logan was charged for possession of a firearm without holding a firearm certificate on 23 January 2019.

Investigating officer DC Dan Steel from Ipswich CID said: “Suffolk Constabulary is committed to removing weapons of all varieties from our streets and will work robustly with its partners to bring to justice those who carry weapons. The sentence handed to Logan by the court today will hopefully deter others from following his course of action.”
