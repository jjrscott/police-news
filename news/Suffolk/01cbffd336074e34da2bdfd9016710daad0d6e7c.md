Police are appealing for witnesses following a road traffic collision on the A12 at Saxmundham.

Officers were called at 12.15pm yesterday afternoon, Sunday 5 February, to reports of a two-vehicle collision between a red Audi A3 and a blue Toyota Yaris in the southbound carriageway, at the junction of the B1119 Rendham Road.

Ambulance and fire crews were also in attendance and the driver of the Toyota Yaris was airlifted to Addenbrookeâ€™s Hospital, having sustained a cracked sternum and cracked ribs. His injuries are not believed to be life-threatening or life-changing.

The southbound carriageway remained closed until around 4.40pm whilst a collision investigation and recovery of the vehicles took place.

Any witnesses to the collision are asked to contact the Martlesham Roads Policing and Firearms Operations Team on **101** , quoting reference CAD 153 of 5 February.
