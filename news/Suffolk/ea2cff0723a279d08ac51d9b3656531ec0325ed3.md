Police are appealing for information to help trace a man who approached schoolchildren in two incidents in Haverhill earlier this week.

The first incident happened on Tuesday, 21 February, around 8.15am – 8.30am in Chalkstone Way. Two 12-year-old boys were approached by a man who had his arms outspread as if he was trying to catch them. He then asked where the boys were going. They carried on to school but the man followed them before walking away.

The second incident happened on Wednesday, 22 February, around 8am in Manor Road. Two girls – both aged 13 – were walking along when a man approached them and asked them about their school. He brushed passed one of the girls and they continued on their way. He then followed them for a brief period before walking away.

The man involved in the Wednesday incident is described as white, possibly in his 60s, with a bald head and was wearing oval-shaped glasses, a dark coat and brown trousers.

There may be an innocent explanation for the incidents but police need to trace the man and are urging him, or anyone who knows who he is, to come forward.

If you can help please contact officers at Haverhill by calling Suffolk Police on **101** and quoting crime number 19201/17.
