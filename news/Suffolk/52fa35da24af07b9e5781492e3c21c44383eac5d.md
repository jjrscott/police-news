Police are appealing for information following a ram raid at a shopping centre in Newmarket.

Officers were called shortly before midnight on Monday 2 April, following reports that a Land Rover Discovery had been driven into The Guineas Shopping Centre.

Once inside the shopping precinct, offenders removed a free standing ATM which was situated inside. Extensive damage was caused to the entrance doors and other shop fronts within the centre in the process of removing the ATM.

The offenders then abandoned the Land Rover Discovery at the scene and made off in a second vehicle – believed to be a black Audi S6 – taking the ATM with them.

It is believed that the number plates attached to the Audi vehicle had been stolen earlier the same evening from a white Vauxhall Combo van which was parked at business park in Risby.

The Land Rover Discovery is believed to have been stolen from a garage in Bury St Edmunds, also earlier that same evening.

Anyone with information about this ram raid, or the vehicle theft in Bury St Edmunds, is asked to contact Suffolk police on 101 quoting reference 37/17844/18, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
