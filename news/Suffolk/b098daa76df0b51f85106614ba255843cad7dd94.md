Police are appealing for help to identify an individual in connection with a robbery in Bury St Edmunds.

It happened on Thursday 28 June just after 11pm when a man aged in his 70s was robbed of his money. The victim remains in hospital for treatment with broken pelvis and broken ribs.

Officers have released CCTV images of a man they would like to speak to in connection with the incident.

It is not exactly clear where the attack took place but possibly in the alley from Kings Road in Bury St Edmunds to Waitrose car park. CCTV shows the victim meeting a man near to shops in Arc shopping centre a few minutes before the attack. The victim followed this man into the alleyway.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has knowledge of it should contact Bury St Edmunds CID on 101 quoting crime reference 37/35956/18. Alternatively, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555111 or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
