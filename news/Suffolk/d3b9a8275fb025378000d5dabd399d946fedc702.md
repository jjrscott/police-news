Police have arrested three men as part of the proactive work to tackle the supply of drugs in the Lowestoft area.

Last Wednesday, 18 January, plain clothed officers from the East Scorpion team were conducting proactive patrols in the area of Blackheath Road in Kirkley and became aware of three men acting suspiciously.

An 18-year-old man from Carlton Colville and a 19-year-old man from Lowestoft were arrested on suspicion of possession of a Class B drug with intent to supply.

They have been released on police bail pending further enquiries and are due to return to Great Yarmouth Police Investigation Centre on Wednesday 1 March.

A 27-year-old man from Lowestoft has also this morning, 23 January, been arrested on suspicion of supplying a controlled drug. He has been taken into custody where he will be interviewed.

Officers would urge anyone with information about those involved in drug dealing or who witness any suspicious activity to contact Suffolk Police on **101**.
