Police are appealing for witnesses to an incident of attempted burglary that took place in Ipswich.

It happened yesterday (Monday 12 March) at 6.15am when the occupant heard noise coming from the rear of his property on Bramford Lane.

The occupier went out into the enclosed yard/garden to see a male in a light grey tracksuit jumping over his fence into his neighbour's garden. He then realised his window has been opened with an unknown instrument with damage caused to the kitchen door. Entry had not been gained to the property and nothing was stolen.

The suspect is described as a white male, in his mid 30s, of stocky build, five foot, six inches to five foot seven inches tall. He was wearing a light grey tracksuit with the hood up. There were no logos, patterns or motifs on the tracksuit and he was also wearing light grey tracksuit bottoms.

Anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in relation to the activity should contact Ipswich CID, quoting crime reference 37/13455/18 or alternatively contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
