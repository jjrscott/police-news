Police have released CCTV images of a woman they would like to speak to after a purse was stolen and the bank card was then used to withdraw cash.

It is thought the purse was removed from a handbag at an address on Hospital Road in Bury St Edmunds, sometime between 7:45am and 1pm on Monday 23 May this year.

The victim received a phone call from a person claiming to be from her bank and was asked to verify her Personal Identification Number (PIN). Cash was then withdrawn from the victimâ€™s current and savings account at a bank in Ipswich.

Police are urging people not to give personal and bank details over the phone to unknown callers, particularly never your PIN number as a legitimate organisation would never ask for this. If you receive a call of this nature, please hang up immediately.

Officers are keen to speak to the woman pictured. Do you recognise her? Anyone with information about who she is should call Suffolk Police on **101** quoting reference 34978/16. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on **0800 555 111** or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
