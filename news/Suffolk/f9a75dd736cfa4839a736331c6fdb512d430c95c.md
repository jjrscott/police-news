Police are appealing for witnesses to two incidents of high value farming equipment being stolen in mid Suffolk.

The first incident took place at a farm at Framsden that took place at some point between Tuesday 7 July and Monday 13 July. A ‘Star Fir 2630’ GPS receiver unit and the in-cab display were stolen from a combine harvester that was stored in a barn.

A second incident took place between Friday 10 July at 6pm and Saturday 11 July at 6.30am from a farm in Elmswell. The offenders entered the yard containing numerous farming machines and tractors and combine harvester and drilled the lock out of five vehicles stealing the GPS systems. The value stolen in this incident is estimated be in the region of £100,000
