Officers are appealing for witnesses following a robbery on the outskirts of Elmswell.

The incident took place in a layby on the A1088 Norton Road, just north of the Elmswell roundabout, close to junction 47 of the A14.

On Thursday 23 November at around 10.40pm two men approached a mobile food takeaway van and turned the generator off, causing the power to go off. One man attempted to enter the van and a fight then broke out between the suspect and the business owner. The second man then approached the victim holding what is described as a large pole or bat. The victim managed to run off and flagged down a passing motorist who assisted. A till containing a quantity of cash was stolen from the van.

The victim sustained minor cuts to his hand.

Witnesses, especially those that might have dash-camera footage, who passed the location between 10.30pm and 11.00pm or anybody who has any information are asked to contact West CID on 101 quoting reference 75482/17.
