Police are appealing for witnesses after a large number of straw bales were deliberately set alight.

Officers were called by the fire service at 1.50am this morning, Thursday 18 August, reporting the incident which occurred in a field close to the A134 between Ingham and Barnham, just prior to the turn-off for Rymer Point.

Two stacks of bales around 500 yards apart were set alight, along with a trailer also containing bales. It is estimated that over 1000 tonnes of straw has been destroyed.

Anyone with information about this crime is asked to contact the Bury St Edmunds Neighbourhood Response Team on **101** quoting reference 50602/16, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
