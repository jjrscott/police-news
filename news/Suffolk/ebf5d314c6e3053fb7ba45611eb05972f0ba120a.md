Police are appealing for help to trace two men officers want to speak to in connection with an incident of theft from a motor vehicle.

It happened at some point between Saturday 25 July at 7.30pm and Sunday 26 July at 7.15am on Cow Green at Bacton.

A wallet was taken from an Audi Q7 vehicle along with an i-pod that had great sentimental value for the victim with the words ‘To my valentine’ inscribed on the back.

A total of £300 was taken from the victim’s account with 10 transactions registered on 26 July at various locations using a credit card from within the wallet that was stolen.

Anyone who recognises the males depicted in the stills should contact Suffolk Constabulary on 101, quoting crime reference 37/41971/18. Alternatively contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
