Owners of drones are being reminded of the laws and restrictions surrounding their hobby.

Following concerns being raised by residents living near Trinity Park in Ipswich, of drones being flown over residential properties for extended periods, Suffolk Constabulary is encouraging those with drones to consult the Civil Aviation Authority’s ‘Drone Code’.

The guide outlines the what is and isn’t allowed, which, if not adhered to, can lead to criminal prosecution.

The guide can be viewed at www.dronesafe.uk/drone-code.

For further details please visit www.caa.co.uk/Consumers/Unmanned-aircraft-and-drones/.

In addition to the Drone Code, no-fly zones can be viewed at www.noflydrones.co.uk, which includes exclusion zones near to airfields and military bases.
