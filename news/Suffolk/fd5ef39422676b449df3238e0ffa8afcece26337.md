Police are appealing for witnesses after a burglary at a convenience shop in Melton.

Officers were called at 12.10am this morning, Thursday 15 February, to reports of a burglary in progress at McCollâ€™s in The Street.

Police units were at the scene just over five minutes later and discovered the front door had been smashed to gain entry and a quantity of cigarettes and alcohol stolen from inside.

The offenders were witnessed making off in a Volkswagen Golf estate, and a vehicle matching this description was encountered by officers on Ipswich Road in Woodbridge at around 12.15am. This vehicle failed to stop for officers and a pursuit ensued, but it evaded capture.

It was then sighted again in the Levington Road area of Ipswich a short while later, before police received a call from the fire service at 2am stating they were in attendance at a car fire in Downham Boulevard, Ipswich, involving what is believed to have been the suspect vehicle.

Any witnesses to either the burglary in Melton or the car being set alight in Ipswich, are asked to contact South CID at Landmark House on 101 quoting reference 8783/18, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
