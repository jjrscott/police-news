Police conducting enquiries into the death of a 52 year old woman from Beyton are now satisfied that there is no indication of suspicious circumstances surrounding the incident.

Julie Feetham died in hospital on Tuesday 14 November 2017 after police were called to a property on Thurston Road in Beyton after reports she had sustained serious injuries.

A Home Office post mortem examination concluded that Julie Feetham died as a result of the effects of a traumatic head injury.

A 55 year old man, initially arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm and released under investigation will no longer face any police action in connection with the incident. A file will now be prepared for submission to the coroner and an inquest will be held in due course.
