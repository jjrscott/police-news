Two people were arrested and over 30 vehicles checked during a multi-agency operation targeting the carriage of dangerous goods in south Suffolk this week.

On Monday 5 November, officers from the Roads and Armed Policing Team deployed along the A12, A14 and other strategic roads, escorting 34 vehicles back to a check site at the Tesco truck stop in Copdock, 27 of which were carrying hazardous materials.

Suffolk Police worked with the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) and HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to enforce legislation around carrying dangerous goods (CDG) such as clinical waste, which has the potential to be used by terrorist organisations to produce explosives.

Only 10 vehicles left the site clear of any offences, with a full breakdown of the results as follows:

 * Two men were arrested on suspicion of drug driving
 * Eight CDG prohibitions were issued; nine CDG offences committed; and 15 CGD advisory notices issued
 * One driver hours prohibition was issued; and one failed to pay road levy
 * 17 Traffic Offence Reports were issued as follows: four for no seatbelt; three vehicles in a dangerous condition; two each for insecure loads and driving while using a mobile phone; and one each for no MOT, defective brakes, illegal use of trade plates, contravening a red traffic light, tachograph excess driver hours, and excess vehicle length
 * Six people were breathalysed, which were all negative

 * The DVSA issued three immediate prohibitions, five delayed prohibitions and 13 advisory notices

 * HMRC challenged 29 vehicles checking for illegal fuel and no offences were found

Sgt Julian Ditcham, of the Roads and Armed Policing Team, said: “The purpose of this operation was to both enforce the legislation relevant to vehicles carrying dangerous goods and to raise awareness of how vitally important it is that the law is adhered to.

“Transporting material which is either itself explosive, or has the potential to be used in creating an explosive device, is by its very nature a hazardous process, and so it is disappointing that 24 of the 34 vehicles we brought back to the check site were found to have been committing offences.

“This demonstrates the importance of the operation, which is one of many roads and armed policing days of action we hold regularly throughout the year, helping to make our roads safer for all users.”
