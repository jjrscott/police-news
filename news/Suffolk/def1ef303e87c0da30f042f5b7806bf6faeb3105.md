Police are urging residents to review the security of their sheds, garages and outbuildings following a number of burglaries in the Lowestoft area over recent weeks.

At some point between Wednesday 30 September and Friday 2 October, offenders gained access to a shed at a property in Oxford Road in Lowestoft, and a bag of fishing equipment and a battery drill were stolen. (37/57572/20).

Sometime between Tuesday 29 September at 7.30pm and Wednesday 30 September at 7.40am a shed at a home in Spurgeon Score was broken into. A padlock from the door was taken; nothing was stolen from inside. (37/56933/20).

Between Monday 28 September at 6pm and Tuesday 29 September at 1.30pm, someone attempted to break in to a shed at a home in Blackheath Road. No entry was gained to the shed however the lock was damaged (37/56939/20)

The following steps will help to ensure that your shed and contents stay secure:

-Fittings should be bolted through the door and reinforced at the back with a steel plate or washer; hasps should have concealed screws.

-Fit good locks to all doors. Padlocks should be at least 6cm/2.5 ins wide, hardened steel, have at least 5 pins and be closed shackle.

-Make sure that the shed is in good condition. Weaknesses such as rotten wood or holes in the doors or windows will be an easy access point for a burglar, even if there are good locks on the doors.

-Consider fitting an alarm or investigating if your house alarm can be extended to cover the sheds/garage.

-Secure items within the shed. Lock items to each other with a quality lock or secure them to a fixed point in the floor.

-Make sure that the boundary fence is in good order, at least six-foot-high and check that gates are locked.

-Use dusk to dawn security lights around the shed.

-Security mark property and register it on www.immobilise.com.
