Police are appealing for witnesses following an assault in Ipswich.

On Sunday 10 December, just after midnight, a man and a woman were walking along Foundry Lane, when they were assaulted by two men.

The offenders walked past the two victims, then turned and punched the man in the face.

The man was knocked to the ground unconscious and sustained a serious head injury. The woman was also punched by one of the offenders, causing a bruise and swelling.

The East of England Ambulance Service attended and the injured male victim was taken to Ipswich Hospital.

The two offenders are described as two men, one about 6 feet tall and the other about 5 feet 10 inches tall. Both men were in their 30s with tanned complexions and were wearing dark clothes with their hoods up.

Police would be interested in hearing from anyone who may have witnessed the incident, or seen or heard anyone acting suspiciously in the Foundry Lane area at the time of the offence, from late Saturday evening into the early hours of Sunday morning.

Anyone with any information should contact South CID at Landmark House on 101, quoting crime number 37/78531/17.
