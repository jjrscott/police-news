A quantity of cigarettes were stolen following a burglary at a convenience store in Debenham.

Police were called just after 11pm last night, Thursday 1 February, following an alarm activation at the Co-op in Chancery Lane.

Officers arrived at the scene a short while later to discover that glass in the front door had been smashed to gain entry and a number of cigarettes stolen from inside. It is believed that three men broke into the shop and made off in a vehicle.

Just after 11.15pm police received a call reporting a collision in Earl Soham, at the junction of the A1120 at Mill Hill, Low Road and The Street, where a black Ford Focus had gone across the junction into a hedge.

The car then drove through the hedge and around the garden behind before colliding with a nearby building. Three men were seen to exit the vehicle and walk towards Brandeston Road, carrying a large bag.

On police arrival officers discovered cigarette packets in the car and following a search of the area, a police dog unit located a large bag of cigarettes in a bush near to the Victoria public house at around 12.30am. However, the suspects were not located.

Any witnesses to either the burglary in Debenham or the collision in Earl Soham are asked to contact East CID at Lowestoft Police Station on 101 quoting reference 6290/18, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
