Police are appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Newmarket this week.

The incident occurred at around 8.45pm on Monday 28 August, along the Yellow Brick Road pathway, where a man and a woman who were out walking their dog were approached by a man who threatened them with a hammer and demanded money.

The victims said they did not have any money, so the suspect then stole a bumbag from the woman, which contained items for their dog. He then ran off through the gate leading to Bill Rickaby Drive.

The suspect is described as white, aged in his late 20s to early 30s, around 5ft 6in tall, with dark hair and a thin moustache. He was wearing a white shirt and blue jeans.

Any witnesses, or anyone with information about this incident, is asked to contact West CID at Bury St Edmunds Police Station on **101** quoting reference 57502/17, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
