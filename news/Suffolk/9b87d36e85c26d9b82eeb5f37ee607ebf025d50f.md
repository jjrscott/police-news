Police are issuing an image of a man they would like to speak to in connection with an assault in Newmarket.

The incident occurred at around 10.40am on Friday 23 February on the Number 11 bus as it pulled into the Guineas Shopping Centre.

The victim – a man aged in his 70s – was assaulted by another man who punched him on the chin and also threw several other punches which did not connect properly. The victim did not sustain any injuries as a result of this attack.

The victim and the suspect had boarded the bus at Bury St Edmunds bus station, where they had been involved in a verbal disagreement.

Police would like to speak to the man pictured in the image about this incident. He is described as white, 5ft 11in tall, of medium build and balding. He was wearing a padded coat, dark green chords and was carrying a green cloth carrier bag.
