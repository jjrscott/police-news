A woman has sustained serious injuries following a collision at West Suffolk Hospital.

Police were called by the Ambulance Service at 10.30am this morning, Friday 24 November, to reports of a collision between a car and a female pedestrian within the grounds of the hospital.

The woman, who is aged in her 70s, has sustained potentially life-threatening injuries and is currently receiving treatment at the hospital.

The area where the collision occurred has been closed off whilst an investigation takes place and so there are currently some traffic restrictions in place at the site, but people can still access the hospital and will be directed where necessary.

Any witnesses to the incident are asked to contact the Serious Collision Investigation Team on 101 quoting reference CAD 128 of 24 November.
