Police are appealing for witnesses following a burglary at a home in Brandon.

The break-in took place at an address in the vicinity of St Benedicts Road. At approximately 9pm on Wednesday 26 April, the victim heard voices to the rear of the property. She called out but didn’t hear anything more.

The following morning, around 7:50am, a window was discovered as forced open. It is thought the suspects may have been deterred from entering the property further after hearing the victim’s voice as nothing appears to have been taken.

Witnesses or anyone who may have heard anything suspicious is urged to come forward. Anyone with information should contact Suffolk Police on 101 quoting reference 31516/17, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Police are also reminding residents to keep all doors and windows secured at night, and to keep gates locked using a study lock such as a closed shackle padlock.
