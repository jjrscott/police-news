Police investigating two break-in incidents at Ipswich Town Football Club are appealing for witnesses.

Officers were called on Monday 9 October to reports that unknown suspects had gained access to the grounds in Portman Road.

Entry was forced at some point between 7:45pm on Saturday 7 and 6:20am on Sunday 8 October and a quantity of food and drink was stolen. A desktop computer and laptop are also believed to have been stolen.

Police would like to identify two people, believed to be males, seen in the Portman Road carpark between 6:20am and 6:50am on Sunday 8 October and speak to them in connection with the incident.

The first suspect is described as white with dark hair, who was wearing a black Adidas jacket with three stripes on the arm, grey trousers, and carrying a black Adidas rucksack.

The second suspect is described as white, of skinny build and was wearing a blue jacket with a black hoodie underneath – which was worn up – and grey trousers.

This incident is believed to be linked to a second break-in on Tuesday 10 October, in which two plasma TV screens and alcohol have been confirmed as stolen. Access was gained to the premises at some point between 9:10pm and 10:30pm.

Anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity during the times stated or has knowledge of either incident should contact Suffolk Police on 101, quoting crime reference 67021/17 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
