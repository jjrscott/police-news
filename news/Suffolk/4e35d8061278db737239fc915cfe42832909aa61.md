Police are investigating following an aggravated burglary at a shop in Bury St Edmunds last night.

Officers were alerted around 8.45pm yesterday, Sunday 23 October, to reports that two men had gone into the Co-Op shop in Out Risbygate. One jumped over the counter, and staff managed to get to safety in a back room, while the other man stood near the door of the premises. He appeared to be armed with a knife.

Two cash boxes were stolen from the property and the two men fled.

The two members of staff – a man and a woman – in the premises at the time were not threatened or hurt in the incident.

Both men are described as white, around 5ft 10ins and wearing tracksuit-style clothing.

One wore a black beanie-style hat with three stripes, a black jacket, blue gloves, grey jogging bottoms with dark stripes along the sides and white trainers.

The other was slightly shorter and of heavier build than the first and also wore a black beanie-style hat, a black and white checked scarf, a black jacket with a white logo on the chest, grey jogging bottoms with dark zips on the side, dark gloves and black shoes or trainers.

CCTV images have been released showing the men’s clothing.

Police are asking anyone who was in the area around this time to come forward and detectives are keen to speak to anyone who may have information about the incident or those involved.
