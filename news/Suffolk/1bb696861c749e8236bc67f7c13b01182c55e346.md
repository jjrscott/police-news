Police are appealing for witnesses following an armed robbery at a business premises in Maidenhall Green, Ipswich.

Officers were called shortly after 8pm on Wednesday 13th December 2017 after two men entered the premises and threatened staff with a handgun before making off with money from the till.

One suspect is described as wearing black tracksuit trousers, a blue zipped hooded top with another black hooded top underneath this, and a pair of black leather gloves.

The second suspect wore a black hooded coat, black tracksuit trousers and white trainers.

Both men are thought to be about 5’7” – 5’9” in height and both were wearing scarves.

Anyone with information about this incident should ring police on 101, quoting CAD 351.
