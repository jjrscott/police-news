Police have arrested two people after officers located a cannabis factory in Southwold.

The arrests were made after a warrant was executed under the Misuse of Drugs Act at a flat on Station Road in the town yesterday morning (Wednesday 13 March). On entering the property officers found the second floor contained 145 cannabis plants, a large amount of hydroponics equipment and associated paraphernalia. The estimated value of the find was about Â£100,000.

A 31 year old man and a 30 year old woman were arrested at the scene by officers from East Scorpion drugs team both on suspicion of production of cannabis and abstracting electricity.

They were both taken to Great Yarmouth Police Investigation Centre for questioning. They were later released under investigation pending further enquiries.
