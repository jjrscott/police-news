Police are appealing for witnesses and information following a distraction burglary in Pakefield.

Officers were called to an address in London Road following reports that a man had tapped on the window at the home of an elderly woman. The incident is believed to have taken place between 12.30pm and 1pm on Monday 16 April.

When the victim opened the door the man said he "was doing something next door and wanted £10”. The man was allowed entry into the house while the victim took £10 from her purse. After a short time the suspect left, which is when the victim noticed her purse was missing.
If you saw any suspicious activity in the area or if you have any information which may help with inquiries, please contact East CID at Suffolk Police on 101, quoting crime reference number 37/20471/18.
Advice on how to deal with cold callers and how to keep yourself safe at home can also be found on the ‘advice’ pages on the Suffolk Police webpage http://www.suffolk.police.uk/advice/crime-prevention-z
How to deal with cold callers
• Always ask for identification from any unexpected callers and do not let anyone in if you are not comfortable with who they are and verify their identity with the company they work for.

• Always use the chain and viewer on your door to see who is calling. Only open the door if you feel comfortable and always keep the chain on.

• Councils and utility companies will generally contact householders by telephone or letter if they plan to carry out repairs rather than make unsolicited calls.

• If you have a back gate ensure that it is locked with a padlock. A slide bolt is not sufficient on its own.

• Ensure that your doors are kept locked when you are in the house.

• If you need carers or family to have access then consider fitting a key safe on the outside wall near to the front door.

• If anyone calls claiming to be from the utility companies such as water, gas, electricity or the council, do not let them in unless they can quote to you on the doorstep your personal account number which is found on your bills. If you are at all suspicious then phone the police immediately.

Please report anything suspicious as soon as possible to police on 101.
