A 16-year-old boy has been remanded in custody today after breaking a Criminal Behaviour Order.

The boy was given a CBO on 15 June which banned him from entering the borough of Ipswich for 18 months unless under the supervision of a parent/foster carer. The CBO also banned him from being in possession of any motorised vehicle in a public place unless he is the legal owner, that he is legally entitled to drive and that the vehicle is registered with the DVLA, with road tax and insurance, and not to associate with three named individuals.

The teenager, who canâ€™t be named because of his age, appeared at Ipswich Magistrates Court today Wednesday 5 July.

The boy has been remanded into youth custody and is due to appear at Ipswich Youth Court on 13 July.
