More than 50 wraps of Class A drugs were seized and two people were arrested in Haverhill yesterday, Wednesday 27 June.

Officers from the Haverhill Neighbourhood Response Team carried out a warrant under Section 23 of the Misuse of Drugs Act and discovered suspected Class A drugs, an amount of cash and a number of mobile phones, among other items, in a property in the vicinity of Chalkstone Way as part of Operation Velocity.

A 30-year-old woman and a 36-year-old man, both from Haverhill, were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs and for money laundering. The man and the woman were taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre for questioning and were later released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Velocity is the operational name given to the co-ordinated enforcement activity across the three policing areas in Suffolk to identify and arrest drug dealers and support the vulnerable/young people who are exploited and harmed by drug supply and dealing.
