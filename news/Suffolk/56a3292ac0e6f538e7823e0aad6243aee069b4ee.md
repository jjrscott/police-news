Police are appealing for witnesses or information following an indecent exposure in Felixstowe.

The incident occurred at approximately 5.45pm on Friday 19 February in Beatrice Avenue.

The victim, a woman aged in her 40s, was walking along Beatrice Avenue when she noticed a male walking towards her in the distance. When the woman was about four or five metres away from the male, he indecently exposed himself and carried out a lewd act.

The woman continued to walk away but then turned around and noticed the male appeared to be following her. However, when she reached the end of Beatrice Avenue, the woman turned around again and the male was not there.

The suspect is described as male, white, of slim build, aged approximately in his late teens or early 20s and with fair hair. He was wearing light grey jogging bottoms, a dark top and a hooded jumper/coat with the hood up.

Police would be interested in hearing from anyone who could identify the male or who witnessed the incident or who has any CCTV or dashcam footage from the area at around the time of the incident.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has knowledge of the suspect should contact Suffolk police, quoting crime number: 37/8454/21
