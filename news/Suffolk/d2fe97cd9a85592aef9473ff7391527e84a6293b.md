Police are appealing for witnesses to a burglary that took place in Bury St Edmunds.

It happened at some point between 3pm on Sunday 2 December and 1.45pm on Sunday 9 December on Raedwald Drive. The unknown offenders entered a secured and unoccupied property by smashing the glass pane on a conservatory door to the rear of the dwelling and entered via conservatory. An untidy search of the bedrooms on the first floor had taken place with jewellery stolen from the bedrooms.

Any witnesses to the incident, anybody with information or persons who were in the area is asked to contact Bury St Edmunds CID at Landmark House on 101 quoting crime reference 37/71193/18

Alternatively contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
