Residents living along the Suffolk coast south of Lowestoft are being advised that it is now safe to return to their homes – with the exception of the Snape area – following earlier flood warnings.

The Environment Agency has given guidance that it is now safe to return to homes south of Lowestoft, with the exception of Snape where the tide is still due to arrive around 1.30am today, Saturday 14 January.

It is thought that residents in Snape who have evacuated will be safe to return to their homes by 2.30am if they wish to, and it is safe to do so.

Please be advised that there are still some road closures in place in the Southwold area and residents need to be aware of this if they wish to return home immediately.

Rest centres in Snape and Leiston will remain open until it is safe for all residents to return.

There is flooding in some coastal areas, with some premises affected along the east coast, however the extent of the flooding was not as bad as may have been.

Suffolk Police would like to thank all residents, volunteers and partner agencies for their support in ensuring that the flood risks were minimised during a period of uncertainty this afternoon and evening.

Suffolk Resilience Forum have been co-ordinating the multi-agency response to the potential threat from flooding, with all agencies involved working to safeguard residents in the county.

## Previous release - Flood Warning 13 January 2017 10am

With severe weather expected to continue in the Lowestoft and Waveney area overnight, it is important that there is a consistent message reaching all affected communities. The Suffolk Resilience Forum is urging residents and businesses in coastal areas of Suffolk to be prepared and remain vigilant over the next 48 hours.

Emergency services, local councils and other partner agencies continue to work together to support vulnerable communities during the bad weather and discussions are already taking place to help prepare for conditions after the weather passes.

Around 1,800 properties may be affected by flooding in East Suffolk. The evacuation of homes, businesses and other properties is well underway and advice has been issued to residents and businesses.

From around 9.30pm tonight there is potential severe flooding in the following areas:

* Aldeburgh and Thorpeness

* Lowestoft seafront and docks

* North bank of Lake Lothing

* Oulton Broad near Mutford Lock

* Snape, Iken and surrounding marshland

* Southwold and surrounding marshes

Warnings have also been given to residents and businesses;

* On the south bank of Lake Lothing

* At the Riverside Business Park in Kirkley

* In and around the Blythburgh and Blythburgh marshes area

Whilst there remains no large scale evacuation planned in these three areas, residents and businesses may wish to take steps to protect their property and to self-evacuate if they wish to do so.

Rest centres are welcoming residents at the following locations with coach pick up points running for those residents without transport

* Leiston Leisure Centre Red House Lane, Leiston IP16 4LS

* Water Lane Leisure Centre, Water Lane, Lowestoft NR32 2NH

At this point, it is understood that Highways England have no plans to close either the Orwell Bridge in Ipswich or the Bascule Bridge in Lowestoft. For the latest update on this, stay tuned to local media and the Highways England East Twitter account @HighwaysEAST

Flood warnings remain in place following afternoon high tides in the Felixstowe area. It appears as though the community was thankfully affected less than predicted but people are urged to remain vigilant throughout the remainder of today and into tomorrow as the next high tide is due around midnight tonight at Felixstowe. Vulnerable locations that remain at the greatest risk of flooding are:

* Felixstowe Ferry and Bawdsey Quay

* Felixstowe Ferry Hamlet and the Deben Marshes

* Isolated riverside properties on the Deben Estuary

* Tidal Orwell at Ipswich Quay

The rest centre at Brackenbury Sports Centre in Felixstowe will close at 7pm as the severity of the weather begins to ease.

The following advice is offered for those people preparing for evacuation:

o Stay calm and do not panic.

o Police officers and / or other officials will try to visit all properties at risk to advise on the requirement to evacuate.

o If road conditions permit, move vehicles to unaffected areas; for example higher ground, and ask friends / family if you can share their parking facilities.

o You will be given details about your evacuation point for transport and the location of the reception centre either verbally or by a leaflet.

o Try to check that any elderly / vulnerable family members or neighbours know about the evacuation.

o Try to inform family members / friends as to where you are evacuating.

o Listen to the advice of the authorities and follow any instructions to leave the property.

o Take special foods and medicines with you.

o Switch off gas and electricity.

o If possible, move electrical equipment and furniture upstairs.

o Any furniture that you cannot move upstairs, try to raise well off the floor.

o Lock all doors and windows.

o Block doorways and air bricks - sandbags are not available via local authorities

o Avoid walking and driving through floodwater, there could be hidden hazards.

Residents in the areas likely to be affected are advised to check advice from the Environment Agency on preparing your property for flooding:http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/floods/31644.aspx and take all necessary steps. People can also find out more information by calling the Environment Agency's Floodline on 0845 988 1188.

Superintendent Kerry Cutler, of Suffolk Constabulary said: "We expect the worst of the weather to be in the Lowestoft and Waveney area this evening and we continue to work with agencies both locally, regionally and nationally, with teams out on the ground talking to residents that are likely to be affected. We would continue to ask that you monitor local media and the Environment Agency website to ensure you keep up to date with any developments.

"Rest centres have been established in the county and people in those areas are encouraged to find alternative accommodation outside of the affected areas or to make their way to the nearest rest centre well in advance of the high tide times.

"We would urge anyone who may be currently considering going to the coast to watch the tidal surge, not to do this. This would be incredibly dangerous not only for those people but also as it may cause disruption and delay for emergency response teams and vehicles who are supporting local communities in these areas."
