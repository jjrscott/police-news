Police have arrested a 12-year-old boy in connection with an assault in Stowmarket.

The incident took place at some point between 6:30pm and 7:15pm on Friday 19 May at the Recreation Ground.

A man in his late teens was walking through the park when he was approached by a boy who, following a brief exchange, was reported to have threatened the man with a knife. It was also alleged that the boy punched the victim in the face before kicking him to the ground.

The victim managed to free himself from the attack and police were called.

A 12-year-old boy was arrested on Monday, 22 May, and taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre where he was interviewed by officers. He has since been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Witnesses or anyone with information is asked to contact Suffolk Police on 101 quoting reference 36169/17.
