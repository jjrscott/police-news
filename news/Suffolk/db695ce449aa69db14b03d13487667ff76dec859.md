Police are appealing for witnesses to an incident in Halesworth.

It took place on Wednesday 17 February at about 6.30pm on Fen Meadow where a woman in her 60s was assaulted after an altercation between two dogs.

The woman was walking her dog when it was attacked by another dog reportedly off the lead. The victim managed to get the two dogs apart when the male owner of the second dog approached her and accused her of hitting his dog. He pushed her over and was verbally abusive to her. She sustained a sore neck but no injuries.

The male is described as in his 30s, was wearing dark clothing and had with him a Tibetan terrier/cocker-poo style dog that was caramel in colour.

Anyone who saw any suspicious activity or knows who the offender was should contact Suffolk police, quoting crime number 37/8402/21.
