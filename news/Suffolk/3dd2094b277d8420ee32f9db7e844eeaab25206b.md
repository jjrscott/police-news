A 23-year-old man has been charged in connection with two burglaries that took place in Ipswich over the weekend.

The first incident occurred between 4.30pm on Friday 13 July and 8am on Saturday 14 July at an address in All Saints Road.

A front window was forced open to gain entry to the property and a set of keys for a vehicle were stolen. The keys were then used to steal the vehicle which was parked on the street nearby.

A second incident took place around midnight on Saturday 14 July at an address in Kensington Road.

An insecure front door was used to gain entry to the property and a set of keys were stolen from inside. An attempt was made to start a vehicle parked nearby, but the offender(s) were disturbed by the victim.

Thomas Lee, of no fixed address, was arrested by officers investigating these crimes on Sunday 15 July and taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning.

Lee has subsequently been charged with two counts of burglary, for attempted theft of a motor vehicle, theft of motor vehicle, driving whilst disqualified, failing to provide a specimen, for driving with no insurance and for making off without payment for fuel.

Lee appeared before Ipswich Magistrates' Court today, Tuesday 17 July and was remanded to appear before Ipswich Crown Court on a date to be arranged.
