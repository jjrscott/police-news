Police appealing for witnesses to a burglary that took place in Bury St Edmunds are linking it to a robbery in Lynford.

It happened on Thursday 12 July at some point between 9.10am and 12.20pm at a property on Eyre Close. The female victim, aged in her 30s, came back home to find numerous items of jewellery, along with a toaster, kettle and scuba diving gear had been taken and the back door to the property had been left insecure.

It is being linked to a robbery that took place on the dog walking paths near to the Lynford Hall Hotel in Lynford in Norfolk. One the same day, earlier on at about 9.10am to 9.30am the same female victim has been walking her dog when a male pushed past her and took her handbag which contained house keys and a quantity of cash. It is believed the keys from the robbery have then been used to commit the burglary.

The male is described as white with a very slim build, about 5 foot 8 inches tall to foot 9 inches tall. He had what is described as a big nose, acne and blotchy cheeks. He was wearing baggy navy tracksuit bottoms with a white stripe running down the legs and a dark blue zip up hoodie with its hood up.

Anyone with information to either incident should contact police on 101 and quote crime reference 37/38997/18 for the burglary and 36/42453/18 for the robbery. Alternatively, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
