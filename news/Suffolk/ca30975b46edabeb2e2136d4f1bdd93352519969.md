Police are appealing for information after six sheep were found injured in a field in Bredfield, near Woodbridge.

Six rare breed Norfolk Horn sheep were found on Monday 28 November with injuries which appear to be consistent with a dog attack. All have survived, having sustained minor cuts, abrasions and bruising.

An Alsatian dog was seen worrying sheep that morning, around 8:30am, and police are appealing for public support to trace the owner.

The dog is thought to be a short-haired breed and was not wearing a collar.

Anyone who may have seen anything, or who believes they may know the owner of the dog, is urged to contact the south area Neighbourhood Support Team by dialling Suffolk Police on **101** quoting reference 68963/16.

Police are also reminding dog owners that they are responsible for keeping their pets under control and are asking anyone who sees a dog attacking sheep to call police immediately. In an emergency, or if a crime is in progress, always dial 999.
