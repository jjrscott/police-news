Lowestoft Safer Neighbourhood Team is holding a community engagement event on Friday 2 December at the Britten Centre in Lowestoft , between 10am and 1pm.

Local residents and shoppers are invited to come along to speak to their local team of officers, ask questions about crime prevention and find out more about crime reduction over the winter months and in the run up to Christmas.

Police officers from the Community Safety and Domestic Abuse teams will be in attendance, along with Neighbourhood Watch representatives.
