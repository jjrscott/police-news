Detectives in Lowestoft are appealing for information after a robbery at a home in the town this morning where a woman was held down and a ring stolen from her hand.

The incident happened at an address in Princes Walk/ Normanston Drive area around 10.15am today, Wednesday 10 May.

The older lady was in her bedroom when she heard a noise and called out as she was expecting a relative. She then found a man in her home. The man made her sit down and then tried to pull her rings off her fingers. He then demanded money before leaving the home with a small amount of cash and jewellery including a diamond ring taken from her hand and gold chains.

The resident then went to a neighbour who made a 999 call to police. The woman has been left extremely distressed by the incident.

The offender is described as white and may have been wearing a camel-coloured hooded top.

Police are asking anyone who may have been in the area around 9.30am â€“ 10.30am this morning to come forward if you saw anything suspicious or if you have any information about the man involved.

Officers would also like to hear from you if you have been offered rings or gold chains for sale today.

Anyone who can help is asked to contact Lowestoft CID by dialling Suffolk Police on **101** and quoting crime number 34204/17.
