Officers are appealing for witnesses following the theft of a motorcycle and an incident of criminal damage to a van in Beccles.

Both incidents took place in Coxâ€™s Close. A blue and white Yamaha TT 600R motorcycle was stolen sometime between 11pm on Sunday 15 January and 7.10am on Monday 16 January.

At some point between 5.30pm on Monday 16 January and 10.50am on Tuesday 17 January an attempt was made to force entry to a black Peugeot van and as a result the paintwork was damaged.

Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on **0800 555 111** or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
