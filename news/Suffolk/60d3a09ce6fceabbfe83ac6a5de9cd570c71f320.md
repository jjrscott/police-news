Police investigating the theft of charity boxes in the Ipswich and Felixstowe area have charged a 44 year-old-woman in connection with the incidents.

The thefts took place at licensed premises in: High Road, Trimley St Martin (near High Hall Close); High Road, Trimley St Martin (near Thurmans Lane); High Street, Felixstowe (near the junction of Maidstone Road); The Street, Tuddenham; and in the vicinity of The Square, Martlesham.

Michelle Burrows, of Kemball Street Ipswich, was arrested on Sunday 29 January and charged with six counts of theft of charity collection boxes, containing an unknown amount of cash between Saturday 7 and Friday 20 January.

She has been released on police bail and is due to appear before Ipswich Magistrates Court on Monday 13 February.

Police are urging businesses that display charity boxes to remain vigilant and keep them secure, where possible, with something that is difficult to cut, such as a metal chain, to deter thieves and minimise the risk of becoming a victim of crime.
