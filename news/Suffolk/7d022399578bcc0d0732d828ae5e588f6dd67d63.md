Police are appealing for witnesses following a number of reports of indecent exposure in Bury St Edmunds.

An incident occurred on Symonds Road on Thursday 29 March when a man indecently exposed himself to a small group of teenage girls.

On Sunday 22 April between 3pm and 4pm a man with a pushbike walked past a teenage girl on Jermyn Avenue and indecently exposed himself. On the same day, a man exposed himself to a group of girls on Mead Road.

A fourth incident occurred on Thursday 3 May at 4.15pm on Airfield Road when a man exposed himself to two girls and swerved towards them as he passed them on a black and white bike with three stripes.

Police are looking at the possibility that these offences are linked, and the offender is described as a man of possibly mixed race or with a tanned complexion. He has short dark brown hair, aged in his late 20s or early 30s. He is described as of average build, wearing black trainers and possibly a black backpack. He was riding a black and white pushbike with stripes.

Officers would like to hear from anyone with information that could assist the investigation, or who has seen anyone matching this description acting suspiciously in these areas at the times of these offences.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact Suffolk Police on 101, quoting crime reference numbers 37/21672/18 and 37/21684/18.
