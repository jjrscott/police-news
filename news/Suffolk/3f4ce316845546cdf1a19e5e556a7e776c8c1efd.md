Two people have been arrested in connection with drug offences following a pre-planned operation in Lowestoft.

Approximately 40 officers from across the force including the scorpion and sentinel teams, CID, and the Safer Neighbourhood and Response Teams, among others, executed search warrants at three addresses within the town shortly after 8.30am yesterday morning, Tuesday 4 August.

Following the warrants, two males, aged 20 and 18, were arrested and taken to Great Yarmouth Police Investigation Centre for questioning.

Officers carried out searches and a number of items were seized including approximately £2k in cash, cannabis and associated paraphernalia.

The 20-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply – Class A, being concerned in the supply of controlled drugs, possession of Class B or C drugs and driving without a licence, relating to three separate occasions.

The 18-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of controlled drugs and possession with intent to supply – Class A.

The two males were subsequently released on bail and are due to return to police on Monday 31 August.

Sergeant Mark Cotton of the East Scorpion Team, said: “Yesterday’s warrants and subsequent arrests have taken place after a period of investigation by my team of specialist officers.

“The supply of drugs and the harm they can cause to vulnerable people is a priority for us and we remain committed to targeting offenders and disrupting criminal activity.”

Officers are continuing to work with partner agencies to tackle drug dealing and associated criminality in the Lowestoft area.

Anyone concerned about drug-related activity in their neighbourhood should contact police on 101.
