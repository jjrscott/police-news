Police are appealing for information after a dog was found deceased following a burglary in Ipswich.

The break-in occurred at some point between 8:30pm and 10:30pm on Friday 21 July at a home address in Norwich Road, near the junction with Springfield Lane.

It is believed that garden ornaments were thrown through a window to gain access to the rear of the property and appears to have struck the dog.

A search of the home was then made and items stolen include a beige-coloured suede ladies handbag.

Anyone with information should contact Suffolk Police on **101** quoting reference 50081/17.
