Officers are appealing for witnesses or information following an attempted burglary in Ipswich.

The incident took place at a property on Foxhall Road, near to the junction Felixstowe Road, at around 2.15am on Saturday 15 July. Offender/s attempted to force entry to a door at the back of the house but were not able to gain access. The victim reported seeing the offenders fleeing the scene on a motorbike.

Shortly afterwards police received a report of two men riding a motorbike in the Rands Way/Nacton Road area. The men were described as wearing balaclavas and no helmets. The motorbike is thought to be an off-road type.
