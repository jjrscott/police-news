Police are appealing for witnesses following a robbery at a bookmakers in Newmarket.

The incident occurred at around 6.30pm yesterday, Wednesday 11 January, at the premises in All Saints Road.

Two men entered the building through the front door, with one of them brandishing a crowbar. They confronted two female members of staff and demanded the keys to the slot machines.

One of the employees was pushed to the floor before the keys were handed over and they then emptied the coins from the slot machines. They then demanded the safe be opened, but it has not yet been established if anything was taken from it. The two men then left the building.

The suspects are described as both having their faces covered, one wearing a balaclava and the other with what is believed to have been a ski mask.

Detectives are appealing for any witnesses who were in the vicinity of All Saints Road between 6pm and 7pm yesterday and who saw two men acting suspiciously to make contact.

Anyone with any information about this crime is asked to contact Bury St Edmunds CID on **101** quoting reference 11855/17, or Crimestoppers anonymously on **0800 555 111**.
