Police are appealing for witnesses to a theft from a motor vehicle that took place in Woodbridge.

It happened overnight at some point between 6:45pm on Friday 9 February and 11am on Saturday 10 February outside a property in a road named California.

Offender/s broke into a secure Ford Transit van and searched the entire vehicle before taking a range of specialist equipment from a rear caged section. The items included a FLIR T620 thermal camera, a Sonus XT Airbourne altrasound detector and a Sonus PD kit and headphones.

If you have any information regarding the incident, saw any suspicious activity during the times stated, contact police on 101 quoting crime reference 8221/18 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Van owners are being advised to register their tools and equipment for free at www.immobilise.com by taking note of the serial numbers and models, and to use ultraviolet pen to (invisibly) mark their property, which increases the chances of having them returned to you in the event of items being lost or stolen.

Van drivers should also consider the following measures to reduce the risk of being a victim of crime:

• Always lock all doors & shut windows, physically checking van doors are locked.
• Park in a garage or secure area where possible.
• Park with the doors against a wall.
• If you park on your driveway consider installing motion activated CCTV.
• Be particularly aware when unloading.
• Remove tools from the van if possible.
• To increase the security of tools, you can bolt either a cage or box to the base of the van which should be secured with a sturdy close shackle padlock to reduce and deter further incidents.
• Setting an alarm or immobiliser will make it more difficult for the offender.
• Consider upgrading locks/fitting additional protection.
