Police are investigating a burglary at a home address in Claydon.

The incident took place on Church Lane, between 10:30am and 11.10am, on Tuesday 15 November, where the suspects gained entry by smashing a window to the rear of the property. A search was then conducted and a quantity of jewellery, a watch and Â£40 in cash was stolen. It is thought the offender left the property via the garden.

The items taken include a rose gold ring with pearls, a large garnet cluster gold ring, a diamond and sapphire gold puzzle ring, a diamond and emerald gold ring, and various other gold rings with precious stones. In addition four gold pendants were stolen, including one depicting a Grecian woman.

Police are appealing to anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious to come forward and would also like to hear from anyone who may have been offered any similar items of jewellery. Anyone with information should contact Ipswich CID on **101** quoting reference: 66366/16, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on **0800 555 111.**
