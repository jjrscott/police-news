A family tribute is being issued to the victim of a fatal road traffic collision, which occurred on the Suffolk/Norfolk border at the weekend.

Officers were called just after 5am on Sunday 9 October, to reports of a collision between a red Ford Mondeo and a green Fiat Panda on the B1107 Thetford Road at Santon Downham, near the exit to High Lodge Visitor Centre.

Mark Smyth, aged 46, of Brandon, who was driving the Fiat Panda, sadly died at the scene of the collision.

Mr Smyth’s wife has asked us to issue the following tribute on her behalf:

“Mark Smyth, aged 46, who was married to Jo, both of Brandon in Suffolk, was tragically killed in the early hours of Sunday 9 October on his way to work in a head-on collision. He was a family and animal lover who leaves behind a widow and his beloved dog Hugo.

“Mark was a kind, warm, gentle, man who was funny and had a great sense of humour. He had a love for the outdoor sports and photography which took him to many places across the globe. He was loved and liked by so many people and highly respected. He will be sadly missed by us all.”

33-year-old Raimondas Saveikis, of Canons Walk, Thetford, was yesterday charged with causing death by dangerous driving in connection with this incident and remanded in police custody to appear before Ipswich Magistrates’ Court this morning, Friday 14 October.

Saveikis was granted bail by the court and the case was sent to Ipswich Crown Court, where he is due to appear on Friday 11 November.
