A 56-year-old man reported missing by prison authorities has been recaptured.

William Kerr was reported missing after failing to return to a rendezvous point in Ipswich during the afternoon of Friday 1 December, has now been arrested by police.

He is serving a life sentence for murder.

Following an earlier media appeal, an alert member of the public who had seen Kerrâ€™s photograph telephoned police to report seeing him in Ipswich town centre last night. Officers attended immediately and Kerr was arrested and brought to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre pending his transfer back to the prison system.

Police would like to thank the media and public for their assistance with this appeal.
