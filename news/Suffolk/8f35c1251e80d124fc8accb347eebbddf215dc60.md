Police can confirm that a man has died following a road traffic collision in Bramford.

Officers were called at just before 6.00am, today Monday 10 September, to reports of a single vehicle collision on The Street in Bramford. It is reported that a blue Ford Focus car travelling from the direction of Acton Road into the village travelled across the carriageway before colliding with a building.

The driver, Robert Mills aged 59 from Bramford, was sadly pronounced deceased at the scene.

The road was closed to allow an investigation into the circumstances to get underway, but it has since re-opened.

Police are appealing for witnesses who may have seen the manner of driving prior or who have relevant dash-cam to contact the Serious Collision Investigation Team on 101 quoting reference CAD 42 of today, 10 September.
