Police are appealing for witnesses after a man exposed himself in Stowmarket earlier this week.

The incident occurred at around 6.30pm on Monday 26 March in Stowupland Street.

A 17-year-old girl and a 21-year-old man were sitting by the bridge over the River Gipping, when two men approached from the direction of Stowupland Road and along the footpath towards them.

One of the men is then reported to have removed his clothing and entered the river, making suggestive comments towards the teenager. He then got out of the river, put his clothes back on and then walked along the path towards Station Road with the other man.

The suspect is described as white, around 40-years-old, of heavy build and with short hair. His clothing was described as a dark blue jacket, white t-shirt and green trousers.

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to contact the Stowmarket Safer Neighbourhood Team on 101 quoting reference 16445/18.
