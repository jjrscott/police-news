Police are appealing for witnesses following an attempted robbery in east Ipswich at the weekend.

The incident occurred at around 10.30pm on Saturday 21 November in Celestion Drive.

The victim – a woman aged in her 30s – had been walking along Foxhall Road and then cut through the play area by Celestion Drive. She was talking on her mobile phone as walked and noticed two men sat on a bench in the playground.

As she passed the men one of them shouted at her to give them the phone, before they then got up and began pushing her. The victim fought the men off and managed to run away to safety.

The suspects are described as being aged between 30-40 years-old. The first man was wearing a grey hooded top, grey tracksuit bottoms. The second man was wearing a black Adidas tracksuit and black hooded top. Both men were also wearing black face masks.

Detectives would like to hear from any witnesses to this crime, or anyone who saw two men matching the descriptions above in the vicinity of Celestion Drive on Saturday night.

Any witnesses are asked to contact South CID at Landmark House in Ipswich, quoting reference: 67718/20.
