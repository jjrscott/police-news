Police are appealing for witnesses following a fail to stop incident on the A14 at Woolpit.

At approximately 3pm on Tuesday 23 June, officers on patrol requested the rider of a red Suzuki Bandit motorcycle to stop due their manner of driving but after initially stopping in a layby, the rider made off.

Officers pursued the motorcyclist, who was witnessed driving at excessive speeds, until they reached the Stowmarket area.

Police would like to hear from anyone who may have seen or captured on dash-cam, a rider and a passenger on a red Suzuki Bandit motorcycle, without a rear number plate in the Stowmarket area or shortly before on the A14.

Anyone with information that they believe could assist officers with their enquiries, is asked to contact PC 1823 Perrier of the Roads and Armed Policing Team at Bury St Edmunds Police Station, quoting CAD reference: 277 of 23 June 2020.
