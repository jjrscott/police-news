Police are appealing for witnesses after a man was attacked with an unknown substance in Beccles.

Officers were called just after 1.25am this morning, Thursday 20 July, to an incident at an address in Fair Close.

The victim – aged in his 50s – was woken-up by noises outside and when he went to investigate, discovered a group of men who squirted him in the eye with a substance.

Police were called and local officers searched the area, with the assistance of the dog unit and National Police Air Service helicopter, but the suspects were not located.

The victim was taken to hospital for treatment to his eye and it is not yet known what the substance thrown was, but it is not believed to be corrosive.

> **Detective Sergeant Jamie Rose, of East CID, said:** "We are obviously in the very early stages of this investigation, but at the current time we believe this was intended to be a targeted attack against a specific individual. However, it would appear the man targeted has been a victim of mistaken identity and suffered an injury to his eye as a result.
>
> "Although we do not yet know what the substance was, it does not appear to be acid or any other corrosive liquid. Tests will be carried-out to try and determine exactly what it was.
>
> "I am appealing for anyone who believes they may know who is responsible for this attack, or anyone who was in the area at the time, to contact us immediately.”

Anyone with information should contact East CID at Lowestoft Police Station on 101 quoting reference 49607/17, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
