Police **** are **** appealing **** for information after **** a woman in her 60’s had her **** purse stolen **** in Lowestoft.

The incident took place at the North Quay Retail Park on Friday 14 October at approximately 12:20pm.

The woman was approached by a man at the car park who asked her for directions to the local hospital. She asked a second man who had approached from behind for help with explaining the location but he did not appear to speak English and did not stop.

It was only after both men had left the area that she realised her purse was missing.

Money was subsequently withdrawn from her account, and her bank card was used at various retailers.

The first man is described as white, between 5ft 10ins and 6ft tall, and in his late 30’s. He is of medium to stocky to build, has dark hair and spoke with a foreign accent.

The second man, who Police believe is connected to the theft, is also described as in his late 30’s with light, brown hair. He is slightly shorter and of smaller build to the first man and was wearing a long coat.

Anyone with information, or who may have seen anyone who matches the description of the two men, is urged to contact Lowestoft Neighbourhood Response Team on **101** quoting reference 60874/16. Alternatively call Crimestoppers anonymously on **0800 555 111.**
