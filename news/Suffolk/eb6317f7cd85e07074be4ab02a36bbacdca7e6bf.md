Police are appealing for witnesses following a hit and run road traffic collision in Worlington.

Officers were called just before 6.25am this morning, Friday 26 May, to reports of a collision between a car and a bicycle on the B1102, around 30 metres before the junction with Bridge Farm Close. Both the car and cyclist were travelling towards Mildenhall.

The cyclist â€“ a man aged in his 30s - sustained a head injury as a result of this collision, but it is not believed to be life-changing. He has been taken to West Suffolk Hospital for treatment. The road was closed for around two hours, reopening at 8.30am.

The vehicle involved in this collision failed to stop and is believed to be a dark-coloured car. Debris left at the scene indicates that it has sustained damage to one of its front headlamps.

Police are appealing for anyone who witnessed the collision, or who saw a dark-coloured car in the area either immediately prior to or after it, to contact officers.

They are also appealing for anyone with information on a car which may have sustained recent damage to a headlamp and is known to travel in the Worlington area.

Calls should be made to the Roads Policing and Firearms Operations Unit at Bury St Edmunds on 101 quoting reference CAD 53 of 26 May.
