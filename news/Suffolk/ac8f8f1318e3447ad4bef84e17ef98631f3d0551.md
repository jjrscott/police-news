Police are appealing for witnesses following an incident in Felixstowe.

The incident occurred at around 12.55pm on Wednesday 17 July on the corner of Beach Station Road and Sea Road.

The victim – a 17-year-old – teenager was walking along Sea Road from the direction of the town centre and as she was walking past Micklegate Road towards Beach Station Road, a car slowed down and the driver shouted suggestive comments towards her.

The male driver then pulled over on Beach Station Road and got out of the car. He is then grabbed the victim’s wrist and made further suggestive comments.

The female then threatened to call the police and the male got into his car and drove off towards the A14, in the direction of Mcdonald's.

The male suspect is described having a tanned complexion, aged in his late 30s to 40s, bald, with black greying stubble, around 5ft 9ins in height and of a medium build. He was wearing large black plastic framed sunglasses, a black t-shirt with white rectangular print on the front, light denim shorts half way down his knee and flip flops.

The male suspect was driving a black car with five doors and tinted back windows.

Officers would be keen to hear from any motorists who may have any dashcam footage or any householders with private CCTV equipment with footage captured from between 12.40pm and 1.15pm within the named streets as they may be able to help with the investigation.

Anyone with any information about this incident is asked to contact Suffolk police quoting crime reference 37/41924/19
