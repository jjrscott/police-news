Police are appealing for witnesses following a serious road collision at Wherstead yesterday evening (Sunday 13 September).

Police were called at 9.04pm to reports of a collision involving a blue Ford Focus and three pedestrians on The Strand (B1456), close to the entrance for the Suffolk Food Hall.

The blue Ford Focus was travelling towards Shotley, and three pedestrians, two men and a woman, were walking towards Ipswich.

The female pedestrian, believed to be in her 40s, was flown to Addenbrookes’ Hospital by Air Ambulance in critical condition last night. She remains in hospital, where her condition is described as critical but stable.

One of the male pedestrians suffered injuries and the third pedestrian was uninjured.

The road was closed in both directions between the Oyster Reach Public House and the B1080 at Freston and reopened at 1am.

Officers are appealing for witnesses who were using the road who may have dash cam footage or any other information to assist the investigation.

Any witnesses are asked to contact Suffolk Police on 101 quoting 37/53417/20.
