Three teenagers from London have been arrested after a robbery in Bury St Edmunds.

The incident occurred at around 4.30pm yesterday, Tuesday 20 September, in an alleyway at the rear of Raynham Road, heading towards Northgate Avenue.

The victims, two 16-year-old boys, were approached by three males who grabbed hold of them and stole a bank card.

Police were called and approximately 45 minutes later arrested three people on suspicion of robbery at Bury St Edmunds Railway Station.

The three – two 19-year-old men and a 17-year-old boy, all from east London – were taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre for questioning. They have all been released on bail until Thursday 17 November pending further enquires.
