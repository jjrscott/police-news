Police are appealing for dog owners in the Corton Wood area of Lowestoft to remain vigilant after the death of a dog.

It follows an incident on Wednesday 3 March where a dog was fed an unknown substance by an elderly gentleman, described as ‘treats’ in the Corton Wood area. The dog, a nine year old Bullmastiff, became ill and died the following day.

Another incident in the same area, Corton Woods, on the morning of Saturday 6 March saw a dog that had been for a walk in the woods became seriously ill later the same day. It required veterinary treatment and survived. The vet said it was likely it had eaten something that had poisoned it. This dog was not approached by anyone during it’s walk on the Saturday morning.

Anyone who has experienced a similar situation in the Corton Woods area when out walking with their dog is asked to contact Suffolk police, quoting crime reference 37/11545/21
