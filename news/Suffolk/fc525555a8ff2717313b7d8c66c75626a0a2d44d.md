A man who died following a serious road traffic collision between Lakenheath and Eriswell is being named by police.

Emergency services were called at 6.30am on Tuesday 7 June to reports of a three vehicle collision involving a Subaru Impreza, a Vauxhall Corsa and a Jeep Wrangler on The Street B1112 in Eriswell, approximately 300 yards south of the junction with Lords Walk.
