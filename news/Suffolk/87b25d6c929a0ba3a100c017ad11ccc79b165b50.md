Police are appealing for witnesses and information after stones were thrown at vehicles in Lowestoft and Carlton Colville.

Between 5.20pm and 7.45pm on Wednesday 19 August, police received three reports. The details are as follows:

\- Shortly before 5.20pm, a group of around seven or eight males were witnessed throwing stones. One of the stones hit a vehicle in Castleton Avenue, Carlton Colville. The extent of the damage is not known.
\- Shortly before 5.40pm, a stone was thrown at a coach while it was being driven along Beccles Road, Lowestoft, causing a window to smash. Officers attended shortly afterwards but there was no trace of the suspects.
\- Shortly before 7.45pm, a large group of people were witnessed throwing stones in Lowestoft Road, Carlton Colville. Two large stones or rocks were thrown and hit a vehicle, causing it to swerve off the road and become involved in a collision. Officers attended and patrolled the area.

Police are investigating whether these incidents are linked and would like to remind members of the public that throwing objects at cars is a criminal offence, capable of causing damage and injury.

Police are also urging drivers to report such incidents as soon as possible with the location of travel and with as much detail as possible to assist with enquiries.

Anyone who has been a victim, or has any information about these incidents or who may have dash-cam footage is asked to contact Suffolk police on 101, quoting 378 of 19 August 2020.
