A 54 year old man has been jailed for over a year and half for an assault in Saxmundham.

Simon Clarke of Albion Street in the town was convicted after pleading guilty to GBH and common assault at Ipswich Crown Court on Monday 12 November.

He received a 19 month custodial sentence, and was ordered to pay £750 compensation and £1,000 in costs.

On 7 February this year Clarke, the license holder at The Cooper’s Dip public house, assaulted a customer, aged in his mid 30s without any apparent provocation punched him and used a pint glass to smash over the head causing lacerations to the victim’s head.

Following the incident police successfully applied for a suspension of Clarke’s premises licence on 10 February, despite an appeal by Clarke. A subsequent review hearing of Clarke’s licence was held on 7 March when the licence was revoked.

DC Matt Rogers of Lowestoft CID said: "To see Clarke jailed for over 18 months is extremely satisfying as he was an intimidating and threatening individual. His conviction demonstrates that when members of the public are prepared to assist police in reporting criminal offences, witnesses are listened to and supported throughout the investigation process by police and the courts.”
