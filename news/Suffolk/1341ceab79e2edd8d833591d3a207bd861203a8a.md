Police are appealing for witnesses to an incident of public order that took place in Woodbridge.

It happened on the A12 near Seckford Hall on Sunday 2 December at about 10.50am.

A woman in her 30s was driving a silver VW Polo when she was overtaken by a grey coloured hatchback car. The vehicle then cut in front of her and braked sharply, causing the Polo to take evasive action.

The male driver of the hatchback then stopped his car, got out of the vehicle and shouted and swore at the victim, making threats before kicking her vehicle and leaving the scene.

Anyone who saw the incident, has knowledge of it or has dash cam footage of the incident should contact Suffolk police on 101, quoting crime reference 37/69870/18.
