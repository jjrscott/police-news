Staff and officers at Bury St Edmunds Police Station had the opportunity to meet a remarkable young man recently.

14-year-old Kai Golden from Bury St Edmunds, who is wheelchair bound, visited the police station with the assistance of Michael O’Rourke works for ‘Achieving Aspirations’, a Bury St Edmunds based organisation that provides respite care for children with disabilities.

Kai arrived at the police station on his electric wheelchair and had a morning of meeting various staff and police officers in the office before spending some time out with the response cars and the van.

Hi wheelchair was plastered with police ID material and wore his police cap and high visibility police jacket for the entirety of the visit.

Kai had the opportunity to help officers getting a very 'naughty man' in handcuffs and in the back of a van. He also assisted with taking fingerprints of a 'very naughty' Michael O’Rourke.

Bury St Edmunds Community Engagement Officer, PC Andre de Jongh, who facilitated the visit said: “Meeting Kai was an inspiration for us all. Never a minute went by without that big warm smile on his face. When I saw him on his wheel chair all done up with police markings, I knew he was serious!”
