Police are appealing for witnesses following a sexual assault in Lowestoft.

The incident occurred between 10.15pm and 10.30pm last night, Saturday 19 May, in Crown Meadow Walk, near to Lowestoft Town Football Club.

The victim, a 16-year-old girl, was walking with some friends when she became separated from the group. Shortly after this, she was touched on the leg by a man walking behind her and when she turned around he sexually assaulted her. She managed to push him away and then ran off and contacted her friends.

The suspect is described as white, of slim build and with facial stubble. He was wearing a baggy hooded top with the hood up and grey tracksuit bottoms.

Detectives would like to hear from anyone who was in the area between 10pm and 10.30pm last night and who may have seen a man matching the above description.

Anyone with information about this attack is asked to contact the East Safeguarding Unit in Lowestoft on 101 quoting reference 27335/18. Alternatively call the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
