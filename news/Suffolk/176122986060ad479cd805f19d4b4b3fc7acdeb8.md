Police are appealing for witnesses to robbery that took place in Ipswich.

It happened on Thursday 13 September by Suffolk College at about 7.40pm when a 14 year old teenager was approached by four teenage males and asked if he was listening to music. He had his phone in his hand and then one of the males grabbed it and the headphones and then handed both back to the victim with a threat made that they would assault him if the victim went after the group.

Two teenagers, aged 13 year and 14 years old have both been arrested on suspicion of robbery and taken to Marltesham Police investigation Centre for questioning where they remain.

Officers believe that several members of the public walked past the group at about the time of the incident that took place on a path next to the football pitches near to an ATM machine and are keen to speak to them as potential witnesses.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or saw any suspicious activity should contact Ipswich CID on 101, quoting crime reference 37/52646/18. Alternatively contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
