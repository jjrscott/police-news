Police are asking residents to stay vigilant following a recent incident of lead theft from a church.

The incident occurred at a church on Church Lane in Sproughton and which was reported to police on 17 October.

The offenders have accessed the lower section of the church roof by using a ladder and removed a substantial quantity of lead. It is unclear exactly when the incident took place.

Stealing a large amount of lead takes time and is likely to involve a small group of people so any prompt reports will assist police in locating the offenders.

> **Sgt Brian Calver said:** "Communities can act as our eyes and ears, and by making a note of any suspicious activity of people or vehicles we can deter thieves. Don’t ignore anything that you think looks out of place - report anything you think may be suspicious to the police. I would also urge scrap dealers to report any attempts at lead disposal to us, as the lead from church roofs is often marked with smart water and so we can easily identify where it’s come from.”

If anybody does have any information regarding the theft they should call police on 101 quoting crime reference number 37/68091/17 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
