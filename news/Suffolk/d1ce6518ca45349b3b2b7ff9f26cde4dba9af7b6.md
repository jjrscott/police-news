A man has died following a road traffic collision in Worlington, which happened earlier this month.

The incident occurred at 6.40pm on Sunday 18 November, on the B1102 Mildenhall Road.

A white Toyota Hilux was travelling in the direction of Mildenhall, where it collided with a digger which was parked and unattended on one lane of the road. This section of the road was closed off for roadworks and controlled by temporary traffic lights.

Stephen Hogg, aged 40 and from Fordham in Cambridgeshire, was treated at the scene and then taken to Addenbrookeâ€™s Hospital where he sadly died three days later.

Any witnesses to this incident, or anyone who may have seen a white Toyota Hilux in the area immediately prior to it, is asked to contact the Serious Collision Investigation Team on 101, quoting reference CAD 340 of 18 November.
