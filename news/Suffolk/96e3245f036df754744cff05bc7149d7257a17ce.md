Police are appealing for witnesses after an attempted robbery in Ipswich yesterday.

The incident took place on Colchester Road, near to the Royal George pub at approximately 12:45pm, yesterday Sunday 6 September.

A 13-year-boy was cycling towards Sidegate Lane when he was stopped by a man also on a bicycle who asked if he had a phone or money. The victim said no and the suspect then produced a small knife but the boy was then able to cycle away. He was not injured and nothing was stolen.

The suspect is described as around 16 years of age, of small build and was wearing black clothing, a black face covering and white trainers. He was riding a bicycle that was possibly red in colour.

Witnesses or anybody with any information are asked to contact Ipswich CID quoting reference 37/51889/20
