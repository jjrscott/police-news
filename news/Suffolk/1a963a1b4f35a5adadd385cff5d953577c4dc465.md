Two silver condiment pots and a silver picture frame were stolen following a burglary at a home in Kersey last week.

Someone broke in via the back of the property on Church Hill between 2.30pm on Thursday 23 and 5.05pm on Friday 24 March and made a search before stealing the items.

A small rectangular silver tray â€“ measuring around three-and-a-half inches by two inches - was also taken.

Police are asking anyone who may have noticed any suspicious behaviour in the area between these times, anyone who may have been offered similar items for sale since or anyone with information about the burglar or burglars to contact CID at Ipswich by dialling Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting crime number 24906/17.
