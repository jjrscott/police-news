A man has been charged with drug offences connected to Ipswich.

A man was arrested in an address in East London yesterday afternoon (Thurs 19 November) on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of a Class A drugs. The arrest was made in connection with Operation Orochi â€“ an operation set up by Suffolk
Constabulary with the Met Police to tackle County Lines drug dealing that operate between London and Suffolk.

He was transported to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning.

22 year old Galid Hassan of Cricklewood Lane in London was subsequently charged with two counts of being concerned of the supply of class A drugs.

He was remanded to appear before Ipswich Magistrates Court in the morning (Sat 21 November) at 10am.

Since February 2020* Operation Orochi, led by the Metropolitan Police, has been in place in Suffolk. It focusses on analysing the data of mobile phones used to buy and sell crack cocaine and heroin by dealers and controllers. Officers from the team in Suffolk will share this intelligence with a dedicated team at the Met, who will then investigate to identify the line controller and their location.
