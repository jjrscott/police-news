Police are appealing for witnesses to a burglary that took place in Bury St Edmunds.

It happened on Thursday 8 November at some point between 12.20pm and 6.40pm at a property on Winsford Road.

During the times stated unknown offenders have gained entry to a property by smashing the rear patio door an untidy search has been carried out in the upstairs and a small safe containing jewellery was taken by the offenders who have then left via the back door. It is thought a middle drawer from a chest of drawers was also taken which may have been used to carry the safe from the address.

Dark evenings can provide the perfect cover for burglars but by carrying out a few simple crime prevention steps, householders and motorists can thwart opportunist criminals.

As part of the initiative, an online suite of bespoke, easy to follow crime prevention documents are available to view and download on the constabulary's website for free. Visit: https://www.suffolk.police.uk/advice/crime-prevention-z

Anyone who may have seen the incident or saw any suspicious activity should contact Suffolk police on 101 quoting reference 37/64859/18

Alternatively, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
