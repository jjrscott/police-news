Police are urging residents to keep their properties secure as summer approaches. The advice comes as three burglaries in Ipswich were reported yesterday evening, Tuesday 23 May, and in the early hours of this morning, Wednesday 24 May.

The details of these incidents are as follows:

 * Between 9:30pm and 10pm, offenders gained entry to a premises in Felixstowe Road – near the Bixley Road roundabout – via an insecure door and stole a handbag and mobile phones.
 * At approximately 10pm, a home in Warren Heath Avenue was accessed via an insecure door. A tablet and mobile phones were stolen from the property. A man seen in the area was challenged by a neighbour but fled the scene on foot. He is described as white, in his 30s, around 5ft 10ins and of average build. He has short, light-coloured hair and was wearing a dark padded jacket.
 * Around 3am this morning, an attempted burglary in Paper Mill Lane, Bramford, was reported to police. The victim heard his insecure garage door open and went to investigate, upon which he saw someone of slight build running away. Nothing is believed to have been stolen.

Police are reminding members of the public to ensure doors and windows are locked as thieves will typically look for the easy option by looking for gaps in security and are generally not afraid to try door locks.
