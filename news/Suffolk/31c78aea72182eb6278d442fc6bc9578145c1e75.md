A man is currently being questioned by detectives in connection with two serious sexual assaults which occurred in Great Cornard at the weekend.

Police were contacted during the afternoon of Sunday 7 August by a woman reporting that she had been raped in the early hours of that morning.

The victim had encountered a man at around 4.30am whilst walking back from Sudbury town centre and was then later raped by him at an address in Great Cornard. Further enquires then identified that a second victim had also been raped at the same address.

The victims have been supported by specialist trained officers and a suspect was quickly identified.

Detectives have been making enquiries to locate the suspect and at around 10pm yesterday evening, a 34-year-old man was arrested at Liverpool Street Station in London on suspicion of rape.

The man, who is from New Romney in Kent, was brought back to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre where he currently remains for questioning.
