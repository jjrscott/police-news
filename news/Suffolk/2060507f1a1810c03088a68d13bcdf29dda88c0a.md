Two men have been jailed for a combined total of four years after being convicted of drug offences in Leiston last year.

Cy Whitham, 25, of Blenheim Road, Ipswich, was jailed for 28 months on Friday 9 February, when he appeared at Ipswich Crown Court, where he pleaded guilty to being concerned in the supply of heroin and for possession of cannabis.

Sam Prior, 33, of Valley Road, Leiston, was jailed for 20 months, on the same day at Ipswich Crown Court, where he pleaded guilty for allowing his premises to be used to facilitate Class A drugs supply and also for being in breach of a suspended sentence.

The charges relate to an incident which occurred on Monday 23 October, when police officers in plain clothes observed Whitham leaving the property in Valley Road, and shortly after, making a drug exchange in a nearby road.

Officers then parked nearby and witnessed Whitham leaving the property a further time to engage in a second exchange. He was then arrested, along with Prior, who was found within the property. Subsequently, a quantity of cash, along with 47 drug wraps and a small bag containing a Class B drug were recovered.

PC Stephen Brown of the Scorpion East team said: "This is an excellent result which has taken two individuals off the street who are involved with the supply of drugs.

"The impact of drugs can blight a community and our continued aim is to disrupt the criminals who are involved in these types of activities.‚Äù
