Police are appealing for witnesses to an accosting incident that took place in Ipswich.

A 12-year-old girl was walking along Nacton Road near to the Mildmay Road junction at around 3.30pm on Friday 15 June when she was approached by four men in a car. The driver lowered his window and asked the girl if she wanted to get into the vehicle. The girl immediately ran off down an alleyway.

The car is described as a rusty-looking, dirty, green people carrier vehicle.

The girl was unhurt in the incident.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has further information should contact police on 101, quoting crime reference number 32885/18. Alternatively call the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
