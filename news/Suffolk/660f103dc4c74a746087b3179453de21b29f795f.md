Police are appealing for witnesses following the attempted theft of a defibrillator in Martlesham.

The incident occurred at around 5.20pm on Saturday 27 February at St Michael’s and All Angels Church, The Drift, Martlesham Heath.

Four males were seen to damage the defibrillator cabinet located on the side of the church, by smashing the window in the unit and then attempting to pull the defibrillator out, but were not successful in removing it. They then walked away in the direction of The Square.

The four suspects are described as white, all aged approximately 15-16 years-old and of average build between 5ft 7in and 5ft 10in tall. They were all wearing tops with hoods up, with three of them in dark clothing and the fourth wearing a grey tracksuit. They were all wearing face masks.

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to contact Woodbridge Safer Neighbourhood Team, quoting reference: 9876/21.
