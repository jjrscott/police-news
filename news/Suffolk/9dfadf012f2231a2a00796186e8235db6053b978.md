A pair of binoculars was stolen following a burglary at a home in Ipswich last week.

Officers were called to a property in Holbrook Road at 11:55pm on Thursday 6 April to reports that a man wearing a black balaclava had just forced entry into the home while the occupants were in the room.

He is reported to have walked through the room and out the front door, stealing a black case which contained the binoculars on the way.

The suspect is described as approximately 5ft 9ins in height and of stocky build. He was wearing all dark clothing, including a thigh-length black coat, and is said to have fled in the direction of Hawke Road.

Police are asking anyone who may have noticed any suspicious behaviour in the area around this time, or anyone with information that can help identify the man, to contact Ipswich CID at Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting reference 27486/17.
