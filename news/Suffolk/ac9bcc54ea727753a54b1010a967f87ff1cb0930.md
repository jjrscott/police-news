Police are appealing for witnesses following a serious road traffic collision in West Stow.

Officers were called just after 8.25am this morning, Thursday 23 November, to reports of a single vehicle collision on Icklingham Road.

A yellow Volkswagen Golf travelling towards the A1101 left the road and collided with a tree. The driver – a man aged in his 20s – was taken to Addenbrooke’s Hospital with serious back and leg injuries, though these are now not believed to be life-changing.

The road was closed until around 1.30pm whilst a police investigation took place.

Anyone who saw a vehicle matching this description at the time, or just prior to, the collision, or who may have dashcam footage, is asked to contact the Bury St Edmunds Roads Policing and Firearms Operations Unit on 101 quoting reference CAD 91 of 23 November.
