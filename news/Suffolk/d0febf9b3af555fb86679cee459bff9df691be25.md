A cordon has been put in place at the skate park at Stoke Bridge after police received a report that a woman had been raped.

Officers were contacted around 11.30pm last night, Thursday 15 December, by a caller who reported a female friend – a young woman - had been raped.

Police attended and the woman reported that she had been walking in Ipswich around 10.30pm yesterday when she saw a man who had followed her, approached her and then led her into the skate park on Stoke Bridge where he raped her.

Specialist officers are working with the young woman and have started enquiries into what happened.

Police are asking anyone who may have seen a man and a woman in this area around 10pm – 11.30pm last night, or anyone who may have been in the skate park between these times to come forward.
