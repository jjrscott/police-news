Police are appealing for witnesses after two women were locked in a car and one was sexually assaulted near Rushmere Road, Ipswich.

On Monday 1 January, between the hours of 1am and 2am, two women, both aged in their 20s, accepted a lift from an unknown male near to Unit 17 in Cardinal Park.

On arrival, he locked both women in the car until one of the women convinced the man to let them out. Shortly after, outside the car, the man sexually assaulted the woman. One of the women then managed to get the attention of a passing car and a male stopped and helped.

Officers would be keen to appeal for any witnesses to come forward who may have seen the offender approach the victims and seen them getting into what is thought to be a red car near Unit 17 between midnight and 2am. Alternatively, they would like to hear from the man who assisted near Rushmere Road between 1:30am and 2:30am.

Anyone with information should contact Suffolk Police by calling 101, quoting crime reference number 767/18, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
