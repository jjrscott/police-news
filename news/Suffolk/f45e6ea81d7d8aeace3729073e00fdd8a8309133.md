Police are appealing for witnesses following a sexual assault in Claydon.

On Thursday 23 February, sometime between 3:20pm and 3:35pm, a young girl was approached by a man whilst on a public bus heading in the Bramford direction.

He is reported to have boarded the number 88 bus at Old Ipswich Road and sat next to the girl before stroking her thigh and pinching her bottom.

The man is described as white, between 40 and 60 yearsâ€™ old and was wearing a green jumper, green camouflage trousers and a black beanie hat.

Detectives would like to hear from anyone who may have seen anyone matching this description in the area around the time stated, or witnesses on the bus who may have information to assist the investigation.

Anyone with information should contact Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting reference 19653/17.
