Police are appealing for witnesses and information after a fire at a home in Montgomery Road in Ipswich.

Officers were contacted by the fire service around 7.25pm last night, Wednesday 28 December, about the incident. It appears the front door at the property had been set alight but that a passing member of the public managed to put out the fire using an extinguisher. Fortunately everyone at the address managed to get out safely via the back of the home, although damage had been caused to the property.

An investigation is underway into what happened and who started the fire. Itâ€™s thought the person or persons involved may have sustained some burn injuries and police are asking anyone who may have seen anything in the area around 7pm - 7.30pm yesterday, or anyone with information, to come forward.

The incident is being treated as arson with intent to endanger life and detectives are exploring possible motives for the incident.

If you can help please call Ipswich CID by dialling Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting crime number 74029/16. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers, anonymously if required, on 0800 555 111.
