A 19-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply after police went to an address in Spruce Court in Lowestoft yesterday.

Officers had gone to the address looking to trace two individuals on fail-to-appear warrants. Both of these – a 49-year-old man and a 47-year-old woman – were arrested at the scene.

The 19-year-old, from south-east London, was also found at the address around 4.20pm yesterday, Sunday 9 April. He was arrested and police recovered two packages of what are believed to be class A drugs.

The 19-year-old has now been released under investigation while further enquiries are made.
