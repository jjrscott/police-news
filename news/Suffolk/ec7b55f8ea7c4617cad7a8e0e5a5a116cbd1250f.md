Police are appealing for witnesses following a two-vehicle collision in Hacheston.

On Tuesday 24 November at 5.30pm, police were called to a collision on the B1116 at the junction with Easton Lane, involving a red Toyota MR2 and a black Yamaha motorcycle.

The car was travelling towards Hacheston on Easton Lane and the motorcycle was travelling northbound on The Street on the B1116 towards Framlingham.

The male teenage motorcycle rider suffered minor injuries and was taken to hospital for treatment.

The driver of the Toyota, a man in his 50s, was arrested on suspicion of drug driving and has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

The road was closed for recovery of the vehicles and reopened at 10.50pm.

Officers would like to hear from anyone who may have been in the area at the time of the collision or who may have any dash cam footage to assist the investigation.

Any witnesses should contact PC Kelly Milton at Suffolk Police on 101 quoting reference number 293 of 24 November.
