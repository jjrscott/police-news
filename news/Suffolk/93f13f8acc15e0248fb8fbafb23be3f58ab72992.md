A man from Ipswich has been convicted of firearm offences after an incident last December.

Patrick Connor Smith, aged 29 and from Dombey Road in the town appeared at Ipswich Crown Court on Friday 25 September where he was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison.

At an earlier court hearing he pleaded guilty to two counts of possession of a prohibitive firearm and one count of possession of prohibitive ammunition.

It follows an incident in the early hours of 6 December 2019 where during a search of a property on Goldsmith Road in Ipswich, the keys to an Audi A4, were located within the handbag of a woman at the address. Officers located the vehicle nearby on Thackeray Road, and two firearms and ammunition were located within the boot of the vehicle.

Further enquiries led police to arrest Smith and he was taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning.

He was subsequently charged with possession of cocaine and three counts of possession of a knife. Following further enquiries he was also charged in August this year with two counts of possession a prohibitive firearm, namely automatic pistols and possession of prohibited ammunition.

DI John Allison from the Serious and Organised Crime Directorate said: "The recovery of these firearms removes the significant risk they posed to the communities within which they were held. Members of the public should be reassured that we have the capability of responding to incidents involving the use of firearms or other weapons which could cause significant harm, although it is important to note that such reports are rare across Suffolk‚Äù.
