Two men have been bailed after being charged in connection with a robbery in Lowestoft.

The crime took place at approximately 3:15pm on Tuesday 9 January 2018, at an address in Seago Street, Lowestoft.

Two men visited a property where one of the men offered to sell the victim drugs. When the offer was declined, both men demanded that the victim hand over money. The victim handed over cash from his wallet, a purse and a jar of coins before both men finally left his home.

Jonathan Quinn, 37, of Henham Road, Gunton, Lowestoft, was arrested on Wednesday 10 January 2018, and was subsequently charged with robbery. He was granted conditional bail when he appeared at Norwich Magistrates’ Court on Monday 15 January.

Dylan Edwards, 24, of Deborah Road, Gorleston in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, was also arrested on 10 January and was later charged in connection with the same robbery. He was granted conditional bail when he appeared at Norwich Magistrates’ Court on Friday 12 January.

The two men are next due to appear at Ipswich Crown Court on Friday 9 February 2018.
