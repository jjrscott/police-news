Police are appealing for witnesses to an incident of theft from a motor vehicle in Hadleigh.

At approximately 1:25pm on Tuesday, 16 February, a woman aged in her 60s was shopping in store in Morrisons on Calais Street.

After unloading her shopping in her car – a grey Citroen – she returned her trolley to the trolley park and was approached by a man asking for directions to the local vet.

The woman stopped to draw him a map and, in that time, bank cards were stolen from her bag in her car by an unknown person.

The victim was notified by her bank a short time later that £800 had been withdrawn from her account. It was established that two attempts were made to withdraw cash from her account at the Sainsburys ATM on Hadleigh Road shortly after 2pm.

The man who distracted the victim is described as being approximately 5ft 8ins in height, of average build, with olive skin, thick black hair and brown eyes. He was wearing all black clothing and wore a blue medical mask. He spoke with a foreign accent.
