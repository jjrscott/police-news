Police have charged a man in connection with Ipswich-based drug offences.

Officers arrested a 28-year-old man in the Hertfordshire area yesterday morning, Tuesday 15 December, on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs and possession with intent to supply Class A drugs. He was taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre for questioning.

Adam Kabuye, 28, of Sydney Road, Hornsey, London, was charged yesterday evening with two counts of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs and two counts of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs.

He remains in custody and is due to appear before Ipswich Magistrates’ Court today, Wednesday 16 December.

The arrest was made as part of Operation Orochi – an operation set up by Suffolk Constabulary with the Metropolitan Police to tackle County Lines drug dealing that operates between London and Suffolk.

Since February 2020, Operation Orochi, led by the Met Police, has been in place in Suffolk. It focusses on analysing the data of mobile phones used to buy and sell crack cocaine and heroin by dealers and controllers. Officers from the team in Suffolk will share this intelligence with a dedicated team at the Met, who will then investigate in order to identify the line controller and their location.
