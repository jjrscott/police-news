Police are appealing for witnesses after a robbery at a restaurant in Ipswich.

The incident occurred just before midnight yesterday, Thursday 8 February, at the premises in Duke Street.

The restaurant had closed to customers and two male members of staff were cashing-up when a man entered the building through an insecure back door and demanded money, threatening them with a hammer.

A quantity of cash was handed-over and the suspect then left. It is believed he made off in a silver or grey car, similar to a Vauxhall Astra. The whole incident lasted around a minute and the two members of staff were not harmed.

Officers want to take this opportunity to remind restaurants, shops, or any other businesses that deal in cash, to review their security and cashing-up procedures and ensure the building is locked after the final customers have left and varying the times and frequency that they count-up or transport cash.

Detectives are also exploring the possibility that this incident may be linked to two burglaries occurring at other business premises in Ipswich last night.

These occurred in Wentworth Drive between 11.39pm and 11.45pm and in Felixstowe Road at around midnight.

In both instances glass in either a door or a window was smashed to gain entry to the buildings, with electrical items stolen from Wentworth Drive. It is not yet clear if anything was stolen from the address in Felixstowe Road.

Any witnesses to these incidents are asked to contact South CID at Landmark House on 101 quoting reference 7615/18, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
