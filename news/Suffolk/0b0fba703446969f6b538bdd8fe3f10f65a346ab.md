Police are appealing for witnesses and urging communities to be vigilant following a number of burglaries in the Ipswich area.

On Saturday 24 March there were two attempted burglaries and two burglaries reported to police and officers believe these incidents may be linked.

Details of the incidents are as follows:

\- Belmont Road, Ipswich: At around 01:50am, an offender has attempted to force entry into a home.

\- Belmont Road, Ipswich: During the early hours, a suspect gained entry into a property but nothing is believed to have been stolen.

\- Belmont Road, Ipswich: During the early hours, an offender has attempted to force entry to a property.

\- Holcombe Crescent, Ipswich: At some point overnight, an offender has gained access by unknown means and taken keys, a wallet, a Samsung phone and a blue Vauxhall Astra vehicle.

As the majority of the incidents in this series involve houses being entered by force rather than because of insecurities, police are urging members of the public to consider crime prevention measures such as CCTV, security lighting and doorbell cameras as a way to help make their properties more secure.
