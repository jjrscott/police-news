Police are appealing for witnesses following an attempted burglary with violence in Ipswich.

The incident occurred at around 8.15pm yesterday evening, Wednesday 4 January, at an address in Dales Road.

The victim â€“ a man aged in his sixties - saw the rear outside light come on and when he went to investigate, discovered three males wearing balaclavas outside the conservatory door.

He called out to his wife to phone the police as he attempted to close the conservatory door. At this point one of the offenders struck him with a metal bar before all three then ran away down the side of the house.

The victim was treated by paramedics after suffering swelling to the front of his head as a result of this attack.

The suspects are described as three males wearing dark clothing and balaclavas. Two of them were approximately 5ft 10in tall and the other 5ft 8in tall. All were of average build and one was carrying a small metal bar.

Detectives would like to hear from anyone who was in the area of Dales Road between 8pm and 8.30pm yesterday evening, who may have seen three males matching this description or people acting suspiciously.

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to contact Ipswich CID on **101** quoting reference 10640/17, or Crimestoppers anonymously on **0800 555 111**.
