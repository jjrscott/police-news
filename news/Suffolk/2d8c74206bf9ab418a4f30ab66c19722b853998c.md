Police are appealing for witnesses to a fail to stop collision that took place in Haverhill.

Officers were called at approximately 4:55pm on Tuesday, 2 February, to reports of a collision between a vehicle and a cyclist on Burton End.

The cyclist, a teenage boy, was reportedly knocked off his bicycle near Primrose Hill when the door of a parked van opened in front of him. A passing vehicle – believed to be grey in colour – has then collided with the boy and failed to stop.

The teenager sustained a broken leg and was treated for his injuries at Addenbrookes Hospital.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Suffolk Police on 101 quoting CAD 245 of 2 February.
