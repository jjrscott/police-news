Three people have been charged in connection with two burglary incidents occurring in Beccles.

The offences occurred in the early hours of Sunday 4 March at addresses in Fredericks Road and Nelson Way.

At around 4am in Fredericks Road an attempt was made to gain entry to a house by trying the door handle, but the offenders were disturbed when the occupants’ dogs began barking. They were seen to make off in a hatchback car.

The second offence occurred at some time after 12.40am at a house in Nelson Way. Entry was gained to the property and items including cash, jewellery, watches, mobile phones and vehicle keys were stolen from within.

Following initial police enquiries, detectives arrested three men and one woman in connection with these incidents during the evening of Wednesday 7 March in Lowestoft.

They were all taken to Great Yarmouth Police Investigation Centre for questioning and the three men have subsequently each been charged with one count of burglary and one count of attempted burglary.

All three are from London Road South in Lowestoft and their details are as follows:

 * Arturas Steponavicius, aged 26
 * Ignas Bielevicius, aged 22
 * Sarunas Jovaisa, aged 19

They have all been bailed to appear at Great Yarmouth Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday 11 April.

A 21-year-old woman who was also arrested in connection with these offences has been released under investigation pending further enquires.
