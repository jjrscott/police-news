Police are appealing for witnesses following a single vehicle collision in Lowestoft.

Officers were called shortly after 4:40pm on Wednesday 14 June to reports of a collision involving a motorcycle on the southbound A47, after the B1385/Millennium Way roundabout.

The rider, a man in his 20s on a Suzuki motorcycle, is believed to have sustained spinal injuries and was taken to James Paget Hospital in a serious condition.

The road was blocked as emergency services dealt with the scene but reopened at approximately 8:15pm.

Anyone who may have witnesses the collision or has information to assist the enquiry should contact Suffolk Police on 101, quoting CAD 308 of 14 June.
