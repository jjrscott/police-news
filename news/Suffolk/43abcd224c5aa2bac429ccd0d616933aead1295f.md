Police are appealing for information following an oil theft from a property in Laxfield, near Eye.

The theft took place at an address on Fressingfield Road at some point between 9:20am on Wednesday 25 January and 2:30pm on Friday 27 January.

Access was gained to the oil tank by cutting a padlock and approximately £400 worth of oil was stolen.

Anyone with information that could assist police enquiries is asked to contact the Incident and Crime Management Hub at Suffolk Police on **101** quoting reference 14487/17.

In the winter months, often coupled with the rise in the cost of fuel, heating oil also becomes an attractive target for thieves. Suffolk Police are reminding homeowners of simple measures to prevent such thefts: positioning lights with a ‘Dusk ‘til Dawn’ feature close to the tank, ensuring your fence is high and not easy to climb, and investing in good quality locks, such as shackle padlocks.

Close shackle padlocks offer better resistance to bolt croppers and other tools that thieves usually come equipped with. Homeowners should check their oil gauges regularly, which will indicate any potential theft, and consider installing a remote electronic oil level gauge, which triggers an alarm if there is a sudden drop.
