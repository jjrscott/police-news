Those interested in joining Suffolk Constabulary to become a Detective Constable are invited to join a Live Q+A event this week.

Taking place on Wednesday 19 July at 8pm there will be an opportunity to speak with Detective Superintendent Andy Smith who has been a police officer for 23 years.

The event will be hosted from www.suffolk.police.uk where attendees will get the chance to ask any questions they may have about what it's like to be a Detective Constable, what the role entails and ask about the recruitment process.

We will attempt to answer every question asked during the event, however, if this is not possible those who pose the question will be responded to afterwards.

To attend the hour long Live Q+A visit this page: www.suffolk.police.uk/DCrecruit

Those interested in applying are also encouraged to visit the Constabulary website at www.suffolk.police.uk/join-us for further information on how to apply, and where you will also find a link to the initial Detective entry eligibility form and to request an application pack.

An open evening will be held on Thursday 20 July at Police Headquarters in the Assembly Hall. There is no need to book in advance though those interested should arrive promptly for a 6pm start. Recruitment lines to request the information packs will be open until Friday 28 July. The closing date for completed application forms is Friday 4 August.
