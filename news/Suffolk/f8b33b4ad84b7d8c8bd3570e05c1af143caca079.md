Police can confirm that the body of a man was found near Westley this afternoon.

Officers were called shortly after 2.50pm today, Thursday 19 November, following reports that a body of a man had been discovered in a field.

Emergency services were called to the location but the man was sadly pronounced deceased at the scene.

Road closures were temporarily put in place at the entry to the A14 at Westley while an investigation was carried out.

The death is being treated as unexplained at this time but police do not currently believe there are any suspicious circumstances.

A file will be prepared for the coroner in due course.
