Police are appealing for information following a ram raid at a convenience shop in Debenham.

Officers were called at 3.55am this morning, Monday 26 February, following an alarm activation at the Co-op in Chancery Lane.

A JCB teleporter was used to remove the cash machine from the building and then placed in the back of an Isuzu pick-up truck.

A police unit on its way to attend the ram raid encountered the Isuzu in the Mendlesham area with the cash machine on the back. The offenders abandoned this vehicle in a road off the A140, where they got into a silver Audi A5 without number plates and made off from the officers.

Both the JCB and the Isuzu were stolen at some time after 9.30pm the previous evening (25 February), from a farm in Stowupland.

An Audi A5 was stolen during a burglary at a property in Harefield, Long Melford, at around 10.40pm on Saturday 24 February and it is possible that this was the vehicle used during this incident, however as the Audi involved has not yet been located and did not have number plates, this is not confirmed.

Anyone with information about this ram raid, or the vehicle thefts in Stowupland and Long Melford, is asked to contact East CID at Lowestoft Police Station on 101 quoting reference 10943/18, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
