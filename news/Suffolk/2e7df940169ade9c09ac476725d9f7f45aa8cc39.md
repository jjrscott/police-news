Police are appealing for witnesses after a man was assaulted in Newmarket.

Officers were called last night, Monday 3 December to reports of an assault on Weston Way in the town.

At around 8.40pm, the victim was at home when he heard and saw a number of men causing a disturbance near to his car outside. He went to investigate and was pushed over a hedge and then punched and kicked by one of the men. All three men then got back into their car and drove off in the direction of Fordham Road.

The suspects are described as black men who were wearing dark clothing and baseball caps.

The victim sustained minor injuries and was very shaken as a result of the incident.

Witnesses or anybody with any information is asked to call police on 101 quoting reference 69953/18. Alternatively, call the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
