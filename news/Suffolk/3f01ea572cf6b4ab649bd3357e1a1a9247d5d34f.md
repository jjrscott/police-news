Police have charged two men after a burglary in Lowestoft.

Officers were called to a report of a burglary on Uplands Road North in Carlton Colville in Lowestoft at 5.35pm on Wednesday 5 December. Entry had been forced and a wide screen television, iMac computer, iPad, laptop jewellery and travel documents were stolen from the property.

Later the same evening, two men in their 30s from Lowestoft were arrested on suspicion of burglary. A local woman was also arrested on suspicion of handling stolen property. All three people were taken to Great Yarmouth Police Investigation Centre for questioning by officers. Later the same day, a fourth man, aged in his 20s was also arrested and taken into custody for questioning.

22 year old Christopher Edgington of Eastwood Avenue in Lowestoft was subsequently charged with burglary. 39 year old Ronnie Bridges of Summerfield Gardens in Lowestoft was also charged with the same burglary. He was also charged with a separate burglary that took place at a property on Barn Close in Carlton Colville on 12 April 2018 where cash, jewellery, watches and clothing were stolen.

Both will appear before Norwich magistrates court this morning (Friday 7 December).
