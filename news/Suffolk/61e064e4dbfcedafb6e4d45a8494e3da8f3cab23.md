A 33-year-old man has been jailed for 16 weeks after pleading guilty to setting up an online false dating profile for a former partner and a posting an intimate photograph of her to the web.

Carl Muir, 33, of Victory Avenue, Poringland, Norwich, was charged with disclosing a private sexual photograph or film without consent, with intent to cause distress.

He was jailed after appearing before Norwich magistrates court on December 8. He had previously pleaded guilty to the offence and was jailed as the abuse was continuing to impact on his victim. A five-year restraining order was also put in place prohibiting him from contacting his former partner, from going near her home in the Southwold area, posting or sending any images of her online, or retaining any intimate photographs.

Around 8am on August 8, the young woman, who had previously been in a relationship with Muir, started receiving text messages to her mobile phone, and via What’s App, from unknown numbers, asking about her profile. She asked who they were and what they were referring to and discovered a profile had been set up posting private photographs and her contact details, without her consent.

Police were contacted and an investigation by officers revealed Muir to be responsible.

In addition to being jailed for 16 weeks Muir was also ordered to pay costs of £300 and compensation of £500.
