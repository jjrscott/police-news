Police are appealing for witnesses after a number of sheep were killed in the East Bergholt area.

Officers received a report of a number of sheep killed or badly injured in the East Bergholt area on land where livestock grazes in the Dazeley's Lane area. The incident took place at some point between Sunday 20 December early afternoon and Monday 21 Dec at 8am. Around 16 were found dead at the time and around 30 others will need to be put down as a consequence of their injuries.

It is strongly suspected that dogs off a lead had committed the attack on the sheep.

Sgt Brian Calver from the Rural And Wildlife Crime Team: "This is by far the worst case of an attack of sheep I have come across. The suffering the animals must have gone through would have been terrible. Dog ownership is a responsible thing so please remember, dogs that are allowed to worry livestock on agricultural land is an offence Dogs Worrying Livestock Act. Anyone who saw the dogs that were responsible or can describe them please get in touch with us.”

Enquiries are on-going into the incident and anyone with information as to who was responsible or who saw dogs off leads in the area at the time should contact Suffolk police, quoting crime reference 37/73715/20.
