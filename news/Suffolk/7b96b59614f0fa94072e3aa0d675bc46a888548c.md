Police are releasing CCTV images of two men officers would like to speak to after a 60-year-old woman had her purse stolen.

The woman was shopping at a store off Ransomes Way in Ipswich around 11am â€“ 11.40am on Friday 17 June. A short time later she realised her purse had been stolen from her bag.

A card from the purse was used to withdraw cash before the cards were cancelled.

Police are keen to speak to the two men seen on CCTV and are asking anyone who may recognise them to come forward.

If you have any information about who they are please contact the Investigation Crime Management Hub at Suffolk Police by dialling **101** , quoting crime number 40552/16.
