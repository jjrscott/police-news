Police are issuing three CCTV images of two males they would like to speak to in connection with two incidents in Ipswich.

The first incident occurred between 10pm and 11pm on Wednesday 28 September in Helena Road.

During the times stated, a rowing boat was taken without consent from Ipswich Sea Cadets by two suspects. The boat was then used to row across the marina.

The second incident occurred between 10.45pm and 11pm within a houseboat on Ipswich Haven Marina.

Two male suspects entered a houseboat through an unlocked door and attempted to steal bottles of alcohol. The occupant, who was disturbed when sleeping, then shouted at the two males, causing them to leave behind the bottles and run from the houseboat. The rowing boat was left behind.

The first suspect is described as being a white male and around 5ft 8ins. He was wearing an orange hoody with black tracksuit bottoms, a black baseball cap and grey trainers.

The second suspect was also a white male and was wearing a light grey hoody and black jeans. He appeared to be slightly younger than the other male.

Officers would like to speak to the two males pictured in the CCTV images about both incidents as they may be able to help with the investigation.

Anyone who believes they recognise the males pictured in the CCTV images, or who has any information about these incidents, is asked to contact Suffolk police, quoting crime reference: 37/56572/20 (burglary) and 37/56571/20 (rowing boat).
