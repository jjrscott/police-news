Detectives are appealing for witnesses following an aggravated burglary in Ipswich.

The incident took place at a property on Bilberry Road in the town on Friday 29 September at just after 8pm. The victim was at home when he heard a noise in his back garden. He went to investigate and was confronted by two men. One of the offenders was carrying a short hollow metal bar which he used to hit the victim around the head with. The victim ran through the house and left via the front door, chased by the suspects.

The two men then damaged an X-Box console in the property before leaving.

The victim sustained a laceration to the top of his forehead which required treatment in hospital.

The first suspect is described as a mixed race man, in his late twenties, around six feet tall, medium build who spoke with a London accent. He was reported as wearing a dark grey hooded top and a black ski mask covering the lower part of his face which had a white ‘skeleton’ mouth design.

The second suspect is described a mixed race man, in his late twenties, over six feet tall who was wearing a navy blue ski mask.

Witnesses or anybody who has any information are asked to call Suffolk Police on **101** quoting reference 64059/17. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
