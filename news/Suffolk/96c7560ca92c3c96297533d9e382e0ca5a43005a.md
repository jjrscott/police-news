Officers are appealing for information or witnesses following a road collision on the A12, Great Wenham.

Police were called to a collision involving three vehicles on Thursday 28 September at 7.35am on the northbound carriageway of the A12 at Great Wenham, just south of Capel St Mary. Two vehicles, a silver Peugeot Partner van and a blue Peugeot 207 car which were involved in the collision remained at the scene but a third vehicle failed to stop. Officers are keen to trace a Ford Transit tipper type vehicle with a dropside.

Drivers of both vehicles were taken to hospital with minor injuries.

Witnesses or drivers who may have dash-camera footage of the incident or of the Ford Transit are asked to telephone Suffolk Police on 101 quoting reference CAD 46 of 28 September.
