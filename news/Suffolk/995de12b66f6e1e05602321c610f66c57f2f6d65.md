Police are urging residents to be vigilant after an elderly woman was targeted by telephone scammers.

The incident was reported to police on Tuesday 10 March, by a bank in Bury St Edmunds, after a woman, aged in her 80s, from a nearby village, was persuaded to transfer a large sum of money by telephone scammers pretending to be from the fraud department.

The woman was also persuaded to withdraw some of the cash and it was later collected by a female courier.

Courier fraud occurs when a fraudster contacts a victim by telephone and purports to be a police officer, bank or from a government department, among other agencies.

A number of techniques will then be adopted in order to convince the victim to hand over their bank details or cash, which may then be passed on to a courier.

Officers are urging residents not to hand over cash or cards to callers under similar circumstances.

Scammers are known to make calls like this to convince people into handing over money, bank cards or personal information.

Police are keen to hear from anyone who may have received a similar type of telephone call or have any information about this incident.

Anyone with any information should contact Suffolk police, quoting crime number: 37/15013/20

Residents are reminded that neither your bank nor the police will ever ask you to withdraw money or purchase items. Further advice is offered below.

• Your bank or the police will never ask for your PIN, bank card or bank account details over the phone – never give these details to anybody.
• Neither the police nor the banks will send a courier to collect money from you.
• Always request Photo ID and if unsure call the police.
• If you're asked to telephone a bank, then always do it on a different phone to the one you were contacted on. Fraudsters will keep the line open and have been known to play ringtones, hold music and a recorded message down the phone so the victim believes they are making a call to a legitimate number. Use a friend or neighbour's telephone instead.
• Never download any software suggested by caller.
• Do not rush into complying to the scammers demands / requests.
• Friends, family, carers and neighbours are asked to spread the word to ensure everyone is aware of this scam and what they should do.
• If you have already given your bank details over the phone or handed your card details to a courier, call you bank straight away to cancel the card.
