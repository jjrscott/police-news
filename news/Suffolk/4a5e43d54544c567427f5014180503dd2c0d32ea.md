Three people have been arrested after a woman was robbed at knifepoint in Tuddenham Road in Ipswich.

The woman, in her 60s, was waiting at a bus stop there around 5.15pm yesterday, Wednesday 3 August, when she was approached, threatened with a knife and had her handbag stolen.

It’s thought the offender may have run away and got into a vehicle and that this vehicle headed off along Tuddenham Road. The victim’s bag – described as a brown leather handbag which had mobile phone holder built into the strap – remains missing and police are asking anyone who may find it to get in touch.

Police began enquiries and three people were arrested in the early hours of this morning, Thursday 4.

A 31-year-old man from the Stowmarket area, a 31-year-old woman from Ipswich and a 25-year-old man from Ipswich are currently in custody at Martlesham Police Investigation Centre where they will be interviewed by detectives in connection with the incident. All three were arrested on suspicion of robbery.

Police are asking anyone who may have seen the incident, who has not yet spoken to officers, or anyone who may have information to call Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting crime number 48255/16.
