Police are again warning residents to be careful online after receiving several recent reports of men being blackmailed after committing sexual acts via web cam.

Officers have been made aware of men being approached via social media such as Facebook by a woman who has then transferred the conversation to Skype where it has become more personal. She has then undressed and has encourage the man to engage in sexual activity.

Soon afterwards a demand for a large sum of money has been made – often for thousands of pounds to be transferred to an account outside the UK – with the threat that the footage will be released to family, friends, colleagues and the wider public if this is not paid.

Police are urging all residents to be careful online and to be aware of this and other online frauds.
