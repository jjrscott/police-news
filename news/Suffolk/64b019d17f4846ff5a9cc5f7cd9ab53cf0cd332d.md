Officers are appealing for information following an incident in Playford in which a dog worried livestock.

The incident took place in a meadow in the village at some point overnight between Wednesday 24 April and Thursday 25 April.

It is believed that a dog entered the meadow and then chased and attacked a flock of sheep. A lamb was found deceased as a result of the incident.

Police are reminding dog owners to take appropriate steps to keep their pets under control as they are responsible for them and their conduct when out walking.

Witnesses or anybody with any information should contact PC Kevin Stollery on 101, quoting crime reference 37/24419/19 or email [email protected]uk

Alternatively, contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
