Police are appealing for witnesses and information following a fail-to-stop collision near Levington.

Officers were called shortly after 9am today, Wednesday 6 December, to reports of a collision between a vehicle and a pedestrian on Felixstowe Road.

The pedestrian, a man in his 20s, was out of his vehicle (a white Citroen van) when he was struck by a vehicle travelling in the direction of Trimley St Martin.

The vehicle involved in this collision failed to stop, and is believed to be a small silver car. Police are making enquiries to trace this vehicle, which may have sustained damage as a result of the collision.

The man was taken to hospital via ambulance and is reported to be in a serious but stable condition.

Officers are keen to speak to anyone who may have seen the collision or who may have information about the vehicle or driver involved.

If you can help, please contact the roads policing team at Suffolk Police on 101 quoting CAD 87 of 6 December.
