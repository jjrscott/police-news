Police are appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Ipswich.

The incident occurred at around 2.15pm yesterday, Monday 10 December, in a car park next to the New Wolsey Theatre off Black Horse Lane and Chapman Lane.

The victim – a man aged in his 20s – was walking from the direction of the theatre through the car park towards Westgate Street when an unknown male approached him and requested the victim to give him his backpack.

At this point, the victim refused and the offender produced a knife. The pair then became involved in a struggle and the offender threatened the victim before stealing the backpack. The victim was left shaken by the incident but was physically unharmed.

The male suspect is described as white, aged between 15 and 18 years of age, between 5ft 10ins and 5ft 11ins, of a slim build with brown hair and wispy facial hair. He was wearing a grey hooded top with a white zip and white toggles with the hood up.

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to contact South CID on 101 quoting reference 71403/18.

Alternatively, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
