Police are investigating a break in at a home in Ipswich last night, Wednesday 26 October.

The incident took place at approximately 11:45pm on St Johns Road, where a woman heard the sound of her bedroom door being opened. She saw the outline of an unknown man who then ran out of the room after she called out. As it was dark, the victim was only able to confirm the burglar was bald and of average height.

The suspect gained entry into the property via the conservatory and then broke through the secured internal doors using an axe, which belonged to the victim. It is thought he then escaped by the front door. Nothing appears to have been taken at this stage.

Police are appealing to anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious to come forward. Anyone with information should contact Ipswich CID on 101 quoting reference 62902/16, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on **0800 555 111.**

Police are also reminding residents to keep all doors and windows secured at night, and any tools and equipment that could aid a burglar locked away and out of sight.
