Police are appealing for witnesses following a burglary on Sandy Lane in Barningham, near Bury St Edmunds.

The offender is described as a white male in his mid-20s and was wearing a cap.

Police would be interested in speaking to anyone who may have witnessed this incident, been approached in the same manner or who may have seen anyone acting suspiciously in the area around the time of the offence.
