Officers are appealing for witnesses or information following a robbery at a shop in Eye last night.

Police were called at around 9pm on Wednesday 9 May to reports that a robbery had taken place at the Co-Operative shop on Church Street in the town.

At around 8.50pm two offenders entered the rear of the business premises and approached a woman shop worker in the office, instructing her to open the safe. The woman complied with the demand and the suspects stole a quantity of notes and coins from the safe which they put into a JD sports bag before fleeing the scene on foot.

Although nobody was hurt during the incident the shop worker was left very shaken as a result.

The suspects were described as a man and possibly a woman who were both wearing face coverings.

Witnesses, or anybody who saw anything suspicious around the time above are asked to call Police on 101 quoting reference 25263/18. Alternatively, call the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
