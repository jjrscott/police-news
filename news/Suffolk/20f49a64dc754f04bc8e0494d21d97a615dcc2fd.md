Police investigating a number of thefts of motorbikes which were advertised for sale online have arrested two people in connection with the incidents.

The most recent crime occurred at 2.45pm on Thursday 3 December in Warren Close, Brandon.

The victim had advertised an orange and black KTM 250cc off-road motorcycle for sale on Facebook marketplace. He was contacted by a man who was interested in buying the bike and a price was agreed upon.

The suspect claimed that he lived in Warren Close and an arrangement was made to meet there to make the exchange. The victim had put a small amount of fuel in the bike so he could demonstrate the engine, at which point the offender jumped on the bike and rode off, making no attempt to pay the outstanding balance.

This incident is being linked with another eight similar offences, one of which was also in Brandon with the other seven taking place in Bury St Edmunds.

On Saturday 12 December, officers arrested two men from Bury St Edmunds – aged 36 and 29 – on suspicion of nine offences of theft of a motor vehicle and they were taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre for questioning.

The 36-year-old has been released on bail until Monday 4 January, with the 29-year-old released under investigation, pending further enquiries.

Anyone with information about these thefts is asked to contact Mildenhall Neighbourhood Response Team, quoting reference: 70160/20.
