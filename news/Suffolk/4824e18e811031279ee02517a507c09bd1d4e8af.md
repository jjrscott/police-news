Officers are appealing for witnesses or information after a teenage boy was assaulted in Carlton Colville.

The incident took place on Thursday 6 August at around 11pm in the Carlton Meadow skate park on Lowestoft Road. A 17-year old boy was approached by a man who punched him in the face before walking off in the direction of the carpark.

The victim sustained a black eye as a result of the incident and believes that the suspect mistook him for somebody else.

The suspect is described as a white man, aged between 45-50 years, 6 feet 1inches tall, stocky build, dark thinning hair with tattoos on his left arm. He was wearing a red t-shirt and black jogging bottoms.

Witnesses or anyone who recognises the description of the man involved is asked to contact Lowestoft Police, quoting reference 45449/20
