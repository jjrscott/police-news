A 38-year-old man has been sentenced to eight weeks in prison, suspended for 12 months, for stealing Royal British Legion charity boxes in Haverhill.

David Kemp, now of Birmingham, but formerly of Fritton Court, Haverhill, was charged with three counts of theft in Haverhill in October and November last year.

Poppy appeal collection boxes were stolen from the Londis supermarket in Gloucester Road, Haverhill, on October 28; the Clements Primary Academy, Greenfields Way, Haverhill, on November 9; and the Arts Centre in Haverhill Town Hall on November 10.

Kemp admitted the charges when he appeared before Birmingham Magistrates’ Court on May 30. The case was moved to Birmingham after an earlier hearing on May 15 before Ipswich Magistrates’ Court.
