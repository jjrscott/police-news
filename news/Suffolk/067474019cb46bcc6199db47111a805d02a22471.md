Two of Suffolk’s Special Constabulary team provided a special escort for a young man to get to his prom recently.

Farlingaye High pupil George Docker - who receives care from EACH (East Anglia’s Children’s Hospices) as he lives with an undiagnosed condition, which includes a form of cerebral palsy, chronic lung disease, epilepsy and a bleeding disorder called factor X1 deficiency - was looking forward to his end-of-year prom and Suffolk Police were approached to see if they could assist with making the evening even more special for the 15-year-old.

Suffolk’s Special Constabulary volunteers agreed to assist and on Friday 23 June Special Superintendent Paul Smith and Special Inspector Martyn Fulcher arrived at George’s home to collect him in a marked police car to take him and his two carers to the prom held at Wherstead Park.

> **Andrew Docker, George’s dad said;** “We were asked by the hospice how George wanted to travel to the prom – perhaps in a limousine – but all he wanted was to be able to go in a police car. We mentioned this to the hospice and the next thing we knew was the police car arrived to take him. It was unbelievable – his face was a picture. When the siren went on he was in awe of it and when they let put the hat on he loved it. The officers that came along were a credit to the police – they were absolutely marvellous.”

> **Special Supt Paul Smith said;** “We spent some great time with George and his lovely family at their home, it was a pleasure and we are pleased we were able to help.”

EACH support families and care for children with life threatening conditions across Suffolk, Essex, Cambridgeshire and Norfolk, and have a hospice in Ipswich – The Treehouse. They rely on voluntary donations for the majority of their income and work to provide specialist care, activities and therapies to meet the needs of young people and their families.
