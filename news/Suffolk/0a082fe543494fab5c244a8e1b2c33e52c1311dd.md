Police are appealing for witnesses after two burglaries in Ipswich which are being linked.

The first incident took place in Bramford Lane on Monday 12 November. The property was left locked at 10.15am and the resident returned at 1.15pm to find she had been burgled. The victim realised entry had been gained via a rear dining room window that had been smashed. An untidy search of the property had taken place with drawers and cupboards opened and the contents turned out. The shed in the back garden was also broken into. It is currently unclear what was stolen.

It is being linked to a burglary that took place at another property on Bramford Road on the same day (Mon 12 November).

Between 8.30am and 3.20pm entry has been gained via a rear UPVC door which was smashed via unknown means. The offender(s) have then reached through the smashed glass to open the door with the aid of the key on the inside. An untidy search has taken place in all rooms within the property. Again, it is unknown at this stage what items have been stolen.

Anyone, who witnessed with incident or saw any suspicious activity during the times stated should contact Ipswich CID on 101, quoting crime reference 37/65538/18 for the first one and 37/65604/18 for the second incident.

Alternatively, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
