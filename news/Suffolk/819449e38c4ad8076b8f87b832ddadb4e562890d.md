A community engagement day is being held at the Tesco store at Martlesham Heath next week – with the mobile police station being set up outside and new student police officers on hand to give crime reduction advice.

The day, being held next Wednesday, 9 November, between 9.30am and 3pm, forms part of the student officers’ training, giving the opportunity for them to organise the event and to engage with residents and shoppers. They will be available to help with crime reduction advice and will be able to have a chat about the steps you can take to protect your home and property from criminals, as well as answering any questions you may have on the subject or local policing.

With the darker nights and Christmas approaching, the team will be focusing on the prevention of burglaries, with advice and information about home security – what you can do to reduce the chances of your home being burgled – being given out.

The new officers will be joined by representatives from the Constabulary’s Community Safety team and will have more information about the Suffolk SafeKey scheme too.

The group of student officers will also be taking part in various role plays around the Martlesham Heath area.

All are welcome along to Tesco next Wednesday to have a chat or to get information.
