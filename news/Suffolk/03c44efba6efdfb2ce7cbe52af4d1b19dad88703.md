Over the summer months, police see an increase in anti-social behaviour (ASB) in our communities. To response proactively, a team of officers from across the Southern area of the Constabulary are being brought together to carry out anti-social behaviour patrols in targeted locations.

Officers drawn from the local area will identify hotspots of concern and set out to engage with members of the local community including both victims of ASB and offenders. This will provide visible reassurance to the public as well as increasing intelligence gathering related to those involved in anti-social behaviour in certain areas.

Police will take appropriate action against those involved in anti-social behaviour including visits to offenders and their families, issuing warning letters or arresting suspects as appropriate.

Officers also work with partner agencies to positively divert and protect those who are involved in ASB to prevent more serious offending.

Sergeant Dominic Mann said, "We understand the negative impact that anti-social behaviour can have on communities and tackling it remains a force priority. Safer Neighbourhood Teams deal with youth based ASB, street-drinking, begging and the anti-social use of motorbikes and vehicles. This action plan will focus on all of these areas and will aim to positively engage with those involved to deter offending. For those who are unwilling to respect their communities, we will also take positive, appropriate action against them. "
