Police are appealing for witnesses after two people were assaulted in Lowestoft.

The incident took place around just before midnight on Friday 28 August on Bridge Road, near to the junction of The Boulevard near Oulton Broad.

A man and a woman walking with others on Bridge Street were approached by a large group of approximately 15 people who were unknown to them. Both victims were then punched in the face by two members of the group. The man sustained a split lip and nose bleed, and the woman was not injured. The suspects are described as a white woman and a white man who was wearing a navy jumper and possibly carrying a black shoulder bag.

Witnesses or anybody with any information are asked to contact Lowestoft Police quoting reference 37/50222/20
