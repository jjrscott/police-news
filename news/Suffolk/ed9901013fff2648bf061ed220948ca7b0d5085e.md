A 24-year-old man from Lowestoft has been jailed for 38 months for Class A and B drugs offences.

Toby Crossman of Beaconsfield Road, Lowestoft, appeared at Ipswich Crown Court on Wednesday 7 February where he pleaded guilty to the following three charges: possession with intent to supply heroin; possession with intent to supply cocaine and possession of cannabis.

Crossman was arrested on 8 November 2017 after officers from the pro-active Scorpion Team executed a warrant at an address in Lowestoft under the Misuse of Drugs Act.

As a result of the warrant more than thirty drug wraps were found, while cash and two mobile phones were seized.

PC Jade Daly of the Scorpion East team said: "This is a great result achieved by intelligence-led policing.

"This sentence is a warning to anyone involved in dealing drugs within the county that we are committed to tackling drugs supply and associated activities.
