Police need to trace a man with blond hair in a quiff style at the front after a 10-year-old boy was approached in Trimley St Mary.

The incident happened around 4.40pm on Wednesday, 29 June, as the boy stood just outside the play park in Faulkeners Way.

The man, who was driving a black Transit-style panel van with tinted windows with white lettering on the side, pulled up alongside the boy and spoke to him. The boy ran away and the man then drove away.

There may be an innocent explanation for the incident but police need to trace the man involved, who is thought to be in his mid 20s to mid 30s and who may have had tan lines to his face where he had been wearing glasses, but was not wearing them at the time of the incident.

Officers are asking the man himself, anyone who may recognise the description, or anyone who may have been in the area around this time, to call officers at Felixstowe Safer Neighbourhood Team by dialling Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting crime number 41819/16.
