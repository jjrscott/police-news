A Suffolk Police officer Pc Nicola Burnham-Slipper ‘braved the shave’ on Wednesday, 3 May, to raise funds for a local Macmillan Centre.

The officer had her head shaved to raise money for the Woolverstone Macmillan Centre in Ipswich in memory of her late father, who fought cancer for eight years.

He was supported by staff at Ipswich Hospital, where the Woolverstone Centre has been set up.

> **Nicola says;** “During those years it was very tough on him and us as a family, but we had support from the fantastic nurses in the oncology department at Ipswich hospital when dad was having his chemotherapy.
>
> “It was not something you would want to see your loved one go through, however the nurses, no matter what was happening behind the scenes always provided a smile and reassurance to dad and to me. When dad passed away, it was a shock to all and I never truly thanked the staff fully enough for their efforts.
>
> “We raised over £500 at his funeral to the Woolverstone Wish appeal to help towards a new chemotherapy area. They are now named the Woolverstone Macmillan centre. I wanted to celebrate dad's life in a positive way by helping them again.”

Nicola has been collecting from colleagues at work, and has so far raised more than £600 but contributions can also be made at: https://bravetheshave.org.uk/shavers/nicola-rush/
