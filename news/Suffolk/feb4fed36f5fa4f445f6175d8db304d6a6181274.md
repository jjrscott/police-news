One man has died in a road traffic collision that took place in Bury St Edmunds.

It happened on Tuesday 15 January at about 3.25pm on Tayfen Road (A1302).

The collision took place between a car, a grey ford Focus, and a red mobility scooter.

An elderly male in his 90s who was driving the mobility scooter, was taken to West Suffolk hospital for treatment but sadly died of his injuries on Monday 21 January.

Anyone who witnessed the collision or anyone who was driving in the area at the time of the collision with dash-cam footage should contact the Serious Collision Investigation Team quoting CAD 211 of 15 January 2019.
