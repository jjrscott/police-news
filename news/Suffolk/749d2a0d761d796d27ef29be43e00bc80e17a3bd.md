Two people have been arrested on suspicion of modern slavery offences following a warrant in Ipswich.

The arrests were made on Wednesday 8 August following a pre-planned operation. A warrant and search were conducted at a premises on Foxall Road yesterday morning.

Officers made two arrests at the location – a 49 year old man and 18 year old man were both arrested at the premises on suspicion of slavery, servitude and forced or compulsory labour as well as on suspicion of money laundering.

They were taken to Martlesham police investigation Centre for questioning and were later released on police bail until Wednesday 29 August pending further enquiries.

A large quantity of paperwork and a quantity of cash were recovered at the scene which have been seized. No victims were located at the premises.

DI Holly Evans said: "These arrests came about as a result of information we received form a number of sources. Modern slavery is hidden in every community and in many cases the victims are very vulnerable and are specifically targeted by their exploiters. It takes many forms but the most common include criminal exploitation, sexual exploitation, forced labour and domestic servitude.”
