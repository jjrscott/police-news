A Lowestoft man has been sentenced to three years in prison for actual bodily harm following a collision in Lowestoft last year.

Duane Manchester, aged 32, of Larch Road in Lowestoft, was handed a three year sentence at Ipswich Crown Court today after driving a Land Rover into a male pedestrian on Norwich Road.

Following an argument with the driver, the pedestrian, who was known to the driver, was pursued and hit by the vehicle. The victim suffered cuts and bruises as a result of the collision, which took place during the afternoon of 10 November last year.

Manchester was also sentenced to 15 months for dangerous driving, was disqualified from driving for 18 months and was sentenced to two months for criminal damage to the newsagent’s shop, to be served concurrently.

DC Chris Thompson of Lowestoft CID says, "Fortunately, targeted incidents like this are rare and hopefully the victim will be relieved to know that Manchester is behind bars for a significant period of time.”
