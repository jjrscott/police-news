Police are appealing for witnesses following a single vehicle collision in Ipswich.

Officers were called at approximately 8:15pm yesterday, Sunday 29 January, to reports that a car had collided with a sign on the off-slip to the filling station, just prior to the Orwell Bridge, on the A14 westbound at Nacton.

The driver and two passengers of the silver Hyundai sustained minor injuries and were taken to Ipswich Hospital. A third passenger, a young child, suffered a chest injury and has been transferred to Addenbrooks Hospital for treatment.

An investigation into the circumstances of the collision is underway and police are appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the collision to contact Suffolk Police on **101** quoting CAD 300 of 29 January.
