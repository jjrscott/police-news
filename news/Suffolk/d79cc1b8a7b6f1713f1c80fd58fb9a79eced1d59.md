Police are appealing for information after a 10-year-old girl reported being approached by a man in the Chantry area of Ipswich.

The incident occurred sometime between 8:30am and 8:40am yesterday, Thursday 16 March, near Downing Close.

The girl was climbing the off-road concrete stairs when a man approached her and tried to encourage her to go to him.

The girl felt uncomfortable about the situation and ran up the stairs. When she looked back, the man was running in the opposite direction.

There may be an innocent explanation for this but police need to trace the man and are urging him, or anyone who knows who he is, to come forward.

If you can help please call the Incident and Crime Management Hub at Suffolk Police on **101** quoting reference 23370/17.
