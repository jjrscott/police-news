Suffolk Police are asking people to hand in their guns, as they support a national surrender on firearms and ammunition.

It will run from 13 – 26 November 2017 in a bid to reduce the availability of illegal firearms to criminals, reduce the number of illegal firearms within local supply chains and ultimately reduce firearm offences in the county.

During this time members of the public will be able to hand over unlicensed weapons without fear of prosecution. This includes replica firearms, air weapons, BB guns, imitation firearms, component parts and other ballistic items currently lawfully held.

Richard Kennett, Firearms Licensing Manager for Norfolk and Suffolk Constabularies, said: "Some people may have un-registered, old weapons that they have forgotten about, or have received one through inheritance that they no longer use, or that they don’t know what to do with.

“Although such weapons aren’t being used for crimes, it’s important that they are handed in to the police to stop them from falling into the wrong hands.

"Fortunately we don’t have a big problem with gun crime in Suffolk, and reducing the amount of illegally owned firearms across the county will help reduce the threat of gun crime even further.”

Firearms can be surrendered at any police station, but people are encouraged to take them to their nearest Public Enquiry Office (PEO).

In Suffolk these are:

 * Police HQ – Martlesham
 * Bury St. Edmunds
 * Ipswich
 * Lowestoft

Residents should make sure that the firearm is unloaded and covered up, and if possible people are asked to ring the police beforehand on **101** to let officers know that they are bringing a gun in as part of the operation.

Tim Passmore, the Police and Crime Commissioner for Suffolk Constabulary, said: "I fully support the Constabulary’s firearms surrender. We live in a rural county and I know that people end up with guns that they don’t know what to do with; this is an ideal opportunity to safely dispose of them.

“I appreciate these guns are not used for crime but the less guns in the county the less likely they are to fall into the wrong hands.”

## FAQs

 _Yes, on arrival at the station you will be asked if you are willing to sign a disclaimer. However, we will still accept the gun even if you don’t want to sign it._

 **Will I be prosecuted for handing in an illegal firearm?**

 _People who hand in guns at a police station during 13 – 26 November will avoid prosecution for owning an unlicensed firearm._

 _However,_ _if police suspect that the weapon has been used in a crime, the firearm’s history will be searched and prosecutions could be made in relation to any investigation that the weapon is linked to._

 _Immunity from prosecution only occurs at the point of surrender; anyone in possession of a firearm prior to surrendering could still be investigated and therefore may still be prosecuted._

 * _Anyone who owns a licensed firearm that they no longer have a use or need for._
 * _People who have a weapon of any kind that they wish to hand over to police._
 * _People who are no longer legally allowed to own firearms due to legislation._ _People who own registered antique firearms who have not served a custodial sentence of more than three months, or who have not received a suspended sentence of three months to three years, do not need to surrender their firearms._

 _BB guns, air weapons, imitation and replica firearms, both legally and illegally owned firearms, ammunition, and component parts, can all be handed in._
