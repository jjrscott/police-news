Police are appealing for information in connection with an assault, whereby a cyclist was driven at by a motorist in Bungay last week.

The incident occurred between 7pm and 7.30pm on Thursday 7 January in Market Place.

The victim – a man aged in his 20s – was cycling along Trinity Street, where he was cut-up by a car outside Wightman’s shop. He caught the motorist up in Market Place and remonstrated with him about the incident which had just taken place.

The motorist then drove the car into the cyclist and knocked him off his bike, before driving away. This resulted in the cyclist sustaining elbow, knee and hand injuries.

The suspect is described as a white man aged in his 40s or 50s and of heavy build. He was driving a black, soft-top convertible car - possibly a three-door Mercedes.

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to contact the Crime Coordination Team, quoting reference: 1724/21.
