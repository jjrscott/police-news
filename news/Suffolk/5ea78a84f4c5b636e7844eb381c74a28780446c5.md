Police are appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Felixstowe.

The incident occurred shortly before 9pm yesterday, Thursday 31 January, at property in Glemsford Close.

The victim – a man aged in his 50s – heard his doorbell and as he answered the door, three masked males forced entry into his home and asked him to get on the floor. A search was carried out within by the males and a number of items were stolen including a wallet, iPad and an amount of cash.

As a result of the incident, the victim was left shaken but was physically unharmed.

The victim described the suspects as male, 5ft 8ins, who were all wearing black hoodies with the hoods up and with masks across their faces. One of the suspects had a tanned complexion and the other two suspects were white. The victim described one of the suspects as having a northern accent.

Anyone with information about this incident should contact South CID on 101 quoting reference 6243/19.
