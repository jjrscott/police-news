Police are appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Lowestoft.

The incident took place in South View Close between 4pm and 4.15pm on Friday 26 July.

The victim – a 13-year-old boy – was walking home with his BMX bike and a group of friends, when they saw a group of unknown males approaching. The boy tried to hide in some bushes but he was discovered by the males who then demanded his bike, money, mobile phone and his trainers.

One of the males then pushed the boy to the floor and while he was on the floor, the other boys punched him and removed his Nike Air Trainers. The boy then managed to free himself and run away.

As a result of the incident, the boy sustained bruising to his eye, left bicep and lower back.

The group of male suspects are all described as white, aged between 13 and 16-years-old. One or two of the males had red hair and some of the other males had blond or brown hair. The group of males were described as wearing either t-shirts or hoodies.

Anyone with any information about this incident is asked to contact East CID quoting crime reference 37/44074/19
