Police are appealing for information after a robbery at the home of a man in his 70s in Bury St Edmunds yesterday.

Officers were called around 5.35pm yesterday, Tuesday 3 January, to reports four men had gone into the home of the pensioner in Mitchell Avenue. They had knocked at the door and claimed they worked for the water board before barging into the property after the resident asked to see their identification.

One of the men then held the resident down while the other three carried out a search of the address. The resident managed to get away and raise the alarm but his home was ransacked before the offenders fled. The man was left very shaken but uninjured.

At this stage itâ€™s not clear what was stolen and detectives are continuing to work with the resident to get more information about the offenders who have been initially all been described as wearing dark scarves partially over their face and dark hats. One is believed to have worn a green flat cap and all are thought to be white and possibly in their 20s.

The incident is believed to have started around 5pm and police are keen to hear from anyone who may have been in the area between 4.30pm and 6pm who may have seen anything unusual that may be linked to what happened.

Detectives are asking anyone with information about the incident or those involved to call Bury St Edmunds CID by dialling Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting crime number 10469/17. Alternatively you can called Crimestoppers, anonymously if required, on **0800 555 111**.
