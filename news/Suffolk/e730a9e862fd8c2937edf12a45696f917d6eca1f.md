Police investigating an affray incident in Duke Street in Ipswich in July are asking anyone with information to come forward.

Officers are also releasing a CCTV image of a man they wish to speak to in connection with the incident.

A 33-year-old man was arrested last month on suspicion of affray following the altercation around 9am â€“ 9.20am on Wednesday 13 July. He has now been bailed to return to police on November 1 as enquiries continue.

Police were initially called to reports of a fight around 9.20am that morning and a man was located lying in an alleyway there. Further enquiries revealed there had been three men involved in the incident and work is ongoing to trace and talk to anyone who may have been there.

Officers are asking anyone who may have seen anything in the vicinity around this time to come forward and would also like to speak to anyone who may recognise the man pictured, who police would like to talk to.

If you can help please call PC Trevor Spinlove at Ipswich by dialling Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting crime reference 44202/16.
