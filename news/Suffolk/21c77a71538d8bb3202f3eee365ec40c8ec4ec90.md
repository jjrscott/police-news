Police are appealing for witnesses after a man was seen acting in an indecent manner in a neighbourhood park in the Chantry area of Ipswich.

Officers were called around 3:40pm on Sunday 2 July after a man in his 20s reported seeing an older man with his trousers pulled down, exposing himself and acting in an indecent manner, near the pond in Stonelodge Park.

He challenged the suspect who, after a brief exchange, fled in the direction of Manchester Road.

The suspect is described as white, in his late 50s or early 60s, with stubble and dark, greying hair. He was wearing caramel-coloured trousers and a black short-sleeved T-shirt.

Officers would like to hear from anyone who may have seen someone matching this description in the area at the time stated, or who may have information to assist the investigation.

Anyone with information should contact the Incident and Crime Management Hub at Suffolk Police on 101 quoting reference number 46057/17.
