Police are appealing for witnesses and information following a burglary in Ipswich.

Officers were called on Monday 15 May to reports that two men had entered a property in Garrick Way at some point between 2:30pm and 2:45pm.

The victim walked into the kitchen and saw the men who then fled the scene via the rear garden and side gate. Nothing is believed to have been stolen.

Both men are described as white, with dark hair. One of the men was wearing a maroon-coloured shirt.

Police are urging members of the public to ensure doors and windows are locked to reduce the chances of your home being targeted by opportunist thieves. If you see suspect people or vehicles at a neighbourâ€™s house, note down a description of them or the vehicle registration. If you believe a burglary to be in progress always dial 999.

Police would like to hear from anyone who may have seen or heard any suspicious activity in the area around the times specified.

Anyone with any information should contact CID South at Suffolk Police on 101 quoting reference number 35871/17.
