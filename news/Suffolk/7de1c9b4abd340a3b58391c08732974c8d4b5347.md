Police are appealing for witnesses and information following two burglaries that took place in rural locations in the west of the county.

Both break-ins occurred on Tuesday, 23 May, and are thought to have taken place at some point between 8am and 8pm.

During this time, offenders forced entry to a residence in The Green, Little Thurlow. A search was made throughout the premises. A quantity of jewellery, a laptop and silverware were among the items stolen.

Officers are investigating whether this is linked to a second break-in where offenders forced entry into a home in Greys Lane, Barnardiston. Items stolen included a quantity of jewellery and a desktop computer.

Police are urging residents to keep their homes secure to avoid becoming an easy target for thieves. Members of the public are also reminded to activate tracker apps on the computers and mobile phones, and to take photographs of jewellery, to assist in the recovery of stolen goods.

Detectives are appealing for anyone who may have seen any suspicious persons or vehicles in any of the locations above on Tuesday to contact them.

Anyone with information is asked to contact CID West at Suffolk Police on **101** quoting references 36992/17 (Little Thurlow) and 36991/17 (Barnardiston).
