Police are appealing for information after a taxi driver was robbed at knifepoint in Ipswich in the early hours of this morning.

The incident happened at Cecil Road around 12.40 â€“ 12.45am today, Friday 29 July. The driver, in his 40s, was at Ipswich railway station when a man who was walking from the Princes Street area got into the back of his vehicle. The man asked to be taken to Cecil Road but as the driver pulled up at the location he was threatened with a knife by the man, who demanded he hand over cash.

Several notes were handed over and the man then got out of the car. The victim drove away and called police.

The suspect is described as white, in his late teens to early 30s, of thin build, with a light brown coloured bushy beard. He was wearing a long-sleeved dark top and spoke with an English accent.

Anyone who may have been in either of these areas around this time who may have seen the man, or anyone with information about who he is, should call Ipswich CID on 101, quoting crime number 47202/16.
