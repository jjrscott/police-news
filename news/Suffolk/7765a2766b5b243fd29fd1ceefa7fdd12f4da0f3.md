A man in his 50s, arrested on suspicion of drink driving following a collision near Nacton yesterday afternoon, was de-arrested later that same evening (Friday 22 September) without charge. It follows a road traffic collision yesterday, Friday 22 September, after police received reports that a lorry carrying a load of wood had overturned at the roundabout near the John Grose car dealership at about 5.30pm. The Nacton Road/The Havens roundabout - by the car dealership - was partially blocked to allow for recovery works and reopened fully at about 3am on Saturday, 23 September.
