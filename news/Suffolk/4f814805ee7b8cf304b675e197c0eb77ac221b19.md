A 35 year old man has been jailed for 18 weeks after being convicted of a string of thefts.

Aiden Flanigan of Moore Road in Ipswich was jailed at Ipswich magistrates court on 2 June after pleading guilty to 11 thefts and an incident of going equipped.

The incidents took place over a period between early April and end of May where items were stolen from Boots, the Co-Op, McColls and Marks and Spencer in the town.

The items included nearly £700 worth of perfume and aftershave and a razor valued at £99. On 31 May he was stopped by a security guard outside Boots on Tavern Street when he was found to be carrying a screwdriver and nail and was subsequently arrested and charged with the numerous offences.
