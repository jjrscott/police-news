A 26-year-old man has been charged with drugs offences after being arrested by Suffolk officers in London last week.

Leon Warlock was sought in connection with the supply of drugs in Lowestoft last year. Suffolk officers from the East Scorpion pro-active team travelled to Woolwich on Friday, 23 June, and arrested him.

He was subsequently charged with three drugs offences â€“ possession of 46 wraps of crack cocaine, a class A drug, with intent to supply, and possession of 17 wraps of heroin, also a class A drug, with intent to supply, on 2 June 2016, and another charge of possession of heroin with intent to supply between 31 December 2015 and 1 May 2016.

Leon Warlock of Ritter Street, south-east London was detained in custody and appeared before Norwich Magistrates on Saturday, 24 June. He has now been bailed by the court to appear at Ipswich Crown Court on July 24.
