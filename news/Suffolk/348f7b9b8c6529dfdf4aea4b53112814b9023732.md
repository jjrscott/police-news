Residents across Suffolk are being advised to ‘Close it, Lock it, Check it’ and be vigilant with their home security to help keep burglars at bay.

Since 1 April this year, over 25% of all burglaries across the county have been as a result of entry being gained via an insecure door or open window.

Police are therefore keen to remind people to ensure they secure their homes when out, or overnight, and deny opportunist burglars an easy target.

Chief Inspector Matthew Rose, Head of Community Safety for Suffolk Police, said: "Unfortunately the warmer months often bring with them a rise in burglaries due to insecurities, as people have more windows and doors open and forget to close them.

"I would like to remind residents to ‘Close it, Lock it, Check it’ and ensure you keep all doors locked as a matter of routine, but especially if you go out – even for a matter of minutes – or at evenings and overnight. Windows should also be kept closed and secured if you are out, or at night.

"Opportunist burglars look for an easy target and will try door handles until they find an unlocked door, or look for an open window they can either climb into or reach through to access a larger window or door, so be secure and don’t give them an easy way in.”

Further home security information can be found under the ‘Advice’ section on the Suffolk Police website.
