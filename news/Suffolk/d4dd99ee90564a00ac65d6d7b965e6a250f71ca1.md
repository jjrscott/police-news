Police are appealing for witnesses after a number of walls were vandalised in Ipswich.

Officers were called at 7.25pm on Sunday 23 October to reports that a wall had been kicked over at the front of a house in Norwich Road, between Castle Road and Broadway Lane.

On police arrival the wall of neighbouring properties were also found to have been pushed over. The suspects were described as four youths dressed in dark clothing.

Just over five hours later, there was then a further call to police at 12.40am on Monday 24 October, reporting that the wall of another neighbouring property had been pushed over.

Anyone with information about these incidents is asked to contact the Ipswich West Safer Neighbourhood Team on **101** , quoting reference 62404/16, or Crimestoppers anonymously on **0800 555 111**.
