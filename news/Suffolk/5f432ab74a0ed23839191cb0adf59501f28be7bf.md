A 23-year-old man has been jailed for over five years after being convicted of Class A drugs offences in Newmarket.

Ayodele Adeleke appeared at Ipswich Crown Court last Wednesday, 7 February, where he pleaded guilty to the following three offences: possession of heroin with intent to supply; possession of crack cocaine with intent to supply; and acquiring or using criminal property, namely money. He was sentenced to five years and six months’ imprisonment.

The charges relate to an incident on Tuesday 9 January 2018 at an address in High Street, Newmarket. Adeleke was wanted on recall to prison and police had received information that he was staying at this location.

On arrival, officers were required to force their way in after Adeleke denied them entry and tried to hold the door closed. Once inside police discovered 51 wraps of heroin, 35 wraps of cocaine, cash totalling £690, and two mobile phones which had been snapped in half.

Adeleke was arrested and taken into police custody and subsequently charged with the offences detailed above.

Sgt Mel Leaman, of Newmarket Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: “I am extremely pleased with the sentence that Adeleke has been given, which I hope sends out a strong message to drug dealers that they face a significant spell in prison if caught and convicted.

“We are committed to tackling the supply of drugs in Suffolk and we will continue to pursue those who would blight our neighbourhoods with their illegal activities to every corner of the county.”
