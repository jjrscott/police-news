Police are appealing for witnesses and information after a woman reported being sexually assaulted in Broomhill Park in Ipswich yesterday.

Officers were contacted around 7.30pm last night, Tuesday 20 December, reporting the incident that happened around 7am yesterday.

The woman, in her 20s, had been walking her dogs near the middle of the park on Tuesday morning when she was approached by a man who grabbed her arms and forced her to the ground. He then sat astride her and sexually assaulted her before the woman managed to struggle free partially due to the man being scared off by her dogs.

The man fled towards toward the Broomhill Road entrance to the park and the woman returned home. She was very shaken but was uninjured.

The man involved is described as white, around 30 to 40 years old, of skinny to medium build, around 5ft 11ins tall, with freckles across his nose and was wearing a dark coloured hat, dark gloves, a dark coloured waist length jacket and dark coloured jeans.

Police are asking anyone who may have been in the park around 7am yesterday, Tuesday 20, anyone who may have seen someone matching this description or anyone with information about who the man is to call Suffolk Police on 101, quoting crime number 72859/16.
