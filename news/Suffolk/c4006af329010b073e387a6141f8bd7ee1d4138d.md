Throughout January 2017, police are supporting free catalytic converter marking in Haverhill with the aim reducing catalytic converter theft.

Members of the public are invited to arrange to have their catalytic converters marked and registered free of charge, and thereby reduce the chance of becoming a victim.

**Marking will take place on a limited appointment basis at:**

Mitchellâ€™s Motor Repairs Ltd
20-22 Hollands Road
Haverhill
CB9 8PP

Please call 01440 714903 to book your vehicle in for marking and registration.

 **Vehicle owners can also follow these tips:**

 * Keep private vehicles in a well-secured garage where possible, and if no garage is available, in a well-lit public area.
 * Park vehicles in such a way as to make access to the catalytic converter difficult or parallel with another vehicle if you own one.
 * Keep commercial vehicles in a locked building or compound.
 * Use alarms, lighting and CCTV to deter thieves.

For further information, please contact the Haverhill Safer Neighbourhood Team by calling **101**.
