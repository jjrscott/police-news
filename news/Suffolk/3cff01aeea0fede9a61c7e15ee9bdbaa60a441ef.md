Officers are working with community leaders to address the concerns of people living and working in the area.

Superintendent Kerry Cutler said: “We understand that this incident will have caused concern and as a result, we will be carrying out further patrols in the town this week. We will not tolerate this kind of behaviour and will take a robust approach to any person involved in violence on our streets. Officers will also be speaking to local residents, community leaders and schools to provide support and reassurance.

“As part of the patrols, we will be using a range of tactics and this will include vehicle checks and further stop searches where appropriate. Our Operation Sentinel and Scorpion teams are part of our response. Anyone caught with an offensive weapon will be arrested.

“We now believe around 20 people were directly involved in the incident. While this investigation is progressing, we believe that there were two opposing groups of people involved who were known to each other. We hope that this will reassure people that this was not a violent attack against innocent members of the public.

“We have spoken to a number of people who were witnesses to the incident and we are keen to speak to anyone else who has not yet come forward and believes they may have important information to assist the investigation.

“Information from the community is vital and we will work with them to continue to identify those concerned – we welcome the support of the public to enable us to achieve this.

“We have a team of officers who will be dedicated to this investigation and I am determined to bring those responsible to justice. While we have made a total of six arrests in connection with the incident so far, I am confident that more will follow in the coming days, such is our determination to arrest those responsible.

“I would also like to emphasise again that we simply will not tolerate such violent behaviour in Ipswich or the county as a whole. We expect all people in Suffolk to go about their business in a law-abiding and peaceful way. Violent activity will not be accepted and we will always look to prosecute those involved in such serious acts of aggression, regardless of whether they were known to each other.”
