A man has been jailed for grievous bodily harm following an incident in Sudbury.

39 year old Jimmy Roberts of Grenville Road in Sudbury was jailed for 34 months at Ipswich Crown Court yesterday (Thu 10 Dec) after pleading guilty to wounding without intent and possession of a bladed article.

Officers received a report on Saturday 2 May at about 730pm of a man, aged in his 40s, being hit on the head inside his property on Suffolk Road in the town. He sustained a deep cut to the head and minor injuries to his legs as a consequence. The injuries weren’t life threatening or life changing.

Following enquiries officers, later the same evening, arrested Roberts in connection with the incident and he was taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre for questioning and was subsequently charged.

Roberts received 34 months for the assault and 12 months for possession of the weapon and will run concurrent to one another.

DC John Gavin from Bury St Edmunds CID said: "To see Roberts put away for nearly three years is of great satisfaction. He is a violent, aggressive offender so to see him jailed is good news for the people of Sudbury and it will give him plenty of time to reflect on his actions. Carrying a knife without a legitimate reason is both dangerous and illegal.”
