Officers have launched an investigation after a ram raid in Sudbury in the early hours of today Saturday 21 July.

Police were called at 2.45am this morning to reports of a burglary at the Halifax Bank on North Street in the town.

Offenders used a sledgehammer to smash the security glass at the front of the building and stole a large metal deposit box from within. It is reported that this was then attached to the rear of a van and driven away at speed along North Street in the direction of Bulmer.

It is thought that the box contained no cash and was empty.

Nobody was injured as a result of the incident and a scene is in place at the bank whilst police continue enquiries.

Two of the vehicles used by offenders, a white Merecedes Sprinter van and a dark coloured Audi A5 saloon car were later found abandoned and burnt out in Finch Hill, Bulmer in Essex. The van had been reported stolen from Ipswich yesterday.

The suspects are described as three white men who were wearing hooded tops. One of the men was seen carrying a large sledgehammer.

Anybody who witnessed the burglary or who saw any suspicious behaviour are asked to call West CID on 101 quoting reference 40750/18. Officers are also keen to hear from anybody who may have dash-cam footage of the incident. Alternatively, contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
