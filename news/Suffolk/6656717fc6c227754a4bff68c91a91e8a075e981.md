Police are reminding residents to be mindful of their home security this summer as three insecure burglaries were reported on Monday 25 June.

The first incident occurred between 11pm on Sunday 24 June and 1am on Monday 25 June at a house in Burnes Road, Ipswich.

An unknown suspect entered through an insecure rear door and once inside, stole an electric Rich Bit bike. A padlock was also removed from a shed outside but nothing further was taken.

A second burglary occurred between 3am and 5am on Monday 25 June at a property in Stoke Street, Ipswich.

Entry was gained via an insecure door and once inside, a suspect stole two bags and a mobile phone while the occupants were asleep in a room nearby.

The final incident occurred between 8:50am and 8:55am on Monday at a property in Churchill Court, Newmarket.

A suspect gained access by walking in via an insecure front door while the property was occupied. Once inside, a set of keys were stolen.

Anyone who witnessed anything suspicious in either Burnes Road (34859/18), Stoke Street (34964/18) or Churchill Court (34919/18) can call Suffolk police on 101 quoting the relevant reference number.

As the warm weather continues, Suffolk police offers the following safety advice to residents:

LOCK

• Lock all doors and remove the keys before leaving the house.
• Keep front doors locked even when you are at home and especially if you are in the back garden.
• Close all windows fully before you leave the house, lock downstairs windows and remove the keys.
• Use window limiters to allow air in instead of keeping windows fully open, even when you’re at home.
• Install window locks on upstairs windows that can be easily accessed by a flat roof.
• Lock back gates using a sturdy lock such as a closed shackle padlock to no less than CEN 3-4 security grade or 5 lever lock.

LIGHT

• Make your home look lived in – use timer switches if you’re not home.
• ‘Dusk-to-dawn’ sensored security lighting is a cheap, low cost way of making sure the front of your home or shed/outbuilding is well-lit.
• Visible burglar alarms can make burglars think twice; get specialist advice and consult your insurance company.
•You could also consider installing a Ring doorbell camera in order to potentially film an opportunist burglar in action. For more information, visit https://www.suffolk.police.uk/news/latest-news/27-02-2018/suffolk-teams-smart-home-security-company-tackle-burglars.
• Hedging and shrubs to the front of your property should be pruned to no higher than 1m and trim trees up from the ground to 2m. This will allow a clear line of sight across your property and will stop the garden being used as a hiding place.

HIDE

• Keep your valuables, jewellery, cash, passport and deeds to your property in a safe.
• Never leave spare keys in an open place. Be aware, burglars know all the usual hiding places so never leave a spare key under the doormat or under a garden gnome.
• Keep dustbins and wheelie-bins away from fencing/gates as these can be used by thieves to climb into windows or used to escape.
• Make sure valuables are property marked. Take photographs and keep a note of any serial numbers.
• Don’t leave equipment and tools lying around that can be used by burglars to break into your home, such as hammers, shovels or gardening tools. Keep ladders locked away and out of sight.
