Police are appealing for witnesses to two burglaries that took place in Barrow near Bury St Edmunds.

Items stolen include an iPad in a black and red case, a Fenton VONYX portable system speaker, three 20 litre green metal jerry cans of diesel, £44 in cash, a 50” black Samsung TV and a Warrior generator.

In the second incident, also on Church Road, offenders forced entry into the Barrow Archery premises and stole a generator, alcohol and an unknown amount of cash. They broke into the Academy gym and salon, taking petty cash, a Lenova laptop, Dell PC and a Toyota Hilux Invincible.
