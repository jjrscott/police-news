Police are appealing for an attempted robbery that took place in Ipswich.

It took place at about 4pm on Tuesday 20 October on Tavern Street where a 14 year old male victim was with two male friends walking from the Cattle Market towards H&M.

They have been followed by a group of five males, believed to be teenagers and two of whom were wearing face masks. They initially surrounded them before they were able to momentarily get away. The victim then walked to Sailmakers bus station and has been followed by the same group during which time one of them grabbed him by his man-bag and demanded money from him.

The victim managed to get away and walk to McColls with the group still following and then the group walked off.

Anyone who witnessed any suspicious behaviour or knows who was responsible should contact Ipswich CID, quoting crime reference 37/61225/20.
