Police were called at 10.20pm yesterday, Tuesday 29 September, to reports of two persons seen on foot westbound on the A14 Orwell Bridge.

Officers quickly attended and carried out an extensive search of the bridge and surrounding area.

Further searches were also carried out by Her Majesty's Coastguard, Suffolk Fire and Rescue Service and Suffolk Lowland Search and Rescue (SULSAR).

This morning, Wednesday 30 September, officers and partner agencies assisted with continued searches but all agencies and police have since stood down.

Officers are continuing to carry out enquiries in order to check that the two persons are safe and well but all enquiries so far have proved unsuccessful

Police would be keen to speak to anyone who was driving near the bridge, and who may have captured any relevant dash cam, yesterday evening between 9.45pm and 10.45pm.

Any witnesses should contact Suffolk police on 101, quoting CAD reference 450 of 29 September 2020.
