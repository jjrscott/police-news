An 18-year-old man from Ipswich has been given a community order for a sexual offence against a teenage girl.

Jack Purdy, of Spenser Road Ipswich, initially denied the offence of engaging in sexual activity with a child under the age of 16 but later changed his plea to guilty.

He appeared at Ipswich Crown Court today, Friday 3 November, where he received a three-year community order, told to complete 150 hours’ community service and given a 60-day rehabilitation activity requirement.

The offence took place at an address in Ipswich on Monday, 12 September 2016, when Purdy was still 17 years’ old. His victim reported the incident to her family the following day, who notified police, and Purdy was arrested on Wednesday, 14 September.

Detective Constable Rory Prior, Officer in the Case for the investigation, said: "Despite her youth, the victim has shown great courage and resilience by first reporting what happened and then seeing this case through. I would like to thank her family for the support they have provided to her and to the police.

“I am also pleased that Purdy decided to change his plea to guilty, which spared the need for his victim to attend court.

“We are dedicated to supporting victims of all ages and hope this case inspires confidence in others to report incidents of sexual assaults. Our objective is always to ensure that we get the justice they deserve.”
