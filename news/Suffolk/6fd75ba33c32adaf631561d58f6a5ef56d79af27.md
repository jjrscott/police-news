Police are appealing for witnesses and information following a sexual assault in Ipswich.

Around 3pm – 3:15pm on Wednesday, 29 March, a woman in her mid-30s was walking in Holywells Park, near the Cliff Lane entrance, when she was approached by a man on a pushbike.

The man slapped her bottom and cycled away a short distance before stopping by the stairs near the public toilets where he watched the victim. He later cycled off in the direction of the pond.

The man is described as white, approximately 25 – 28 years’ old, and was wearing a blue winter-style jacket with a hood. The bicycle is described as red with a plastic carrier wrapped around the seat.

Police would like to hear from anyone who may have seen a man riding a bicycle matching this description in the area at the times stated.

Officers would particularly like to trace two women who were in the park with two babies and who may be able to help with the enquiry.

Anyone with information should contact the Incident and Crime Management Hub at Suffolk Police on **101** quoting reference number 25915/17.
