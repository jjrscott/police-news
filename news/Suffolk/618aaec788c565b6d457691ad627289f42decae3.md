Three teenagers have been bailed to return to police in July as enquiries continue into a number of garage and outbuilding burglaries in the Otley area yesterday.

The three â€“ an 18-year-old man, a 17-year-old boy and a 15-year-old boy - were arrested in the early hours of Thursday, 2 June, after police received a call reporting suspicious behaviour in the Helmingham Road area around 3am.

Officers, including a dog handler from the dog unit, attended and recovered items including tools and bikes, that are believed to have been stolen from outbuildings in the area, and located the three who were arrested on suspicion of burglary.

All three were taken into custody at Martlesham Police Investigation Centre where they were interviewed. They have now been bailed to return to police on July 1, pending further enquiries.

Anyone with information is asked to call Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting crime number 36389/16.
