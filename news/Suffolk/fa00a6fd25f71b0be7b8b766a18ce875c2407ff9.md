Police are appealing for witnesses or information following a robbery in Haverhill.

The incident occurred at around 10.15am yesterday, Monday 25 January in a garage block at the junction of Greenfields Way and Leiston Road.

The victim – a man aged in his 50s – was walking to a nearby shop when he was beckoned over to a vehicle by three males.

The victim headed over to the vehicle and then two of the males got out, one of which was believed to be holding a weapon. They then threatened him and demanded he hand over his money. The victim handed over a quantity of cash and the males got back in the vehicle drove away in the direction of Burton End.

As a result of the incident, the victim was not physically harmed but was left shaken.

The first male suspect is described as white, aged his late 20s, approximately 6ft 2ins tall, of large build and with dark cropped hair. He was clean shaven and wearing a matching black tracksuit with red piping down the outer seams and a red stripe across his chest.

The second male suspect is described approximately 5ft 11ins tall, aged in his late 20s, of slim build and with mousy brown hair. His hair had been gelled down. He was wearing a black or dark grey sweatshirt and blue trousers.

The third male suspect is described as white, of slim build and with dark short hair. He appeared to be younger than the other two males, possibly a teenager.
