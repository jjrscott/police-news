Ipswich East Safer Neighbourhood Team (SNT) is holding a community engagement event on Saturday 17 December.

The event will begin at the Ipswich East SNT office at Heath Road from 10am, where residents are encouraged to come along to meet officers and air any concerns they have within their community.

They are then invited to join in an organised litter-pick around St Johns ward, in particular within the vicinity of Ipswich Hospital.

Officers and members of the Kerala Cultural Community will be in attendance, and Ipswich Borough Council will be providing the equipment, including litter-pick sticks, refuse sacks and high visibility work wear.

The aim of the event is to help bring about positive change in the community and is expected to finish by 12:30pm.
