Police are appealing for witnesses to a burglary that took place in Newmarket.

It happened at a property on Noel Murless Drive in the town on 6 January at some point between 5pm and 8pm.

Entry was gained through a glass paned door at the front of the property facing the street with a small jemmy mark found on the door, but no other damage caused.

An untidy search of the property had taken place with a small quantity of cash taken.

Anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity at around the time stated in the area, or has knowledge of the incident should contact Bury St Edmunds CID on 101, quoting crime reference 37/1534/19

Alternatively, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
