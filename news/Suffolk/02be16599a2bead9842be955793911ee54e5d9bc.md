Police are appealing for help in tracing a missing 14 year old teenager with links to the Newmarket area.

Joshua Rukwira was reported missing to police on Wednesday 24 January and has not been seen since.

It is possible he may have travelled to London, but could also still be in Suffolk. He is described as black, five foot, eight inches tall, of thin build and with black hair. When last seen he was wearing a black jacket with a hood, a black backpack, pale blue stonewash jeans and Nike trainers.

Officers have made enquiries to locate Joshua but have not yet been able to locate him and are concerned for his welfare.

Anyone who believes they have seen him or who has any information regarding his whereabouts, is asked to contact Suffolk Police on 101.
