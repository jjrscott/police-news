Police area appealing for witnesses to an serious road traffic collision that took place in Woodbridge.

It happened on the A12 southbound (also known as Grove Road) today (Friday 10 August) at just before 9am.

The collision took place between a red Nissan Qashqai and a pedal cycle being ridden by a 70 year old man. The cyclist sustained head injuries and was taken to hospital for treatment.

In particular, police would like to speak to an adult male walking his dog who was on a pedestrian crossing near Hasketon Road at the time of the collision and who may have seen what happened.

Anyone with information or dash cam footage should contact the Roads Policing and Firearms Operations Unit (RPFOU) at Police Headquarters by calling 101 and quoting incident number 72 of 10th August 2018.
