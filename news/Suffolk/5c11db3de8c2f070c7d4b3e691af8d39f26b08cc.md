A 31-year-old man is due to appear in court today charged in connection with a robbery in Lowestoft.

The incident took place on Tuesday 31 January at just after 4pm. A woman walking with a man in the vicinity of Lowestoft Railway station was approached by another man who demanded money. The victim gave her purse to the suspect who then ran off.

Richard Nash of Belvedere Road, Lowestoft was detained by officers soon after the incident and taken to Great Yarmouth Police Investigation Centre for questioning. He has been charged with robbery, possession of a knife in a public place and assaulting a police officer.

Nash is due to appear at Norwich Magistrates Court today, Thursday 2 February.
