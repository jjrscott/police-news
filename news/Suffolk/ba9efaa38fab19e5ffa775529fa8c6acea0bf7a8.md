A 30 year old man has been jailed for seven and a half years following the attempted robbery of a vulnerable man in Lowestoft.

Andrew Bywater of no fixed abode was jailed at Ipswich Crown Court yesterday (8 July) after he pleaded guilty.

The court heard how Bywater had broken into a property on Fir Lane in the town during the hours of darkness on 30 April 2019 via an insecure ground floor window and assaulted the male victim as he slept in his bed making demands for money.

The vulnerable victim, aged in his 50s, woke up to Bywater attacking him with a stick and a bottle demanding that he hand over money. The victim was so scared that despite knowing his attacker he initially chose not to tell police that he knew his identity.

Detectives worked with the victim the following day by gaining his trust and supported him through the process of making a full disclosure with Bywater located and arrested later in the day.

DI Matt Adams from Lowestoft CID said: Bywater was a manipulative individual who in interview tried to claim that he had been invited to the victim’s home and then attacked by the victim. I am pleased that Bywater ultimately pleaded guilty to this offence, negating the need for the victim to give evidence. I am equally pleased to see the court recognising the danger posed by Bywater and that he has been given a lengthy custodial sentence.”

Bywater received a seven and a half year jail sentence with a two and half year licence extension.
