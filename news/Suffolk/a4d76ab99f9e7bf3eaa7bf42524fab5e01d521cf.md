Police are appealing for witnesses after a defibrillator unit was vandalised in Felixstowe.

The incident occurred yesterday, Thursday 11 February, to the unit outside the public toilets in Sea Road.

The unit lens was cracked, which is suspected to have been caused by somebody hitting it. This is the third time in two years the unit has sustained damage – on the previous occasion in October last year the glass front was smashed.

Any witnesses, or anyone with information about this incident, is asked to contact the Crime Coordination Centre, quoting reference: 7137/21
