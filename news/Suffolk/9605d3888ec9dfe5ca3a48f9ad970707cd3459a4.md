Police are holding a community engagement day in Ipswich this week in a bid to reduce the number of bicycle thefts in the town.

Between 11am and 2pm on Wednesday 9 August, a mobile police station will be set up in Cornhill with officers from the Ipswich Central Safer Neighbourhood Team (SNT) on hand to speak to members of the public regarding bicycle safety.

Residents and shoppers are invited to attend for advice on how to register and secure their bicycles, and what to do if their bike is stolen.

Jonathan Driver, Sergeant at Ipswich Central SNT, said: "As an avid cyclist myself, bicycle safety and security is something I feel particularly strongly about.

"Losing your bike to an opportunistic thief can be hugely impactful to a victim; for some, a bicycle is their means of travel, for others it’s of sentimental value. The aim of the engagement day is to advise members of the public on how they can increase their chances of being reunited with a bike if it ever is stolen, and remind them that police do take cycle theft very seriously.”
