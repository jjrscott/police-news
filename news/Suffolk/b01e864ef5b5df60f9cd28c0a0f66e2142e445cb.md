Police are appealing for witnesses after an attempted burglary on Sycamore Drive in Beck Row.

The incident took place last Tuesday (13 September) in the early hours of the morning, approximately between 12:45 and 1:15am.

The offender(s) forced open the side gate and attempted entry into the house via the back door. It is thought they may have been disturbed by a neighbour who was investigating a suspicious noise.

A man was then seen leaving the address. He is described as being white, approximately 30 years old and between 5ft 10in and 5ft 12in, with short dark hair and was wearing a dark burgundy vest.

It is not clear at this stage whether anything has been stolen.

Anyone with information on the identity of this man is asked to contact DC Teare at Bury St Edmunds CID on **101** reference 55113/16 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on **0800 555 111** or through their Anonymous Online Form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
