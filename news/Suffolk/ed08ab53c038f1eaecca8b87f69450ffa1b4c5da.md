> **New Specials with Det. Supt Bridger, Police and Crime Commissioner Tim Passmore and Chief Officer Paul Goldsmith**

A special passing out event took place on Sunday 13 August to celebrate the newest recruits to Suffolk’s Special Constabulary.

11 Special Constables, who have just concluded their initial training after 10 weekend sessions at Police Headquarters in Martlesham, attended the event which celebrated their achievements. They will now be posted to various locations across the county.

Also in attendance was Detective Superintendent Eamonn Bridger, Police and Crime Commissioner Tim Passmore and Chief Officer Paul Goldsmith with friends and family also attending the event.

Chief Officer for the Specials Paul Goldsmith said: "It was an extremely proud day for those involved as well as their family and friends.

Being a Special is a very rewarding, fulfilling and interesting role where no two duties are the same and we hope these new recruits to the Special Constabulary all get a great deal of satisfaction from their new roles.

"I wish them all the best and hope they all have a long and rewarding career with the force.”

Tim Passmore, Police and Crime Commissioner said: "I am always extremely proud to attend these passing out parades to be able to thank the latest recruits personally for their fantastic support to the Constabulary.

"Specials are an integral part of the policing family. They are extremely valued and valuable, and play an essential role in preventing, reducing and tackling crime to help keep Suffolk safe.

"These volunteer police officers are not called Specials for nothing. We are absolutely indebted to them all, their commitment and enthusiasm is second to none. They give their time for nothing and add a completely different dimension to policing in the county.

"I wish these new recruits the very best of luck in their new roles.”

The Special Constabulary is always on the look-out for committed recruits who are keen to experience the rewards and challenges of policing.

Becoming a Special Constable is a positive opportunity to develop existing skills or to learn new ones, give something back to your local community and become a part of a diverse organisation that fights crime in the county. It is also a good way to try police work if you are considering a career as a full time officer.

If you are 18 years or older, in good health and of good character, you can apply. You will get full training to become part of a team that deals with a variety of incidents and events across Suffolk.
