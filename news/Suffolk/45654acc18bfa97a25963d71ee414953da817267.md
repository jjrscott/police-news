Police are appealing for information following a burglary and an assault in Ipswich on Monday, 3 April, where exotic animals were stolen.

Officers were called shortly after 7:20pm to reports that offenders had forced entry to an outbuilding in Chaucer Road and stolen two Horsefield tortoises and two Vietnamese Blue Beauty snakes.

The owner, a man in his 30s, was alerted by his dogs barking and walked into the outbuilding to investigate when he was assaulted by being punched in the face. He fell to the ground where he was left dazed, but was otherwise unharmed and did not require medical treatment.

One of the tortoises is said to have a large chunk missing from its shell, and the other is described as having distinct pyramid shapes to its shell.

The snakes are described as blue in colour, non-venomous and are between 1 - 2ft in length.

Police would like to hear from anyone who may have seen any suspicious behaviour in this area at the time specified, who may have knowledge of the whereabouts of the animals, or who can provide details of those responsible.

Anyone with information should contact Suffolk Police on **101** , quoting reference number 26818/17.
