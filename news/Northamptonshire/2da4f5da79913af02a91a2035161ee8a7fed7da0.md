_Iftar meal with Deputy Chief Constable Simon Nickless_

A local mosque has opened up its doors for an inter-faith iftar dinner to help improve community cohesion.

The event which was held at Al Jamatul Muslimin Mosque, in Semilong, Northampton, on Saturday, May, 18, was attended by Deputy Chief Constable Simon Nickless, as well as representatives from Northampton Interfaith Forum, BBC Northampton and Northampton General Hospital.

The event allowed people to join in with Muslim worshipers for the evening meal which signifies the end of a day of fasting.

Chair of the Northamptonshire Association of Muslim Police, Sophia Perveen, who supported the event, said: "We police the communities and what better way to generate greater understanding of each other, than to share a meal that marks such significance to the local community."

The initiative was organised by Imam Sayfullah Nasir in conjunction with Taste Ramadan, a national project which saw over 100 similar events held on the same day across the country, with the aim of sharing experiences with people from all communities.

Imam Sayfullah, spoke of his elation at having guests from different faiths, during the evening: "The iftar is not just for us local Muslims who are fasting, but for the whole community. The moment of breaking the fast with delectable food is a unique joy that all should be entitled to share with us."
