A man has been ordered to pay more than £90,000 at a Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA) confiscation hearing at Northampton Crown Court on Tuesday, February 4.

In October 2016, officers started an investigation into an allegation of theft. The incident concerned the theft by a son, who had power of attorney for his elderly mother.

He sold their jointly owned property in Stanion when she went into a care home, and took more than his share of the proceeds. Mary Bingham died on November 21, 2018.

Christopher Bingham, 53, of Wymington Park, Rushden, pleaded guilty to theft and was sentenced on May 22, 2019 to 12 months in prison, suspended for 12 months and instructed to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work.

On Tuesday, February 4, at a POCA hearing, Her Honour Judge Rebecca Crane found Bingham to have benefited from crime to the value of £93,105.97. A Confiscation Order has been put in place for him to pay within three months or face 12 months in prison.
