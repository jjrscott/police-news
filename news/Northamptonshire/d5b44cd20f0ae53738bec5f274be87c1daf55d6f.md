A Northamptonshire Police puppy is already showing himself as a force to be reckoned with midway through his police dog training course.

Police puppy Bryn was paid for by a group of retired and current police officers in memory of his namesake, PD Bryn, who died in the line of duty in 1998.

PD Bryn was killed when he and his handler, Ian Churms, were called to an address in Irthlingborough following an emergency call to police. Ian attempted to negotiate with the offender, who was armed with a hunting rifle, but was shot in the leg. Shortly after, PD Bryn was fatally shot. A 42-year-old woman was also shot.

Now, halfway through his training course, police puppy Bryn is doing his namesake proud by completing tasks and exercises beyond his age.

Bryn's handler, PC Sam Clark from the Northamptonshire Police Dog Section, said: "Bryn is a very clever boy.

"As you can see from the video, Bryn has been tasked with finding a leather purse concealed by grass. It doesn't take him long to track it down and this is something we usually don't expect to see from a dog until he or she is about 15 months old.

"Bryn is a joy to handle and I look forward to seeing him graduate and get out into the field."

Superintendent Sarah Johnson, Head of the Operations Department, said: "Police dogs are a vital part of the police service. They are our colleagues and are a huge support in allowing us to fight crime and protect people in Northamptonshire."
