Residents living in a retirement housing complex in Kettering had the opportunity to pick up crime prevention and fire safety tips during a visit from their local police and fire service.

Police Community Support Officer (PCSO) Christine Cotter joined colleagues from Kettering Fire Station for the visit to Harry Potter House in London Road, as part of a joint initiative to reach vulnerable members of the community.

PCSO Cotter from the Kettering Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "We regularly hold partnership events within the community. However not everyone can attend these, so it is important we carry out such visits to prevent vulnerable people from being victims of crime.

"During the visit, I provided information to residents about crime prevention which included details about the various scam tactics being used by criminals. While my colleagues from the fire service provided advice on home safety."
