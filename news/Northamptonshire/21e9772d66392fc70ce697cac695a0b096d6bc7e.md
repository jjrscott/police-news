Police officers are appealing for witnesses after a robbery outside Wellingborough Train Station on Friday, December 18.

The incident took place between 10.55pm and 11.05pm, when a 19-year-old man got off the train and was asked by another man, who was sat on a nearby bench, for a cigarette.

The teenager refused, and the man started to chase him, causing him to fall over, at which the man then threatened him with a knife and demanded he handed over his bag.

The teenager refused and the man took it and walked off towards the station. He is described as white, aged 20-24, 5ft 9in, of a slim build with blond hair which was in cornrow braids. He was wearing a blue jacket, blue jeans and trainers.

Anyone with information or anyone who may have witnessed this incident is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101 quoting reference number 20000668993. Or alternatively, if you wish to stay anonymous, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.

A 20-year-old man from Kettering has been arrested on suspicion of robbery and has been released on police bail pending further enquiries.
