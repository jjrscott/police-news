Three men from East London have appeared Wellingborough Magistrates' Court this morning (Thursday, December 17) charged with the murder of Christopher Allbury-Burridge at his home in Northampton.

Jordan Parker, aged 24, of Chingford Road, Walthamstow, Joel Cyrus, aged 25, of Whitney Road, Leyton, and 23-year-old Calum Farquhar, of Liverpool Road, Leyton, were remanded in custody and will appear before Northampton Crown Court at 9.45am on Monday, December 21.

The men were arrested at different locations in the capital on Tuesday (December 15) following an intensive investigation involving more than 70 police officers.

Mr Allbury-Burridge, aged 33, died at his home in Raeburn Road, Kingsley, shortly after 2.10am last Friday (December 11). A post-mortem-investigation carried out by a Home Office pathologist in Leicester revealed he died from a single stab wound to the chest.
