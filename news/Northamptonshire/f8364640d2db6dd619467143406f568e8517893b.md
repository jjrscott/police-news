Officers investigating an incident in Corby where a car was damaged by a pedestrian have released images of a man they would like to speak to.

At around 10.10pm on Sunday, February 21, a motorist driving along Cheltenham Road had to stop her vehicle due to a man walking in the carriageway.

She sounded her horn to alert him, but before she could back up to go around him the man ran at her vehicle and slammed his fists down onto the bonnet twice, leaving it dented.

The man then did the same to the vehicle behind her before leaving the scene.

Police investigating the incident have released images of a man they wish to trace as he may have information about the incident.

The man pictured, anyone who recognises him or has information about the incident should call Northamptonshire Police on 101.

**Incident number:** 21000104019
