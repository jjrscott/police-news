It was thumbs up all round at the 5th Desborough Brownies weekly meeting after the girls enlisted the help of their local neighbourhood policing team to earn a new activity badge.

Police Community Support Officers Kirsty Ellerby and Margaret Lawson joined the seven to 10-year-olds at the United Reformed Church in Union Street, Desborough to talk about road safety.

PCSO Ellerby, who is based in the Corby & Kettering Rural Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "We always welcome the opportunity to speak to young children about road safety and the Brownies were very engaged and showed an interest in what we had to say.

"To earn their badge, the Brownies needed to be able to understand and explain the Green Cross Code, so we showed the children how to cross the road safely as well as spoke to them about how to travel safely in a vehicle."

In addition to learning the Green Cross Code, the Brownies were asked to design a cycle helmet or high-visibility outfit, explain the sequence of a traffic light and know the meaning of the different shaped road signs.
