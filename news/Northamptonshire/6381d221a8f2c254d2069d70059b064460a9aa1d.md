The University of Northampton Policing Team literally had a mountain to climb when they decided to raise money for a charity close to their hearts.

Five members of the team pushed their endurance levels to the limit to complete this year's annual Snowdon Challenge to raise more than Â£1000 for the Children's Liver Disease Foundation.

It took the team just under six hours to walk up the 3,560ft peak of Wales' highest mountain - slightly bigger than the smaller heights they're used to scaling on a daily basis around the campus.

The charity supports children and their families affected by the condition as well as research into childhood liver conditions, which has provided help to their former colleague, PC Sam Foster following the birth of her twins.

PC Martin Usher said: "The foundation has been invaluable to Sam and her family, after her four-year-old son, Reid was born with a rare liver condition called biliary atresia.

"Reid is such a truly remarkable little boy. He has been in and out of hospital a number of times and battles daily with his condition and will probably require a liver transplant in the future.

"Sam and her family have benefitted so much from the support they have received from the charity that we wanted to give something back and help other families in the same position."

The Foundation is the only UK charity dedicated to fighting all childhood liver diseases.
