Police investigating the theft of a puppy from outside her Northampton home have released a photo of a man they would like to speak to.

Winter, a five-month old white French bulldog with grey and black facial markings, was stolen in Edith Street between 12.30pm and 1pm on Sunday, February 28.

She was taken when she slipped outside while her owner was moving house and was carried off by an unknown man, who walked along Palmerstone Road and onto the Wellingborough Road.

Following an appeal for information last week, officers have now released a CCTV image of a man they wish to identify as they believe he may have information relevant to the investigation.

The man pictured, anyone who recognises him, or anyone who has information about the whereabouts of Winter, should call Northamptonshire Police on 101, or Crimestoppers in confidence on 0800 555111.

**Incident number:** 21000116786
