Nene Beat is Northamptonshire Police's quarterly publication which shares the work the Force is delivering to fight crime and protect people across the county.

In the first issue, there is a range of articles relating to our investment in staff, equipment and training which will see more officers and police staff better enabled to serve our communities.

In addition to this, there is information on our current performance around our policing priorities, giving an insight into the volume of calls and incidents we deal with day-to-day.
