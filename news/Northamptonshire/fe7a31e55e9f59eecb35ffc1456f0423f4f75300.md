Northamptonshire Police are ready to respond quickly and robustly to reports of domestic abuse incidents in the face of Covid-19 restrictions.

In China, police reports show domestic violence increased when restrictions were imposed and exacerbated household tensions due to forced coexistence, economic stress and understandable fears about the virus.

Detective Chief Inspector Andy Glenn, who is the force lead for adult safeguarding, said:

"The controls the government has put in place to protect people from the virus can unfortunately impact on victims of domestic violence. We wholeheartedly support the need to follow measures of social distancing and isolation but we recognise these restrictions may give rise to an increase in domestic abuse and we are more than ready to respond.

"Our first priority is to protect victims and any children present but we also urge perpetrators to seek help and maybe this period of enforced restriction is a good opportunity to think about the root causes of violent or controlling behaviour - there are many ways to get help and support in order to understand and change the way you behave, to give you a better chance of fixing your relationship with your partner and protecting any children in your household.

"The most important message I want to convey is that, in the face of the current challenges presented by Covid-19 and fast-moving developments, we are not taking our eye off the ball. Tackling domestic abuse is a force priority and that hasn't changed. I urge people to keep an eye out for their neighbours and for anybody affected to get help. There is a wealth of support available."
