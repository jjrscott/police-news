Police officers have today closed down an unlicensed music event which was attended by about 80 people.

Officers were alerted to the incident following calls from members of the public in the early hours of this morning, Sunday September 13.

The event was taking place on land near Kings Cliffe and RAF Wittering in East Northamptonshire.

Officers used Covid-19 legislation to disperse those in attendance.

Supt Richard Tompkins said: "We had several calls from members of the public about a large gathering and loud music which could be heard from a considerable distance.

"When we arrived on the site there were about 80 young adults attending an unlicensed music event.

"Our intention was to approach this from both a public nuisance and public health perspective and we closed down the event using coronavirus legislation.

"As is often the case at events like this, it is challenging to identify organisers, however, we spoke to those in the immediate vicinity of the sound equipment about potentially seizing it.

"We also made it clear we could issue large fines to anybody we believed to be involved in the organisation of an event of more than 30 people.

"They immediately turned off the music and have left the site."
