Detectives investigating an assault in Upton Country Park are appealing for witnesses.

The incident happened on Saturday, November 28 between 3.50pm and 4.10pm when a woman out walking her dog came across a man being abusive to another man who was also walking a dog.

As the woman drew closer to the two men, the offender threw a bottle of water at her dog and when she confronted him, he punched her twice to the face causing a swollen nose and a cut to her mouth. He then walked off in the direction of Kislingbury.

He is described as white, in his late 30s to early 40s, well-built and wearing a plain grey T-shirt, a green and black tracksuit and black trainers. He had a local accent.

Anyone with any information should call Northamptonshire Police on 101. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.

**Incident number:** 20000630413
