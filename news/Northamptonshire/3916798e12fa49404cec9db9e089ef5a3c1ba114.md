Police officers are appealing for witnesses after a road traffic collision on the M1 last night (Tuesday, February 16).

The incident happened at about 8.30pm on the northbound carriageway between junctions 16 and 17 when, for reasons unknown, a grey BMW 3 Series left the carriageway to the nearside, careered down a steep bank and collided with several trees before coming to rest.

Following the collision, the driver and sole occupant of the BMW - a 32-year-old man - was taken to University Hospital Coventry with serious injuries.

Anyone with information, anyone who witnessed this incident or anyone may have any dashcam footage is asked to call the Drivewatch Hotline on 0800 174615.
