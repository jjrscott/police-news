Officers from Northamptonshire Police's Rural Crime and Safer Roads teams are set to provide help and advice to horse lovers at a British Horse Society (BHS) event at Moulton College.

Taking place from 6pm on Tuesday, October 22, the free event will see police officers and PCSOs share crime prevention tips and an overview of rural crime trends.

The Force's Safer Roads Team will also explain the work of Operation Close Pass, a road safety initiative aiming to protect vulnerable road users like horse riders, cyclists and motorcyclists by educating all road users about safe passing distances and how to share the roads safely and legally.

Tack marking will also be on offer from a PCSO, to allow attendees to have their saddles, bridles and other equipment permanently security marked to help make them less appealing to thieves, and aid their return if they are stolen and recovered.

Other presentations at the event will be made by BHS director of safety, Alan Hiscox, who will talk about the charity's Dead Slow road safety campaign, and advice on towing vehicle driving and safety.

The event is taking place at Moulton College's John Thorpe Centre, Gate 4, Moulton, NN3 7QL, starting at 6pm for tea and coffee, with talks starting at 7pm.
