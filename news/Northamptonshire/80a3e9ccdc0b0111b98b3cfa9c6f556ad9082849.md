Members of the Towcester Neighbourhood Policing Team were on duty at the ninth annual Blisworth Canal Festival over the weekend (August 10-11).

Police Community Support Officers Kev Thompson and Peter Firth were joined by thousands of visitors who descended on the South Northants village and the Grand Union Canal.

Since the inaugural boat festival in 2010, the two-day event is now an established date in the calendar with attractions spread across the village including Blisworth House, waterfront, village hall and chapel as well as the Festival Field.

There were attractions for visitors of all ages at this year's festival including classic cars, military vehicles, live music, dancers, fun fair, dog show, stalls, Artisan Food market, Picasso gallery and of course, the canal traders.

PCSO Thompson said: "The event usually attracts thousands of people to the Blisworth over the two-days, and draws many people from outside of the area and from all walks of life.

"Our attendance not only provides reassurance to both local residents and visitors but it is also an opportunity for us to be more accessible to those who would like to speak to us.

"We have good links with the British Waterways officers who operate in the area, so the event is a good opportunity to catch up with them as well as those who live and travel on our section of the Grand Union Canal."

Organised by the Blisworth Canal Festival, proceeds from the event go towards maintaining the canal and its environment within the parish as well as supporting many local organisations and national charities.
