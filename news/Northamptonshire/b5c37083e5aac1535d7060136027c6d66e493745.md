Police officers are appealing for the owner of the items pictured to come forward and speak to them.

On Saturday, January 9, neighbourhood officers conducting foot patrols in Wellingborough saw what looked to be a drug deal in Olympic Way.

At the sight of our officers, the group dispersed with one male discarding a number of items as he ran away, including drugs, a large quantity of cash, cannabis grinders and some personal belongings.

Neighbourhood Policing Sergeant Chris Stevens, said: "We're really disappointed that the owner of these items ran away from us and didn't feel like he wanted to stick around and talk to us.

"We'd really like him to come to a police station of his choice at his earliest convenience to try and have that conversation with us in the warm.

"We know he must be be missing his property - especially the cash!"

If you are the person who dropped these items, we would love you to get in touch either in person or on the phone via 101.

**Incident number:** 21000014955
