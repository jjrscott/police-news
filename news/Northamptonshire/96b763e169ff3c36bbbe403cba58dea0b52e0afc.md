A man who brutally attacked two vulnerable Northamptonshire pensioners at different addresses on the same day has been locked up for five years.

Ian Courtney Moore was jailed at Northampton Crown Court on December 23 after he was convicted of two counts of grievous bodily harm against the two men, one aged 79 and the other 68.

The court was told how 47-year-old Moore had attended two addresses in Finedon on June 29 this year and assaulted the occupants, inflicting serious injuries.

During the attacks, in Thrapston Road and Allen Road, Moore subjected his victims to terrifying violence, with one of the victims sustaining a broken jaw in the attack.

The crime spree was believed to be money-related, but Moore only pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm.

Speaking after sentence was passed, DC Ryan Smedley, of Northamptonshire Police, said: "Moore is an extremely violent and dangerous man who has been locked up for two attacks which were entirely unprovoked and wholly terrifying for the victims, one of whom has had to leave the area altogether.

"Due to some excellent work, Northamptonshire Police has been able to safeguard the public from a very violent individual."

Moore, of Thrapston Road, Finedon, has been on remand since his arrest in June. He was told he posed such a danger to the public that it would be up the Probation Service to determine if he was safe for release upon completion of his sentence.
