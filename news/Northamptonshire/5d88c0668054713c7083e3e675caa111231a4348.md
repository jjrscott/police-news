Northamptonshire Police has released a video about open land searches which took place in Northampton as part of the force's fight against serious and organised crime.

The searches took place in the Blackthorn area last Thursday, October 17, with officers using information received from the community to target their efforts to find illegal weapons and drugs.

A number of items were recovered as part of the day's activity, which also saw officers execute a search warrant in Cowley Close, Wootton.

The work formed part of Operation Viper, the Northamptonshire Police crackdown on serious organised crime, including serious violence and drug-related activity.
