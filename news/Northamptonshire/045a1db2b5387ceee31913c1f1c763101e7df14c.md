A 23-year-old woman has been charged with Possession of Class A drugs with Intent to supply after an incident in Becketts Park, Northampton, on Tuesday, December 8.

Amy Pitt, 23, of Northampton, has been charged in connection with an incident where a woman was found to be in possession of heroin and crack cocaine.

Pitt, who has no links to the University of Northampton, has been bailed to appear at Northampton Crown Court on January 6, 2021.

This arrest was made by the University Policing Team as they were patrolling the surrounding community areas around the Waterside Campus at the time.

The team deal with crimes and incidents related to both students on campus and in the wider communities where students are living. They carry out a mixture of uniformed and plain-clothed activities in order to make the area the University sits within safer for the students and all other residents.

The wider community continues to benefit from these extra police resources as a direct result of the investment made by the University.
