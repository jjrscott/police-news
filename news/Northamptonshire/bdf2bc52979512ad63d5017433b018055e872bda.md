Nineteen officers have joined the ranks of Northamptonshire Special Constabulary after being sworn into their new roles at a ceremony held at Force Headquarters last month (October).

Special Inspector Kevin Freeman oversaw the ceremony, which was also attended by Deputy Chief Constable Simon Nickless and Paul Bullen on behalf of the Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner.

In the presence of Justice of the Peace John Baker, the special constables received their policing powers, read their attestation pledge as well as signed their declaration of service.

Family and friends were also invited to attend the ceremony to witness the officers swear their oath of allegiance to the Queen before having the opportunity to pose for photographs.

Mr Nickless said: "The Special Constabulary provides a valuable service to policing in general. We're indebted to each and every one of them for the time they give for free and for the contribution they make to fighting crime and protecting the public. I wish them all the very best in their future careers with the Force."

Special constables are part-time, voluntary police officers with all the same powers as their full-time regular colleagues, who come from all walks of life and join us for a variety of reasons.

Special Inspector Freeman added: "I am grateful for the opportunity to welcome these officers into Northamptonshire Police Special Constabulary and would like to wish them luck in their careers with the Force.

"These officers will be giving up their free time to help with the Force's policing priorities, including fighting crime and protecting people, and I look forward to serving with them on the frontline."
