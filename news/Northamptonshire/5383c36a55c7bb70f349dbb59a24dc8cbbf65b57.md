An attempted kidnap and an ongoing murder investigation are among the Northamptonshire Police cases to be highlighted by the BBC's Crimewatch Roadshow this week.

From this morning (Monday, September 7), the roadshow will be broadcasted live on BBC1 every week day between 9.15am and 10am, until Monday, September 27, appealing for witnesses to unsolved crimes as well as showcasing some of the proactive police work which goes on across the UK.

Presenters Rav Wilding and Michelle Ackerley will be speaking to officers from Northamptonshire Police, who are appealing for information to help solve some of the Force's unsolved cases.

Detective Superintendent Paul Rymarz, said: "The BBC Crimewatch Roadshow is a fantastic opportunity for us to publicise some of our unsolved crimes in order to appeal for witness and information.

"It will also showcase some of the fantastic work our officers are involved in on a day-to-day basis in order to fight crime and protect people in across the county.

"We would like to hear from anyone who may have witnessed or have any information about any of the Force's cases featured on the show, who have yet to come forward, to do so as a matter of urgency."

Anyone with information is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101. Or alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

If you miss today's show, don't worry as it will be available to watch on catch-up via BBC iPlayer at www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer.
