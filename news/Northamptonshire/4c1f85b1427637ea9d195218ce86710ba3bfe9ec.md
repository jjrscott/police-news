People in the north of the county were given the opportunity to discover what kind of activities and support is available to older generations living and working in the borough of Corby.

The Talking About Our Generation event was organised by Corby Borough Council along with the town's MP Tom Pursglove, at the Cube in George Street on Friday (April 12), and was aimed at the over-50s.

Visitors to the fair were able to pick up information on everything from financial and pension advice, health care and nutrition through to arts, crafts and hobbies, travel and leisure.

Police Community Support Officer (PCSO) Tony Greening was also on hand at the event to discuss local policing concerns as well as handout information leaflets and public safety goodies.

The Corby Neighbourhood Policing officer was joined by three members of the Northamptonshire Emergency Services (NES) Cadets who were able to speak to visitors interested in their role.

PCSO Greening said: "This was a really good event and we had a great time talking to those who came along. The main aim was to find out from those who are over-50 about their neighbourhood and their point of view on local policing issues.

"Luka, Patrick and Aiden were fantastic and very helpful. A number of people who visited our stand were very interested in the NES Cadets and the role they play in policing, and the boys were very professional and a credit to their unit."

If you are interested in joining the Northamptonshire Emergency Service Cadets, applications are now open for the next intake to start in September. For more information visit www.nescadets.co.uk. Closing date for applications is April 30.
