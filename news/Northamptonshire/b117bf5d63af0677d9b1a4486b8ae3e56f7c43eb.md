Police investigating a burglary in Northampton are appealing for witnesses and information.

Between 8.15am and 8.45am yesterday, Tuesday, February 2, two masked men carrying machetes forced their way into a property in St Michael's Road.

Once inside, the pair stole around Â£1,000 in cash and items of jewellery before running off towards Kettering Road and then into Wellingborough Road, heading towards the town centre.

The offenders are described as two men of Asian appearance. Both wore black face coverings, and dark coloured or grey jogging bottoms.

Anyone who saw the incident, or who may have information, CCTV or dashcam footage which could be useful to the investigation, should call Northamptonshire Police on 101.

**Incident number:** 21000067717
