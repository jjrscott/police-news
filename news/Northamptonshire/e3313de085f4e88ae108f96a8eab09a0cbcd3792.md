We asked the county's children and young people to share their lockdown artwork with us. We had a fantastic response and this celebratory video showcases all the creative, colourful work we received. There are clearly a lot of talented young people in Northamptonshire!

Thank you for sharing your wonderful work - your originality, talent and skill shines through.
