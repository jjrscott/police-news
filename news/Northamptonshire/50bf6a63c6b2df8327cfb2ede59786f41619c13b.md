Members of the Corby Neighbourhood Policing Team had the opportunity to enjoy the sunshine last weekend (June 29/30) as they joined local residents for two fun days in the town.

PC Chris Vickers and Police Community Support Officer Tony Greening attended the community events at Coronation Park in Corby and East Carlton Country Park over the two days.

Supported by the Northamptonshire Emergency Services (NES) Cadets Kingswood Unit, the Neighbourhood team handed out crime prevention advice and leaflets to visitors as well as carried out a Local Identified Priorities questionnaire.

While younger visitors had the opportunity to sit in one of the Northamptonshire Police patrol cars and give the blue and twos a quick blast as well as have their photo taken wearing a police hat.

PC Vickers said: "The good weather always brings people outdoors, so it was great to be able to support both community events and have the opportunity to meet members of the public.

"The events were also a great way for the Cadets to interact with the community, to not only provide crime prevention advice but to also listen to any local policing issues they may have."

On Saturday, the Neighbourhood team and Cadets joined visitors in Coronation Park for the Maplefields Circle of Friends Fun Day. At the event, PC Vickers put his face painting skills to the test to raise money for The Care of Police Survivors (COPS) charity.

While on the Sunday, the Cadets set up their NES gazebo at East Carlton Country Park for the Corby Lions annual Fun Day, there were lots of activities for the whole family to enjoy, including a dog show.
