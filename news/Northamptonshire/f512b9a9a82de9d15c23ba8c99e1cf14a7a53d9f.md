Officers investigating an incident where a young woman was followed and touched by a stranger are appealing for witnesses and information.

Between 4.45pm and 5.30pm on Saturday, March 20, an 18-year-old woman walking along Kettering Road, Northampton, was approached by a man who had been walking behind her.

He began to ask her questions and walked closely beside her as she tried to walk away, before putting his arm around her, touching her hair and making comments which made her uncomfortable, and ignoring her when she asked him to get off her.

The woman decided to walk to somewhere with more people about, but the man stayed with her as she walked along St Michael's Road.

As the woman reached the Aldi store in Earl Street the man moved away from her, but stayed in the area until she was met by a friend.

The suspect is described as a man in his 30s, 5ft 6in to 5ft 8in, of average build and possibly mixed race or of Asian appearance. He had short dark hair and some facial hair. He wore a dark brown jacket, blue jeans and white trainers.

Anyone who saw any of the incident, or has information about it or the man described, is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101.
