Northamptonshire Police Community Engagement Officers were in Wellingborough on Wednesday (October 9) to share personal safety and crime prevention advice as part of the Force's ongoing burglary campaign.

Members of the Wellingborough Dostiyo Group invited Detective Constable Rachel Packman and PC Christian Buckenham to attend their meeting held at the town's Victoria Centre.

The officers spoke to the group, which provides support and friendship among the Asian community, about how to protect themselves and their property, as well as handed out copies of the Force's new burglary prevention packs.

Rachel said: "There is often a spike in residential burglaries at this time of year, which coincides with the clocks going back. It is important we share our advice with all members of the community, and this was another great opportunity to do just that."

Savita Paw, of the Wellingborough Dostiyo, said "We appreciate any engagement from the police. The talk was very helpful and reassured our members, some of whom live alone. The burglary packs were also very informative."

The next major event in the Hindu calendar is Diwali on Sunday, October 27, and in addition to the talk, Rachel and Christian visited the Hindu Mandair in Highfield Road, to leave Happy Diwali cards, which included key crime prevention messages.
