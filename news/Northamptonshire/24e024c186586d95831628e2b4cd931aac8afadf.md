Two men have been arrested on suspicion of cultivating cannabis after officers raided a Northampton drugs factory.

Officers conducted a misuse of drugs search warrant at the non-residential property off Upper Thrift Street at about 11.15am today (Tuesday, July 7).

Inspector Andy Blaize said: "We forced entry to the property and found two men who have been arrested on suspicion of cultivating cannabis and they are in custody at the Criminal Justice Centre.

Inspector Andy Blaize said: "We forced entry to the property and found two men who have been arrested on suspicion of cultivating cannabis and they are in custody at the Criminal Justice Centre.

"The grow is in various stages, there is a nursery area for the young plants and some mature plants which have been cut and prepared.

"I think we have entered at a time when these plants would have been due for collection and then sale on the streets of Northampton.

"This is a substantial grow and a sophisticated set up with lighting and ventilation.

"Cultivation of cannabis is an illegal offence, it is organised crime and like any organised crime there are victims of that.

"If you are going to set up a cannabis grow in Northampton, you are going to spend a lot of money up front, we can come along and take your grow, take your equipment, you lose that money and there's a good chance that you're going to prison."
