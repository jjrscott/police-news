**Chief Constable Nick Adderley, said:**

"This morning's meeting at Force Headquarters was a great opportunity for me to have a face-to-face conversation with the family of Harry Dunn.

"It was a warm and productive meeting where all manner of things were discussed.

"The pain this family feel over the loss of 19-year-old Harry cannot be put into words and this pain continues to be compounded by the fact that the suspect in this case remains in the United States of America.

"We will continue doing all we can to work alongside the Crown Prosecution Service in getting justice for Harry and I am pleased to be able to do this alongside the family.

"In addition, we will also be working with the family regarding ongoing base safety in Northamptonshire."
