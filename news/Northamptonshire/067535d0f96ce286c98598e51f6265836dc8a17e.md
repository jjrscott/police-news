Police officers are appealing for witnesses after a man was robbed in Northampton between 9.30pm and 10pm on Friday, February 12.

The incident started in Cowper Street, when two men approached the man and demanded money. As the offenders chased him, the man got into the back of a taxi parked nearby.

The taxi driver refused to drive, and the offenders got into the back of the taxi as well and attacked the man, who sustained lacerations to his hands caused by a knife.

The taxi then travelled on to Cloutsham Street via Clare Street and Overstone Road, where it stopped. The man managed to escape after a chase.

The first offender was black and in his early 20s, 5ft 8in and of a chubby build with shaven dark hair and spoke with a London accent. It is believed he may have had rectangle framed glasses.

He was wearing a dark coloured scarf covering the lower half of his face, dark bottoms and had a black or grey Gucci messenger bag over his shoulder.

The second man was also black and of a similar age, 5ft 7in and of a slim build with short dark braided hair and possibly a noticeable gap in his top teeth. He also spoke with a London accent and was wearing a black tracksuit.

Officers would like to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the incident in either Cowper Street or Cloutsham Street, or who may have information which could assist with the investigation.

Anyone with information is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101 quoting reference number 21000088118. Or alternatively call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
