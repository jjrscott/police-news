Students who attend a Polish Supplementary School in East Northamptonshire had the opportunity to learn more about crime prevention and fire safety during a visit from their local police and fire service.

PC Christian Buckenham and DC Rachel Packman joined more than 300 students at the community-run school based at Huxlow Science College in Irthlingborough, on Saturday (October 5).

The Community Engagement Officers were joined by Northamptonshire Fire and Rescue colleague, Jo Gouldson for the visit which was part of a joint initiative to reach all sections of the community.

Christian said: "Rachel and I continue to visit various community and faith groups across the county to build links and to make people aware of our work. We want to make sure all our communities feel safe and secure."

Community Safety Officer, Jo added: "This was a fantastic opportunity to meet with youngsters from the Polish communities to promote our fire safety messages, in particularly in the run up to Halloween and Bonfire Night."

The visit, which was well received by those attending the school, included a short presentation and Q&A session. The students were also had the opportunity to try on uniforms, test equipment and climb aboard a fire engine.
