Northampton Community Safety Partnership are coming together in Semilong for a Day of Action today (Tuesday, August 6).

Starting at Alliston Gardens Youth and Community Centre, the day gives local residents the opportunity to engage with services and highlight any issues they are experiencing.
Northampton Borough Council, Northampton Partnership Homes, Veolia, Northamptonshire Police, Age UK and Neighbourhood Watch are among the organisations that will be on hand to chat, between 10am and 12.30pm.

In addition, free massage, nail treatments and refreshments will be available for anyone who pops by.

Then in the afternoon, Northampton Leisure Trust, Free2Talk and Inspiration FM will be leading free activities for young people in Miller's Meadow, 1pm to 4pm.

Activities include free sports sessions, boxing taster sessions with local club 'Rough and Ready Boxing', bike security markings and cycle safety. This is followed by Free2Talk's weekly youth club at Springs Family Centre from 4pm.

Councillor Anna King, Cabinet member for community engagement and safety, said: "Each year we hold a series of 'Action Days' with partners in a variety of areas, giving residents the chance to meet and chat with people who provide their local services, with the aim of making improvements together.

"There's lots going on at the Semilong Day of action for people to get involved in and we look forward to seeing more residents at future 'Action Days' in Spring Boroughs, Briar Hill and Rye Hill as well as many more locations throughout the summer."
