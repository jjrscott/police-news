Officers taking part in an operation to target those involved in crime in Northampton conducted a drugs warrant in Delapre yesterday, December 17.

The Northampton Neighbourhood Team were joined by colleagues from the Central Operations Team to conduct the Misuse of Drugs Warrant at the residential property.

Cannabis and other drugs which are subject to testing were recovered at the property and officers are working with the RSPCA after concerns were raised about the welfare of a number of animals inside the property.

Officers also conducted patrols in areas identified as being known for drug dealing. Off road motorbikes were used in these areas which resulted in the Stop Search of four individuals, during which cannabis was recovered.

A 21-year-old man was interviewed on suspicion of the possession of cannabis and the investigation into his activity is on-going.

Sergeant Nick Paul from the Neighbourhood Team, said "Northamptonshire Police continue to fight the war on drugs and this warrant is one of many the Northampton Neighbourhood Policing Team have conducted in recent months. In fact, this is the seventh warrant we have executed since December 1.

"More enforcement is being planned and the level of community intelligence being provided to us has been incredible.

"We know that drug abuse impacts and links into many crime types, from domestic abuse, to exploitation, burglary to vehicle crime and many more. This is exactly why we will keep the pressure on those who think it is acceptable to produce, posses, or supply illegal drugs of any kind in our areas."

If you have any information or concerns about suspicious behaviour where you live, you can report it to us online or by calling 101. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 08000 555 111.
