The family of Ralph Baxter, the 74-year-old man who died in Roade on Wednesday, April 8, have released the following tribute to him.

"Ralph was a loving husband, step-father, step-grandfather, brother, and uncle.

"Ralph lived in Roade with his wife for 35 years and since retiring has enjoyed walking their dog Bertie around the local area.

"One of his proudest moments was receiving an MBE from the Queen for his dedication and commitment to the Civil Service.

"He was an avid supporter of the Saints Rugby Club and rarely missed a match. Ralph was also a keen member of the Labour Party and could always be relied on to 'pound the pavement' at canvassing time.

"He will be greatly missed by his family, colleagues, neighbours and friends."
