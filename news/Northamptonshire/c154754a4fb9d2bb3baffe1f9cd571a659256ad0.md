The 12 days of Christmas continues for the Northampton Neighbourhood Policing team who shone a light on domestic abuse in the third day of activity.

Tackling domestic abuse is a force priority and the team ramped up the intensity yesterday, engaging with victims of domestic abuse and targeting offenders.

The team worked closely with the Domestic Abuse Prevention and Investigation Team (DAPIT) to identify victims in need of safeguarding and support while taking positive action against perpetrators.

Items such as personal attack alarms and window alarms were issued to those vulnerable to abuse - these were funded by the Office of the Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner as part of a crime prevention initiative in Northampton.

Some of the day's results are below:

 * Eight safeguarding checks to victims of domestic abuse
 * One woman was arrested for failing to appear at court in relation to domestic abuse offences
 * One man was arrested for a high risk domestic assault and breach of a Domestic Violence Prevention Order (DVPN). He has been put before the courts this morning for the breach of the DVPN and enquiries are ongoing for the assault
 * Three disruption visits to high risk domestic perpetrators

Police Sergeant Tor Lindsay said: "Domestic violence makes people feel unsafe in their own homes and has huge repercussions, impacting everyone in the household - sadly that often includes children.

"There is no place in our communities for perpetrators of domestic abuse and those engaging in this type of violence should be in no doubt Northamptonshire Police will continue to relentlessly safeguard victims and bring those responsible to justice.

"Today's arrests and visits demonstrate just how dedicated we are to tackling this terrible crime - not just today, but every day."
