Police investigating an attempted assault in Northampton are appealing for witnesses.

A man in his early 20s was walking along Kettering Road, opposite the Guy Salmon Jaguar garage between 5.20pm and 5.30pm on Wednesday, December 2, when he was approached by a group of young men.

One of the group produced a knife and lunged at the victim, causing damage to his coat. The group of offenders then fled the scene.

They are described as a group of six to seven black men, aged around 20, and all wore tracksuits, coats, gloves and face masks.

Police would like to speak to anyone who may have witnessed this incident or who may have any information regarding it.

Witnesses or anyone with information is asked to call police on 101 quoting 20000637809, or independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
