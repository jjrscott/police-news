Sixteen new officers were sworn into their roles at Northamptonshire Police at a special ceremony held at Force Headquarters last Friday (August 30).

Chief Constable Nick Adderley oversaw the ceremony, which was also attended by family and friends who were invited to see the new recruits swear their allegiance to the Queen.

In the presence of Northamptonshire Bench Chair and Justice of the Peace Dominic Goble, the student constables read their attestation pledge, received their policing powers and signed their declaration of service.

Six of the new recruits are no strangers to the Force having worked as members of police staff in the control room and custody, or served as Special Constables with Northamptonshire Police.

However the majority of the new intake are new to the police service, joining the Force from a range of professions from horse riding instructor, marquee installer, bar manager and charity administrator to serving with the Armed Forces.

Mr Adderley said: "The attestation is an important and proud occasion for officers and their families. I was delighted to welcome our latest intake of new constables to the Force.

"I have no doubt each will bring their own unique strengths, skills and experiences to the role and will be an asset to both the Force and the communities they serve, fighting crime and protecting the people of Northamptonshire."

This latest attestation takes the total number of new officers joining the ranks of Northamptonshire Police since January to 80. The Force is currently running the #FitTheBill recruitment drive and is welcoming applications for police constables.
