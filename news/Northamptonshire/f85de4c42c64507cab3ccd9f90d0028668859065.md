The Northamptonshire Police Dog Section will be in action at a Community Safety Fun Day in Towcester this Sunday (June 23).

Organised by South Northants Council (SNC), in partnership with the emergency services, the event takes place at the Towcester Recreation Ground on Islington Road, between 10am and 4pm.

This free event will feature live demonstrations from the emergency services and displays by the Force's dog section, fire engines and rescue vehicles, plus local neighbourhood teams.

There will also be information stands promoting activities and clubs for young people to get involved with, stalls and refreshments.

Cllr Karen Cooper, Portfolio Holder for Wellbeing at SNC said: "We are really looking forward to bringing people together for this event and sharing important safety messages, while also having some fun in the sunshine (fingers crossed!).

"The day is part of our ongoing initiative to encourage our communities to work as one to solve issues and educate our young people to make South Northants a safe place for everyone."

SNC's Community Safety Officer Gary Crook is chief organiser. He added: "We hope this event will help bring the whole community together for some fun.

"As well as exciting emergency service demonstrations including displays from the police dogs throughout the day, we will be showcasing just how many great organisations there are in South Northants for young people to get involved with."

Other organisations attending include sea cadets, air cadets, St Johns Ambulance, Towcester Rugby Club, Towcester Football Club, The Scouts, Guides and Brownies, Towcester Boxing Club and Voice for Young People.
