Officers from the South Northants Neighbourhood Policing and Rural Crime Teams joined thousands of people from the local farming community for the 135th annual Blakesley Show.

With the traditional agricultural show attracting visitors from across the country, the event at Blakesley Heath Farm provided the perfect opportunity for PCs Aaron Puckrin and Abbey Anstead to meet the rural community.

Joining firearms licensing colleagues on the Northamptonshire Police stand, Aaron and Abbey were on hand to promote the work of the Rural Crime Team and Wildlife Officers, answer any policing concerns as well as provide crime prevention advice.

Sergeant Micki Simons of the South Northants Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "Farmers can be notoriously difficult to meet with due to their busy schedules, unsociable working hours and often isolated location, which makes our attendance at these shows vitally important.

"Abbey has attended these events for a number of years and the effectiveness of this is evidenced in the amount of people who recognise her, address her by her first name and are happy to speak to her.

"Although it was Aaron's first show, he found the whole experience invaluable as it provided him with the opportunity to not only network with partner agencies but to have the chance to meet local landowners on his policing area.

"Events such as this provides us with the opportunity to build on that partnership to ensure members of the rural community receive the same level of service and support as those living in our towns."

Organised by Blakesley & District Agricultural Ltd, the event which is held the first Saturday of August, hosts an array of equestrian, livestock and trade exhibitors as well as a Gymkhana.
