With a host of police officer and staff vacancies currently available, Northamptonshire Police is the place to find your next career.

For the first time in years, the Force is expanding across roles both on the front line as well as those roles that support the front line.

There are a variety of roles in specialist areas to meet the needs of the organisation, while providing opportunities for people to apply.

We have roles in digital forensics, a range of ICT roles from developers and programmers to solutions architects and analysts.

There are key positions in the areas of domestic abuse and road traffic collisions, case builders, crime scene investigators and research analysts.

If you are interested on being on the front line, then we have police officer vacancies for degree holders, we're also looking for transferees for detectives or police constables.

Or for those who don't want to leave the job they're currently doing but want the insight of a police officer life, then we're also looking at Special Constable Recruitment.

Paul Bullen, Director of Enabling Services, said: "If you enjoy facing challenges, solving problems and would like to contribute to keeping your community safe whilst developing a wider range of skills, then a career in policing could be for you.

"There are many different ways you can contribute to the police, as the wide range of vacancies demonstrate. Our police staff work side by side with police officers and make a real difference to people's lives.

"We offer competitive salaries, flexible working as well as great training and development opportunities."
