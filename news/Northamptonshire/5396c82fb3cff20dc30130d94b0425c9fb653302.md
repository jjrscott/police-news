A 27-year-old Northamptonshire man has been charged with drugs offences following raids by police in Daventry.

Jordan Swain appeared before Northampton Magistrates Court yesterday charged with three counts of conspiracy to supply cocaine, cannabis and amphetamine and a further charge of money laundering.

The offences are alleged to have happened between February 2019 up until his arrest in the town last Thursday (December 10).

Swain, of Admiral's Way, Daventry, was remanded in custody by magistrates to appear before Northampton Crown Court on Wednesday, January 6.
