A Corby charity has joined forces with the town's neighbourhood policing team to deliver a little festive cheer to local schoolchildren and their families.

Corby & District Lions Club, with support from the town's Morrisons supermarket, purchased Â£300 of festive goodies to create 42 food bags which were donated to families on the Lloyds estate.

PC Chris Vickers of the Corby Neighbourhood Policing Team, asked the charity for help after visiting Rockingham Primary School in Rockingham Road, and hearing about the difficulties some families were experiencing.

"Through Head Teacher Tracey Hudson, I heard about the difficulties some of their more vulnerable families were having as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic," said PC Vickers.

"Christmas can be a particularly difficult time for some of our families, but thanks to the generosity of Corby & District Lions Club and Morrisons, we hope the donation of some festive goodies will help ease the financial pressures they face.

"The bags included Christmas cakes, mince pies and Christmas pudding, all festive goodies which the majority of us take for granted, however these are luxury items for some, and we didn't want our local schoolchildren to miss out."

Corby & District Lion Club member, Jenny Clarke added: "After hearing about the plight of some of the families at the school, we were only too happy to work together with the Corby community to spread some goodwill at this difficult time.

"We would like to say a huge thank you to Morrisons' community champion, Tricia Robins, who assisted with not only the purchasing of Christmas treats but also the packing of more than 40 bags."

Corby & District Lions Club members Jenny Clarke, Ronnie Vickers (Santa Claus) and Dan McDonald, were joined by PC Vickers to hand over the festive food bags to Head Teacher Tracey Hudson.

"The last few months has been tricky for everyone. However the people of Corby have rallied around and the sense of community is humbling," said Head Teacher Tracey Hudson.

She continued: "PC Vickers and members of the Corby & District Lions Club have added some festive cheer for some of our families and we are hugely grateful for this."
