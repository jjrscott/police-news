Officers from Northamptonshire Police have released images of jewellery on behalf of their Leicestershire colleagues, in a bid to reunite items with the rightful owner.

The items which included a number of bracelets, rings, necklaces and brooches, are believed to be stolen and were recovered from the Bagworth area of Leicestershire on Wednesday, December 9, last year.

Officers believe these items, which were stored in a distinctive pillowcase, could have been stolen during burglaries in Northamptonshire, and are appealing for anyone who may recognise the jewellery or the pillowcase to get in touch.

Anyone who recognises these items or knows who they might belong to should call Northamptonshire Police on 101, quoting reference number 20000557523.

A 20-year-old man from Coalville, a 19-year-old man from Cheshire and a 16-year-old boy from Leicester have been arrested by Leicestershire Police on suspicion of burglary and released on bail pending further enquiries.
