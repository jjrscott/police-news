The family of an 85-year-old man who died in a road traffic collision in Desborough have paid tribute to him.

Michael Harvey, known as 'Mick', died on Thursday, May 21, after his electric powered tricycle was hit by a car in Stoke Road.

His family have now paid tribute to him in a statement released on their behalf by Northamptonshire Police:

"Mick spent his whole life in Desborough and was a valued and well-liked member of the community.

"He was husband to the late Barbara, father to Richard and Jane, grandfather to Donald, Charis, Henry & Joshua and brother to Janet.

"Mick was a passionate cyclist and an active member of St. Giles Church.

"He had many friends in Desborough and the wider area and will be sadly missed by everyone who knew him."
