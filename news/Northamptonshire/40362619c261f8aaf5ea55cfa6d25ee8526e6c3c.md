A stolen trailer recovered in Wellingborough has been reunited with its rightful owners thanks to Northamptonshire Police's Rural Crime Team.

The Ifor Williams trailer was seized by police from Shaw Close in late August alongside a range of items officers suspected were stolen property.

Officers from the Rural Crime Team then set about tracing it via the manufacturer, with records showing it had been legitimately resold, eventually being bought by a Wellingborough tree surgery firm before being stolen in early August.

Rural crime officer PC Hutch Hutchings explained: "At the time it was stolen, the trailer wasn't on the firm's insurance, so its loss hit them financially as well as practically.

"They were very happy to have it returned, it's great to be able to reunite someone with their property when they had given it up as lost."

Enquiries are ongoing into the theft of the trailer, with the locations it was stolen from and recovered at proving useful to the investigation.

For PC Hutchings, the job also serves as an important reminder of the importance of machinery and plant owners keeping a list of their equipment, including full identification numbers.

He said: "Having all the details of your kit to hand means that if you should fall victim to this kind of crime, you can pass all the information on to the police straight away so it can be used to identify property and used to return recovered items to their rightful owners quickly.

"It's also a good idea to make your items easily identifiable - adding postcodes or company names is a good start, and you can also use schemes like Datatag for overt and covert marking purposes."
