The Crime Prevention team at Northamptonshire Police will be contacting businesses in the county to offer advice and answer any crime prevention questions following the Covid-19 closures.

Prevention Manager Laura Jones, said: "We know this is an exceptionally hard time for businesses in Northamptonshire and we want to provide them with the best crime prevention advice to get them through this difficult time.

"We know that business owners in this county have invested a great deal of time, energy and money into their businesses and we'll be contacting them to go through any concerns or queries relating to crime prevention that they may have."

There are some simple steps businesses can take to help prevent crime during this time including:

 * Remove cash and any high value goods from business premises where possible.
 * Ensure premises are locked and secured, including gates.
 * Ensure alarms are set.
 * Removing wheelie bins or anything which could be used as a climbing aid.
