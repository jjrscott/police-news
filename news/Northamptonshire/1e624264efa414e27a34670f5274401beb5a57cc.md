The public in Northamptonshire is being urged to celebrate VE Day sensibly this year amid the COVID-19 lockdown.

On the 75th anniversary of the end of fighting in Europe, it is right that we join together safely, as a nation, to remember and give thanks to all those who played their part in bringing peace after six long years.

However, in light of the ongoing coronavirus outbreak and social distancing guidance, it is of utmost importance that people commemorate at home, so we can protect the NHS and save lives.

Superintendent Sarah Johnson, said: "We know that people may have had plans to hold street parties to celebrate VE Day and that these have now had to be scaled back significantly due to the lockdown.

"We really appreciate people making these sacrifices in order to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and would like to reiterate the need for everyone to keep doing their bit by socially distancing themselves from people outside of their households.

"Increased foot patrols will be taking place across the county to make sure people are celebrating sensibly. We are keen to support those safely celebrating VE Day but remain available to assist should reports be received of people not adhering to the lockdown rules.

"Thank you to all the people of Northamptonshire who have really helped us police this unprecedented time by staying inside and I hope we can have another weekend where the majority of people work with us to protect our NHS."
