Police are appealing for witnesses after a man was pepper-sprayed and punched in the face in Towcester.

The victim was attacked in Springfields some time between 9.20am and 9.40am last Wednesday (March 10).

He pulled over his car over after he saw a man and a woman, both aged about 30, gesturing at him. After being punched twice by the woman, the victim got out of his silver Vauxhall Zafira and was then punched twice more before the male suspect then sprayed him up to 10 times in the face with pepper spray before they both ran off.

The man was white, 5ft 8in and had dark blonde hair. He was wearing a green tracksuit top and bottoms. The woman was also white with a slim build and long black hair tied back in a ponytail. She was wearing a black coat and black leggings.

Officers say the attack happened directly by the roundabout junction with Brackley Road and there would have been a number of people in the areas at the time.

Anyone with information should contact Northamptonshire Police on 101 or call Crimestoppers, in confidence, on 0800 555111
