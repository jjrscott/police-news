Police officers are appealing for witnesses after a man was assaulted as he walked through an underpass in Towcester Road, Northampton.

The incident took place between 5.15am and 5.45am on Thursday, January 7, as the man in his 30s walked through the underpass, near the Mereway roundabout, when two men asked him for a cigarette.

When the man told them he didn't smoke, the offenders punched him to the head but the man fought them off. Both offenders were white and in their late teens to early 20s, about 6ft and of a medium build.

One was wearing a black hooded top and a black skull cap, the second wore a black top with the hood up.

Anyone who witnessed this incident or has any information which could assist with the investigation is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101 quoting reference number 21000011543. Or alternatively call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
