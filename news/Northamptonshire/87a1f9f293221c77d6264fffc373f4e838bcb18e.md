Police investigating an attempted robbery in Wellingborough are appealing for potential witnesses to get in touch.

Shortly after 4.45pm on Saturday, February 27, a man was set upon by two other men in an alleyway off Mannock Road, at the entrance to Croyland Park.

The suspects pushed him to the floor as they attempted to steal his bicycle, before they were chased off by a member of the public who had heard shouting.

Croyland Park was busy at the time and officers would like to hear from anyone who was in the area who may have seen or heard anything related to the incident.

The suspects are described as young men, no older than 18. Both are black and wore blue face masks. One wore a black jumper and black tracksuit bottoms with white stripes, the other was dressed all in black.

Anyone who saw the incident or has any information about it should call Northamptonshire Police on 101.

**Incident number:** 21000115772
