Police officers are appealing for witnesses after a racially aggravated incident in the Hall Park/Wymington Road area of Rushden.

The incident took place between 4.30pm and 5.15pm on Wednesday, February 10, when an unknown man chased four boys aged between 11 to 13 and shouted racial abuse at them.

The boys attempted to flag down passing motorists without success, before hiding until the offender had gone and running to a nearby house to ask for help. The offender was a white man in his 50s and wearing a black woollen hat and blue face mask.

Anyone who may have witnessed this incident or has any information which could help with the investigation is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101 quoting reference number 21000083390.
