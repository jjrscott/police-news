Officers investigating an incident of dangerous driving in Wellingborough are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information or relevant dash-cam footage to get in touch.

Between 6pm and 6.45pm on Friday, March 12, a silver Audi A4 estate followed a purple Citroen Picasso along Wordsworth Road in a dangerous manner before overtaking it.

When the Citroen turned around to head to the A4500, the driver of the Audi used the Wilby Way roundabout to do the same and followed the Citroen onto the A4500 where further dangerous manoeuvres were carried out, including the Audi stopping in the carriageway and then clipping another vehicle which was trying to get past it.

Anyone who saw any of the incident, has information about it or dash-cam footage of it, is asked to contact Northamptonshire Police on 101.

**Incident number:** 21000141904
