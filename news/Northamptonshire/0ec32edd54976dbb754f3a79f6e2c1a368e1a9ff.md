Police officers are appealing for witnesses after an assault at the Abington Park bus stop in Wellingborough Road, Northampton.

Between 4.55pm and 5.15pm on Thursday, October 22, two boys were assaulted by two fellow passengers on a Stagecoach bus. All four males have then got off the bus at the Abington Park bus stop, and the same two boys were assaulted again.

During the incident, one of the offenders produced a knife, before both offenders ran off into Abington Park. Both are described as being mixed race, of a slim build and wearing face coverings.

One of the offenders was aged between 17-18 years, 5ft 11in, with hair plaits which reached his ears. The second offender was about 5ft 9in.

Officers believe the area near to the bus stop would have been busy at that time and are appealing for anyone who witnessed the assault, either on the bus or in Wellingborough Road, to contact them.

Witnesses or anyone with information are asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101 quoting reference number 20000558209. Or alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
