An 11-year-old girl got a special surprise for her birthday this year when her mum contacted Northamptonshire Police asking for help.

11-year-old Maclain was looking forward to spending her 11th birthday in lockdown on Monday, May 11, so her mum decided to try and make her birthday one to remember by contacting her local police force.

After liaising with Maclain's mum, PCSO Dot Wilson-Townsend and PCSO Craig Matthews made sure they were patrolling in the area at the same time Maclain and her family were out on their daily walk. PCSO Wilson-Townsend then presented the birthday girl with a teddy.

Maclain's mum, Rebecca Lamb, said: "I really wanted to make Maclain's birthday one to remember, especially in these challenging times, and Northamptonshire Police absolutely made her day last week. Both she and her brother haven't stopped talking about it.

"Maclain is a very special little girl and I just wanted to show her how special and loved she really is.

"It was really kind of the officers to make the effort to come out and I would like to say a massive thank you to them."

PCSO Dot Wilson-Townsend, said: "As part of the Force's COVID-19 policing operation, we patrol the streets of Northampton every day to provide community reassurance and a friendly face to anyone with any concerns.

"When Maclain's mum contacted us, it was easy to arrange our patrol that day to coincide with the family's daily walk.

"I'm really pleased that we were able to make this little girl's birthday."
