Officers policing the British Grand Prix at Silverstone today, Sunday, July 14, have issued several motorists with Fixed Penalty Notices for Obstruction after 39 vehicles were parked illegally on grass verges on Dadford Road, close to the circuit.

The vehicles were then recovered to a nearby field to ensure the safety of other road users.

Superintendent Dennis Murray, commander for the policing operation, said: "The parking restrictions were clearly marked and were put in place to ensure the safety of the many hundreds of people camping in the nearby campsites who have been walking to and from the circuit over the past four days, and who would be returning to the site following the race this afternoon.

"We have liaised closely with partner agencies and Silverstone Circuits and, as well as issuing parking tickets, we took the joint decision remove as many vehicles as possible from the verges in the interest of public safety."
