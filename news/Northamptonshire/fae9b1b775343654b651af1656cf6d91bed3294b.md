Officers from Northamptonshire Police were among the visitors to the Al-Jamaatul-Muslimin of Bangladesh Mosque for its largest open day.

The Mosque in St George's Street, Northampton opened its doors to the public on Saturday, September 28, to give members of the local community the opportunity to learn more about the place of worship.

As part of the event, visitors learned about the history of the Mosque as part of a guided tour, as well as the different types of religious services held at the Mosque and a demonstration of what happens at prayers.

There was also an opportunity to listen to speeches by the Mosque Imaam, take part in a Question & Answer session as well as join members of the Mosque for refreshments.

Police Community Engagement Officer, PC Christian Buckenham, said: "This event was a great opportunity for members of the public to find out what happens inside their local Mosque and meet members of the Muslim community."

Chair of the Northamptonshire Association of Muslim Police, Sophia Perveen: "In the current climate, it is more important than ever before to increase community cohesion, and events like the Mosque open day that we attended help to do just that."

Committee member of the Mosque and local Solicitor and Magistrate, Jabeer Miah presented the programme on the day. He said: "Around 60 guests, including local residents and dignitaries, attended the event and the feedback was really positive.

"We look forward to holding future events and welcoming more local organisations and members of the community into the Mosque to learn more about the workings of the Mosque and our religion."
