Burglars in Northamptonshire may get more than they bargained for following a suite of specialist crime prevention equipment being installed in areas across the county as part of Operation Crooked.

Operation Crooked is Northamptonshire Police's campaign to reduce burglary - a top priority for the Force. Since the inception of the Force Burglary Team two months ago there has been a significant reduction in burglaries across Northamptonshire.

Now the team are working to prevent burglaries before they even happen by working with specialist crime prevention officers to install equipment across the county which detects offences. Some of this equipment is covert but other equipment includes Ring door bells, forensic marking kits and window shock alarms.

Detective Inspector Wayne Preece, said: "The Force Burglary Team isn't just about arresting and charging burglars who have committed crimes, but also about making Northamptonshire a hostile place for would-be burglars and preventing crimes before they even take place.

"That's why we have invested in this suite of crime prevention equipment which will provide a wall of security against criminals thinking of committing a burglary.

"It will also allow us to track and identify stolen property and make it easier for us to identify burglars after a crime has taken place so we can bring them to justice."

"I also want to take this opportunity to remind people that 25 per cent of burglaries in Northamptonshire are committed by burglars getting in through unlocked doors or windows.

"Give yourself the best chance of not becoming a victim by locking up your property - don't make it easy for them to steal your hard-earned possessions."
