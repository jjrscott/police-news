Witnesses are being sought after a woman was robbed as she walked in Helicopter Park on the Grange estate in Daventry.

Between 7.10pm and 7.30pm on Thursday, January 28, the woman in her 30s, walked along the path near to the Grovelands entrance, when she was approached from behind by two men.

The men threatened her with a weapon and stole her diamond engagement ring, which had a large stone with smaller diamonds embedded in the gold band, and a white Fitbit watch.

Both of the offenders were possibly in their early 20s and wore black balaclavas. One was white and of a slim build and the second was black and of a stocky build. At least one of them was wearing fitted, cycling type clothing and a black t-shirt.

Officers would like to speak to anyone who may have seen two men running away from the park between the stated times or who may have been offered a diamond gold ring for sale in unusual circumstances.

Anyone who witnessed this incident or has any information which could assist with the investigation is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101 quoting reference number 21000060319. Or alternatively call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
