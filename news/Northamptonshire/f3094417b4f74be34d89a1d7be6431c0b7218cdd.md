Police officers have seized £3500 worth of alcohol from a shop in Kettering Road, Northampton, after it was found to be selling it despite having its licence to do so suspended.

D-Light Supermarket had its alcohol licence suspended earlier in the year due to concerns over illegal workers and the sale of illicit tobacco.

However, following three test purchases made by plain-clothes police officers this week, the shop was found to be continuing to sell alcohol.

An enforcement visit was subsequently carried out yesterday (Wednesday, May 6) in which £3500 worth of alcohol and a number of illicit cigarettes and tobacco were seized.

D-Light will now be subject to a further licensing review by the local council at a date in the future to be determined.

Licensing Sergeant Simon Moreton, said: "This shop was blatantly selling alcohol illegally and our officers were able to purchase it a number of times this week despite the shop being told explicitly that its licence to sell it had been suspended.

"Many licensed premises work very hard to maintain good standards in their shops so it is important to make it clear to those that don't that we won't tolerate it in Northamptonshire."
