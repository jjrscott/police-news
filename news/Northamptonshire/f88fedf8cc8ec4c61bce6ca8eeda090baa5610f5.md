A total of 66 officers stood on parade for uniform inspection as part of their police officer training before they go out on patrol in the county.

While things have slowed down in the world amidst the coronavirus pandemic, police officer recruitment and training has continued apace to ensure the Force remains prepared to deal with crime and protect people.

As well all the robust training that is provided to new recruits to teach them how to deal with crime and incidents, ensuring they understand the importance of maintaining a professional and corporate image, and wearing their equipment safely and appropriately is also key.

PC Merb Hussain, one of the trainers, said: "Having undertaken a mixture of socially distanced classroom training and distance learning, the new officers have worked their way through police officer training in a less than traditional fashion. However, some things like uniform inspection are very important and we've been able to manage this with appropriate social distancing.

"The new recruits are from a mixture of backgrounds and ages, with different life experiences. We even have former police officers joining us from Australia, Hungary, America and Sri Lanka!

As part of the inspection, Chief Constable Nick Adderley took the opportunity to show the new recruits how it's done and speak to them, offering his experience and expectations.

Northamptonshire Police is now recruiting police officers. Applicants can join through the regular officer route, known as the Initial Police Learning and Development Programme (IPLDP). This requires applicants to have a Level Three qualification. Closing date is 5 July 2020. To find out more, go online: www.northants.police.uk/policeofficer
