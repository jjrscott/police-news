Police officers have released an image of a man they believe may have information about the theft, and subsequent use, of two bank cards in Northampton.

Between 6pm and 6.30pm on Friday, December 4, in Stubble Close, Northampton, a car had its rear window smashed and a rose gold coloured iPhone 8 stolen along with two bank cards.

The bank cards have then been used to purchase tobacco items from shops in the Kingsthorpe and town centre areas of Northampton, and officers believe the man in the image may have information, which could assist with their investigation.

Officers are appealing for the man or anyone who may recognise him, to get in touch. They are also appealing for the return of the woman's rose gold coloured iPhone 8 which has huge sentimental value.

The phone was purchased by the woman's late husband, who sadly died of Covid-19 in April, and has personal text messages from him stored on it which can never be replaced.

Anyone with information is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101 quoting reference number 20000641768. Or alternatively call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
