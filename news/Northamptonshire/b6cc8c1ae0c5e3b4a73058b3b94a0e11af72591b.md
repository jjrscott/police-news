A group of young volunteers who have been supporting their local community in Northampton throughout the Covid-19 pandemic were give a special police escort last Thursday (August 6).

Since lockdown began at the end of March, the youngsters have been on a mission to collect donations for their local food bank based at St David's Church in Eastern Avenue.

The group has selflessly ventured out in all weathers over the past 20 weeks, and walked around their neighbourhood to help provide food for the more vulnerable members of their community.

Inspired by their dedication, Police Community Support Officers, Rachael Barber and Dot Wilson-Townsend, joined the youngsters on their latest round to provide an extra two pairs of helping hands.

PCSO Barber said: "Each week, the group collects around eight to 10 bags of food donations for the food bank, which has been set up at St David's Church during the Covid-19 pandemic.

"These donations will make a huge difference in helping those in need of additional support at such a difficult time, and the actions of this group is a real testament to the young people living in our communities.

"Both Dot and myself were keen to join the youngsters on one of their collections to show our appreciation and support for the fantastic work they are doing. They are great role models for their peers, and a great inspiration to us all."
