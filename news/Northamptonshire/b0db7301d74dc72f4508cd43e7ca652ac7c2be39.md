Can you help our colleagues at Hampshire Constabulary locate Connor Parker who is wanted on recall to prison?

The 22-year-old is wanted after breaching the conditions of his licence following a sentence for conspiracy to steal in 2019.

Officers have been carrying out a number of enquiries to find Parker and are now appealing to the public to help locate him.

Parker is from Hampshire and has links in Havant, Portsmouth and Park Gate, however he's also known to travel to, and have links to the Northampton and the East Northamptonshire area.

Parker, who is described as white, 6ft 3 and of a slim build, is also known to travel to the Huntingdon and Peterborough area as well as Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Wiltshire.

It is believed Parker is aware he is wanted on recall to prison and is deliberately evading police, and officers would like to remind people that anyone found to be harbouring him to deliberately obstruct attempts to locate him may be committing an offence and be liable for arrest themselves.

Anyone who sees Parker, or has information about his whereabouts, should call their local police force on 101, quoting Hampshire Constabulary reference number, 44200402549. Or alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
