Police investigating deliberate damage to vehicles in Daventry's Headlands estate are appealing for witnesses and information.

On Wednesday, February 24, a vehicle parked in Kingston Close was found to have been damaged, possibly by having been kicked. The same vehicle had also suffered deliberate damage to a wing mirror on January 21.

It is believed the damage to the vehicle may be linked to other incidents of criminal damage in the area, including reports of young people throwing items at passing vehicles in Ashby Road.

Anyone with information about any of the incidents is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101.

**Incident number:** 21000108639
