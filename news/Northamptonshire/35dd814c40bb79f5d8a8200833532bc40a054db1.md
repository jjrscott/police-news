Two police officers, funded by the Business Improvement District, will be a dedicated resource to the town centre, three days a week.

The commitment of officers, whose sole focus will be the town centre, will work to support business and target retail crime, drug dealing, ASB, street drinking and begging.

The officers will also form part of a wider neighbourhood policing team tackling the same issues.

As well as the normal uniform patrols providing high visibility, reassurance and public engagement, officers will also be deploying in plain clothes.

The additional policing, which begins tomorrow, Saturday, October 17, will see officers working in partnership with other support agencies in the town.

Superintendent Kevin Mulligan, local policing commander, said: "It's really important that we work to maximise as much visibility as we possibly can to reassure people that work, visit and frequent the town that it is a safe and controlled environment for them to be in.

"The funding is very welcome because it allows us to put that additional resource into the town centre where people are concerned. The extra staff that it gives us, will reassure, engage and enforce where necessary. "

Mark Mullen, BID operations manager, said: "This is a great opportunity from the BIDs point of view to work in partnership with Northamptonshire Police to encourage visitors into the town, and increase the levels of confidence in the town itself around primarily safety."
