A watch of great sentimental value stolen in a recent burglary has been recovered and returned to its owner by officers from the Northamptonshire West Burglary Team.

PC Mark Edkins from the burglary team said: "The impact of a burglary is significant regardless of what has been stolen, but the theft of items of sentimental value can greatly add to the distress caused.

"My colleagues and I were really pleased to be able to return the watch, which had belonged to a relative who recently passed away, and I hope this has brought the family a little festive cheer during what has been a difficult year for many people."

Officers returned the watch, with a Christmas Card from the team, in a presentation box kindly donated by Michael Jones Jewellers in Northampton.

The item was stolen in a burglary at a property in Kings Sutton last month and was recovered as part of the ongoing investigation. Two men arrested in connection with the burglary have been released under investigation pending further inquiries.
