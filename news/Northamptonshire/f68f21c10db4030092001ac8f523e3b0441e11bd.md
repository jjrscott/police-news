Police investigating the theft of a French bulldog puppy in Northampton are appealing for information and the return of the dog.

Five-month-old Winter was stolen in Edith Street between 12.30pm and 1pm on Sunday, February 28, after she slipped outside while her owner was moving house.

Witnesses reported seeing a white man wearing dark clothing pick the puppy up and carry her off up Ethel Street, heading towards St Edmunds Road/Palmerston Road.

Winter is described as a small white dog with grey and black facial markings. She has one blue eye and one brown eye. She is microchipped but was not wearing a collar when she was stolen.

Officers investigating her theft want to hear from anyone who may have seen her being taken, or who has seen her since, and would ask whoever has taken her to do the right thing and hand her in to a vets.

Anyone with information about Winter's theft or her current whereabouts should call Northamptonshire Police on 101.
