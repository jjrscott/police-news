Police investigating an assault in Wellingborough are appealing to trace a male driver who was flagged down by the victim.

Shortly after 2pm on Sunday, January 17, a man flagged down a passing vehicle in Brickhill Road to ask for a lift home, after being involved in an altercation nearby.

The driver declined to give him a lift but advised that he would call the police. The driver is described as male and wore a blue suit, and was driving towards Wellingborough town centre.

Officers would like to speak to this man as it is hoped he can provide information relevant to the investigation.

Anyone who believes they may have been this driver is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101, regarding incident number 21000040012.
