Youngsters from the Loddington Beaver Scout Colony working towards their Safety Activity Badge received help from two of their local Neighbourhood Policing Team on Monday (October7).

Police Community Support Officer Kirsty Ellerby and PC Richard Horsburgh from the Corby and Kettering Rural team, joined the six to eight-year-olds at their group meeting to talk to them about all aspects of personal safety.

To earn their badges, Beavers must understand the Green Cross Code and Water Safety Code, how to use a roadside/railway level crossing, stranger danger, what to do in the event of a fire and how to call the emergency services.

PCSO Ellerby said: "It was great fun helping the children with their Safety Activity Badges. They demonstrated a good understanding of all the subjects we covered and enjoyed hearing about the different things we do as neighbourhood officers."

As part of the visit, the group went outside to test the lights on the neighbourhood team's patrol car as well had the opportunity to try on PCSO Ellerby's high-vis vest for size.
