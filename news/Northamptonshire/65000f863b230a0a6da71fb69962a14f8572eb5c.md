Chief Constable Nick Adderley joined the Northampton Neighbourhood Policing Team as they spent a few hours visiting some of the more vulnerable members of the community to deliver some Northamptonshire Police Christmas Hampers.

Working with Age UK, the Force has been able to deliver more than 20 hampers over the course of the last week, thanks to kind donations from staff and officers from across the county.

Mr Adderley joined PC Kellie Butler and PCSO Beth Allwork on Monday (December 14), to personally deliver a number of the hampers, taking the opportunity to talk to residents, wishing them a peaceful Christmas after a truly challenging year.

He said: "For me policing never has just been about fighting crime, policing is part of a caring profession, which should be seen and relied upon to provide a sense of security and togetherness at the worst time in people's lives.

"By showing that we as a police community care passionately about those in the wider community, we start to get a real sense of the power of the police and the public working together.

"The hampers themselves are small tokens of appreciation, but are huge in terms of markers of the respect we have for those vulnerable members of the community who have supported us and who in some cases have very sadly been victims of crime.

"I am incredibly proud of the officers and staff for the contributions they have made, which have allowed us to put the hampers together, to bring even for a moment a smile on the faces of those who may be having a difficult time this year."
