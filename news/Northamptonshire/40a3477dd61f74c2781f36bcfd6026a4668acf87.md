Northamptonshire Police is recognising Black History Month, starting with their own officers.

Each week the force will release a profile of a black police officer speaking about their experiences in life and as serving members of Northamptonshire Police.

In the first release, PC Andrew Walker speaks about loss of lives: "This isn't always the easiest job. I am sympathetic to those families who have lost lives involving the police. I am also sympathetic to those fellow officers injured or killed in the line of duty. It's a thin blue line for black officers, and behind that uniform are families, mothers. sisters and brothers. The challenge continues, but one that is definitely worth it."

The force joins other organisations across the country who are also celebrating the achievements of black communities and their contributions to society.

Paul Bullen, Director of Enabling Services, said: "As an organisation and public service it is vitally important that we recognise and celebrate the contributions of our black, Asian and minority officers and staff.

"As a force we are committed to tackling racism and inequality and Black History Month gives us the opportunity to further this.

"It is now more important, than ever before, to listen to and show support to minority communities. There are significant events taking place in the world such as the Black Lives Matter movement and the differential impact that COVID-19 appears to have on black, Asian and minority communities. We need to listen to and make the right changes to improve the service we deliver and be part of the conversation.

"By showcasing the profiles of some of our existing officers, we hope to show people that we welcome people from all walks of life and that Northamptonshire Police is a place that encourages diversity and allows people to grow and develop while making a real change to their communities. We want to demonstrate that we welcome people from all cultures and are working hard at creating an inclusive workforce that offers a real career prospect for people."
