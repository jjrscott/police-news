Police have dismantled a large-scale cannabis farm after officers followed their noses in Corby.

At around 1pm on Monday, December 2, officers were recovering a stolen car from South Folds Close in the Oakley Hay industrial area when they realised they could smell cannabis.

Tracing the scent to an insecure industrial unit, they discovered a large industrial-scale cannabis farm filled with plants at varying stages of production, spread across three rooms.

While no people were present, a total of 1,235 cannabis plants were later removed for destruction, with a large amount of cultivation equipment also dismantled.

Investigations are underway to trace the leaseholder of the units, and anyone with information about the illegal factory should call Northamptonshire Police on 101.

**Incident number:** 19000645632
