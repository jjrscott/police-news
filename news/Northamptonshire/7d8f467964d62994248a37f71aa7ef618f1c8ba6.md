Three teenagers charged with offences following a stabbing in Northampton have pleaded guilty in court.

The three boys, two aged 17 and one aged 16, all from Northampton, pleaded guilty to Section 18 Wounding with Intent and Possession of a Bladed Article during a hearing at Northampton Crown Court yesterday, Monday, December 14.

All three, who cannot be named for legal reasons, have been remanded into custody and will be sentenced in January.

The incident took place on the afternoon of Wednesday, October 14, when a group of teenagers entered McDonalds in the Drapery, Northampton and attacked a 17-year-old with knives and machetes.

Detective Inspector Simon Barnes, from Northampton CID, said: "I'm pleased that these teenagers have admitted their part in what was a horrific incident, not only for the victim but for the members of the public and staff who were in the restaurant at the time.

"Those involved had no hesitation to use knives and machetes during the attack, which saw the victim sustain serious injuries, which could very easily have been fatal.

"Our team of officers have been working incredibly hard on this investigation and I'm pleased for the victim's sake that they have pleaded guilty, saving him the need to attend court and give evidence."

The case against a third 17-year-old who had been charged in connection with this incident was discontinued at court.

The three teenagers will be sentenced on January 26.
