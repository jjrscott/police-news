Northamptonshire Police has launched an appeal for people to come forward in connection with non-recent sexual abuse.

An investigation was launched locally at the end of June this year after police received a number of reports of sexual abuse which happened between the years 2006 - 2016, all originating from the statue at the top of Abington Street in Northampton where young people would gather.

A number of people have come forward since the appeal was launched however detectives are aware that people may have moved out of the county since and are now extending their appeal to reach out to those people who now live elsewhere.

Detective Inspector Liz Basham, said: "We've had a really positive response to our appeals locally and I'd like to commend the bravery of those who have come forward so far.

"We are now extending our appeal to other areas in the country to ensure as many people as possible see it and feel able to come forward.

"Let me be clear that I do not underestimate in the slightest the courage it takes to come forward and tell police officers about sexual abuse and I want to reassure people that we will treat your reports with the confidence and sensitivity they deserve."

Anyone who has not yet come forward with information about non-recent child abuse emanating from the statue at the top of Abington Street, believed to have taken place between the years 2006 - 2016, is asked to get in touch.

Anyone who has any information is encouraged to contact Northamptonshire Police on 03000 111222, quoting Operation Antigua. If you're not comfortable speaking to someone initially, you can report online at www.northants.police.uk/ro.

Northamptonshire Police will do all we can to bring offenders of sexual abuse to justice and will treat all reports with the utmost confidence and sensitivity.

**Incident number:** 542 of 27/06/20
