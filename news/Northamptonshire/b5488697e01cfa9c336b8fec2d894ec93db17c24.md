Officers investigating an incident where a man was threatened outside a Wellingborough medical centre are appealing for witnesses and information.

At around 2.45pm on Thursday, February 4, a man was getting into his car at Queensway Medical Centre in Olympic Way when a man got into the car next to his and banged the door into the victim's vehicle.

When the victim challenged him about this, the man became verbally aggressive, before leaning into the victim's car and threatening to attack him. The man then banged his car door into the victim's car again before leaving the scene.

Anyone who saw the incident or has information about it is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101.

**Incident number:** 21000073578
