"Specially trained officers are supporting the man's loved ones at this time and I would kindly ask the media to respect their privacy at this extremely distressing time.

"Please come forward if you have any information about what happened here or if you have any Ring doorbell, dashcam or CCTV footage that you think could assist our enquiries.
