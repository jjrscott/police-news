Officers and staff at Northamptonshire Police are set to return in new episodes of 999 What's Your Emergency?

The first of the new episodes, which focuses on roads, will broadcast this evening (Monday, January 20) at 9pm on Channel 4.

Filming for the documentary began with the force in February last year, with four episodes hitting the screens in the summer, showcasing how officers and staff deal with crime among other things, against a backdrop of austerity.

The series returns this month with new episodes and a behind the scenes look at how the force tackles crime.

Assistant Chief Constable Pauline Sturman, said: "When the first four episodes broadcast last year, we received an overwhelming response from the public. Our communities were shocked by what our officers and staff deal with and sometimes, how poorly they are treated when they attend incidents or answer calls.

"Viewers were also immensely intrigued and appreciative of how we deal with crime and keep our County safe.

"We hope that people will continue to watch the new episodes in this fantastic documentary and get a first-hand insight into their local police force."
