A 34-year-old man with a history of shoplifting has been made the subject of a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) after a successful application by Northamptonshire Police.

Ricky Long, 34, of Kettering, has recently been convicted of numerous shoplifting offences in Corby and Kettering, which has resulted in him being issued a Criminal Behaviour Order in order to deter and prevent him from committing further offences.

The order, which follows an application submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service, means that Long is barred from entering retail premises in a certain part of the county (within the attached maps) as well as being banned from entering any Co-op in Corby and Kettering, and any BP or Tesco store in Kettering.

The order will remain in place for three years.

PC Rob Booth, said: "We are very pleased to have secured this order against Long who has been a persistent issue to retail staff in the Corby and Kettering areas with his prolific shoplifting and subsequent threatening and abusive behaviour when challenged.

"The CBO now prevents him from entering a number of shops and by releasing his photo, we are asking anyone who sees him flouting this order, to report it to us via 101."
