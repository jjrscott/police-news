Yesterday we released the results of our month-long campaign to clampdown on domestic violence, stalking and harassment.

We made 330 arrests during the month-long campaign, the highest during any single month over the past 18.

Tackling domestic abuse remains a priority for Northamptonshire Police and we're not taking our foot off the gas.

As such, we are re-appealing to the public to help us locate the following men who we are seeking to arrest. **They** **should not be approached.** Anyone who sees them or knows of their whereabouts, should call Northamptonshire Police on 101, quoting the reference numbers below.

TOP ROW, left to right

Otis Wallace, aged 24 - Last known address was in Northampton. 20000294135.

Perry O'Boyle, aged 28 - Last known addresses were in Burton Latimer and Wellingborough. 20000570442.

BOTTOM ROW, left to right

Stuart Doyle, aged 37 - Known to frequent Brixworth and Cosgrove in South Northamptonshire. 20000270139.

Machi O'Brien, aged 26, whose last known address was in Wellingborough. He also frequents Kettering. 20000514183.

**Publically naming suspects is a tactic we reserve the right to use again - we owe it to the victims to do everything in our power to protect them.**
