Eighteen new recruits were sworn into their new roles at Northamptonshire Police at a special ceremony held at Force Headquarters on Thursday, July 11.

Deputy Chief Constable Simon Nickless oversaw the ceremony, which was also attended by family and friends who were invited to see the new officers read their attestation pledge.

In the presence of two Justice of the Peace Amy Crawfund and Mary Maclean, the officers received their policing powers as well as signed their declaration of service before posing for the official photographs.

The latest intake includes two Special Constables, three former Police Community Support Officers from neighbouring forces (Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and Bedfordshire), a Cambridgeshire Police Force Control Room operative and a member of the Royal Military Police.

A number of the officers also come from a non-policing background, joining the Force from a range of different industries including the prison service, retail, education, civil engineering and logistics.

DCC Nickless said: "The Attestation is an important occasion for officers and it was a huge pleasure to welcome them, along with their family and friends, to the Force. I wish them all the very best in their future careers with Northamptonshire Police."

This latest attestation takes the total number of new officers joining the ranks of Northamptonshire Police since January to 65. The Force is currently running the **#FitTheBill** recruitment drive and is welcoming applications for police constables.
