Young people living in the Blackthorn area of Northampton can now practice their footballing skills following the launch of new community coaching sessions.

The sessions, which started on Monday (April 29), have been organised by Police Community Support Officer (PCSO) Wallace to help give young people something positive to do and to stop them getting involved in anti-social behaviour.

A pitch has been marked out on the green, off Blackthorn Road and the first 10 sessions will be delivered by coaches from the Northampton Town Football Club Community Trust.

PCSO Wallace of the Northampton Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "Anti-social behaviour and gang-related activity is an issue in Blackthorn and its surrounding area.

"So it is extremely important to push for youth provisions in this area to help defer young people from being caught up in such activities by giving them something positive to do."

This is one of the latest community safety initiatives across the county to receive support from the Northamptonshire Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner Stephen Mold, who awarded this project Â£1000.

Mr Mold said: "I am proud to be supporting local initiatives, where officers have identified a need in the community and have an idea that can make a big difference to the safety of communities they work with."

The coaching is open to anyone aged eight to 18-years-old living in or around the Blackthorn area. These are split into two one-hour coaching sessions with those who are aged between eight and 12-years-old from 5.30pm followed by 13 to 18-years-old at 6.30pm.
