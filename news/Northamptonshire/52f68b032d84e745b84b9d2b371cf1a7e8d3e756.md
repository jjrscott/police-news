Organisations working with victims of domestic abuse and sexual violence in Northamptonshire are to benefit from extra Government funding to support them through the challenges of the covid 19 pandemic.

The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) is making up to **£ 252,000** available to organisations in Northamptonshire, subject to approving bids that must be made through the office of the Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner.

The additional funding - announced yesterday, May 20 - is intended to enable organisations to continue their work to support some of the most vulnerable people in society, enabling existing services to continue and creating additional capacity so that more people can be helped.

The MoJ has made available **£ 63,000 for sexual violence services** and a further **£ 63,000 for organisations providing domestic abuse** services.

Northamptonshire Police, Fire, and Crime Commissioner, Stephen Mold, is asking organisations to bid immediately for a share of the funding to:

 * Tackle short-term disruption to their services due to the pandemic
 * Help support essential costs of their current activities, such as moving to remote working
 * Meet increased demand for their services due to covid 19

The funding announced yesterday also allows the Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner to bid for a further **£ 126,000** to support or extend domestic and sexual abuse services that he already provides or commissions.

Timescales are tight and applications for funding must be received by **Monday June 1**. The application from will be available from TOMORROW, Friday 22 May at www.northantspfcc.org.uk

Northamptonshire Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner Stephen Mold said: "This is a welcome boost for organisations providing vital services so that they can remain open, and offer additional support if needed, during these unprecedented times we are living in.

"Support for victims is at the heart of my Police and Crime plan for Northamptonshire and I want to ensure this extra funding is shared in Northamptonshire as quickly as possible so that organisations can continue to give help to the vulnerable people who need it most."
