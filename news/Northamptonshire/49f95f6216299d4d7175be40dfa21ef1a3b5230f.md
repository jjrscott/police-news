Police officers have released an image of a man they believe may have information about a common assault which took place on the Racecourse in Northampton on Christmas Day.

At about 1pm on Friday, December 25, a woman and her family were walking their pet dog when a German Shepherd dog, which was not on a lead, came up to them and appeared to become aggressive.

The woman asked the other owner to put his dog on the lead, however he refused. She became upset as she repeatedly asked the man to get his dog away. The man shouted at her partner, and as the family turned to leave, he kicked the woman in the leg.

Officers are appealing for the man or anyone who may recognise him, to get in touch. Anyone with information is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101 quoting reference number 20000679750. Or alternatively call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
