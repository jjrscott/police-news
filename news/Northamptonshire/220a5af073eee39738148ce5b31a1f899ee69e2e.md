Police investigating an incident where a woman was forced into a car near Corby are appealing to find a woman in a red car who drove past the scene.

At around 4pm on Saturday, February 6, a woman was walking along Ashley Road towards Middleton, near Corby, when a man in a white car approached her and pulled her by the hand towards the vehicle.

As this was happening, a woman in a small red car drove past which the victim attempted to flag down. The vehicle slowed down but did not stop.

Officers are seeking to trace this driver as she may have information useful to their investigation. The woman is described as white and possibly in her forties.

She is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101, regarding incident 21000076946.

Shortly after the incident the victim was able to contact police and is now safe and well.
