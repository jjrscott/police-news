Do you recognise this woman? Police officers would like help to identify this woman who they believe may have information about a theft and assault in Corby.

The incident happened between 5.50pm and 6.05pm on Thursday, January 21, at Tesco Express in Oakley Road, when a woman took four bottles of alcohol and as she attempted to leave without paying, triggered the door alarm.

When challenged, the woman threatened the security officer with a syringe needle before leaving the store.

Officers investigating the incident believe the woman in the image may be able to assist with their enquiries, and are appealing for her or anyone who may recognise her, to get in touch.

Anyone with information is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101 quoting reference number 2100051696. Or alternatively call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
