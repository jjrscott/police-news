Northamptonshire Police's Force Control Room (FCR) has just seen the biggest intake the Force has had for a number of years with 15 new starters who joined on April 14.

The new FCR Operatives are joining the Force during unprecedented times which sees the emergency services having to deal with the additional strain of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The recruits will undergo 12 weeks of thorough training (six in the classroom and six in a model office) before they will be able to work alongside experienced colleagues in the real, live environment.

FCR Superintendent Adam Ward said: "It's fantastic to see the biggest intake of new recruits into our FCR for a number of years. It is a great testament to the Force that so many people are not only choosing to work for Northamptonshire Police, but are joining the heart of the frontline during these unprecedented times.

"We have had a number of FCR Operatives leave to join up as police officers with us, and our new starters will ensure we will have enough call takers and dispatchers to meet the summer demand."

This training course has had to be adapted to create a safe and practical learning environment for everyone. There is a changed classroom layout to allow for social distancing and video conferencing has replaced the more personal interactions of training. However, despite this added to the usual challenges of learning the ropes of a new job, the new recruits have taken it all in their stride.

Supt Ward added: "We've had to adapt our approach to training as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic to make sure everyone had the right advice and protection to keep themselves and their new colleagues safe.

"We had to think out of the box on how to deliver the course, and one of the key changes we made was to the equipment we used. However, all this wouldn't have been possible without the support and flexibility of the FCR team.

"Our ISD team built bespoke FCR machines, which included dual screens to help with social distancing, while we have been making use of the video conferencing facilities available to us.

"There is also a contingency plan for anyone who may have to self-isolate during the course, which will mean they can continue with the training from home, if they are well enough to do so."

Northamptonshire Police is now recruiting for FCR Operatives to join the Force. Do think you have what it takes to be the voice at the end of the line in an emergency?
