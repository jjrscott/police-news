Officers investigating a knifepoint robbery in Kettering where a man's car was stolen are appealing for witnesses and information.

At around 4.10pm on Friday, March 12, a man was sitting in his silver Honda Civic in Grafton Street, opposite the junction with Cross Street, when a group of up to four people approached the vehicle and shouted 'Get out of the car'.

One of the group was holding a knife and came to the driver's door and opened it, before grabbing the victim's clothing and pulling at him.

The victim was able to get out of the car and ran away unharmed. It is believed the group then took the man's car.

The suspects are described as white, with the person who came to the car door dressed in black clothing with a hood up and a black mask over their face.

Anyone who saw the incident, or has information about it, should contact Northamptonshire Police on 101.
