We all love a good tale with the paw-fect ending and that is exactly what one lucky dog owner enjoyed after her four-legged friend went walkies!

Vinnie decided to explore his neighbourhood after leaving his Northampton home yesterday morning (Monday, April 15) and walked into a nearby business premises in Williams Street, where he introduced himself to Zoe.

As Zoe helped her new furry friend look for his owner, she bumped in to PC Aimee Holdcroft and her colleague Police Community Support Officer (PCSO) Sam Dyson from the Neighbourhood Policing Team.

Just as the officers were about to give Vinnie a guided tour of Campbell Square Police Station, they spotted his owner frantically searching for the black and white Staffordshire Bull Terrier-Cross.

Thanks to the help of Zoe, the officers were able to swiftly reunite the adorable Vinnie with his very grateful owner!
