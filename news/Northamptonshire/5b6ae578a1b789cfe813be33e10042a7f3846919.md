Neighbourhood Policing Sergeant, Chris Stevens, said: "We always see an increase in the number of burglaries during the Christmas period and we want to arm the public with the best crime prevention advice so they can enjoy a crime-free Christmas.

"We know the public like to see police officers out and about so we hope this visible presence will make the community in Wellingborough feel safe and we look forward to speaking to them and answering any questions they might have."
