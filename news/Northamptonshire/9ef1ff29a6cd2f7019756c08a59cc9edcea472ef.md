On Saturday, January 18 we issued a statement from Chief Constable Nick Adderley.

In the statement, Chief Constable Adderley revealed he had requested an urgent meeting with the base commander at RAF Croughton to discuss safety on the roads around the base.

That meeting has now taken place.

Chief Inspector Tom Thompson, said: "Having met with MOD Police, USAF Security Forces and RAF Croughton base officials this week, I am looking forward to providing road safety support to those working and visiting the base.

"Road safety is a top priority for Northamptonshire Police so I welcome anything we can do across the County to reduce collisions and improve education."
