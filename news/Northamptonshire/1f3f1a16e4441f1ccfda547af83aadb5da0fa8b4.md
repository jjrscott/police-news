Police officers are appealing for a dog walker to contact them after a woman was injured as she ran through Upton Country Park in Upton Way, Northampton.

The incident took place at about 9.45am on Sunday, January 10, as a dog, which was off its lead, ran towards the woman barking. She put out her hand and called out to the dog.

Despite the dog slowing down, it has made contact with her thigh with its teeth. However, although the impact has not broken her skin, it has left bruising to the woman's thigh.

The dog walker is described as an Asian woman and was wearing a yellow/green coat and bobble hat. She was carrying an orange ball thrower. The dog was a medium to large brown Labrador.

Officers investigating the incident are appealing for the dog walker or anyone who may recognise her or the dog's description, to get in touch.

Anyone with information is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101 quoting reference number 21000015879. Or alternatively call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
