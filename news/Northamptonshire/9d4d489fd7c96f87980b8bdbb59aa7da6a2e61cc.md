Officers investigating an assault in which a motorist was punched by another driver are appealing for witnesses to get in touch.

At around 4.10pm on Wednesday, March 17, a man was driving his silver Mercedes Benz westbound along St Peter's Way, Northampton, when he was undertaken by a grey Audi A3.

Both vehicles turned into Towcester Road, and at the traffic lights before the train station the driver of the Audi pulled in front of the silver Mercedes and stopped, causing the Mercedes to have to brake suddenly and stop too.

The driver of the Audi then got out, approached the Mercedes and punched the male driver in the face through the open car window. The man said nothing during this incident, then ran back to his car and drove off towards Sixfields.

The suspect is described as a black man in his 30s, 5ft 10in and of medium build. He wore a long-sleeved Chelsea football shirt with a sleeveless orange high-vis jacket, grey jogging bottoms and a light blue or grey beanie hat with a white motif.

Anyone who saw any of the incident or has relevant dash-cam footage or information about it is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101.

**Incident number:** 21000151515
