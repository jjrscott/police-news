Northamptonshire Police officers and staff, are set to debut in the latest series of 999 What's Your Emergency?

Episode One, which focuses on domestic abuse, will broadcast this evening (Monday, June 3) at 9pm on Channel 4.

Filming began with the force in February this year, and now the first episode will hit the screens, showcasing how officers and staff deal with crime amongst other things, against a backdrop of austerity.

Chief Superintendent Sean Bell, said: "Through this documentary, we have a great opportunity to really showcase to the public the challenges we face, every day, in protecting them.

"There is no better way for our communities to understand what we do, than to see it themselves.

"There have been some amazing stories filmed during the course of the documentary and some exemplary policing demonstrated by our officers who are a true asset to the force. But it's not just the officers who are hailed the heroes in this documentary. It's the unsung heroes in our control room, who are often the initial point of contact for the public.

"We hope, through this documentary, the public of Northamptonshire, will get a better insight in their local police force."
