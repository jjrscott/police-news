"We wish to make it absolutely clear that, at no point, has Northamptonshire Police informed the family spokesperson for the Dunns, Radd Seiger, that an Interpol Red Notice has been issued in respect of Mrs Anne Sacoolas.

"Given that this remains a live case it would be inappropriate to comment further. However, Northamptonshire Police continues to support the Dunn family at this difficult time."
