Police Community Support Officer Margaret Lawson covers 26 parishes across the rural sector and is a regular visitor to village groups across the north of the county to make sure residents do not feel isolated.

The Cranford Men's Over-60s Club is just one group the Kettering Neighbourhood Policing Officer visits on a monthly basis to give local residents the opportunity to discuss any local policing concerns they may have.

PCSO Lawson said: "Covering such a large rural community, some of the residents I meet, particularly the elderly, can often feel quite isolated, so I try to make sure I get along to as many of the village groups as I can.

"It's always a pleasure to catch up with everyone for a chat and it gives residents the opportunity to raise any concerns which they may have about any their local community."

The club is held at Cranford Village Hall in Grafton Road on the first Wednesday of every month, between 12.30pm and 2pm and anyone who would like to speak to PCSO Lawson is welcome to attend.
