A Daventry man convicted of a string of serious sexual offences against children has been given a 23-year custodial sentence.

Keith Streeton, aged 73, from Hood Road was convicted of 11 serious sexual offences against children and yesterday (Thursday, December 17) the judge handed him a 23 year sentence.

Streeton was convicted of rape, indecent assault, indecency with a child, sexual assaults of a child and causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity.

The offences were committed between 1981 and 2017 and include numerous victims.

Detective Constable Laura Beeby from the force's Child Protection Team who led the investigation, said: "This has been a long and difficult investigation with multiple victims. I hope the sentence goes some way towards giving them closure so they can move on with their lives. I want to pay tribute to their courage for speaking out and supporting the investigation through to yesterday's conclusion.

"Streeton is a dangerous, manipulative and selfish man who acted purely for his own sexual gratification without sparing a thought for the damage he was inflicting.

"This case serves as a warning to anybody with a sexual interest in children -- we treat allegations of this kind with the utmost seriousness and will leave no stone unturned to ensure children are protected and justice is carried out."
