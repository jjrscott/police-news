Fifteen motorists were stopped by officers in Kettering after being caught speeding as part of an on-going Force campaign to improve road safety across the county.

Officers carried out a total of 303 vehicle checks in Deeble Road on the town's Ise Lodge estate, between 2pm and 6pm on Thursday, April 11 which resulted in 12 drivers being issued with penalty notices and three received words of advice.

Although this was less than five per cent of all vehicles checked, the highest speed recorded during the four-hour period was 44mph, while the average motorist was driving at 39.7mph in the 30mph zone.

PC Ryan Stanley, who led the operation, said: "Whilst it appears to be a relatively low number of motorists caught speeding, we need to consider the location where these excess speeds were recorded.

"A 30mph zone is set up for a reason, some of the vehicles were recorded driving up to 44mph. About two thirds of all collisions in which someone is either injured or killed occur on the roads with a speed limit of 30mph or less.

"This road is a busy route within Kettering and often has a high volume of foot fall as it's close to a school. It's vital we continue to do such operations to continue to educate drivers and re-enforce the message that speed kills."

Preventing/reducing road fatalities and serious injuries is a policing priority across the Force, which aims to reduce the number of people who are killed or seriously injured on our county roads. In 2018, there were 303 recorded incidents, of which 43 were fatalities.
