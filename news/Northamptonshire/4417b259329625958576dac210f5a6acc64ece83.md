A MAN has been jailed after being caught filming inside Northampton Crown Court.

Justinas Raugala, aged 34, from Wellingborough Road, Northampton, was handed a four-month sentence for contempt of court, after he was caught filming court proceedings on Friday, December 18.

Raugala was caught recording proceedings relating to the sentencing of a crime gang for a multi-million-pound dark web drugs operation, reported on last month.

Detective Sergeant Keith Morson, who arrested Raugala inside the court after spotting him covertly filming a sentencing, said: "The use of mobile phones and recording equipment is strictly prohibited in court.

"This sentence demonstrates just how seriously the issue is viewed and I hope it serves as a deterrent. If you attempt to film inside a court the likelihood is, you will find yourself standing before the court yourself."

Raugala was sentenced yesterday (Monday, January 4).
