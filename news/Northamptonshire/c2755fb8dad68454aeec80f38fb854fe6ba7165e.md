Increased patrols and intensive policing activity will continue in Wellingborough say detectives from Northamptonshire Police's Serious and Organised Crime Team.

Policing activity in the town was intensified after incidents in September which were suspected to be linked to local gangs.

Since then, the response from detectives and local police officers has seen a number of good results, with no plans for the increased patrols, warrants and policing activity to cease.

Only yesterday (Wednesday, October 14), a warrant was executed in The Crescent, Wellingborough, where a quantity of Class A drugs were recovered and a 35-year-old man was arrested.

Detective Superintendent Lee McBride who leads Northamptonshire Police's Serious and Organised Crime Team, said: "Everyone has the right to feel safe in their homes and in their local areas, and when this right is threatened by a small minority, we will not stand for it.

"There were a number of incidents in Wellingborough last month which rightly concerned the local community, however since then, a lot of good work has taken place, resulting in a number of key arrests and charges.

"Over 15 warrants have also been executed in the town and more are planned.

"A lot of these warrants have been secured due to information supplied by members of the public so I would really encourage people to continue reporting suspicious activity to us, as well as anyone they suspect to be involved in gangs, drug dealing or violent crime.

"Remember, we don't need to know who you are, just what you know.

"Finally, I would make an appeal to anyone who is on the periphery of a gang or anyone who is worried about a family member getting involved in one, to please let us help you.

"Trust me when I say that life in a gang may look glamourous and financially promising but the consequences can be devastating and the risks are not worth it.

"Too often we hear of young people seriously injured and even killed due to becoming involved in gang life.

"It is never too late to make a positive choice and we, alongside our partners, will help you to do that."
