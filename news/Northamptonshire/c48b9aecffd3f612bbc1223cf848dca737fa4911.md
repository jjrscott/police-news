Northamptonshire Police is increasing the number of response cars equipped with 'stingers' which are used to puncture the tires of vehicles during a pursuit.

In recent weeks, more officers have been receiving training in the use of the device as well as drones which will mean more are carried in cars across the county on a daily basis.

The hollow spike tire deflation device, commonly called a stinger, works by puncturing one or more tires of an oncoming vehicle when they are thrown into its path by an officer from the side of the road.

They are then quickly retracted before a following police car passes by.

They are designed to gradually deflate tires making it significantly more difficult for a motorist evading police to continue driving.

Supt Dennis Murray said: "I hope this sends a very clear message to any criminals that want to use the road networks that this is a hostile place to come to, we take this very seriously and if they come to Northamptonshire they can expect to be caught and brought to justice.

"Previously, we would have seen about six vehicles per shift with this kit in.

"There will now be an additional nine so at any time we will have 15 vehicles out and about with a stinger in. It will allow us to respond quicker and have more capability."

Training more officers in the use of drones will aid searches and reduce the reliance on waiting for trained pilots or a helicopter.
