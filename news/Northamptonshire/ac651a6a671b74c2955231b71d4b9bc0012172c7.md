Police officers are appealing for witnesses after a suspicious incident in Allen Road, Irthlingborough.

The incident happened on February 26, between 7.45pm and 9.15pm, when a man in a white BMW 3 Series met a group of males in a silver Ford Fiesta in a small carpark in the area.

Three males in the Fiesta pulled the man from his car, told him to sit in the back and proceeded to drive around the area in his BMW before returning him to the area. It is then suggested they did the same thing to another driver in the area at the time.

The first suspect is described as a white man with a tanned complexion and short dark hair. He was about 19-years-old and wore a red, short-sleeved t-shirt with tracksuit bottoms and Air Max 90 trainers. The second suspect is described as a white man with a navy tracksuit and white or grey body warmer. He wore his hood pulled up and had a surgical mask. The third suspect is described as a white man in his mid-20s.

Police officers are appealing for anyone with information but specifically the second driver who it is suspected was approached by the same group.

The driver or anyone who has any information about this incident should call Northamptonshire Police on 101. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.

**Incident number:** 21000114387
