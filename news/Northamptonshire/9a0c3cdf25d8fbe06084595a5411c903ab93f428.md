A 30-year-old man has died following a road traffic collision in Geddington.

The collision happened just after midnight on Saturday when a Honda Civic travelling north on the A4300 from Kettering has for unknown reasons crossed over onto the opposing carriageway and collided head-on with a blue Skoda private hire vehicle travelling in the opposite direction.

The driver and sole occupant of the Honda was pronounced dead at the scene.

The male driver of the Skoda, together with a female passenger, were taken to Kettering General Hospital for treatment. A second female passenger was conveyed to the University Hospital Coventry & Warwickshire to be treated for serious facial injuries.

Anyone with information or who witnessed this incident or may have any Dashcam footage or information that may assist the investigation are asked to call the Drivewatch Hotline on 0800 174615.
