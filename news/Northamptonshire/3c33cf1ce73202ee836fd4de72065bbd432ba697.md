A 31-year-old Northampton man has today (Friday, January 8) been convicted of raping a child.

Northampton Crown Court heard how Ryan Johnson, from Duston, had raped his victim while the rest of her family had gone out to the cinema. She was just 12 at the time of the offences in May 2019.

Johnson had denied the allegations throughout the trial, but a jury found him guilty of four charges, one of raping a child under the age of 13, two counts of sexually assaulting a child under the age of 13 and one of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity.

Her Honour Judge Rebecca Crane remanded Johnson into custody to await a sentencing hearing on February 11.
