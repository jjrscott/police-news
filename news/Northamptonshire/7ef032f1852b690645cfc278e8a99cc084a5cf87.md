Witnesses are being sought after an assault in Northampton on Tuesday, January 14.

The incident happened between 2.30am and 3.30am in Rillwood Court. A 28-year-old man, sitting in his car, was approached by two men who demanded he give them his car keys and wallet. They then grabbed him through the open window and told him to get out of the car, which he did. One of the men took his car keys and demanded his wallet. He asked for his car keys back, but they took his wallet and house keys and ran off towards the garages. The man drove off and the keys and wallet were subsequently found.

The first offender is described as 5ft 8in white man, between 25 and 30 years old, with short ginger hair and a ginger beard. He was wearing a black jacket with fur on the hood and black jogging bottoms. The second offender is described as a 6ft 2in, 18 to 25-year-old black man with his face covered with a scarf and the hood of the black jacket he was wearing. He was also wearing black Adidas bottoms.

Witnesses or anyone with information should call Northamptonshire Police on 101.
