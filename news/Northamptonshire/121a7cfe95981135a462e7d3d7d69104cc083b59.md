***Update***

One lane of the westbound carriageway, between the Queen Eleanor and Tesco roundabouts, is open to traffic. However, the eastbound carriageway is expected to be closed for the rest of the weekend.

***********

Due to a burst water main, Mereway in Northampton is expected to be closed all weekend which will affect those travelling to the British Grand Prix at Silverstone over the next three days.

Northamptonshire Police is advising race-goers heading to the circuit from the east of the county to please find an alternative route with no access to the A43 from the A45 along Mereway.

Although partner agencies are on the scene dealing with the large amount of water, both carriageways are expected to remain closed for the duration of the British Grand Prix.
