A man has been sentenced to six years and 10 months in jail for multiple assaults on his former partner.

Peter Going, aged 68, from High Street, West Haddon was convicted for extreme violence and physical abuse.

He was sentenced at Northampton Crown Court last week.

Detective Constable Aoife McCormack, who led the investigation said: "Peter Going is an extremely violent and controlling man who has shown no remorse.

"He will now serve a significant custodial sentence and will have time to reflect on the severity of his offending and the damage he has inflicted.

"I would like to take this opportunity to commend the victim in this case for their bravery in coming forward and hope this sentencing provides them with some closure.

"Tackling domestic abuse is a priority for Northamptonshire Police and this sentence sends out a clear message that we will investigate these crimes robustly.

"Domestic abuse has no place in our society. If you are experiencing abuse, I would encourage you to contact police or one of the helplines below for reassurance, support and advice about those next steps."
