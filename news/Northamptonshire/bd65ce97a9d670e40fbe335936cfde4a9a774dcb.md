Northamptonshire Police is running an operation to tackle crime and help keep people and businesses safe over the festive period. Both uniformed and plain-clothes police officers, PSCOs and special constables are taking part in dedicated foot patrols across the county targeting retail crime, anti-social behaviour and more.

Chief Inspector Scott Little, said: "This targeted operation provides a highly visible police presence aimed at preventing crimes such as shoplifting, thefts and robberies of bags and purses. The patrols are taking place across the town centres of Northamptonshire and also where we have had increased reports of anti-social behaviour.

"We will also be providing advice to shoppers and those working in the retail industry and PSCOs are working with the Retail Crime Partnerships across the county.

"We are committed to both preventing and tackling crime and keeping our towns safe places to visit, shop and work during the busy festive period. I hope that everyone has a great holiday, but be aware - anybody planning on breaking the law can expect to be arrested and have their Christmas ruined!"

Tips to avoid becoming a victim of crime when you are out and about during the festive period:

 * When out shopping, keep your purse and handbag with you - don't leave it in your trolley or unattended
 * Keep any cash you may have on you to a minimum
 * Mobile phones and wallets in back pockets are a target - keep them in a more secure place and out of sight
 * Be careful at cash machines and when paying by card - shield your PIN at all times

If you've travelled by car to shop, don't let it be an easy target to thieves while it's parked and unattended:

 * Don't leave presents or valuables like laptops, mobile phones, handbags, credit cards or cheque books in your car - if this is unavoidable, put them in the boot and ensure any electronic equipment is completely switched off
 * Make sure car doors, windows and sun roofs are all properly closed and locked and remove sat navs
 * Leave absolutely nothing on show - you may know that there is no wallet in your jacket, but a thief will break a window just to check
 * If you own a van, remove tools overnight and display an appropriate sign in the rear window making this clear.

If you have witnessed, been a victim of crime or want to report an incident, please call 101 or report online at https://www.northants.police.uk/ Always call 999 in an emergency and where a crime is in progress or someone is in danger.
