The family of a woman, who had a ring believed to have been stolen from her home, are searching for the person who may have innocently purchased it.

The cameo ring, described as having a white face on a brown background and mounted on a gold band, was purchased by a store in Silver Street, Kettering.

The ring was then purchased by a customer from the store at around 2.40pm on Monday, September 9.

The family are keen to locate the ring and are asking for the customer who purchased it to come forward.

The ring is originally thought to have gone missing from a property in Seaton Crescent, Corby.
