Northamptonshire Police and the Neighbourhood Watch Network are teaming up to provide residents across the county with information on how they can best stay safe and protected from crime over Christmas.

We want to help you keep your home safe. Use our checklist at protectyourhomenorthants.co.uk to test your security and arm yourself with the best possible crime prevention advice to reduce your chances of being burgled.

Remember to keep front and back doors locked at all times and keep keys and valuables out of sight and reach from cat flaps, letterboxes, and downstairs doors and windows. If you're out in the evening make sure you leave a light on and draw the curtains.

Fraud is something to watch out for too. This could be via email, text, phone or in person, either on the street or on your doorstep. Some adults may be especially vulnerable to fraud and financial abuse. However, with a little knowledge you can protect yourself from fraudsters. Visit https://www.ourwatch.org.uk/crime-prevention/crime-prevention-toolkits/scams for more details.

Make sure that when you're out and about too, you think about crime prevention. Plan ahead before you go out. Know where you're going, how you'll get there, and how you'll get back. Let someone know where you're going, and be prepared for a change of plan. When you're out, always walk with confidence, and stick to well-lit, busy areas, using the route you know best.

To speak to Northamptonshire Police's crime prevention team about darker nights crime prevention and staying safe over the Christmas and New Year period, please email crimeprevention@northants.pnn.police.uk.
