Police investigating an incident in Long Buckby where a shoplifter threatened store staff with a knife are appealing for witnesses.

At around 3.20pm on Saturday, February 13, a man entered the Co-op store and placed around Â£150 worth of alcohol, drinks and a Valentine's Day card in a shopping basket before passing it to a woman outside and leaving without paying.

Two members of staff chased the pair out onto the High Street, causing them to stop running outside the public toilets where the woman produced a knife and thrust it at the staff members while threatening to stab them.

The woman and man then left the scene on foot, heading down Station Road and into William Road.

The woman is described as white, of medium build and around 5ft. She wore a face mask, black North Face puffer jacket with a green camouflage hoody underneath and grey jogging bottoms.

The man is described as 6ft, of slim build and was dressed all in black, with a hood pulled up and a face mask.

Anyone who saw the incident or has information about it is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101.

**Incident number:** 21000089373
