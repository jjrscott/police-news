Officers investigating the theft of a bicycle that belongs to a young cancer patient are appealing for information.

Between 6pm on Sunday, January 31, and 4.30pm on Wednesday, February 3, a modified Trek Roscoe 24 bicycle was stolen from the locked garden of a property in Westbrook, Blisworth.

It belongs to a young boy who received it from the charity Cyclists Fighting Cancer while he was undergoing cancer treatment, and has special fat tyres to make it easier for him to ride.

Anyone who has seen a bike matching this description (pictured) or has information about this theft is asked to contact Northamptonshire Police on 101.

**Incident number:** 21000070709
