As part of an investigation into a Class A drugs conspiracy, ten people were arrested during a two-day police operation in Corby last week.

Officers from the East Midlands Special Operations Unit (EMSOU) worked alongside Northamptonshire Police to execute 10 warrants on Thursday 4 and Friday 5 February 2021. Around 8kgs of suspected amphetamine was seized, along with Â£11,000 in cash, a number of cars and mobile phones.

In total, nine men aged between 36 and 55, and a 46-year-old woman were arrested on suspicion of being involved in a conspiracy to supply Class A drugs.

Three men have since been charged with conspiracy to supply Class A and remanded in custody:

 * Scott Sterling, aged 42, from Eastbrook
 * Anthony Barrett, aged 55, from Holkham Close
 * Liam Meenan, aged 38, from Southbrook

The remaining seven were released under investigation.

EMSOU Detective Inspector Mark Booth said: "I want to extend my thanks to everyone from Northamptonshire Police who worked with us last week during the action. We'll now be looking at all of the evidence gathered and our financial investigators will begin to investigate the origin of the seized cash."
