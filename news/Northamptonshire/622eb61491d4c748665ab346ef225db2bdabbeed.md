Police officers in Northamptonshire are urging the public to support the NHS this weekend as the predicted hot weather may tempt people to venture outside their homes.

Assistant Chief Constable Simon Blatchly, said: "We completely understand how frustrating it is to be asked to stay inside when the weather is nice but there is something much bigger at play here - saving lives. The stakes really are that high.

"We're asking the public to consider whether their journeys this weekend are essential and we may have to ask people about their circumstances if they're outdoors.

"No fines have been issued in Northamptonshire yet because we would much rather engage, explain and educate as opposed to enforce. We are proud to police by consent in this country - please help us continue to do that by staying inside and mitigating the spread of COVID-19.

"Finally, I'd like to thank the majority of the public in this county who have been amazing in adhering to the regulations and staying inside - we do not underestimate how much of an ask it is and your support is so appreciated.

"When we get through this pandemic, and make no mistake, we will get through it, you can be proud that you were part of the solution by staying inside, helping your police force and protecting an NHS we are so lucky to have in this country."

**We all have a shared responsibility in adhering to these regulations - please apply your common sense. Stay home. Protect the NHS. Save lives.**
