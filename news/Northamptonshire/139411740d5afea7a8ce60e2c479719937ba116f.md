Two people have been arrested for possession with intent to supply Class A drugs following police raids in Corby.

The arrests in Scarborough Walk were part of misuse of drugs act warrants taking place across the town on Wednesday this week.

Class A drugs, drug paraphernalia and weapons were recovered from the property.

The operation was part of Northamptonshire Police's 100 Days Of Intense Policing activity.
