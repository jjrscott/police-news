* Eighteen County Lines destroyed
 * Twelve local drugs lines destroyed
 * 72 convictions
 * Over 221 years of prison time handed out
 * Over Â£1.3million of drugs taken off the streets

A large-scale covert operation has achieved 72 convictions with 221 years of combined jail time and a number of County Lines completely decimated.

In recent years, drug dealing across this county had become so well-organised that typical methods of police investigation and surveillance had proven fruitless, and in time, detectives came to discover an underworld so enigmatic that drug addicts were vetted before they were able to gain access to the drugs they needed.

So Northamptonshire Police adapted, and at the beginning of 2019, a covert operation was launched in an effort to infiltrate both County Lines and local drug dealing gangs across Northamptonshire.

In time, officers gained access to a secretive criminal network which unearthed the true nature of these drug dealing gangs - where vulnerable children as young as 14 were used to sell drugs while the people at the top took none of the risks and simply sat in their homes counting their money.

The evidence these officers collected over time allowed detectives to build investigations against these drug dealing gangs, which ultimately led to numerous warrants being executed simultaneously across London, Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Northamptonshire at the end of 2019. Multiple arrests and charges followed.

Now, the operation is coming to a close with eighteen County Lines destroyed, twelve local drugs lines destroyed, 72 convictions secured and a combined total of more than 221 years in prison.

Detective Chief Inspector Adam Pendlebury, said: "We have always been clear as a Force that it is the people at the top of these drug dealing gangs who we want to target. And this operation has done exactly that, leaving no stone unturned from London to Northamptonshire in order to put these people where they belong - behind bars.

"Drug dealers like Aways Osman, Hussein Jimale, Bruno Borges, Omarni Bernard-Sewell and Levi Bernard truly think they are untouchable.

"They exploit vulnerable people like children and adults suffering with addiction, and make them take all the risks, while they sit at home counting their money. There is no honour in this.

"Over the past two years we have warned them and their associates directly that one day, we would get them, one day we would come through their door, and one day they would be looking at the inside of a prison cell.

"Today is that day and I could not be prouder of the exceptional work that has gone into this investigation by a group of detectives, uniformed officers and experienced criminal analysts, who have made this operation their lives for the past two years.

"Of course our work is never done as there will always be people who think dealing drugs is an acceptable way to make money. But I hope the success of this operation makes our relentlessness to pursue offenders clear and reassures the community.

"My advice to those drug dealers we haven't caught yet is to look at the list below - perhaps there are names on there that you recognise. There was a time when like you, their egos allowed them to think that they were beyond our reach. Don't make the same mistake."

Chief Constable Nick Adderley, said: "To say this was a phenomenal operation, led by DCI Adam Pendlebury, would be a complete understatement.

"The drive, commitment, determination, creativity, tenacity and relentlessness these detectives have shown here is incredible and I am so very proud of them."

Northamptonshire Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner, Stephen Mold, said: "These results are absolutely fantastic.

"I know that across Northamptonshire, people are concerned with the drug dealing and related anti-social behaviour that they see in their communities and they want to see it being dealt with robustly.

"This is a great demonstration of the work being done by Northamptonshire Police to make all of our communities safer and shows that the Force is putting the investments we have made to good use in cracking down on crime."
