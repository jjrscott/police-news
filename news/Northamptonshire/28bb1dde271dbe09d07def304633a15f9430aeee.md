A 74-year-old Wellingborough man has been arrested by police for failing to appear in court in connection with domestic abuse offences.

The suspect was tracked down and arrested yesterday afternoon (Wednesday, December 23) after magistrates issued a warrant a few hours earlier for failing to appear for breaching a non-molestation order and harassment linked to domestic abuse.

Northamptonshire Police is currently working through a 'most wanted' list of those responsible for high-harm domestic abuse, stalking and harassment.

Speaking at last week's launch of a month-long domestic abuse campaign in which he has set officers the challenge to ensure all these offenders are behind bars before Christmas, Chief Constable Nick Adderley, said: "Tackling domestic abuse is a force priority and I have set my officers the task to focus their efforts on protecting people from this terrible crime, which has a devastating impact on victims."
