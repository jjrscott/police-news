Police are appealing for witnesses and information after a teenage couple were assaulted by a woman and a man in Northampton.

Between 4.30pm and 5pm on Tuesday, March 9, a girl and a boy were sat by the underpass below Lings Way, close to Goldings shops, when they were approached by a group of two men and two women.

A man within the group began to ask the pair questions and became verbally aggressive when they did not answer, before a woman grabbed the girl, pulled her away from the boy and punched her several times.

When the boy tried to intervene, he was punched by one of the men, before he and the girl were able to leave the scene.

The suspects are described as a black woman aged 17-20, who had black hair, was short in height and wore a yellow top. The male suspect is described as white, aged 19-20, with facial stubble, and wore a black hoody and a blue and white scarf or snood.

The others in the group, who did not participate in the assault, were a white woman aged around 18, with blonde hair and wearing a grey jumper and blue jeans, and a white man with brown hair wearing a black tracksuit and carrying a JD Sports bag.

Anyone who saw the assault or has information about it should call Northamptonshire Police on 101, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
