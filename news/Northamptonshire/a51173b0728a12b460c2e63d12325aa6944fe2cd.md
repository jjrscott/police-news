Police officers are appealing for witnesses after an incident in Kettering on Tuesday, November 17.

At about 9.30am, a woman had just come off the A14 in her white VW Golf and joined the A43 in Kettering when she came to the big roundabout in the left lane, going towards Corby, and she stopped at the lights.

As she sat at the lights, a white box van stopped at her right-hand side and a man in a black balaclava got out and began to smash her car up with a sledgehammer. The woman managed to drive off but was left very shaken.

Two men aged 46 and 55 have been arrested in connection with this incident and released on police bail pending further enquiries.

Witnesses or anyone with any information should contact Northamptonshire Police on 101.

**Incident number:** 20000608155
