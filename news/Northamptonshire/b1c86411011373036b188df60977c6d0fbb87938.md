Police are seeking to trace a young woman and young man who helped a teenage girl near a Daventry skate park.

The pair spoke to a 17-year-old disabled girl who was being helped to walk by a man, close to a skate park off Portland Close between approximately 11am and 1pm on Sunday, February 28.

They spoke to the girl and man, and then to the girl's mother on the phone, to confirm she was ok.

Officers are asking the young woman and young man to get in touch as it is hoped they may be able to provide information relevant to the investigation of an assault which took place nearby.

The potential witnesses or anyone who knows who they are should call Northamptonshire Police on 101, quoting incident number: 21000125735
