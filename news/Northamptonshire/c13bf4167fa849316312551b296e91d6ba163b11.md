A group of young carers received the VIP treatment when they got the opportunity to go behind the scenes at Wellingborough Police Station.

The children were invited to the Midland Road station as part of a visit organised in partnership by the Northamptonshire Young Carers Service and Wellingborough Neighbourhood Policing Team.

Police Community Support Officer (PCSO) Craig Blacha provided the guided tour for the eight to 10-year-olds which included a visit to the former police cells in the custody suite.

The youngsters from the Wellingborough and East Northants area, also had the opportunity to try the police uniform on for size in the kit room as well as check out the ANPR technology in a patrol car.

PCSO Blacha said: "The children spend a lot of time caring for a family member, so it was really nice to have the chance to show them around the station and also speak to them about how to keep safe when out and about in the community.

"I also spoke to them about what to do in the event of an emergency if a family member or friend becomes unwell. Being young carers they often come in contact with the ambulance service, however the police service is also there to help.

"Such visits are a great way to introduce them to their local neighbourhood team in a fun and safe environment instead of in an emergency situation when they are more likely to be upset."

In addition to the tour, the children joined PCSO Blacha on a walk in and around the station to learn about stranger danger and road safety.
