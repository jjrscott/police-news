Officers are appealing for witnesses and information after a Northampton pub was broken into and a large volume of spirits stolen.

At around 4.30am on Wednesday, February 24, four unknown offenders went around the back of the Queen Eleanor public house in Newport Pagnell Road and broke into a delivery hatch to gain entry to the cellar.

Once inside they broke open the spirits lock-up and stole a large number of bottles worth around Â£2,300.

Anyone who saw the incident or has information about it should call Northamptonshire Police on 101.
