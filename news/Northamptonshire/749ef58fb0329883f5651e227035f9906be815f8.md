Emergency services are this evening advising people to take care following a day of rainfall across the county.

Localised flooding is expected in some parts of Northamptonshire tonight (Thursday) and into the weekend, with a Met Office warning for ice also in place for this evening.

Motorists are advised to follow the advice below:

 * Only travel if it is essential, in line with the latest Covid-19 guidance.
 * If you must drive, ensure you drive to the conditions of the road and adjust your speed
 * Do not attempt to drive through floodwater
 * If you become trapped by flood water in your vehicle or home, stay calm and dial 999 or 112

Pedestrians are also being advised to stay away from rivers and flood water as strong currents may not always be visible.

If you discover a local flooded road you can contact Northamptonshire Highways on 0300 126 1000 (Select Option 4) between 8am and 6pm, or on 01604 651074 (out of hours)

Or, for major trunk roads, call Highways England on 0300 123 5000 (say "Report")

If you have concerns about rivers contact the Environment Agency on 0800 80 70 60 or 0345 988 1188.
