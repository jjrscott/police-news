We know you're at home with lots of time on your hands. We'd love you to tell us what you've been up to by sharing any stories, poems, artwork or posters you've created since lockdown that you're proud of.

No doubt many of you will have been keeping busy with school work and getting creative in all sorts of ways whether that be writing, drawing, playing fun games, colouring or painting.

Please ask your parents and carers to send in photos of your great work and with their permission, we'll create a colourful celebratory video and share it on our force's website and social media channels. We're certain our partners in health, councils and our voluntary sector colleagues would like to join in by sharing it on their channels too. That means the video will reach tens of thousands of people!

We've joined forces with Beat Route Radio who have donated a voice controlled i-box Century Internet Radio with Amazon Alexa built-in (photo attached) as a prize for the piece of artwork judged the best with the winner being announced live on Friday, May 22nd May. Tune in at www.beatrouteradio.co.uk and click "Listen Live."

Don't forget we'll need parents and carers permission for artwork to be posted on social media channels. Please ask them to send your work to: news@northants.pnn.police.uk
