An ambition to recruit more than 200 police officers by 2021 has started with a major new recruitment campaign.

In April, Police Fire and Crime Commissioner Stephen Mold and Chief Constable Nick Adderley, announced the Force would be recruiting more than 200 new police officers over the next two years, taking the numbers above 1300 for the first time since 2010.

To increase applications and help bolster the ranks, the Force is using the strapline **#FitTheBill** alongside a recruitment campaign.

An inspirational video, available on the Force website and YouTube channel, is hoping to motivate and attract applications from a diverse background.

Chief Constable Nick Adderley, said: "This job really is like no other. There are few careers that offer the variety of a police constable role. There are many diverse areas that police officers develop into, from detective to specialist dog handler, from cybercrime expert to financial crime investigator. The list is endless.

"How far an officer goes, is really up to them. One thing that is guaranteed, is that the role gives people a real opportunity to give back to the community and make a real difference to people's lives, while developing real life skills that will transform who they are."
