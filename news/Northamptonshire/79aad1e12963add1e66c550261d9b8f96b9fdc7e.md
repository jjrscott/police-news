Detectives from the Operation Ejector incident room have released CCTV images of three people they believe may be able to assist them with their enquiries after an attempted murder in Prentice Court in the Goldings area of Northampton.

Five men aged 18, 19, 19 20 and 25, and two boys aged 15 and 17, have been arrested in connection with the incident and released on police bail pending further enquiries.

"I would encourage them, or anyone who recognises them, to contact us on 101, or if you don't feel comfortable calling us, you can use our online reporting system at www.northants.police.uk.ro.

"This was a very serious offence which we are not prepared to tolerate on our streets and we are determined to bring all of those responsible to justice."

Anyone who recognises the people in the images should contact Northamptonshire Police quoting reference number 21000078249. If you would prefer to remain anonymous, you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.
