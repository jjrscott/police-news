A 15-year-old boy and 44-year-old woman have been arrested following a misuse of drugs act warrant conducted today in Wellingborough.

Both were arrested for offences relating to the possession and cultivation of Class B drugs.

Officers attended the property in Gordon Road at about 8am today, Wednesday, July 8.

The operation followed information which had been passed to police by members of the community.

Sergeant Chris Stevens said: "We forced entry to a property on Gordon Road where we have recovered a number of cannabis plants, cultivated cannabis and a quantity of white powder.

"We need to be very clear to people engaged in this form of activity, we will be coming through your door at some point.

"It may not be today, but make no mistake, if the intelligence points us to your doorstep, we will come through your door at the most inconvenient time to you and we'll take enforcement action where we have the lawful ability to do so."

Anyone with any information about drugs in their community can call Northamptonshire Police on 101, report it online at www.northants.police.uk or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
