For the ninth day of their Christmas operation, yesterday, Sunday December 20, the Northampton Neighbourhood Policing Team continued their focus on supporting and helping vulnerable members of the community. The activity included:

 * Visits to victims of domestic abuse to discuss safety plans and referrals to specialist support services
 * All officers, PSCOs and special constables in the area responded to support in the search for a high-risk elderly lady who had gone missing - she was found within an hour of the call being made to the Force Control Room
 * Joint patrols with Neighbourhood Watch coordinators in areas where there have been several burglary and vehicle crimes and where several vulnerable and elderly people live
 * Visits to vulnerable people who are at risk of being cuckooed - the illegal practice of taking over the home of a vulnerable person to use it for drug dealing. The team work on an ongoing basis with partner agencies to tackle this - find out more about this issue **here**
 * Patrols of local vaccination and Covid-19 test sites
