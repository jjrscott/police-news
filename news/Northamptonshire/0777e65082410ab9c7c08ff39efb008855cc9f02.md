Police Community support Officer (PCSO) Carl Barton was among the hundreds of visitors to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Woodford Halse Regatta.

The Daventry and South Northants Neighbourhood Policing officer was joined by the Northamptonshire Emergency Services Cadets at the event to raise awareness of the Force's recruitment campaign.

Despite being a landlocked village, up to 2000 people flocked to the annual event, traditionally held on the last Friday of June, to take part in a number of adult and children's boat races.

PCSO Barton, who is the officer for Woodford Halse, said: "The regatta is always such great fun and has become a very popular village tradition, bringing the whole community together.

"The event was not only a great opportunity to promote our recruitment campaign but also a chance to speak to lots of local people. The Cadets got into the spirit of the event and even entered their own team in to one of the races."

Away from the races, there was plenty for visitors to do including stalls, live music, bouncy castles as well as food and drink.
