Two rookie dog handlers and their canine partners are the latest recruits to join the ranks of Northamptonshire and Leicestershire Police forces.

PC Alex Willatt and 15-month-old PD Ayla will be working together fighting crime and protecting people in the county after successfully completing a 13-week Police Dog Handler course.

While five-year-old PD Bo will be working with PC Karen Daybell across the border at Leicestershire Police after being retrained following the retirement of his dog handler PC Paul Furlong from Northamptonshire Police earlier this year.

Bo is an experienced member of the dog section having joined the police service with Northamptonshire Police in 2016. Ayla was recruited last year as part of the police dog breeding programme and has been with the Force since she was 10-weeks-old.

The intense programme covers four disciplines - tracking, searching, use of force, and obedience and agility work - which the dogs learn through repetitive training exercises at various location across the two counties.

Instructor PC Steve Thorpe of Northamptonshire Police, who directed the course, said: "To successfully complete the course they have to demonstrate a high level of competency in all disciplines. Both teams achieved this. I am proud of them and look forward to hearing about their operational successes in the future."

Following the intense 13-week course, PCs Willatt and Daybell and PDs Ayla and Bo are now licensed to carry out full operational duties.
