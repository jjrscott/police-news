A video celebrating diversity and equality has been released showing officers and staff speaking the policing oath in twelve languages.

Seventeen different ethnicities are reflected in the video and shows the diversity that exists in the force.

Sergeant Megan Sae-Tang, chair of the Northamptonshire Black Police Association, who produced the video, said: "Some of our members, as well members of the Association of Muslim Police and other support networks, volunteered to make this video to show and celebrate our diversity and hopefully inspire others to join the Police and help us make Northamptonshire Police a more diverse Force. This video is the policing oath, we have 12 languages reflected and 17 different ethnicities in our video and would love to continue to increase this."

Northamptonshire Police is focused on attracting, recruiting and retaining talented people. We value equality, diversity and inclusivity and welcome applications from across our communities. If you think you could be a #ForceForGood then apply now at www.northants.police.uk/policeofficer
