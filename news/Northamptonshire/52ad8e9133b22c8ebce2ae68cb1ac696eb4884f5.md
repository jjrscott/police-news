A proactive, intelligence-led police operation took place in Corby on Thursday, August 15, with officers deployed to a number of estates in the town to tackle motorcycle nuisance.

The all-day operation focused on the illegal use of motorcycles which has been reported to officers over a number of weeks by members of the community in Corby.

The operation focused on tracking down stolen motorcycles and making it clear to offenders that the police are aware of the issues they have been causing in recent weeks and are determined to tackle them.

A number of garages across the town were searched as part of the day of action and a number of vehicles were seized as a result.

Two arrests were also made, including a man who was already wanted by police.

PCSO Julie Anderson, who led the operation, said: "I hope this operation went some way to reassuring the people in Corby that the police are taking these issues with motorcycle nuisance seriously, and are working to deter the offenders and bring them to justice."

PC Tamlin Rees, lead for off-road bike nuisance on the north of the county, said: "I'm pleased with how the operation went and I hope it makes it clear to offenders that we are after them and remain determined to curb their criminal activity on behalf of residents in the affected areas.

"This is just one of a number of tactics we shall be using to show these offenders their behaviour and criminality does not go unnoticed and shall not be tolerated."
