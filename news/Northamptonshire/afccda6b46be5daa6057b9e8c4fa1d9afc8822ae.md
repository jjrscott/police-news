A 31-year-old Northampton man has been handed a ten-year sentence after being found guilty of child rape.

Ryan Johnson, aged 31, from Duston, raped his victim while the rest of her family had gone out to the cinema. She was just 12 at the time of the offences which happened in May 2019.

Johnson had denied the allegations throughout the trial, but a jury found him guilty of four charges, one of raping a child under the age of 13, two counts of sexually assaulting a child under the age of 13 and one of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity.

Detective Sergeant Liam O'Neill, from the Force's child protection team, said: "The victim in this case has shown remarkable courage and bravery, not only in reporting this terrible incident, but by sticking through a lengthy investigation and trial.

"Johnson's guilty verdict and subsequent conviction will never be enough to take away the harm he caused, but we hope the guilty verdict and sentence will give the victim the confidence and reassurance to move on.

"He never admitted guilt and it is testament to the courage of the victim and the hard work of Detective Constable Nicky Webb, who led the investigation, and the whole investigating team, that he now has plenty of time to reflect on the damage he has caused."

At his sentencing at Northampton Crown Court on Thursday, February 11, Her Honour Judge Rebecca Crane told Johnson: "Victim impacts statements have shown how your victim now finds it hard to trust people.

"It has affected her friendships. her mother says it has destroyed her confidence."

Johnson was jailed for 10 years and nine months. He will remain on the sex offenders register for the rest of his life.
