Three people were arrested last night (Tuesday, July 21), following a quick response by police officers to an incident in Northampton.

The incident started at 6.30pm when a woman was approached by three people in a car in the Sixfields area who made threats to kill her.

Armed police officers were immediately deployed due to the assessed threat and quickly located the car in question which failed to stop for them.

After a short pursuit, the blue Hyundai Santa Fe was stopped in Abington Square. One of the people, a 21-year-old man, was arrested on suspicion of threats to kill, possession of a bladed article and theft of a motor vehicle, while the other two made off.

A foot chase began around the Wellingborough Road and St Edmunds Street areas of Northampton, ending with a tip off from a member of the public which led officers to locate the other two people, a 16-year-old boy and a 17-year-old boy, who were also both arrested on suspicion of threats to kill, possession of a bladed article and theft of a motor vehicle.

All three remain in police custody at this time.
