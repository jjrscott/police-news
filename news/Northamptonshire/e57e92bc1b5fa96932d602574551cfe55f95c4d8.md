Northamptonshire Police is asking people if they could #DoSomethingSpecial as it seeks to recruit 30 new Special Constables.

A video has been launched showing Special Sergeant Ben Baines in action, as he talks about his experiences with balancing his day job as a deputy head teacher, with being a Special Sergeant and a father.

Specials work across neighbourhood policing, response, Safer Road Teams, Missing Persons Unit, Football Policing Unit and many other specialist areas.

They also support with many major planned operations such as the British Grand Prix at Silverstone and Moto GP, while also assisting with around 600 operations and events per year, alongside hundreds of smaller events or calls for supports each year.

The Force's existing officers come from all walks of life from students to scientists, home makers to senior managers and builders to school teachers. Over 200 Specials from different jobs and walks of life.

Special constables are volunteer police officers who wear the same uniform and have the same powers and responsibilities as regular paid colleagues.

The only difference between specials and regular officers is that the time they give up - a minimum of 16 hours a month - is voluntary. The Force covers out of pocket expenses and provides all the equipment and uniform needed.

Chief Officer for the Special Constabulary, Mike Maywood, said: "I would encourage anyone who has spare time on their hands and has the drive, commitment and passion to #DoSomethingSpecial and really contribute to their community, to apply now. This really is a job like no other"

"The closing date to apply is Sunday, August 2, in order to make it through to the January intake."
