A 26-year-old man has been arrested following a police raid on a cannabis factory where more than 400 plants were being grown across eight rooms.

Officers attended the property in Euston Road, Northampton, at 9:20am today (Wednesday, December 9).

Plants at different stages of growth were found throughout the mid-terrace house.

Police estimate the street value of the plants between £200,000 and £300,000 - based on the production of multiple yields.
