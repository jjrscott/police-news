Officers from Northamptonshire Police's Paedophile Online Investigation Team (POLIT) have been conducting warrants over the last two weeks to target people involved in viewing indecent images online.

This video footage shows the team at work in towns across the north of the county with Detective Inspector Stuart Hitchon talking more about their work.

On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Rushden was arrested on suspicion of possession of indecent images of children. He has since been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

On Tuesday, a 33-year-old man from Wellingborough was also arrested on suspicion of the same offence. He has also since released under investigation pending further enquiries.

The work by the POLIT team is part of Northamptonshire Police's 100 Days of Intense Policing Action campaign.
