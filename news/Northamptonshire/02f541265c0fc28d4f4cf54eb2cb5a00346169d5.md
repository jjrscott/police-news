Police are calling for volunteers to knit soft toys which will be given to children, in order to provide some comfort when officers attend incidents at their homes.

The toys are called 'Bobby Buddies' (pictured) and local knitting enthusiasts are invited to make them, in the knowledge their donation could help a child at a potentially distressing time.

Detective Sergeant Jen Castle is from the force's Domestic Abuse Prevention and Investigation Team. She said:

"We hope that a Bobby Buddy will bring some comfort during what can be a confusing, frightening time for young children.

"Working in this area of work, we are aware children must not be overlooked during police attendance. Bobby Buddies will help attending officers engage with children whose voice should never go unheard".

If you are a knitting enthusiast or a knitting group that would like to help, please email Rachel.Percival@northants.pnn.police.uk with your details. The pattern will then be supplied.
