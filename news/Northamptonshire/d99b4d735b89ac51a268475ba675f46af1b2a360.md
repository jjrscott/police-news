Police officers investigating an incident in Abington Park Crescent in Northampton, on Saturday, November 7, have issued an e-fit of a man they would like to speak to.

Between 11.45am and 12.15pm, a 12-year-old girl, who was pushing her bike, walked past a parked black SUV type vehicle when the front seat passenger spoke to her.

He got out of the vehicle and asked the girl to get in. However, the girl who was walking ahead of her mum and brother, signalled for her mum to come over and walked away.

The man is described as Asian, between 20 to 25 years, about 6ft and of a slim build. He had black hair which was shaved at the sides and gelled on top. He was wearing a hooded top, grey jogging bottoms with long neon yellow socks over his ankles and a baggy top.

Anyone who recognises this man or has information about this incident, is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101 quoting reference number 20000590890. Or alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
