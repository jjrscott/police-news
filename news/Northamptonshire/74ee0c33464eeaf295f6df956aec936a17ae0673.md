Detectives investigating an incident where five bulldog puppies were stolen from a Wellingborough home are pleased to confirm the dogs have been returned safe and well.

The incident happened in Windermere Drive, Wellingborough, on Monday, January 18, between 4.20pm and 4.35pm, when three males entered the address and threatened the occupants with weapons before making off with the puppies.

A plea was made by police officers for the puppies to be returned and thankfully they were yesterday evening.

Detective Inspector Johnny Campbell, said: "We are very pleased to confirm that these puppies are back with their rightful owners and I would thank the people who stole them for having some humanity and doing the right thing by giving them back.

"As an organisation with dogs on our team, we know how important and cherished they are to their owners, how they are part of the family, so I would like to thank everyone who shared our appeal and helped get these puppies back.

"We would still encourage whoever did this to come forward and speak to us about why you did this in the first place so we can put the matter to rest."

Detectives from CID are continuing to investigate this incident and witnesses or anyone with information are still encouraged to call us on 101. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
