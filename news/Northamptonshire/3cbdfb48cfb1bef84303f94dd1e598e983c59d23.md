The Northamptonshire Safer Roads Alliance will be among the exhibitors tomorrow (September 18), at the first of three Freshers' Fairs organised by Tresham College for its new intake of students.

Members of the partnership will be at the Kettering Campus in Windmill Avenue, from 9am, to speak to the teenage students about all aspects of road safety from driving to college to catching public transport or cycling.

Students will have the opportunity to learn more about educational courses which can improve driving techniques, information on cycling as well as personal safety mobile phone apps.

There will also be the chance to take part in a number of fun and interactive games on the stand, including testing their reactions on a Batak Machine and wearing beer goggles to feel the sensation of the effects of alcohol and sleep deprivation.

Students at the Corby and Wellingborough campus will be able to meet the team at their fresher events on Thursday (September 19) and Wednesday, September 25 respectively.

The Alliance is made up of Northamptonshire Police, Northamptonshire Fire and Rescue Service (NFRS), The Office of the Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner (OPFCC) and Northamptonshire Highways representing Northamptonshire County Council, who work together on initiatives to make our county's roads safer.
