**Statement from Northamptonshire Police Chief Constable Nick Adderley on IOPC referral.**

Yesterday I was informed by the Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner, Mr Stephen Mold, that he has referred a complaint made against me, by Mr Radd Seiger, to the Independent Office for Police Conduct in relation to emails I sent to the Home Office last year. This is standard policy and procedure when a complaint is made against a Chief Constable and occurs frequently across the country.

It is vital that all officers are held to account for their decisions, including Chief Constables. Thankfully in England and Wales we have a transparent investigations process to look into such complaints and allegations and I very much welcome the opportunity to discuss these with the relevant authority in due course.
