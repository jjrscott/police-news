Police officers have released the partial image of a male they believe may have information about an incident which occurred in a South Northamptonshire village in January.

Between 1.15am and 1.30am on Saturday, January 23, the occupants of a black Mitsubishi L200 which had a hardtop canopy, have attempted to break into a farm in the Wappenham/Slapton/Green Norton area.

During the incident, a post housing the wiring for the CCTV was damaged, however before the system cut out, a partial image of a male was captured on camera, and officers believe he may have information which could assist them.

Officers are appealing for the male or anyone who may recognise him, to get in touch. Anyone with information is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101 quoting reference number 21000050183. Or alternatively call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
