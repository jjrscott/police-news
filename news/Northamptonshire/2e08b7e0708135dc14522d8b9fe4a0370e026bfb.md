A delivery van was stolen in Tanfields Grove, Corby, after a woman asked the driver for the time, before a male accomplice snatched the keys.

The robbery occurred at around 4pm on Saturday, November 28. The man initially grabbed the driver from behind and then snatched the keys off him.

The offender then threw the keys to a second man before they drove off in the stolen vehicle.

The van turned into Westfields Road and the delivery driver chased after it on foot before the van got away.

The van is a white Vauxhall Vivaro with registration DS68 BZL. Some of the packaging from the parcels have since been found in the Harris Road and Mull Drive areas of Corby.

The woman is described as white, short, skinny build and in her 30's. She had long hair and a large handbag over one of her arms.

The man who grabbed the victim was wearing a face mask and a black hooded top.

The second man is described as having a medium build with spiky hair and wearing a grey top.

Anyone with information can contact Northamptonshire Police on 101. Alternatively, they can call the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
