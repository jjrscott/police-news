The incredible bravery of one of our police dogs was demonstrated in the early hours of this morning during an incident where a large vehicle failed to stop for police.

Just before 4am this morning (Wednesday, July 1), police officers were called to reports that a vehicle potentially connected to a theft from a HGV was travelling along the A43.

Officers were sent to the area but the vehicle failed to stop for them and a pursuit began.

The Operations Team were quickly deployed and used stingers to stop the vehicle successfully. However, the offenders inside made to run off and PD Nala, who was on the scene, raced after them.

One of the offenders kicked out at her and she also received facial injuries as well as a result of bravely entering the vehicle through a broken window.

Four men, aged 25, 33, 34 and 43, were all subsequently arrested in connection with the incident.

One of police officers was also injured when attempting to arrest them.

Inspector Andy Hall, said: "Firstly, I want to reassure the public who we know will be worried about PD Nala, that she is recovering well, resting up, and being given the best care there is.

"As a result of her and her colleagues' bravery last night, four suspects were detained and remain in police custody at this time.

"Our police dogs are not just assets to us - they are fellow officers, colleagues and friends.

"I am very pleased that PD Nala is recovering well but it is a stark reminder of the danger our dogs and our officers face every day in the line of duty."
