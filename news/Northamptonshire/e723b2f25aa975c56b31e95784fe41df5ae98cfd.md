Do you live in Kettering? Then please read the second edition of the #Citadel _newsletter._

This includes updates and information about the exciting #Citadel project, which aims to tackle the harm caused by drug addiction in parts of Kettering.

We also invite you to fill in a short survey to let us know what you think our policing priorities should be for the area - see page two of the newsletter or click on the QR code below this newsletter.

If successful, this project will be rolled out to other parts of the county.
