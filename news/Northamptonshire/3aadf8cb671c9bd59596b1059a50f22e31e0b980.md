Police officers are appealing for witnesses after a man was assaulted as he walked along London Road in Wellingborough.

Between 8.30pm and 9pm on Saturday, December 19, the 56-year-old man was approached from behind by two men as he walked alone along London Road, after leaving a nearby football club.

The offenders have asked the man for money, which he refused to hand over and he has then been punched and kicked to the floor. The offenders ran off in the direction of Wellingborough town centre.

One of the offenders was a white man in his late 20s to early 30s, 6ft and of a medium build. He was wearing a dark fleece hooded top and jeans. The second man was Asian and of a similar age, 5ft 2in and of a medium build. He was wearing a suit.

Anyone who witnessed this incident or has any information which could assist with the investigation is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101 quoting reference number 20000670585. Or alternatively call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
