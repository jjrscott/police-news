Members of the public who have had fishing equipment and electric tools stolen from them are asked to come forward if the item pictured may belong to them.

The bag containing fishing equipment, a Makita screw gun and a Makita drill were recovered after a 35-year-old man riding a red BMX pedal cycle was stopped by officers in Northampton in the early hours of Wednesday, December 16.

Officers believe these items could have been stolen in the Abington area of the town between 8pm on Tuesday, December 15 and 1am on Wednesday, December 16, and are appealing for the rightful owners to come forward.

Anyone who recognises this item or knows who they might belong to should call Northamptonshire Police on 101, quoting reference number 20000662780.

The 35-year-old Northampton man was arrested on suspicion of theft and has been released on police bail pending further enquiries.
