Northamptonshire Police is today (10 December) launching an online survey about the use of Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology across the county.

Running for two weeks, the survey aims to give local communities the chance to voice their views and understanding of how ANPR works and how it is used to tackle crime.

ANPR is a technology whereby images of passing vehicle number plates are captured by a camera that reads the plate using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software, before sending the data back to a central database. This is used by police forces across the country to help detect, deter and disrupt criminality by providing lines of enquiry and evidence in the investigation of crime.

ANPR Manager Jamie Culverhouse said: "In Northamptonshire, there are approximately 100 ANPR sites that instantly capture vehicle data, as well as numerous operational police vehicles which are used to help fight crime and protect the people of this county.

"This survey will help us develop a broader view of public understanding around ANPR and help shape its future use across the force. It would be very useful for as many residents as possible to complete it."

Take part in the survey.
