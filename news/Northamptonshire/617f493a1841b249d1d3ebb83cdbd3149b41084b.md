Police have released a CCTV image of a man they believe may have information about the theft of a handbag from a supermarket shopper in Daventry.

The handbag was taken from the shopper's trolley in Aldi, in Sheaf Street, and a bank card was later used to fraudulently withdraw cash from a nearby cashpoint.

Officers would like to speak to the man pictured and anyone who recognises him is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 20000500014.
