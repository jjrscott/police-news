A man from Abthorpe, Towcester has been handed a four and a half year sentence for sexually abusing a child.

David Cambray, aged 51, was convicted of 12 offences - all relating to child sexual abuse.

The offences were committed a number of years ago and in January this year, the victim bravely spoke out about the abuse and a police investigation was launched.

Cambray was sentenced on Friday, November 20 at Northampton Crown Court.

Handing him the sentence, the judge told him he lacked remorse when the disclosure was made and that he had abused a position of trust.

Detective Constable Kelly Roberts, who led the investigation said: "This has been a complex and difficult case in which the victim and their family have shown immense courage and bravery in speaking out about the abuse and then supporting the investigation through to its conclusion.

"Cambray has acted entirely for his own sexual gratification without any thought for the damage his acts caused.

"This case serves as a warning to anybody with a sexual interest in children - we treat allegations of this kind with the utmost seriousness and will leave no stone unturned to ensure children are protected and justice is done".

The judge also handed Cambray a lifelong Sexual Harm Prevention Order and he be added to the Sex Offender Register for life.

 _Anybody with a sexual interest in children should seek help now._
