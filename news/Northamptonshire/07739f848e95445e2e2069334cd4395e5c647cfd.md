Young people who volunteer their spare time to help the county's communities through the Northamptonshire Emergency Services Cadets (NESC) scheme were yesterday celebrated at an awards ceremony.

On Monday, December 10, cadets, unit leaders and proud family and friends came together at Franklin's Gardens in Northampton for the NESC annual awards.

Ten awards were presented by dignitaries including Northamptonshire Police Chief Constable Nick Adderley, Northamptonshire Fire and Rescue Service's Chief Fire Officer Darren Dovey, Regional Manager for the East Midlands Ambulance Service Mike Jones, and Northamptonshire Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner Stephen Mold.

Chief Inspector Julie Mead, Chief Cadet Officer, reflected on the event and said: "I feel incredibly proud of the Northamptonshire Emergency Services Cadet units, and am pleased we have had the opportunity to celebrate the work and input cadets have on serving the communities of Northamptonshire.

"In 2018-19, cadets delivered more than 50,000 hours of volunteering to assist the emergency services and community groups in safety initiatives, and it is through events such as the NESC annual awards that we can all take a moment to reflect and appreciate the time contributed by some of our county's young people."

Each of the scheme's six units, Northampton, Daventry, Kettering, Kingswood Academy Corby, Towcester, and Wellingborough, nominated a Cadet of the Year from within its members.

These winners were Cameron French (Northampton), Alix Kemp (Kettering), Celina Page (Daventry), Georgia Summerfield (Kingswood), Sophie Bleakly (Towcester), and Courtney Robinson (Wellingborough).

NESC offers a curriculum based around the work of the police, fire and ambulance services. Open to teenagers aged 13 to 18, units meet weekly during term time and enable cadets to support the work of the emergency services and make a positive contribution to their communities.
