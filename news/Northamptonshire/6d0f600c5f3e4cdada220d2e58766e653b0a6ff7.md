Police officers are appealing for witnesses after a car collided with three pedestrians in Sackville Street, Thrapston, at 4pm, yesterday, Wednesday, December 16.

A car, for unknown reasons, crossed on to the wrong side of the road, mounted the footpath and collided with three pedestrians before reversing at speed, colliding with a garden wall, losing a part of its exhaust system and then driving away.

The three pedestrians, women, aged 68, 73 and 69, were taken to Kettering General Hospital. Two remain in hospital with serious injuries which aren't deemed to be life threatening or life changing at this stage.

Detective Constable Bruce Wilson, from the Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "This is a very serious incident and we are determined to find the driver and bring them to justice. Witnesses at the time said the car was possibly a Vauxhall Corsa or Astra. As it collided with the wall and a part of the exhaust system fell off which made a loud bang. We are urging anyone who witnessed this or sees a similar car to get in touch urgently."

 Anyone with information or who witnessed this incident is asked to call the Drivewatch Hotline on 0800 174615.

**Incident number:** 380 of 16/12
