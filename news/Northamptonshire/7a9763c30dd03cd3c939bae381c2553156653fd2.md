Police are thanking people for complying with the new mandatory face covering rules in shops and supermarkets since they were introduced at the end of last week.

Assistant Chief Constable Simon Blatchly said: "We are pleased to see that the vast majority of shoppers are following the new rules since they were introduced last Friday. It's reassuring that people are doing the sensible thing and following the Government's advice to help prevent the spread of Covid-19."

"I'd also like to thank people for understanding our request to report concerns about shoppers not wearing face coverings online rather than by phone. This means that we can answer and prioritise emergency calls and I would urge people to continue to assist us in this way."

Since the new rules came into force, Northamptonshire Police has only received four reports in relation to face coverings. These include concerns about shops not complying and an incident which wasn't a breach of the legislation. Another involved a customer becoming aggressive and refusing to wear a face covering - officers attended but the customer had left. Police will continue to review each reported incident and they are dealt with on a case-by-case basis.

Report breaches of Covid-19 legislation to Northamptonshire Police.
