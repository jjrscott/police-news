"COVID-19 won't stop us doing what we do best - fighting crime and protecting people."

That's the message from Superintendent Dennis Murray, the man in charge of policing North Northamptonshire, as his team nets a week of great results unrelated to the global pandemic.

On Monday, April 20, 37-year-old Andros Baker Allen was remanded after being charged in connection with a stabbing in Fishton Close, Kettering. A further two people, a 56-year-old man and a 48-year-old man, were arrested on the same day on suspicion of assisting an offender in relation to the incident.

On Tuesday, April 21, Superintendent Murray authorised the circulation of two wanted men to the media - 41-year-old Anthony Lake and 28-year-old Brett Stuart Trevor. After some helpful calls from members of the public as a result of the coverage, both men were found later in the week, arrested and recalled to prison. Lake, who has been charged in connection with an assault on an emergency worker, was tracked down by the Force's Road Crime Team.

On the same day, a 16-year-old boy selling drugs in Rushden was disrupted by officers and arrested on suspicion with intent to supply.

On Wednesday, April 22, the Rural Officers in the north made their way to Wilby Way in Wellingborough and seized a quad bike suspected of being involved in anti-social behaviour as well as a caravan which was suspected to be stolen. The welfare of a nearby horse was also reported to the RSPCA by officers concerned for it.

Yesterday (Thursday, April 23), two men, aged 37 and 23, were arrested in connection with an aggravated burglary in Eastbrook, Corby, with the week rounded off by a number of off-road motorcycles, suspected of being used in an anti-social manner, being seized in the town.

Superintendent Murray, said: "This week has been exceptionally busy for police officers across the county but we are more than up to the challenge - demonstrated by some of the cracking results we've had, only a snapshot of which is demonstrated here.

"It is obviously a busy time for the service due to the current pandemic but COVID-19 won't stop us doing what we do best - fighting crime and protecting people."
