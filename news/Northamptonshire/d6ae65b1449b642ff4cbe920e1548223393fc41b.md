A group of police motorcyclists joined a man on his 18th birthday as he ran a marathon across Northamptonshire in order to raise money for the NHS.

Trystan Barnett, a champion triathlete, decided to undertake the gruelling task after his triathlon season was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Starting at his dad's house in Little Billing, Trystan was accompanied by motorcyclists from Northamptonshire Police as he went through Northampton town centre, Overstone, Sywell, Earls Barton, around the edge of Wellingborough and through Irchester before finishing at his mum's house in Rushden.

Neighbourhood Policing Sergeant Lee Flavell, said: "It was a pleasure to ride alongside Trystan as he ran the 26.2 mile journey across the county.

"This young man is a prime example of what can happen when kindness is mixed with determination and exceptional talent.

"Well done Trystan - it was a privilege to ride with you."

This event was Trystan's first ever marathon as he normally runs between 5km and 10km in triathlons, having completed more than 80 in his career so far.

Trystan's dad, Lee Barnett, said: "The police officers who rode with Trystan to make sure he was safe made the day one that we will never forget.

"It has been amazing to see all of the comments and messages received and the amount of money my son has raised for such a great cause has been fantastic. So many lives were touched by this event."

So far Trystan has raised more than Â£2800\. To donate to his cause, please visit: https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/trystan-barnett
