The family of a 79-year-old man who died in a road traffic collision in Corby have paid tribute to him.

His family have now paid tribute to him in a statement released on their behalf by Northamptonshire Police:

"William had a unique character - he is loved and will be missed by his wife, three children and two grandchildren."
