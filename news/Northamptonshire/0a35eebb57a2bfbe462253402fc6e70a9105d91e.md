Police investigating the theft of around Â£1,800 of items from a Northampton supermarket have released CCTV stills of a number of people they wish to speak to.

Between 3pm and 3.30pm on Monday, February 8, a group of people entered the Asda store in Harborough Road, Kingsthorpe, and placed bottles of Champagne and spirits, as well as razor blades and a small amount of food, into a trolley which was then pushed out of the store without payment being made.

Officers have released CCTV stills of a number of people they are seeking to trace and speak to, as it is believed they may have information relevant to their enquiries.

The people pictured, anyone who recognises them, or anyone with information about the theft is asked to contact Northamptonshire Police on 101.
