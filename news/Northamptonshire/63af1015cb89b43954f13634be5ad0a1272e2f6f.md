Officers investigating an incident where a man was bitten by a dog as he protected his pet are appealing for information.

Between 1.05pm and 1.30pm on Sunday, February 21, the victim was walking his dog in Irchester country park when he came across two men walking two dogs off the lead.

One of the men put one dog back on its lead, but the other man left the second dog loose, and it went on to attack the victim's dog.

As the owner tried to stop this attack he too was bitten, causing minor hand injuries. The man with the loose dog then threatened to attack the victim if he did not leave, so he walked away along a wooded footpath leading to Daniels Road.

The suspect who threatened the dog owner is described as a white man in his early to mid-20s, 5ft 8in and of slim build. He wore a light grey or white tracksuit.

The dog which bit the victim is described as a tan-coloured bull mastiff/English bulldog cross, which wore a camouflage patterned Julius K9 harness.

The other man was white, 6ft 2in, of medium build, and the dog he had on a lead was a tan-coloured bull mastiff/English bulldog cross, in a fluorescent Julius K9 harness. This man is not being sought as a suspect.

Anyone with information about the incident or who recognises the description of the suspect or the dogs is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101.
