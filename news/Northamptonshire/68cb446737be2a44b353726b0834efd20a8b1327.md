A second person has had Christmas interrupted after being arrested for domestic abuse.

The 34-year-old man from Kettering was arrested as part of an intensification of efforts by the Force to lock up the county's most wanted domestic abuse offenders.

The man was arrested last Friday for harassment, threats to cause criminal damage and breach of a non-molestation order.

He was located and arrested by a team of officers dedicated to the Christmas intensification campaign and has been charged with offences relating to the non-molestation order. He will appear in court later this month.

The Force's domestic abuse Christmas awareness campaign launched last Friday (December 17), to coincide with an anticipated increase in incidents over the festive period.

Scheduled to run until mid-January, the aim of the campaign is to encourage the reporting of incidents and signpost victims to help and support while sending out a strong message to offenders: your Christmas gift from us is a knock on the door from a uniformed officer with a warrant for your arrest.

Officers are currently working through a 'most wanted' list of those responsible for high-harm domestic abuse, stalking and harassment.
