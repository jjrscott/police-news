Police officers are appealing for witnesses after a man and his dog were bitten by two dogs as they walked on the Racecourse in Northampton.

The incident took place between 8.45pm and 9.10pm on Tuesday, December 8, as the man in his 40s walked his dog at the bottom of the Racecourse, near to the footpath which links Leicester Street and Barrack Road.

As another dog walker with two dogs approached him, his two dogs have bitten the man after attacking his dog. As a result of the incident, both the man and his dog sustained injuries.

The offending dogs are described as being about 2ft in height and a similar breed to the American Pit Bull. Their owner, was a white man who spoke with an Eastern European accent. He was wearing a royal blue windbreaker jacket and black bottoms.

Anyone with information is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101 quoting reference number 20000649425. Or alternatively call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
