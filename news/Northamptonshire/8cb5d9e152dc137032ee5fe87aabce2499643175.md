Members of the 15th Kettering (Avondale) Beavers have successfully earned their Safety Activity Badge with the help of their local Police Community Support Officer.

PCSO Lynn McShannon, based within the Kettering Neighbourhood Policing Team, joined the six to eight-year-olds at their group meeting last Tuesday (May 21) to talk to them about all aspects of personal safety.

To earn their badges, Beavers had to understand the Green Cross Code and Water Safety Code, how to use a roadside/railway level crossing, stranger danger, what to do in the event of a fire and how to call the emergency services.

PCSO McShannon said: "It was great fun helping all the children earn their Safety Activity Badges. They demonstrated a good understanding of all the subjects we covered from road safety, stranger danger and what to do in an emergency."

Once the Beavers completed their badge work, the group went outside to test the lights on PCSO McShannon's patrol car.
