A 55-year-old man has been handed a three-year sentence for sexually abusing a woman with learning difficulties.

Keith Coomber, formerly of Kettering, was sentenced yesterday (Thursday, February 4) at Northampton Crown Court for offences which happened in 2019.

Detective Constable Sarah-Jane Roberts led the investigation and described the devastating impact the abuse has had on the victim and her family. She said:

"This has been a difficult investigation, not least because of the vulnerability of the victim.

"I want to commend the tremendous bravery shown by both her and her family throughout the investigation and I hope yesterday's result goes some way to helping them heal.

"Coomber's despicable and selfish actions caused untold damage and he gave no thought to the damage he was inflicting.

"Such was the damage he caused, the victim attempted to take her own life. This reveals the terrible impact the abuse had.

"I want to end by saying this case demonstrates how seriously we take allegations of this kind and will do everything to secure justice for victims."

Anybody who wants to report sexual abuse should pick up the phone and call 101 - we will listen.
