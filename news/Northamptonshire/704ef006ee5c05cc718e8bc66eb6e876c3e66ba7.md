Supt Rich Tompkins, who is leading the police operation in relation to this protest, said: "We are currently monitoring the protest in Northampton where approximately 70 people, including some children, have gathered to march through the town via St Giles Street, All Saints and the Drapery.

"This is a peaceful protest and all those taking part are socially distanced and wearing masks. While Northamptonshire Police tried to engage with the organisers before the event, without success, our officers are still seeking to engage with those taking part today. It is important we balance people's lawful right to protest with the continuing and very real need to mitigate the spread of Covid-19.

"Clearly this is a very emotive issue - the death of Sarah Everard has shocked so many people, including us, and we want to facilitate people in paying their respects.

"However, in the current climate with mindfulness of the global pandemic, and are asking people to seriously consider whether a protest is the right thing to do at this time.

"The protest is also causing some disruption to traffic in the town centre and we would urge people to avoid the area this afternoon while this action continues."
