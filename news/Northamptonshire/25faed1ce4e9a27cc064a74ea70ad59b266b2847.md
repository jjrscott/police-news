Cadets from the Daventry Unit have clubbed together to take festive action to support those in need this Christmas.

For the second year running, the cadets have chosen to donate to those in greater need instead of paying their December subscription fees to start a collection for the Comfort and Joy campaign.

This campaign is an annual event co-ordinated by Northamptonshire Police, the Daventry and District Forum, Daventry and South Northamptonshire Community Safety Partnership and Daventry Fire Station. The campaign aims to provide essential items - as well as gifts and treats - to men, women and children across the county who find themselves seeking refuge as a result of domestic abuse throughout the festive period.

The gifts donated will be wrapped and gifted to those supported by the campaign on Christmas Day this year.

Cadet Leader Emma Teagles said: "As Cadet Leaders, we are all immensely proud of the efforts by the Daventry Cadets, who in just three weeks have managed to collect a fantastic amount of items to donate to this very worthy cause.

"They unanimously took the decision to begin the collection for this campaign again this year, and we think this is testament to the kindness, generosity and good will which is demonstrated by these cadets on a day-to-day basis."
