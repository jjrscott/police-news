JOINT STATEMENT FROM NORTHAMPTONSHIRE POLICE, NORTHAMPTONSHIRE FIRE AND RESCUE SERVICE, NORTHAMPTONSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL, HIGHWAYS ENGLAND AND CCG

Police, Fire and other services are receiving a large number of calls due to the heavy rainfall - many from stranded drivers who have driven into floods.

We are reminding people 999 is for emergencies only, and the increase in calls is putting services under pressure.

We are urging people not to call 999 unless there is a serious risk to life or threat of danger to property. Doing so puts services under strain so those who do require an emergency response may have to wait longer.

We are also advising people not to drive into water - the depth isn't immediately obvious and the risk often unapparent.

Driving conditions are difficult and we urge people to take extreme caution.

Later, as temperatures drop, the roads could become icy, making conditions even more hazardous.
