Members of the public are being thanked for playing their part in following the latest lockdown restrictions which came into force last week.

The vast majority of people in Northamptonshire are following the guidance put in place by the Government in order to help stop the spread of Covid-19.

Assistant Chief Constable Simon Blatchly, from Northamptonshire Police, said: "We know the vast majority of people are following the rules and we thank them for that. No one wants to be in another lockdown, however, as infection rates increase across the county, it's vital that we all do our part to stop the spread of coronavirus.

"It is clear the NHS is under immense pressure, with both of our acute hospitals busier now than they were last spring - we must all continue to pull together to help ease this pressure.

"We all have a personal responsibility to follow the rules, bringing the infection rate down is not the responsibility of other people, each and every one of us has to do the right thing."

It was revealed last week that Northamptonshire Police issued 848 Fixed Penalty Notices between March and December 2020, this number will have risen to more than 1,000 since the New Year and is expected to rise further following an increase in patrols.

ACC Blatchly added: "Policing across the UK has been asked to be even more proactive in tackling those people who are not complying with the law, and that it what we're doing. Our Neighbourhood Teams are completing covid patrols, focussing on our town centres, public transport, parks, country parks and supermarkets, in order to engage and offer reassurance to the public.

"Social distancing measures and the need to wear a face mask in shops and on public transport have been the law for six months, there is no excuse for not knowing the rules. Likewise, people know they shouldn't be having visitors to their homes, other than those who are in their support bubble, and then only when absolutely necessary. The more people mix, the higher the risk of the virus spreading.

"My officers will continue to respond to reported breaches of Covid legislation and issue fines of up to £10,000 to anyone hosting a gathering and £200 fines to those people in attendance."

Reports of breaches, which are received in the Force Control Room, can be made via our website here.

During lockdown people are advised to:

 * Stay at home
 * Only leave home for food, medical reasons, exercise or work
 * Work from home, unless you're unable to do so
 * Do not travel unless necessary, stay local, including for exercise
 * Wear face coverings in shops and on public transport
 * Maintain good hygiene practices, wash/sanitise hands regularly
