Please see a statement from Northamptonshire Police on RAF Croughton:

"Northamptonshire Police has today been advised by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office that they have reached an agreement with the US Government to restrict the immunity from criminal jurisdiction of Embassy staff, officers and family members at RAF Croughton.

"While we understand these changes will not be retrospective, Northamptonshire Police welcomes these changes.

"Northamptonshire Police remains committed to working with colleagues in the Crown Prosecution Service to ensure Anne Sacoolas is returned from the US to allow criminal proceedings to go ahead here in the UK."
