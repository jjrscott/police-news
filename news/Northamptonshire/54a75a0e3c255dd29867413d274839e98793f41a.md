Police officers are issuing a warning to the public after an attempted scam in Hesketh Road, Yardley Gobion.

The incident happened between 1.45pm and 2.30pm on Saturday, October 31, when an elderly woman was contacted via the telephone by a man who explained that she was entitled to reduced price loft insulation due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The man attended the property later that day and upon inspection, told the woman that she had mould growing in her loft and that it'd cost Â£2,000 to sort out. Thankfully, the woman got suspicious and refused.

Later on, her loft was inspected properly and there was no mould found to be growing.

The suspect called himself Roger Brooks and is described as a white man, aged 50, about 5ft 6in, of a stocky build, with short black hair.

Witnesses or anyone with any information should contact Northamptonshire Police on 101.

**Incident number:** 20000584384
