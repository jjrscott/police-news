Officers from Northampton Neighbourhood Policing Team and the Local Response Team, with the help of the Northamptonshire Emergency Services Cadets, have been conducting knife test purchasing throughout Northampton as part of Northamptonshire Police's focus on reducing knife crime.

On Tuesday, August 25, they conducted the test purchasing in several locations including the town centre, Weston Favell, Riverside, St James Retail Park and Kingsthorpe as part of an operation to stop shops selling knives to children and three of the 17 stores failed. PC Lewis Dickens said: "We chose our list, which included various stores from large franchises to local shops, based on local knowledge and intelligence that certain shops could be selling knives to children. Three of the 17 shops failed and have been reported for summons to court.

"Of course, the vast majority of shop owners and managers passed our test and refused to sell to anyone underage. However, we will continue these operations so the message to shop owners is clear - we are dedicated to tackling knife crime and selling knives to children is unacceptable. We will find out if you are doing so and you will face the consequences."

 Anyone concerned about a shop selling knives or alcohol to children can call Northamptonshire Police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
