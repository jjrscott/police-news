The Special Constabulary at Northamptonshire Police have volunteered a huge total of 7,800 hours to COVID-19 patrols since the pandemic's lockdown was imposed.

Specials are highly-trained volunteers who work with their local police force to tackle crime in their community. They come from all walks of life and join us for a variety of reasons.

Once they have completed their training, they have the same powers as regular officers and wear a similar uniform.

Superintendent Elliot Foskett is one of the officers who has led the Force's COVID-19 policing operation. He said: "I truly believe we have one of the best Special Constabularies in the country in Northamptonshire - we simply could not do the work we do without them and every time we need them, they are there.

"The COVID-19 lockdown was an unprecedented situation and we needed to quickly adapt to the new scenery in order to police effectively, which we have done.

"Our Specials were an absolutely integral part of that and have volunteered a huge total of 7,800 hours fighting crime and protecting people during this pandemic.

"I would like to say a huge thank you to them for always being there when we call upon them and for helping our communities across Northamptonshire during this time."

Northamptonshire Police is always on the lookout for more Specials to join the Force. If you would like to learn more, please visit: www.northants.police.uk/careers
