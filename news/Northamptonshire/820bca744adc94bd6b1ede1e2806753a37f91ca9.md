Police investigating an incident in Long Buckby where a shoplifter threatened store staff with a knife have released photos of two people they would like to trace.

Following a previous appeal for information, officers have now released CCTV images of a man and a woman they believe may be able to assist their investigation into the incident at the Co-op.

The incident, which happened shortly after 3.20pm on Saturday, February 13, involved a man entering the store, filling a basket with alcohol and other goods then passing it outside to a waiting woman, before the pair fled.

Pursued by staff from the store into the High Street, the man and woman then stopped outside the public toilets before the woman produced a knife and threatened to stab the store workers. The pair then left on foot, heading down Station Road and into William Road.

The man and woman pictured, anyone who recognises them or knows where they are, please contact Northamptonshire Police on 101, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.

**Incident number:** 21000089373
