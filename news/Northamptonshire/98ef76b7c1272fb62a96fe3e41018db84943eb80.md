Several thousand people from Northampton's Muslim community took part in open air prayers on the Racecourse to mark Eid al-Fitr early this morning (Tuesday, June 4).

Uniformed officers attended the event, in addition to Rachel Packman and Christian Buckenham, Police Community Engagement Officers. Rachel and Christian handed out Eid Mubarak cards which not only contained information about community engagement, but also crime and fire safety advice and details about becoming a Volunteer, Special or Cadet, whilst also promoting the current recruitment drive for regular officers.

Christian said;

"Eid prayers and celebrations are a great opportunity for us to engage with the Muslim communities we have in the county. The event is attended by a wide variety of our Muslim communities including those who have links with Nigeria, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Turkey, Tanzania, Somalia and the Middle East. The uniformed officers were very popular with lots of selfies being taken. We wish all our Muslim communities Eid Mubarak."
