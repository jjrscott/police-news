Officers investigating the sexual assault of a woman in Wellingborough are appealing for witnesses and information.

At around 10.30am on Tuesday, March 23, a woman was walking along Hardwick Road towards the town centre with a friend.

As they approached the Torrington Road junction, the victim was approached from behind by a male who struck her on the bottom with such force it left a large mark and bruising.

The suspect then ran off towards Minerva Way. He is described as white and possibly in his teens due to his small stature. He wore a black top with the hood pulled up and was holding a scrunched up paper bag, possibly from McDonald's.

Anyone who saw the assault or has information about it is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101.

**Incident number:** 21000164234
