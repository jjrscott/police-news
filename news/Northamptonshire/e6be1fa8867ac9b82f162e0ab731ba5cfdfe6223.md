A Northampton cannabis factory has been discovered and dismantled this morning in Hunter Street with two men arrested in connection.

As a result of community intelligence, officers were able to secure the warrant and executed it this morning at 8.30am. Hundreds of plants were discovered.

Officers at the scene met with some trouble at the door of the property as it had been barricaded with a washing machine, allowing a man to escape through the back of the property.

The man in question then began garden hopping before entering the house of an elderly woman in his bid to escape. Finally, following a tip-off from a member of the public and some good work by PD Olly, the 28-year-old was quickly located and arrested.

Another man, aged 33, was then arrested a short time later at a nearby address in connection with the grow.

Both men remain in police custody at this time.
