Officers investigating an incident of arson at a cash machine in Far Cotton have released CCTV images of a man they wish to speak to.

At around 11pm on Tuesday, February 23, a cash machine at the Co-op store in Rothersthorpe Road had a suspected accelerant poured on it and was set alight by a man who then ran away.

Police have now released two images of a man they would like to identify and speak to as it is believed he may have information relevant to the investigation.

The man pictured, anyone who recognises him or has information about the incident, is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101.
