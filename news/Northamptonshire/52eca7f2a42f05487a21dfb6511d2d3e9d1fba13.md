A 29-year old Corby man has been handed a three-year sentence after pleading guilty to one count of sexual communication with a child and one of inciting a child to engage in penetrative sexual activity.

Gary Norman, of Shakespeare Way in Corby, was sentenced today at Northampton Crown Court.

The sentencing follows a complex investigation led by Detective Constable Chris Waterfall from the forces Child Protection Team, who said today:

"I'm pleased the court has recognised the seriousness of Norman's crimes by handing him a custodial sentence.

"The victim in this difficult case has demonstrated extreme bravery by reporting the incidents to us, which has resulted in Norman paying for his crimes while also helping protect other children from his predatory behaviour.

"This case serves as a warning to anybody with a sexual interest in children - we will track you down, protect victims and put you behind bars.

"We take all allegations of this kind extremely seriously and will leave no stone unturned to ensure children are protected and justice is done.

"Anybody with a sexual interest in children should seek help now."
