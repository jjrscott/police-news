A 35-year-old Northampton man has been arrested on suspicion of drug offences after the vehicle he was driving was stopped by police.

The incident took place at 1pm yesterday (Thursday, July 9), in Wellingborough Road, Northampton when officers from Northamptonshire Special Constabulary, had cause to stop a silver Vauxhall Astra van.

The driver attempted to evade being stopped by the officers, however with support from their colleagues in Northamptonshire Police's Operations Team, the van was stopped using a reinforced box manoeuvre

A quantity of drugs, believed to be cannabis, were recovered from the van and the man was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply a controlled Class B drug. He has been released under investigation.
