Primary school children in Northampton have been learning how to stay safe after their local Police Community Support Officer paid a special visit to their classroom.

PCSO Nat Shaw from the Northampton Neighbourhood Policing Team, was invited to the Bellinge campus of Ecton Brook Primary School to talk to the Reception Year children about stranger danger and road safety.

The visit was a great opportunity to introduce the four and five-year-olds to their local policing team with PCSO Shaw explaining the role of the neighbourhood team and how the police are there to keep them safe.

PCSO Shaw said: "I really enjoyed my visit and talking to the children. They asked lots of interesting questions, which was absolutely fantastic as it showed that they were listening to what I had to say.

"As well as speaking about stranger danger and road safety, we also did some role playing to teach the children how to contact the police. They pretended to call the police and I asked them some simple questions such as their name and address."

If you've the community at heart, good local knowledge and great problem solving skills, Northamptonshire Police is looking for more PCSOs to join its neighbourhood teams. Visit the careers page at www.northants.police.uk for details.
