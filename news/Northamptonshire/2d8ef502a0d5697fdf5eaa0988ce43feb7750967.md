The police commander in charge of the Force's response to the Covid-19 pandemic has thanked the public for their "widespread compliance" of the UK-wide lockdown measures which are now into a fourth week.

Assistant Chief Constable Simon Blatchly said: "I'm very happy to report the vast majority of people are using their common sense and playing a full part in the national effort to restrict the spread of Covid-19.

"Patrolling officers are seeing widespread compliance and this is the case in open spaces and parks throughout the county.

"Even where there has been a need for officers to talk to people who aren't observing social distancing rules we are finding they are quick to comply, without the need for enforcement.

"We will continue to encourage and support our communities to abide by the restrictions. We have no desire to use the formal powers but it's right we are able to take positive action against those who disregard the measures and put people's lives at risk.

"I expect the high levels of co-operation to continue and once again thank people for staying indoors, staying safe, protecting the NHS and saving lives."

Police can issue penalty notices of £60, reduced to £30 if paid within 28 days, where they have reason to believe there has been an offence under the regulations.

Due to the exceptional nature of these powers, the regulations will be reviewed at least every 21 days to ensure they are still necessary.
