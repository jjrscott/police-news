Officers investigating a knifepoint robbery at a Northampton convenience store have released CCTV images of a man they would like to speak to.

At around 8.55pm on Monday, January 4, a man entered a Premier store in Queen Eleanor Road and picked up a bottle of wine which he hid under his jacket before trying to leave without paying.

When the shopkeeper challenged him, the man pulled out a silver lock knife around five inches long and pointed it at the shopkeeper, who retreated to the back office and dialled 999.

The man then left the store with the wine and ran off towards Playdell Gardens.

Officers are keen to trace the man pictured as he may have information relevant to the investigation.

The man pictured, anyone who recognises him or who has information about the incident should call Northamptonshire Police on 101.

**Incident number:** 21000005926
