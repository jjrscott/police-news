Police officers are appealing for witnesses after a commercial burglary in Kettering Road, Northampton.

Between 3.30pm on Saturday, December 5 and 7.30am on Monday, December 7, it is believed the offender/s have used an angle grinder to gain entry to a storage unit next to the Morrison's Petrol Station and stole machinery and tools.

The rear of the storage unit backs on to some allotments, and officers would like to speak to anyone who may have seen anyone acting suspiciously either near to the allotments or the petrol station between the stated times.

Anyone who witnessed this or who may have any information about the incident, is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101 quoting reference number 20000647463. Or alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
