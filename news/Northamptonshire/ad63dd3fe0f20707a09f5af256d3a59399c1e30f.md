Do you recognise this man? Police officers would like help to identify him as they believe he may have information about a robbery in Northampton.

The incident happened between 11.15am and 11.25am on Monday, December 28, outside the Kingsley Park Methodist Church as a 78-year-old woman walked along Kingsley Park Terrace.

She was approached by a man who grabbed her arm, hurting her in the process, who then pulled her shopping bag from her and ran off down Milton Street towards Junction Road.

Officers investigating the incident believe the man in the image may be able to assist with their enquiries, and are appealing for him or anyone who may recognise him, to get in touch.

Anyone with information is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101 quoting reference number 20000683055. Or alternatively call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

A 64-year-old man from Northampton has been arrested in connection with this incident and released under investigation pending further enquiries.
