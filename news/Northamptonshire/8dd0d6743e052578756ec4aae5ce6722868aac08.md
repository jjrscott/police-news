We've had a wonderful array of artwork from across Northamptonshire since we asked children and young people to tell us what they've been up to since the lockdown by sharing their stories, poems, artwork or posters with us.

Because of this we've decided to extend the closing date to Wednesday, May 27 so people can get creative over the bank holiday weekend, whether that be writing, drawing, colouring or painting. We can then create a truly spectacular collage of colourful work!

Parents and carers must give permission to send in and with their consent, we'll create a colourful celebratory poster and video and share it on our force's website and social media channels.

We've joined forces with Beat Route Radio who have donated a voice controlled i-box Century Internet Radio with Amazon Alexa built-in (photo attached) as a prize for the piece of artwork judged the best with the winner being announced live on Thursday, May 28 at 5pm.

Don't forget we'll need parents and carers permission for artwork to be posted on social media channels. Please ask them to send your work to: news@northants.pnn.police.uk
