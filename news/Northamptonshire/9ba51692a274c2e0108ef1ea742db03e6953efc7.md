A group of children have teamed up with their local community support officer to encourage parents to be more considerate when parking on the school run outside their village primary.

Each month a small group of Year 6 pupils are nominated to be parking monitors by their class teacher to join PCSO Margaret Lawson on her patrols at Geddington C of E Primary School in Wood Street.

The project was set up in partnership by head teacher Martin Adamson and PCSO Lawson in January to help alleviate inappropriate parking during peak times in the morning when parents drop off their children.

PCSO Lawson, said: "The project has been very well received by parents and local residents and the children have really enjoyed being parking monitors and joining me on patrol.

"We work together as a team to identify adults who are going to park illegally, and speak to them about the potential hazard their parking could cause for pedestrians and other road users."

To take part in the project, the children arrive at school 30-minutes early and put on their hi-visibility parking monitor tabards before receiving a road safety briefing from PCSO Lawson.
