A white Springer Spaniel called Flynn was stolen in a burglary that took place at a cottage in Yelvertoft Road, Elkington.

The incident happened between 11pm on Monday, November 16, and 6am on Tuesday, November 17, when the unknown offender/s forced entry into a barn.

Once inside they stole tools and also the family's dog - an eight-year-old liver and white Springer Spaniel called Flynn.

Witnesses or anyone who information should call Northamptonshire Police on 101.

If you are the offender and you are reading this, do the right thing and give Flynn back. Dogs are not 'property' to their owners, they are family members, and you have caused enormous distress to Flynn's family who don't know where he is or if he is okay.

**Incident number:** 20000607712
