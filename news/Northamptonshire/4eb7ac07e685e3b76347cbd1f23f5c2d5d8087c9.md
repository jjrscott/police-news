Officers investigating two incidents in which two women were followed by an unknown person are appealing for witnesses and information.

The women realised they were first being followed after leaving a premises in Park Square, in Kings Heath, Northampton, at 9pm on Saturday, March 20.

On Saturday, March 27, the women left the same location at 9pm and again realised someone appeared to be following them.

When they stopped at the corner of Wharf Green and Severn Drive the person also stopped and appeared to be looking at a mobile phone.

The father of one of the women had come to meet them, and when he arrived the person following the pair walked past him and was then found hiding behind a van in Swale Drive. When questioned about what they were doing they said 'Me looking' before running off.

It is unknown if the suspect is male or female. They are described as around 5ft 5in and of slim to medium build. On the first occasion they wore a red jacket and dark clothing, including hat, hood and boots, with a scarf or mask over their face.

On the second occasion their clothing was again dark, with a red jacket seen underneath a black jacket. They are believed to have an Eastern European accent.

Anyone with information about either incident is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101.
