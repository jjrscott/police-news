On Friday (July 17), officers from the local response team conducted a misuse of drugs act warrant in the Eastfield area of Northampton.

A 39-year-old Northampton woman was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A drugs. Quantities of cash and a weapon were also seized from the address.

This warrant was part of our 100 days of intense policing activity across Northamptonshire.

In this video Sergeant Nicola Tailby talks in more detail about the operation.
