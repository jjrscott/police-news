On the first anniversary after his disappearance, Northamptonshire Police has issued a fresh appeal for help to find missing teenager Zelalem Gegzihabet.

Zelalem is now 17-years-old, and was one of four Eritrean teenagers who were reported missing from Northampton on March 20, 2019. Three of the four have since been located, however there has been no sightings of Zelalem.

He is described as being of a medium build with brown eyes. At the time he went missing, Zelalem had black and brown hair worn in short dreadlocks to the top of his head, with short sides.

Zelalem, who has an African accent, was last seen wearing a turquoise hooded top, black jeans and black trainers.

Northamptonshire Police and Children First Northamptonshire are concerned for the welfare of this young person. If anyone has seen Zelalem or knows where he is, please call 101 or email MissingPersonTeam@northants.pnn.police.uk
