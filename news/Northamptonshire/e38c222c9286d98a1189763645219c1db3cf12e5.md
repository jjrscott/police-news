Visitors to Open Farm Sunday had the opportunity to meet their local community support officers at this year's annual event.

PCSOs Kev Lumbis and Steve Sangster were on hand to provide crime prevention advice to families and members of the farming community at the playing field in Brixworth Road, Creaton on Sunday (June 2).

While the adults collected advice and information from Kev and Steve, having the chance to sit in the Daventry Rural Neighbourhood Policing Team patrol car proved a big draw for the younger visitors.

There were also demonstrations, a static display of modern farming machinery and the opportunity to learn more about the innovative new technology being used on farms.

Organised by Brixworth Farming Company, the event was held in conjunction with Creaton in Bloom, which raises thousands of pounds for local good causes and the upkeep of village amenities.
