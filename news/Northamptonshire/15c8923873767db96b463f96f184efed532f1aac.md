Officers investigating the theft of a puppy from a Northampton street have released a new image of the dog as they reappeal for information on her whereabouts.

Winter, a five-month-old French bulldog, escaped from a property in Edith Street at around 12.30pm on Sunday, February 28, before witnesses saw her being picked up and carried off by an unknown man.

The suspect had been standing in Woodford Street on the phone prior to the theft, and when he had picked Winter up, he walked off up Ethel Street and was last seen turning right out of Palmerston Road onto Wellingborough Road.

Winter is described as a white female puppy, and has grey and black markings on her head and ears.

Anyone with information about her theft or her current whereabouts is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.

**Incident number:** 21000116786
