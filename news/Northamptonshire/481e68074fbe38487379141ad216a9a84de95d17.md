A Rushden couple who have a history of shoplifting have been made the subject of Criminal Behaviour Orders (CBO) after a successful application by Northamptonshire Police.

Paul Barnett, aged 43, of Rushden, and Catherine Bell, aged 55, of Rushden, have both been convicted of a number of shoplifting offences, including in a number of stores at the Rushden Lakes leisure complex.

The order, which follows an application submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service, means Barnett and Bell are both barred from entering Rushden town centre and Rushden Lakes.

The order will remain in place for five years.

Neighbourhood Policing Sergeant Sharan Wildman, said: "We are very pleased to have secured this order against Barnett and Bell who have been a persistent issue to retail staff in Rushden with their constant shoplifting.

"The CBOs now prevent them from entering the town centre and the leisure complex and by releasing their photos, we are asking anyone who sees them flouting this order, to report it to us via 101."
