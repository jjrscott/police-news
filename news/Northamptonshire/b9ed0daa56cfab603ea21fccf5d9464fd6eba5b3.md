Northamptonshire Police is saddened to hear about the terrorist incidents on Saturday, April 21, in Sri Lanka.

First and foremost, our thoughts and prayers are with the victims , their families and the wider community. We recognise that this incident will inevitably resonate with all communities across the world.

All of the neighbourhood policing teams are aware of this tragic incident and will work with places of worship to provide reassurance.

If anyone has any concerns or questions, I would advise you to contact your local neighbourhood policing team who will be happy to help.
