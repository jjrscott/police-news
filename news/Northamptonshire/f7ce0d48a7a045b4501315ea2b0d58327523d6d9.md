Police are asking for the public's help to identify a man they believe may have information about a robbery in Northampton.

At 5.40pm on Wednesday, December 16, a 47-year-old woman had unlocked her car on Greenwood Road when she was approached by a man who asked her for the time. He then took her handbag and ran off in the direction of Althorp Road.

Her card was subsequently used in three local shops.

Anyone who recognises the man pictured is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 20000664479.
