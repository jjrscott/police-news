A 39-year-old Kettering man has been jailed for 32 months in connection with five attempted burglaries.

Matthew Frances Mick White, 39, previously of Kettering, pleaded guilty to the offences which happened across Kettering between January 18, 2020, and February 6, 2020.

In all five, White attempted to gain access to people's homes but was disturbed by various means including guard dogs and the occupants themselves.

At Northampton Crown Court he was sentenced to a total of 32 months.

Detective Sergeant Alan Rooney, said: "I'm very pleased to see White sent to jail - he is a prolific burglar who often targets houses where doors or windows have been left open. As a result of him being sent to prison, further burglaries will no doubt be prevented.

"I'd like to emphasise how this case was greatly assisted by CCTV and Ring doorbells - both of these things are fantastic deterrents as well as great investigative tools.

"Northamptonshire Police knows how deeply burglary can affect a victim. Everyone has the right to feel safe in their homes and we will continue working hard to reduce burglaries and bring the burglars to justice."
