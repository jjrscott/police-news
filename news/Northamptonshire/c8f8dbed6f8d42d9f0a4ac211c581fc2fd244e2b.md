Police officers are issuing a warning to the public after a man crossed a live railway track to graffiti a bridge.

The incident happened on Monday, February 8, at about 12.15pm, when a man was seen to be graffitiing Bridge D (pictured) near the Crick and Kilsby bridleway.

When he was spotted, he ran into the adjacent field, climbed the palisade security fencing, crossed the live London Midland railway track and then the adjacent live rail sidings.

The man was in his 30s wearing a blue checked lumberjack-style shirt, grey combat-style trousers, a black beanie hat and was carrying a lightweight drawstring bag.

If you recognise the description of the man or know anyone who may use the image as a graffiti tag, please call us on 101.

Trespassing onto the railway track is extremely dangerous and people who do so are putting themselves at risk of electrocution. Please don't take the risk.

**Incident number:** 21000079640
