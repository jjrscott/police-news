Police officers are appealing for witnesses after a teenage boy was threatened with a knife as he walked through an alleyway between Church Walk and Market Hill in Rothwell.

Between 11.45am and 12.30pm on Monday, January 18, the boy was approached by the offender who has threatened to stab him. He has caused a small cut in the boy's jacket, who has ran off.

This is the second time the offender has approached the boy. On Monday, January 11, at about the same time, the offender has approached the boy in the alleyway, and demanded he found a person for him and provided a description.
