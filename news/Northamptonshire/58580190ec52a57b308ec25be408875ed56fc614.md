Officers are appealing for help to trace a man who may have information about the fraudulent use of a stolen bank card in Rushden.

At around 12.30pm on Tuesday, January 26, a woman in the town received a phone call from someone claiming to be from her bank, advising her that her purse had been stolen and someone had attempted to use her bank card.

Having checked and discovered that her purse was missing, during the course of this call the woman was tricked into revealing her PIN by the caller.

She later realised the call was fraudulent as she discovered her card had been used to withdraw a large sum of cash and also for purchases in a local store.

Officers investigating the incident would like to speak to the man pictured who may have information relevant to the investigation.

The man, anyone who recognises him, or has information about the incident, should call Northamptonshire Police on 101.

**Incident number:** 21000055648

 * Your bank and the police will never ring and ask you to verify your PIN, withdraw cash or purchase high-value goods. They'll also never come to your home to collect your card, cash or purchased items. If you get a call like this, end the call.

_Officers want to hear from this man - any information, call 101._
