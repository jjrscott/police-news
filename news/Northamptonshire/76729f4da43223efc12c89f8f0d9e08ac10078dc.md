Members of the public have the opportunity to speak to their local neighbourhood team on Wednesday (June 12) at a special crime prevention evening being held in Long Buckby.

The event has been organised by Police Community Support Officer (PCSO) Craig Egdell at the United Reformed Church in Brington Road, between 5pm and 8pm in response to a series of burglaries earlier this year.

PCSO Egdell said: "Directly following the burglaries, we spoke to victims, carried out letter drops of the local area and sent out crime prevention information via the Neighbourhood Alert system.

"This event has been organised to reinforce the crime prevention message and is open to anyone who would like more information on crime prevention or raise any local policing concerns they may have with their local neighbourhood team."

The Daventry Rural Neighbourhood Policing Team officer will be joined at the event by colleagues PCSO Tara Cooksammy and Crime Prevention Officer Brenda Hart, and Neighbourhood Watch Co-ordinator Rachel Dobbs.
