A crack house has been shut down by Northamptonshire Police following numerous community complaints.

The address inside Eyeletter House in Greenwood Road had a partial closure notice issued against it on Monday, August 10, after complaints from local residents that the address was being used as a base for drug dealing and as a result, was a hotbed of anti-social behaviour.

The closure will prevent anyone, apart from the registered resident, from entering the address.

PC Neil MacKenzie, said: "This address was a real blight on the local area and we were receiving regular complaints from residents regarding the anti-social behaviour that was taking place.

"I hope our actions this week demonstrate to the local community that we are listening to their concerns and acting upon them - everyone has the right to feel happy and safe in their homes and we will not tolerate behaviour that threatens that right.

"The resident inside this address was also a vulnerable person who we feared was being taken advantage of by local drug dealers. I am pleased that we have been able to get them the support they need and ensure the closure order protects them instead of leaving them homeless.

"We recognise that some residents are forced or coerced into allowing undesirable people to stay, therefore forcing them to lose the power of control over their own homes. This order allows them to take back control with the police and court's support."

A request for a full closure order is to be heard at Northampton Magistrates' Court on Friday, August 21.
