Detectives are continuing to appeal for witnesses after an incident in Wellingborough in which they believe a firearm was used.

The incident happened at about 5pm on Friday, March 5, in the area of Brickhill Road and Lea Way when a 24-year-old man was shot in the leg. He was taken to hospital where he has since been treated for his injuries which were not deemed to be life threatening.

Officers are now re-appealing for anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious in the area around the time of the incident to contact them.

Detective Inspector Danny Gasson, said: "This is clearly a very concerning incident however we are satisfied that it was an isolated incident and that there is no wider risk to members of the public.

"I would encourage anyone who has information that has not yet come forward to please contact us. You don't have to tell us who you are, just what you know.

"We are particularly interested in anyone who may have any pertinent CCTV, doorbell or dashcam footage."

"Witnesses, or anyone with camera footage or any other information, should called Northamptonshire Police on 101, quoting reference number 21000127501. If you wish to remain anonymous, please contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555111."
