Joint patrols by the police and fire service in Desborough has had a positive impact to reduce the problem of inconsiderate parking outside two of the town's primary schools.

Police Community Support Officer (PCSO) Kirsty Ellerby of Kettering & Corby Rural Neighbourhood Policing Team has been working in partnership with her colleagues from Desborough Fire Station for the past two months.

Patrols have been carried out in and around Harrington Road and Havelock Street, where there are three schools - Loatsland Primary, Havelock Junior and Infants - following reports of dangerous parking.

PCSO Ellerby, said: "We started the joint patrols about two months ago following calls to both the fire service and ourselves about dangerous parking outside these schools, and we have already seen a positive impact.

"The school-run can be quite stressful for some parents when they're trying to get their child to school on time, so we understand that how they park is probably the last thing on their mind.

"However as a result of our presence and talking to parents, they have started to understand the importance of parking more sensibly outside the school. Not only from a personal safety issue but also to provide access for emergency vehicles."

The patrols have also been welcomed by the schools, with PCSO Ellerby receiving positive feedback from one of the head teachers, who said they had seen a change in some parents' parking already.
