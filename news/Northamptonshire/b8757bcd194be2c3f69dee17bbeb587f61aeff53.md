Detectives investigating the stabbing of a man in Kettering are appealing for witnesses and information.

The incident happened shortly after 7.25am on Sunday, February 28, in an alleyway which links St Theresa's Close and Anderson Drive in the Ise Lodge area.

As the man walked down the alleyway from St Theresa's Close, he heard someone shout 'oi' before he was approached by an unknown man.

An altercation ensued during which the victim was stabbed in the upper arm, receiving a wound which required hospital treatment.

The suspect is described as a white man aged 30-35, around 5ft 9in, of skinny build and gaunt appearance. He wore a dark blue or black hooded coat with the hood up, light grey muddy tracksuit bottoms, and scruffy dirty white trainers.

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
