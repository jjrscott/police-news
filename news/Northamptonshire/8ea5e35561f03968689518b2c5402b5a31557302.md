Police in Corby are investigating 10 offences involving thefts of motorbikes.

Each of these crimes involved the same pattern - the victims have advertised their bikes for sale on Facebook. They have then been contacted by the suspects and arrangements made for the bike to be brought to Corby, from all areas of the country. Once there, offenders have asked to test the bikes - but then ridden off and disappeared without making any payment.

Three local men have been arrested in connection with the thefts. A 28-year-old man is currently in prison for other matters and two men, one aged 20 and one aged 21, are currently on bail pending further investigation.

One of the stolen bikes has been recovered and returned to the rightful owner and enquiries are ongoing to recover the rest.

PC Mark Walker, who is leading the investigation said "I urge people to be very careful when selling bikes or vehicles on social media. If you do, keep the bike secured when showing potential buyers and be wary of travelling long distances in the hope of a sale."

If anyone thinks they've been offered a stolen motorcycle or knows the location of one they think may be stolen, please contact: mark.walker@northants.pnn.police.uk in confidence.
