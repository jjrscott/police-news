Police officers have released an image of a man they believe may have information about a theft which took place at the home of an elderly woman in George Street, Wellingborough.

The incident happened between 3pm and 4pm on Sunday, October 23, when the woman invited a man into her home for a cup of tea, however shortly after he left, she noticed her bank card was missing.

The bank card was used at two nearby shops to purchase cigarettes and alcohol, and officers believe the man in the image may have information about the theft, which could assist with their investigation.

Officers are appealing for the man or anyone who may recognise him, to get in touch. Anyone with information is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101 quoting reference number 20000563656. Or alternatively call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
