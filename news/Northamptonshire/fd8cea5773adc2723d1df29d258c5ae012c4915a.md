A total of eleven warrants were executed by police officers across Northamptonshire last week with significant arrests made, County Lines disrupted, and stolen property recovered.

In the north of the county, officers focused on one specific County Line, executing six warrants and arresting six people believed to be a part of it.

On the west, a total of five warrants were executed resulting in two large cannabis grows being found.

One person was charged and remanded for cannabis cultivation and two out of court disposals were given for personal amounts of cannabis.

A stolen moped was also recovered from one of the addresses.

Detective Chief Inspector Hayley Costar from the Force's Intelligence Bureau, said: "Last week was another successful week of proactive enforcement against those people who seek to use this county as a base to commit crime.

"We are continuing to send a very clear message that Northamptonshire is a hostile place for criminals and I would like to reassure the public that this positive enforcement will continue unabated.

"I am particularly pleased to see a County Line severely disrupted as part of our activity last week. These Lines exploit vulnerable people and safeguarding those people is just as important to us as taking drugs off our streets.

"Finally, I would like to thank the public for the community intelligence they regularly provide us with which really helps us to secure these warrants - please do continue to report suspicious activity to us."

Northamptonshire Police encourages anyone with information about suspicious activity in their area to come forward and report it to us. Please call us on 101 or use our online reporting tool at www.northants.police.uk/ro.
