Police officers investigating a robbery in Brackley have released an image of a group of males they believe may have information about the incident on Sunday, March 14.

The incident took place between 4.55pm and 5.10pm when a man in his 20s was approached by a group of males as he walked along a wooded footpath between Swift Way and Humphries Drive.

The group demanded money and after he handed over Â£40, he challenged them and was punched in the face, causing a small cut to the inside of his mouth. The group ran off over the field at the Leisure Centre and towards Candleford Court before getting into an Enterprise rental van.

Officers investigating the incident believe the group in the image may be able to assist with their inquiries and are appealing for them or anyone who may recognise them, to get in touch.

Anyone with information is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101 quoting reference number 21000144170. Or alternatively call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
