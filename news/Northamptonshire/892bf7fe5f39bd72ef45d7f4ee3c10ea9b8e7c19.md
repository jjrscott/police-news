Cat owners in Brackley are being urged to keep an eye on their pets after two cats were shot with metal pellets, injuring one and killing the other.

On January 15, the owners of a cat in Newbery Drive discovered a wound on the animal's head, and when they took her for treatment the vet removed a metal pellet found lodged under her skin.

Three days later the same people found a dead cat in their garden which also appeared to have been shot. They took the cat to the vets where a metal pellet was recovered from his skull.

Police enquiries into the two incidents are ongoing, and officers are appealing for anyone with information to get in touch, particularly anyone who may have heard any shots, or found metal pellets in their garden.

Cat owners in the wider area around Newbery Drive are also asked to be vigilant, and encouraged to consider keeping their pets in at night.

Anyone with information about either incident should call Northamptonshire Police on 101, or make a report online at www.northants.police.uk.

**Incident number:** 21000046620
