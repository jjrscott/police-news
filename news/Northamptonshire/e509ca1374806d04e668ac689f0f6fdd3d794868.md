A woman found guilty under the Dangerous Dogs Act has been sentenced after her dog bit a four-year-old child in the face, which required 14 stitches.

Cheryl Ladner, aged 40 from Little Stanion near Corby, was given a 16-week sentence at Northampton Magistrates' Court for being the owner of a dog dangerously out of control causing injury. The sentence was suspended for one year.

She was also ordered to pay more than Â£3,000 in compensation and costs and serve 10 days of rehabilitation activity. She has been allowed to keep her dog but under strict conditions which, if broken will mean the dog will be subject to a destruction order.

The incident happened in Little Stanion in August 2019. Ladner originally denied her dog had injured the child, however an expert witness deemed the injuries to be consistent with dog bites.

Detective Constable Sharon Jephcott, who led the investigation said: "This was a terrifying incident for the child and the wider family. Being bitten by a dog is an incredibly traumatic experience, especially for a child.

"This case serves as a stark warning - we will take action to ensure justice is served for the victim and that measures are put in place to ensure there are no repeat incidents and no others are subjected to such a terrifying ordeal.

"It also shows how important it is to keep dogs under control and how seriously the courts treat incidents of this nature."
