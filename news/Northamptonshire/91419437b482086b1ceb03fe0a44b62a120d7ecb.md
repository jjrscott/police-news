Officers from Northamptonshire Police will be helping to spread some festive cheer when they deliver Christmas hampers to some of the more vulnerable members of our communities.

Members of the Neighbourhood Policing Teams will be delivering hampers to some of the residents who they have come into contact with during the past year, such as the elderly and those who live on their own.

The special deliveries started today (Wednesday, December 9), with a total of 20 hampers due to be gifted to residents across the county over the next few weeks in time for Christmas.

Officers, police staff and members of the public donated items for the Christmas Hampers, which included festive goodies, which residents may not necessarily buy for themselves, such as chocolates, cakes and mince pies.

Staff Officer to the Chief Constable, Sergeant Sharan Wildman, said: "Christmas is a particularly difficult time for some people, and the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has meant some of our residents have not seen family or friends for months.

"The Chief Constable wanted to give something back to our communities, and with the support of Age UK and our Neighbourhood Policing Teams who nominated local residents, we are hoping the hampers will bring some festive cheer."

In addition to the Christmas hampers, the Force will be donating surplus items to the Northampton Food Bank, which supports families and vulnerable members of the community in need.
