An HMICFRS report due to be published this week highlights concerns about the way Northamptonshire Police manages its demand.

In this film (three of three), Chief Constable Nick Adderley explains that although the report won't make pleasant reading, significant work has been undertaken since the HMICFRS visit back in January - particularly improvements around 999 and 101 calls and the despatch and deployment of officers.

The Force is recruiting more officers and staff and introducing a new policing model next month, with greater ownership and a better connection with the communities we serve.
