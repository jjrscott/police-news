Police in Northampton are appealing for witnesses following a burglary in Fieldmill Road, Little Billing.

The incident happened between 5pm and 6.45pm on Thursday, December 17 when two men tricked their way into the home of the victim, who is registered blind, on the pretence of needing to recover their grandson's football from his back garden.

While inside the house, one of them is believed to have stolen a bag, which contained bank cards and cash.

One of the suspects is described as in his early 60s with a slim build, grey hair and a local accent. He was wearing a light-blue mask.

The other is described as in his early 40s with a medium build, about 6ft 3in with a mild Irish accent and short, black hair. He was wearing a black fleece, black trousers, black shoes and a black face mask.

Anyone with information should call Northamptonshire Police on 101 or ring Crimestoppers, in confidence, on 0800 555111
