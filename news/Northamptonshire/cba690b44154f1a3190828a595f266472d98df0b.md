Four boys have been arrested after they were seen breaking into a property in Harrington Road, Desborough.

The incident happened at 2pm today (Tuesday, February 9) when a member of the public reported seeing a group of people breaking into the property via a window.

The boys, three aged 13 and one aged 14, quickly surrendered to officers who, together with PD Koda, had surrounded the building - there was no escape.

Neighbourhood Policing Sergeant Ken Brown, said: "This was a quick response following a call from a member of the public and I hope it reassures people that we are quick to react when a crime of this nature is reported to us.

"The four boys were returned home to their parents while we investigate this incident further and I hope they have learnt their lesson that it is not right to enter other people's homes and that we will act swiftly to pursue anyone who does so."
