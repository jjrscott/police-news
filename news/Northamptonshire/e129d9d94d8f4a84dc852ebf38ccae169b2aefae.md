A man has been arrested following the discovery of another cannabis factory in Northampton.

Officers conducted a misuse of drugs act warrant in Lower Hester Street, Semilong, at about 10:45am yesterday, Wednesday July 8. More than 300 plants worth an estimated Â£128,000 were seized by police.

One man has been arrested on suspicion of cultivating cannabis.

The warrant was carried out following information reported to the police by members of the community.

Neighbourhood Policing Sergeant Rodney Williams said: "Community intelligence is extremely important to us.

"Today was a prime example of that, it has allowed us to attend this address, discover this grow and make a successful arrest."

Anyone with any information about cannabis factories in their area can report it to Northamptonshire Police on 101, report it online at www.northatns.police.uk or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
