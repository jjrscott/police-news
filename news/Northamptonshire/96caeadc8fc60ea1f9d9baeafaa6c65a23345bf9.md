"Every day is a day of intense policing activity in Northamptonshire - our #100Days campaign simply aims to highlight some of the fantastic work that happens on a regular basis."

This is the message from Superintendent Dennis Murray as his teams secure more arrests, more charges and more good results.

One of these good results came on Monday, July 6, following the arrest of a 38-year-old man for domestic violence related offences. Detectives worked against the clock and into the night on the case to gather the relevant evidence, in the end securing four charges and a remand into custody of the suspect.

That same week, 22-year-old Reece James Fuins, of Kettering, was charged by the Burglary Team with three burglaries and one fraud offence.

An illegal car meet was also thwarted in Wellingborough and a warrant at an address in Gordon Road, Wellingborough, uncovered a small cannabis factory which was immediately dismantled.

On Monday, July 13, a man was stopped and searched in Market Place, Kettering, with 60 wraps of drugs found on his person. As a result, a 38-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs.

On Tuesday, July 14, after a series of offences where two males were targeting vulnerable and elderly people in Corby by knocking on their doors and pretending to carry out remedial work on their properties, a 20-year-old man and a 15-year-old boy were both arrested on suspicion of burglary.

Later that day, officers stopped a blue Ford Fiesta on the A6 between Finedon and Irthlingborough, uncovering a large amount of cannabis and a knife. Three men aged 22, 22 and 18, were all arrested on suspicion of possession of Class B drugs with intent to supply and possession of a bladed article.

The next day, a warrant was executed in Yarwell Court, Kettering, and a significant quantity of crack cocaine and over Â£2000 in cash were uncovered. A 36-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply in connection with the incident.

Superintendent Dennis Murray, said: "The results mentioned here are just a snapshot of what we are achieving across Northamptonshire on a daily basis.

"In the past two weeks, we've executed a total of 14 warrants in the north, seized large quantities of drugs, cash and weapons, and safeguarded a number of vulnerable people, including children.

"Every day is a day of intense policing activity in Northamptonshire - our #100Days campaign simply aims to highlight some of the fantastic work that happens here on a regular basis.

"We have absolutely no plans to slow down or take our foot off the gas and I want our communities to be reassured that we care about the issues that affect them and will continue to be relentless in our efforts to protect them, at the same time making Northamptonshire a hostile place for criminals."
