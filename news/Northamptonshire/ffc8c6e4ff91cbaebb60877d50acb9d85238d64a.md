Two of our police officers from the Force's Road Crime Team - PCs Sandra Payne and James Condon, helped deliver a baby last night following a routine traffic enquiry in Northampton.

The incident started when a car hit the Cliftonville Road camera for having no insurance.

PCs Payne and Condon stopped the car and the driver told them he'd just insured it that morning.

He then received a call from his heavily pregnant wife, telling him she had just gone into labour.

All three hotfooted it to the man's address where PCs Payne and Condon ended up delivering baby Harris.

Paramedics arrived a short time later and then took over care.

Chief Inspector Tom Thompson, said: "I would like to extend my thanks to Sandra and James whose actions last night ensured that baby Harris was delivered into this world safely.

"This is a great story and an example of how varied life as a police officer can be.

"As a Force we're really proud of how both officers managed to keep Harris' parents calm and looked after until our colleagues at East Midlands Ambulance Service arrived.

"Well done Sandra and James - this will definitely be a story baby Harris' parents will remember for a long time to come."
