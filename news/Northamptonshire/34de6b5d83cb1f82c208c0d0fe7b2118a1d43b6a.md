Police officers in Northamptonshire are issuing a warning to lorry drivers following recent thefts from parked-up trailers in Kettering.

The first incident happened between 1am and 4pm on Monday, November 30, in Kettering parkway, when a trailer unit was stolen and later recovered.

The second incident happened in Vernon Court, Kettering, between 11pm on Monday, November 30, and 8am on Tuesday, December 1, when a parked lorry had thousands of pounds worth of toys stolen from it while the driver was asleep in the cab.

Detectives investigating the thefts are appealing for anyone with any information or anyone who may have any pertinent CCTV footage to come forward and call them on 101.

They are also appealing to lorry drivers to be extra vigilant of thieves who may look to be targeting their trailers by ensuring their cabs are locked, looking out for each other in areas where lorries regularly park up to take breaks, and to report anything suspicious to police.

**Incident number:** 20000635152
