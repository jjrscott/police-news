A brand-new roads policing team has hit the streets and highways of Northamptonshire to disrupt criminals and make the county safer.

The Northamptonshire Police Road Crime Team is made up of 18 officers who are focused on denying criminals the use of the roads - disrupting county lines, targeting organised crime groups, responding to ANPR hits and executing planned, proactive operations.

The team will work alongside the Force's Safer Roads Team and the Northamptonshire Safer Roads Alliance to reduce the number of people killed or seriously injured on Northamptonshire's roads by clamping down on the 'fatal four'.

The 'fatal four' are inappropriate speed, not wearing a seatbelt, driving under the influence of drink or drugs, and using a mobile phone behind the wheel.

Detective Inspector Louise Hemingway, who leads the team, said: "The creation of this new team is a good thing for Northamptonshire because we will now have officers focusing on making the county's roads safer.

"The message to organised crime groups and criminals who use the roads to carry out their activities is simple - we are coming for you and will be relentless in our task of bringing you to justice."

Chief Superintendent Mick Stamper, Chair of the Northamptonshire Safer Roads Alliance, said: "The alliance's main priority is to reduce the number of people killed or seriously injured on Northamptonshire's roads so the creation of this team is a huge step forward in allowing us to achieve our aim.

"The team will be working alongside our two fantastic PCs and team of Specials in the Safer Roads Team and together, I'm sure we will see Northamptonshire's road become much safer as a result."

Northamptonshire Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner, Stephen Mold, said: "Northamptonshire is at the heart of the country's strategic roads network and making sure that people can travel safely in and through our county is a key priority for everyone who lives here.

"I welcome the setting up of this new team that will work to deliver our commitment to improving safety, whilst targeting people who drive anti-socially or use our roads while committing crime."
