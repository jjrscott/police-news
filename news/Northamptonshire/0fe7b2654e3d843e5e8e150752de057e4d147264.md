The Northamptonshire Police Enquiry Desk in the Guildhall, Northampton is changing venues on Saturdays only - starting on June 20.

The enquiry desk at Weston Favell Police Station is currently open Monday to Friday, between 9am and midday, and then from 1pm through to 5pm.

The same service will now also be offered on Saturdays, to help with demand with members of the public able to get advice, report an incident or traffic collision as well as enquire about property among other things.

The new arrangements have been introduced following the ongoing closure of the Northampton Guildhall on Saturdays as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The change in venues is for a trial period and will be reviewed at the end of year.
