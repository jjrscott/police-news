Wind and rain did not deter PCSO Ian Pealling from running in the virtual 2020 Virgin Money London Marathon and raising Â£300 for charity.

Along with thousands of other keen runners, Ian had to organise his own 26.2-mile course around the Southend area, on Sunday 4 October, which he completed in 4hrs 15mins, raising funds for Macmillan Cancer Support in the process.

He is pictured above in pouring rain and high winds, halfway round his chosen route at Two Tree Island, near Leigh on Sea.

Ian, a member of our Castle Point and Rochford Community Policing Team, has been a PCSO with us for 15-and-a-half years. Although he does not run as regularly as he would like, he says it helps him with both his job and with life in general.

"I've been running off and on for ages although I don't always get around to it. It's great for general wellbeing and mental wellness," he says.

"I've run a few marathons before but not for a few years and this was my first virtual marathon. I was fairly happy with my time, considering I tried to run an off-road section along Benfleet creek, which was a very bad idea. It was just water, wind and rain and no proper path.

"In fact, the whole route was very windy and wet but it was great, particularly along Southend sea front where there were a lot of runners. Most were very supportive, offering loads of encouragement to each other, and members of the public also braved the weather to cheer us all on."

Of his chosen charity, Ian adds: "We are all affected by cancer at some stage in some way. Macmillan Cancer Support does an amazing job in so many ways."
