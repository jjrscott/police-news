**We are appealing for witnesses after a man was threatened with a knife in Southend.**

The victim, aged in his 30s, reported being approached by a group of eight people aged between 15- and 25-years old at about 3pm on Thursday 18 March.

The incident happened outside Chiltern Flats, in Coleman Street.

During the altercation, two attempts were made to stab the victim with what has been described to us as a six-inch knife.

The victim managed to avoid the attack but was chased through a car park towards Sutton Road.

Thankfully he did not suffer any injuries and he was able to flag down a police officer who was on patrol in Southend.

No arrests have been made and our enquiries are ongoing.

DC Ashley Pavey, of Southend CID, said:

"I would encourage anyone who has any information on this incident to come forward and speak to my team.
"We believe there were quite a few people around at the time, some of whom were standing on balconies. They may have seen the people involved."

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has information on it should submit a report online and use the 'Live Chat' button to speak to an online operator between 7am-11pm.

You can also call us on 101 and cite incident 42/47357/21.

Information can also be given to independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
