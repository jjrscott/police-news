### Essex Police have implemented temporary changes to our firearms licencing procedures.

Due to the current Government direction around social distancing and to assist with reducing the strain on the NHS, Essex Police have implemented the following temporary changes to our firearms licencing procedures and have put the following in place:

 * **All new applications for firearm licences in Essex, including shotgun and explosive licence applications, have been temporarily suspended.**

 * **All home visits conducted by our officers have been replaced by telephone enquiries.**

 * **Where a current certificate is due to expire, a temporary permit will be issued to allow additional time for the required GP report to be obtained.**

 * **All applications will still require a completed GP report to support an application.**

Our priority remains the safety of our communities, our officers and staff, and we will continue to process renewal applications to ensure certificate holders do not fall into unlawful possession. To help us, please ensure any future renewal applications or correspondence is submitted online. You can do this by visiting:

We will continue to update the website with information where required.

We would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your continued cooperation and understanding.
