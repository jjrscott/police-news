"This joint approach leads to more crimes being solved and helps to create stronger communities who are better equipped with crime prevention measures.
"I would like to thank our partners and the communities we serve who have helped build these relationships, it is by working together we can make a difference.
"Our approach has led to dedicated teams for rural and business communities who have specialist skills and understanding, meaning they can truly make an impact and help those who need it."
