PC Simon Blaxland served in the armed forces overseas after signing up as a teenager.

Simon, who is a firearms officer, served in Northern Ireland and Bosnia in the 1990s before applying to work for Essex Police in 2000.

He initially helped with emergency response in Harlow for five years before joining our armed response where he received a commendation in 2010 for saving a woman from a burning building in Earls Colne.

On Armed Forces Day today, Saturday 27 June, Simon looked back at his experiences in the armed forces fondly.

He said: "I have an enormous sense of pride and I'm just as proud of all those who have helped keep us safe - including those who made huge sacrifices.

"I missed the comradeship when I left the army and becoming a police officer helped me get that back.

"I had to be adaptable in the army and discipline was essential and those skills have been transferable in policing."

Simon served in the Princess of Wales Royal Regiment after completing his training in Cambridgeshire.

He carried out two tours of Northern Ireland and in Bosnia with the United Nations.

"I would usually attend a remembrance service somewhere in the county," he added.

"Today I'm working and helping to keep you and the county safe."
