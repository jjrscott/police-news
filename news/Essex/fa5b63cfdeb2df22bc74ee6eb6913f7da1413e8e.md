### A man's been jailed for five and-a-half years for assaulting another man with a crowbar after he told his partner he had been cheating on her.

Ashley Budd attacked the victim in the car park of Broomfield Hospital at 7.40am on 1 December last year after driving into his car.

He used a crowbar to assault him as well as punching him several times, leaving him with a fractured nose, cheek and eye socket.

The victim had found out Budd had been sending messages to his wife, accused him of having an affair with her, and had threatened to tell Budd's partner.

Budd threatened to stab the victim if he did and, when the victim told Budd's partner, he tracked him down and attacked him.

Budd tried to get back into his car and leave the scene after the assault but was stopped by security staff.

He was arrested and a knife was also found inside his vehicle

In interview, Budd, 32, of Woodhall Road, Chelmsford, told officers the messages had been part of an elaborate ruse to make his partner jealous after they had briefly split up and that there was nothing going on with the other woman.

He was later charged and at Chelmsford Crown Court on 6 January he pleaded guilty to GBH with intent, dangerous driving, criminal damage, and possession of a blade in a public place.

At the same court on Wednesday 25 March he was jailed for five and-a-half years and banned from driving for three and-a-half years.

He has also been made subject to a restraining order.

Investigating officer Detective Sergeant Harriet Ware said: "Ashley Budd resorted to extreme violence in a bid to resolve a domestic dispute.

"He left the victim with severe injuries which may well affect him for some time to come.

"He did at least admit to his crimes meaning the victim didn't have to relive the ordeal through a trial.

"I want to thank the members of staff at the hospital who helped keep Budd at the scene while officers attended and the care provided to the victim for his injuries.

"I hope Budd uses his sentence to reflect on his actions."
