Have you seen this man?

Officers are looking to speak with him in connection with the use of counterfeit cash to buy jewellery in Great Wakering on Sunday 21 March.

It was reported that the sale of a gold Versace necklace for Â£1,500 was agreed between two parties online.

They met opposite the Co-op on High Street around 12pm and the jewellery was exchanged for cash.

Upon further inspection, it was found that the owner of the necklace had been given counterfeit notes.

The man we are looking to speak to is described as being 5ft 5in to 5ft 8in tall, white, of a slim build and in his late teens to early twenties.

He was wearing a black waterproof Adidas jacket with a grey hood, light coloured jogging bottoms, white trainers, and a black Nike beanie hat with a green tick.

He approached the location on foot walking from Great Wakering church and left the area the same way.
