### A man is due to appear in court next year to face a charge in connection with the assault of a police officer.

During the incident a police officer reported being assaulted.

Price, 39, of Gypsy Lane, Little Dunmow has now been summonsed to appear at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court on 17 March where he will face charges of assaulting an emergency worker and using threatening or abusive words or behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress.
