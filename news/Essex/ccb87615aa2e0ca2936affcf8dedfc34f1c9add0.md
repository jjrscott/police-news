The Covid-19 infection rate in Essex remains low. However, some areas of the county have seen an increase in the number of infections in the past week.

With lockdown restrictions due to ease on March 29, we must continue to stick to the Government's guidelines to protect ourselves, our families and the NHS. This means staying at home, avoiding unnecessary journeys and isolating when required to.

Any surge in cases could put unsustainable pressure on our local hospitals and lead to delays in implementing the Government's proposed timetable.

Our officers will continue to engage with people, explain the regulations and encourage them to do the right thing.

But, where reasoned conversation is not successful, we will consider enforcement action.

On Thursday 11 March, a 25-year-old man received a fixed penalty notice (FPN) after he travelled to Stansted Airport with a couple he was not in a Bubble with. His excuse? He was accompanying the driver as the journey took two hours. The same day, a 63-year-old man from Wolverhampton received a fine after he went to visit family in Colchester.

The following day, two men travelled from Somerset to Westcliff to join two friends for a birthday party. The 32-year-old organiser of the party was issued with an FPN.

If you return from a trip abroad, it's essential you quarantine for ten days after arrival. But when officers checked at the address of a 37-year-old Harlow man who'd recently arrived back in the UK, he wasn't there. The man later revealed he'd left home to help a client to jump-start a car. He received a fine.

Three men from different household were issued with FPNs on Saturday 13 March after being found in a vehicle together at a suspected car meet on a Braintree industrial estate. All had been warned previously for breaching Covid regulations.

We all miss socialising with our friends on a Saturday night but having a party is currently prohibited. Officers were called to house in Colchester where 12 people - aged from 18 to 32 - had been enjoying some drinks. Nine of the group were found hiding in cupboards and wardrobes. All were fined.

The same evening, seven people were found playing loud music and drinking in a Southend shop. A 34-year-old man and a 26-year-old woman were issued with FPNs.

And the following night in Colchester, officers discovered another party organised by a 26-year-old woman with nine guests. The woman was issued with an FPN.

How many men does it take to collect a watch? Well, according to a group who travelled together from Hertfordshire to Braintree on Saturday 13 March, it takes four. The men, aged from 20 to 28, were from different households and not wearing masks. They were all issued with FPNs. Time to pay closer attention to the Covid rules.

If you are thinking about organising a social gathering or making a non-essential journey, please reconsider, stay safe and stop the unnecessary spread of Covid-19.

We want you to continue to report Covid-19 breaches. You can report them via our website by using our digital 101 service, where you can speak to one of our operators via Live Chat, any day between 7am and 11pm.
