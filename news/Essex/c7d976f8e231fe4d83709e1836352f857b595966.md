A man has been jailed for racially abusing a mother as she walked to a fete with her two young children in Saffron Walden.

Terry Ralph, 60, of Howard de Walden Way, Newmarket, was sentenced to 30 months for racial abuse at Chelmsford Crown Court on Wednesday 17 June.

He was also sentenced for burglary and failing to provide a specimen, which took place in other counties.

Ralph received convictions for breaching a suspended and failing to appear at court and has been disqualified from driving for 61 months.

At around 2pm on Sunday 5 May 2019, a woman visited a fete with her children and husband when she was approached by Ralph, who targeted her due to her appearance.

Ralph was then confronted by the woman's husband and we arrived at the scene.

Ralph made further comments and this was captured on a body worn camera.

Ralph failed to provide a specimen for police in Newmarket on 19 August 2019 and was arrested for a burglary at Boots in Cambridge on 22 April 2020.

Investigating officer PC Daniel Ricketts, of Uttlesford's Local Policing Team, said: "Ralph targeted a woman and went out of his way to racially abuse her while she was visiting a fete with her two children and her husband.

"He has shown no remorse and he was aggressive and uncooperative when he was being questioned that day.

"He intended to cause harassment to a family who were innocently out for the day.

"Ralph has also been sent to prison for other serious offences investigated by our policing partners - where he has time to consider his actions."
