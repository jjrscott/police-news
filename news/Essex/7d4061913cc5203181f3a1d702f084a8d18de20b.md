A woman has been jailed for 12 months after admitting to dangerous driving.

Kerrianne Hibbert, 29, of Windmill Road, Bradfield, appeared at Ipswich Crown Court on Thursday 26 November, charged with driving a motor vehicle dangerously and failing to stop when required by a police officer.

On 28 May, Hibbert failed to stop when asked to by officers while on Oakley Road in Harwich. She continued to drive the car dangerously on to Main Road, putting herself and other people at considerable risk.

She pleaded guilty to the offences and was sentenced to 12 months in prison and disqualified from driving for 15 months.
