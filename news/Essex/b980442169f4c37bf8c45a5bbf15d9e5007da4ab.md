### A drug dealer caught with more than £1,500 worth of crack cocaine and heroin during a vehicle stop in Colchester has been jailed for more than two years.

Officers stopped a black VW Polo in Abbotts Road at around 2.25pm on 6 April.

The driver, 21 year-old Troyhan Coleman, was found to have no insurance and had a significant amount of money on his person and officers decided to carry out a search under the Misuse of Drugs Act.

During the search officers two mobile phones, almost £100 in cash, 34 wraps of heroin, and 121 wraps of crack cocaine.

The drugs had a total street value of £1,550.

During our investigation it was established Coleman had messages on his phone further indicating he was heavily involved in the supply of Class A drugs.

Coleman, of Lawn Terrace, London SE3, was charged with two counts of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs.

He admitted these charges and, at Ipswich Crown Court on 21 May was jailed for two years and 10 months.

Investigating officer PC Richard Philipsen, from the Op Raptor North team, said: "The drugs found on Troyhan Coleman were destined for the streets of Colchester, infecting our communities, causing misery.

"We've put another drug dealer behind bars and prevented Class A drugs from infecting our communities, causing misery.

"We're out every day targeting those intent on causing harm to you and the people you care about and protecting and serving Essex."
