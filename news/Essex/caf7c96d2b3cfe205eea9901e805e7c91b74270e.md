**Essex Police Chief Constable Ben-Julian Harrington has thanked Essex residents for uniting to keep each other safe during the coronavirus pandemic.**

New figures released today (Wednesday 23 December 2020) by the force show that:

 * Between 27 October and 22 December, officers had nearly 11,000 engagements with the public about the coronavirus restrictions.
 * Of these, 136 resulted in fixed penalty notices being issued.

 * In addition, the force has accompanied local authorities on 191 licensing visits.

 * Over the same period, 22 unlicensed music events have been shut down or prevented altogether.

 * Sound equipment has been seized, and on one occasion organisers had attempted to install card payment machines to profit from the unsafe and unlawful gatherings.

**Chief Constable BJ Harrington said:**

"The vast majority of people I have met, and my officers have met, have done what has been asked of them and followed the Government's COVID-19 regulations. I want to thank every single person who is doing the right thing and staying safe.
"Your support means we can spend more time tackling criminals. That's what we want to do, and we know that's what the people of Essex want too.
"Over the last year, we have targeted organised crime gangs and seized millions of pounds worth of drugs and cash.
"We have taken action against criminals who prey on vulnerable people and children, and have protected victims of domestic abuse, criminal and sexual exploitation and modern slavery.
"I'm proud of what our officers have done to keep the county safe."

Essex Police officers will be on patrol as usual over Christmas and the New Year. They will be joined by officers from the 517-strong Special Constabulary. In 2020, these volunteers gave a total of more than 195,000 hours of their time to keep the county safe during one of the most challenging years in living memory.

**The Chief Constable said:**

"Please stay safe, and from the Essex Police family to your family, I would like to wish everyone a Happy Christmas."
