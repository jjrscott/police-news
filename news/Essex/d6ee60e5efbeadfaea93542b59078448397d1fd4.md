A 24-year-old man from Kent has been sentenced to 15 months in prison after he was convicted of committing two burglaries in the Epping Forest district earlier this year.

Kayne Christian, of Speke Road, appeared at Chelmsford Crown Court on Wednesday 28 October, charged with two counts of burglary at addresses in Theydon Bois and North Weald on 16 January.

He was found guilty of both offences and was sentenced to 15 months in prison for each offence, to run concurrently.
