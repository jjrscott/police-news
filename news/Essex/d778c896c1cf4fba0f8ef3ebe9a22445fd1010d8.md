Luke Smith, 27, of Windsor Road, West Mersea, received 16 months at Chelmsford Crown Court on Tuesday 11 August. He entered a guilty plea for two counts of assault on an emergency worker, criminal damage, breach of harassment order and possession of a Class B drug.

We were called to a disturbance in Catchpool Road, Colchester, on Wednesday 25 March.
Smith was detained and found to be in possession of cannabis, when he was arrested.

Upon arrest he began to cough on the two officers while shouting he had Coronavirus. It was unknown at the time if this was true, officer took the appropriate precautions in line with force and national guidance.

During interview he admitted that he only said this because he thought it would mean the officers would release him from custody.

DS Matthew Alexander said "Covid-19 has caused a lot of harm and families have lost loved ones. For it to be used as a weapon and a threat towards police officers is deplorable.

"Threats such as these will not deter us, the officers involved have since continued to help protect those who live, work or visit Essex.

"We will take swift action against anyone looking to assault our officers whilst they work to protect our communities and maintain a visible police presence".
