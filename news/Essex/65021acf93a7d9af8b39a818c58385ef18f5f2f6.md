### A woman who conned elderly and vulnerable people out money is due to be sentenced next month after admitting fraud offences.

On several occasions in July and August this year, 38 year-old Nicola Collins had stopped people in Rayleigh and Rochford claiming her car had broken down and asking them for money for petrol.

Many of the people Collins stopped were elderly or vulnerable.

Officers in Rayleigh investigated seven reports of this behaviour and Collins, of Lundy Close, Southend, was arrested on 10 September.

She was later charged with seven counts of fraud by false representation and eight counts of breaching a criminal behaviour order (CBO).

She pleaded guilty to these charges at Basildon Magistrates' Court on 6 October and is due to be sentenced at Southend Magistrates' Court on 11 November.

Investigating officer PC Leigh Stevenson said: "I am absolutely delighted that this individual has been caught and convicted.

"Targeting the vulnerable and elderly is despicable and Nicola Collins preyed on their charity and good nature.

"Our priority is to protect people and keep vulnerable people safe from crime and Collins' conviction will no doubt do that."
