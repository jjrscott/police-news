Detectives are investigating after it was reported a teenage girl was sexually assaulted in Leigh on Thursday 6 August.

It was reported that a 16-year-old girl was walking through Blenheim Park around 10.30pm, when she was approached by a man asking for the time.

He became aggressive towards her before grabbing and sexually assaulting her.
The man was described as white, aged between 30 and 40 years and was of a large, muscly build. He had cropped white hair and a long full white beard and was wearing a red polo shirt and jeans.

**Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Chief Inspector, Scott Egerton said:**

"We believe there may have been a group of people in the nearby park when this is reported to have happened and we ask them to please contact us if they saw or heard anything unusual or suspicious.
"Thankfully incidents like this are rare and the victim bravely fought off the man and got herself to safety.
"She is now being supported by our specialist officers.

"Officers have been and will be continuing to patrol the area, so if you have any information or concerns, please come and speak to us."
