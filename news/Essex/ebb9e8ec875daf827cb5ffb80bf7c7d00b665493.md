Six men have been arrested as part of an investigation into fraudsters targeting elderly victims.

We are investigating a number of incidents in which victims aged in their 70s to 90s have been called by suspects claiming to be from Barclays Bank.

In each case, they have claimed a courier needs to go to their house to exchange their bank card for a new one.

We are investigating a number of offences in the Colchester, Brightlingsea, Tiptree, and Kelvedon areas.

We are also looking into whether similar crimes in south Essex and Suffolk might be connected.

All have been committed in the last two months.

Two 23-year-old men from Barking and Dagenham, a 25-year-old man from West Ham and an 18-year-old man from Croydon were arrested on Tuesday 14 April on suspicion of committing fraud by false representation.

They were released on bail until Monday 5 May while we continue our enquiries.
However two of those men, a 25-year-old from West Ham and 23-year-old from Dagenham, were re-arrested yesterday, Thursday 23 April.

Both men remain in custody for questioning alongside two 22-year-old men from Walthamstow and Ilford.

All being detained on suspicion of fraud by false representation following another two incidents in which women aged in their 90s were targeted in Frinton and Kirby Cross yesterday.

DC Hollie Hughes, of Clacton CID, said: "We are continuing to carry out enquiries into these incidents and ask anyone with information to please contact us.

"Fraudsters will take advantage of any situation and will be very persuasive, so I ask people to please remain vigilant.

"Your bank will never ask you send your bank cards, money or other personal property, via a courier, taxi or other means.

"They will also never ask for your bank account details or PIN over the phone, so please don't disclose these to anyone.

"Challenge anyone who asks you for this - a genuine caller will not mind. If you are suspicious the caller is not genuine, end the phone call. Wait at least five minutes to ring your bank to check with them the validity of the call, or use another phone, as fraudsters can wait on the line.

"Report any suspicious calls to us so we can investigate."
