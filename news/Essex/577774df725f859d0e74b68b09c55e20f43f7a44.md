### Detectives investigating an attempted assault in Lawford, Manningtree, are appealing for witnesses.

At around 7.15pm on Saturday 26 September, a man in his 20s was crossing Clacton Road near to the junction with Long Road, when fireworks, which are thought to have been thrown from a passing vehicle, exploded near him.

Thankfully the man was not seriously injured, but he did suffered minor injury to his ears.

Detectives believe the vehicle was travelling from Lawford towards Tendring and we would like anyone who was on the road around this time and has dash cam footage to get in contact with us.

We're also keen to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident.

Please report any information on our website here .

Information can also be reported anonymously through independent charity Crimestoppers.

**Please reference incident 42/156198/20 when providing information to make sure it gets to the right officer as soon as possible.**
