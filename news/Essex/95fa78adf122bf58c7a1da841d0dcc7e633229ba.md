Two people have been arrested as part of an ongoing investigation into the supply of illegal substance, Spice, into prisons.

Officers from Operation Raptor, our specialist teams targeting and dismantling drugs gangs, executed a warrant at an address off Mason Way, Waltham Abbey, yesterday, Wednesday 3 March.

A 42-year-old man from Waltham Abbey was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in supplying a controlled drug.

A 71-year-old woman from Camberwell in London was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply drugs.

Both have been released under investigation while we continue our enquiries.

Detective Inspector Scott Fitzmaurice said: "These arrests are part of an ongoing investigation into the supply of class B drug Spice into prisons across the country.

"In yesterday's operation, we seized psychoactive substances with a street value of up to £57,000 and about £24,000 in cash.

"We began our investigation last year after being notified by prison authorities, who have been working closely with us.

"The substances are believed to have been disguised and sent through the post and our enquiries remain ongoing."
