A drug dealer who was caught in the act has been jailed for two-and-a-half years.

Officers from the Basildon Operation Raptor team spotted Tendekai Chirinda in an uninsured car in Academy Drive, Laindon, on 12 November last year.

A woman was seen to approach him then leave. He then drove off, and suspecting a deal had taken place, the officers followed him to Broadmayne, where they carried out a stop search.

Chirinda initially gave a false name, and was arrested and taken into custody, where he was searched.

He had hidden a parcel of individual wraps of crack cocaine and heroin between his buttocks.

The drugs had a street value of £340.

He refused to answer questions during the police interview, but said the drugs were for his own personal use and claimed to have bought them from the woman in Academy Drive.

But phone logs also linked Chirinda to the earlier drug deal and other drug dealing.

The 34-year-old of no fixed address was charged with two counts of possession with intent to supply crack cocaine and heroin.

He admitted the offences at Basildon Crown Court on Tuesday 7 July and was jailed for 30 months and ordered to pay £180 victim surcharge.

The drugs will be destroyed.
