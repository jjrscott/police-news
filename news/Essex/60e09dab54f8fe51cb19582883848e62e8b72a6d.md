### A man who robbed a woman at knife point is off our streets after being jailed for nine years.

Edward Diorgu had arranged to meet the victim at an address in Harlow on 19 May last year.

Shortly after he arrived, at around 9.20pm, he pulled a knife out of his coat, threatened the victim and demanded she hand over money.

Diorgu then searched through wardrobes and handbags looking for money, taking Â£500.

Despite this, he continued to demand she handover cash but after being told she had nothing else, he left.

When we went to the address to investigate, we discovered Diorgu's fingerprints on a bag and on wardrobe doors.

He always also identified through phone work and picked out by the victim during a formal identification process.

Diorgu, 25, of Risley Avenue, London N17, was arrested in September last year.

He was later charged with robbery and possession of a bladed article and was found guilty following a trial at Chelmsford Crown Court on 11 March.

At the same court on Friday (9 October) he was jailed for a total of nine years.

Investigating officer Detective Constable Alana McCreath, from Harlow CID, said: "Edward Diorgu subject the victim to a terrifying ordeal, threatening her with a knife.

"He attended the address armed and intent of robbing her, giving little thought to her wellbeing.

"Diorgu is clearly a dangerous man who will spend the foreseeable future behind bars.

"Essex is a safer place with him there and I hope this sentencing will help the victim move forward."
