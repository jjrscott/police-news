Our Special Constabulary continually work with our communities to help people, keep them safe and catch criminals.

Recently 14 of our Special Constables spent time with our rural communities offering advice to residents on steps they can take to prevent becoming a victim of burglary.

Working alongside our Rural Engagement Team, our Specials spent time in Tiptree, Layer de la Haye, Birch, Abberton, Dedham, Great Horksley, West Bergholt, Fordham and Eight Ash Green.

While patrolling the areas, officers spoke to residents about what they can do to secure their property, protect it from opportunist criminals, helping to prevent becoming a victim of burglary.

They also spent time in areas where burglaries had recently been reported, with high visibility patrols from uniformed officers to deter potential criminals.

You can find advice on steps you can take to help secure your belongings, protect yourself and prevent becoming a victim of crime on our crime prevention advice pages.
