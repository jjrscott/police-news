**Detectives investigating the death of a man in Harlow are appealing for information.**

We were called around 7.15am on Thursday 12 November, with concerns for the welfare of a man on Eastgate.

Officers went to check on the man, but sadly he had died.

His death is not being treated as suspicious, but is unexplained and detectives are appealing for information to help establish how he died.

If you were in the area of Eastgate the evening of Wednesday 11 November or during the early hours of Thursday 12 November and witnessed any unusual or suspicious activity, please get in contact.

If you have any information, please go to our website home page.

Between 7am-11pm you can provide information directly to one of our online operators by selecting the 'Live Chat' button at the bottom right of the page.

This will ensure your report is dealt with as quickly as possible.

Alternatively, you can submit an online report or call 101.

Information can also be given to independent charity Crimestoppers completely anonymously.

**Please quote reference 129 of 12 November** when providing any information, to ensure any information gets to the correct person as quickly as possible.
