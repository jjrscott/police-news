**Officers investigating a road traffic collision in Newport, Uttlesford, are appealing for witnesses and dash cam footage.**

We were alerted at around 11.20pm on Wednesday 7 October with reports that green Volkswagen Bora had spun out on London Road and then flipped onto its roof.

Officers attended but upon arrival the driver had left the scene.

A 27-year-old man from Saffron Walden was later arrested on suspicion of drug driving and released under investigation as enquiries continue.

We're keen to hear from anyone who was in the area around this time and witnessed the incident or has dash cam footage including the moments before or after the collision.

If you have any information, please go to our website home page and select the **'Live Chat'** button at the bottom right of the page. Here, between 7am-11pm, you will be able to provide information by speaking to one of our online operators to ensure your report is dealt with as quickly as possible.

Alternatively, you can make an online report or call 101.

Information can also be given to independent charity Crimestoppers completely anonymously.

**Please reference 42/MZ/20937/20 when providing any information** to ensure it gets to the investigating officer as quickly as possible.
