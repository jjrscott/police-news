A driver caught speeding at 141mph has been given a driving ban and ordered to pay £605.

Joshua Freedman, 30, was caught on camera driving the Mercedes at more than double the national speed limit on the M11 in Harlow on 16 April.

Freedman, of The Avenue, Dunmow, admitted speeding when he appeared at Southend Magistrates' Court on Thursday 15 October.

He was banned from driving for 56 days, fined £450 and ordered to pay £110 court costs and a £45 victim surcharge.

Adam Pipe, head of roads policing, said: "At the time of this offence, our roads were less busy as people were staying at home to help reduce the spread of coronavirus to help keep each other safe and protect the NHS.

"But speed limits exist for a reason - to keep people safe.

"Driving at 141mph is extremely reckless and endangers lives, no matter how quiet the M11 may or may not have been.

"This sentence shows just how serious the courts take these offences.

"It is just extremely fortunate that Freedman's driving didn't lead to himself or anyone else being hurt, or even killed."

In 2019, 17 people died and 241 others were seriously injured on Essex's roads in collisions where an inappropriate speed was involved.

In total there were 684 collisions involving an inappropriate speed where someone was injured - that's almost a quarter of all recorded collisions.

Please don't take the risk.
