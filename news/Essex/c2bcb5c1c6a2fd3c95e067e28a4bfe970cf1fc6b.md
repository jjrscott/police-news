### A man who headbutted one police officer and then spat at them has been jailed.

Ben Westbrook had been arrested for an unrelated matter at his home address in North Avenue, Southend in the early hours of 10 April when he became obstructive to officers escorting him to a police car.

As he was being led to the car he headbutted one officer who then further arrested him.

As the officer continued to escort the 35 year-old to the awaiting police car, Westbrook spat at him.

Fortunately the officer was not injured.

He was charged with common assault and assaulting an emergency worker.

He pleaded guilty to those charges at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court on 11 April and was jailed for a total of nine months.

Investigating officer Detective Constable Jonathan Wilson said: "Police Officers continue, as do all emergency workers, to put their lives at risk to ensure the safety of the public and assaults such as this will not be tolerated in any circumstances, but particularly in the current climate.

"The officer involved attended this incident following reports of concern for a member of the public, putting his own safety to the back of his mind.

"Westbrook failed to take any heed of the current climate and was dealt with accordingly.

"Hopefully this will serve as a timely reminder that, more than ever, no assault on any emergency worker is ever acceptable."
