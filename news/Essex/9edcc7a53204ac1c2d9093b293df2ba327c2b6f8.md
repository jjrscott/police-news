We were called shortly after 2.40pm with reports that a black Ford Kuga and a white Ford Transit van had been in collision on the road.

A man aged in his 50s and woman, who were in the van, have been taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries.

The Ford Kuga driver, a woman in her 20s, is also being treated for injuries, considered to be life threatening.

A baby, who was also in the car at the time of the collision, has been taken to hospital as a precautionary measure.

The road will remain closed for some time and road users are asked to avoid the area where possible and to expect delays.

investigators would like to hear from anyone who saw the collision, particularly those with dash cam footage.
