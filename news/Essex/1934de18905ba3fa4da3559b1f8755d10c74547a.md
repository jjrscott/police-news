Two men have been jailed after exchanging a gun in a car park.

Jake Mitchell and Billy Parsley (pictured above left to right) were seen exchanging the weapon in Bromley Road, Colchester, on 12 October 2019.

Parsley then left in a BMW, which was driven by another person.
Mitchell was arrested soon afterwards, and officers searched his Mercedes.

Inside were a double barrelled shotgun, which had been shortened, and a cut down bolt action rifle.

The loaded shotgun was identified as the item he'd been handed by Parsley. The rifle was believed to have already been in the car, along with a bag of ammunition.

A further gun, a revolver, was found at his home in Egret Crescent.

The following day, Parsley was arrested in Hesper Road, Colchester.

Mitchell, 27, of Egret Crescent, Colchester, pleaded guilty to three counts of a possession of a firearm and Parsley, 24, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty to transferring a firearm at Chelmsford Crown Court on 18 November last year.

They were sentenced yesterday, Wednesday 24 March.

Mitchell was jailed for a total of seven years and two months and Parsley was jailed for five years and three months.

Detective Chief Inspector Steve Nelson said:

"The potential harm these weapons could have caused does not bear thinking about, and there can be no doubt that Mitchell and Parsley were well aware of the potential consequences.
"Fortunately few people will ever be affected by gun crime, but we are working tirelessly to keep it that way, by taking weapons off our streets and putting criminals before the courts."
