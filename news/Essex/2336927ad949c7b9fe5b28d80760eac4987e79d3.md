**Quick acting officers have recovered a vehicle 17 minutes after it was reported stolen.**

We received a call at 2.25am on 30 March with reports a silver Ford S-Max had been stolen from an address in Burns Crescent.

Officers were able to trace the vehicle and stop it on the A12 near Gallows Corner.

The vehicle wasn't damaged and has now been released back to its owner.

A man was arrested.
