**Thank you for doing your bit to protect the NHS and save lives**

Tonight, Thursday 7 January, as our county claps for our heroes, Essex Police Chief Constable Ben-Julian Harrington thanks everyone who is staying home and staying safe.

By doing that and allowing our officers, staff and volunteers to continue to help people, keep you safe and catch criminals, we are all doing our bit to protect the NHS and save lives.

Thank you.
