### One of our officers has helped resuscitate a woman who had gone into cardiac arrest while out hiking in Uttlesford.

A woman in her 70s had had a cardiac arrest while out on Sunday (22 March).

PC Adam Manly and a colleague were five minutes away from where the woman was and were the first on scene. He immediately started performing CPR.

While his colleague helped to manage a growing crowd of onlookers ensuring the woman's dignity and supporting her husband who was with her, PC Manly continued to give her CPR until a paramedic arrived on the scene about 15 minutes later assisted by another officer who had attended.

When paramedics arrived with equipment they continued to work on the woman and were able to get a heartbeat and used a ventilator to help the woman breath before she was able to then breath on her own.

Getting her into a stable condition, she was then taken to hospital.

PC Manly says he had never actually had to perform CPR before: "I'd never given CPR before and turning up to the scene first, with her husband sitting next to us on the floor, was pretty daunting.

"But as soon as we were there, our training just kicked in and we focussed on what we had to do to try and save the woman's life while maintaining her dignity and supporting her husband.

"When the paramedics get her heart beating and then able to breath on her own, I was really relieved. I was pleased there was a chance she was going to be ok and we had played a part in that.

"A huge part of our job is to help people in their moment of greatest need. We're out across Essex every day protecting and serving Essex."
