### We are now in a position to name a man who died following a shooting in Roydon last weekend.

Robert Powell who was aged 50, was murdered when he was shot multiple times from a car on Water Lane on Saturday 13 June.

He was taken to hospital, but sadly, died from his injuries the following day, Sunday 14 June.

Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Chief Inspector Stephen Jennings, who is leading on the murder investigation said: "First and foremost, our thoughts go to Robert's family and friends.

"This is undoubtedly a very difficult time and I would like to reassure them that we are doing everything we can to find those responsible.

"We have made good progress in this investigation and now believe this was a targeted attack."

"We still need anyone with information about what happened to Robert to come forward" added Detective Chief Inspector Jennings.

"If you saw or heard anyone in the area in the moments before or after the incident, or have any CCTV or dash cam footage, please get in contact with the team.

"It doesn't matter how small or insignificant you think it is, it could be vital to our investigation."

Anyone with information about the incident are asked to go our UK Police Major Incident Public Reporting site: https://mipp.police.uk/operation/4201020120P42-PO1.
