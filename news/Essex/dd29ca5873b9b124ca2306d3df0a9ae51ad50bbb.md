Essex Police is growing at its fastest rate in four years - have you got what it takes to help us protect and serve the people of our county?

Our officer numbers are at a four-year high and so far since January 1, 2020 alone we have received 1,210 applications from candidates wanting to join us as a police constable.

We are on track to have 3,369 officers by March 2021. This includes 135 officers who we are able to recruit and train supported by the Government's national police uplift programme.

Between January and December 2019, we received 2,439 applications for police constables - a 44% increase on the previous year.

Deputy Chief Constable Pippa Mills said: "We are on track to be the largest and strongest we've ever been and are proud that so many brave and talented people want to join us to protect and serve Essex, helping people, keeping people safe and catching criminals.

"Now more than ever, we are visible and accessible to the communities we serve, with our new Town Centre Teams and expanded Rural Engagement Team and Business Crime Unit.

"We have invested in our investigative capabilities in areas such as tackling serious violent crime and domestic abuse, and continue to focus on the issues that can cause the greatest harm

"We are proud to have such a strong team of officers and staff who are dedicated to making a difference.

"Being a police officer is a job like no other and we have some great opportunities for those who Fit the Bill and want to help make that difference."

We have opportunities for people who feel they would #FitTheBill as a uniformed officer or detective.
