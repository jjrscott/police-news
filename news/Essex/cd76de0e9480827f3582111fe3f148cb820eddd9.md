### A man has admitted causing a fatal collision in Chelmsford which claimed the life of an elderly woman.

Lewis Barber, 33, of Ongar Road, Stondon Massey, appeared at Chelmsford Crown Court on Monday 30 November where he admitted causing death by careless driving.

Barber was the driver of a skip lorry on 19 June last year at Pentland Avenue when he hit the woman near to the Tesco Express and KFC as she crossed the road.

The woman, who was in her 80s, was initially taken to hospital but, sadly, later died of injuries.

Barber is due to be sentenced at Chelmsford Crown Court on 8 January 2021.
