### A man has admitted deliberately starting a fire at a pub in Buckhurst Hill.

We were called to reports of a fire at the Three Colts in Princes Road at around 4.50pm on Saturday 6 February.

No-one was injured.

Spiros Schulz, 48, of Eleven Acre Rise, Loughton was arrested and later charged with arson being reckless as to whether life is endangered, arson with intent to endanger life, and breaching a restraining order.

Appearing at Colchester Magistrates' Court on Monday 8 March he admitted arson being reckless as to whether life is endangered and breach of a restraining order.

He pleaded not guilty to arson with intent to endanger life and that offence will lie on file.

He is due to be sentenced at Chelmsford Crown Court on 19 April.
