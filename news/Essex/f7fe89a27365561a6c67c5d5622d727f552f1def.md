Another drug dealer has been jailed following an investigation by our specialist officers targeting drugs gangs.

Officers from Op Raptor South spotted a suspected drug deal taking place while they were on patrol in Mellow Purgess Close, Laindon, on 8 January this year.

They identified the dealer as Jerome Lee and he was arrested a few hours later.
A search was carried out an address linked to him.

In his bedroom, officers found knives, drugs, Â£412.85 in cash, and mobile phones and phone number lists believed to be linked to drug dealing.

The 23-year-old, of Mellow Purgess Close, was charged with possession with intent to supply heroin and crack cocaine, and possession of cocaine and cannabis.

He admitted the four offences at Basildon Crown Court on 10 February.

He was jailed for five years and eight months on Wednesday 22 July.

PC Dan Onley said: "Every day we're targeting dealers like Lee who make money off the back of other people's vulnerability.

"We are committed to ensuring they are put before the courts and drugs are taken off the streets so they cannot cause harm in our communities.

"This lengthy jail term reflects the seriousness of Lee's crimes and will give him ample opportunity to consider if this lifestyle is really worth it.

"There is no long term future to be had in dealing drugs, and those involved will only ever be looking over their shoulder, because not only will the police be watching them, but so will rival criminals."
