Three people have been charged and put before court as part of an investigation into drug dealing in the Brentwood area.

Officers carried out warrants under the Misuse of Drugs Act on 2 June at addresses in Whittington Road and Tillingham Bold in Hutton, and Boleyn Gardens in Brentwood.

It was part of Operation Sceptre, our ongoing work to tackle serious violence including knife and drugs-related crime.

Following the warrant at Boleyn Gardens, Brentwood, three people were arrested and charged with drugs offences.

Delvin Hemmings, 34, of Boleyn Gardens, Brentwood, and Jack Sleet, 20, of Rowhedge, Brentwood, were both charged with being concerned in supplying cocaine and ketamine.

Elle Stubley, 21, of Boleyn Gardens, Brentwood, was charged with being concerned in supplying cocaine and ketamine, and possession of cocaine.

All three are due to appear via video link at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court today, Wednesday 3 June.

At Whittington Road, two men aged 31 of no fixed address, and 46 from Hutton, were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in supplying a controlled drug.

A 29-year-old man from the Isle of Dogs, London, was arrested in Tillingham Bold on suspicion of the same offence.

All three have been released under investigation while we continue our enquiries.
