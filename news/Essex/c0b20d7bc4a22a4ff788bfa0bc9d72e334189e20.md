### Officers are investigating after reports that fireworks had been thrown onto the forecourt of shops in the area.

On both Saturday 19 and Saturday 26 September at around 7.30pm, fireworks, which were alight, were thrown from a moving car onto the forecourt of shops on Harwich Road and The Street.

The fireworks exploded, but thankfully no one reported being hurt and no damage has been caused.

"We're appealing for anyone who witnesses either of the incidents or has any information about who is responsible to get in contact with us" said PC Sam Harris from the Clacton Community Policing Team.
"Thankfully no one was hurt but we need to make sure that this doesn't happen again.
"We also want to find those responsible so that we can hold them accountable for their actions."
