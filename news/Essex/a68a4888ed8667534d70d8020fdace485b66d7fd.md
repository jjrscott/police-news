A man accused of killing a man in Colchester on Boxing Day 21 years ago has been found not guilty of murder.

Michael Donnelly, now 73, of Bromley Road, Colchester was accused of fatally stabbing Grant Byrom (pictured above) in Forest Road, Greenstead, Colchester, on 26 December 1998.

Mr Byrom, known as "Granny" to his friends, died from multiple stab wounds.

The court heard Donnelly, who fled the country and remained abroad for 21 years, admitted being present at the time of the murder but denied being responsible for Mr Byrom's death.

Following a trial at Chelmsford Crown Court, a jury today, Friday 28 July, found Donnelly not guilty of murder.
