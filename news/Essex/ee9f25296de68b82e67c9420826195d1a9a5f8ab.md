### Since September 2020, Essex Police has been running a recruitment campaign which has attracted record numbers of men and women from diverse backgrounds to join a fast-growing force.

The We Value Difference campaign has led to 1,295 people applying for a job as an Essex Police officer(*), of whom a record proportion (202) are from a black, Asian or minority ethnic background.

In addition, the campaign has attracted 486 women to apply to join in recent months.

In some online videos, actors were used to stand-in for photo and video images.

This was done so that Officers could focus on catching criminals, which is what they want to do and what the people of Essex expect.

In addition to the online videos, 50 Officers from all backgrounds took a moment to do a quick selfie to complement the campaign videos and to explain what the job is like.

Essex Police values everyone's views, and values the things that make us different whether it's gender, ethnicity, sexuality or our outlook on life.

If you know someone who wants to join an organisation that values difference, and which puts protecting and serving our communities above all else, then please go to our website and apply today.

Recent examples of the work that we are doing to protect and serve the county can be found here.

(*) Period covered: September 2020 to January 2021. This compares to 99 applications from people from a black, Asian or minority ethnic background, and 381 applications from women during the same period the previous year.
