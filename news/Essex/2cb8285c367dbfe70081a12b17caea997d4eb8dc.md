A drug dealer has been sentenced in court after officers seized nearly £15,000 and a large quantity of herbal cannabis.

Officers went to Nathan Poole's home in Trenchard Crescent, Chelmsford, for an unrelated matter on 26 March this year and could immediately smell cannabis.

They found bags of cannabis, scales, deal bags, several mobile phones and £14,810 in bank notes.

The drugs had a street value of about £30,440.

Poole, 25, was arrested and later charged with possession with intent to supply to cannabis.

He admitted the offence at Chelmsford Crown Court on 28 April and was sentenced on 18 May to a two-year jail term suspended for two years. He must complete 300 hours of unpaid work and was made subject of a 12-month supervision order.

The drugs and mobile phones were seized and will be destroyed.

An application is being made under the Proceeds of Crime Act and a hearing is due to take place sometime from 14 September.

Detective Inspector Steve Nelson said: "The drugs supply chain is closely linked to the exploitation of vulnerable people and the use of violence to manipulate and control.

"Our officers work hard every day to target dealers and ensure they are not profiting from the misery they cause to the most vulnerable people in our communities."
