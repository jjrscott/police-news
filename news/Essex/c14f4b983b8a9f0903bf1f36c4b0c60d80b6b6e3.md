This December, our Special Constabulary is getting in the festive spirit by running an online advent calendar.

Each day we're going to reveal a volunteer police officer and their story.

The aim of the calendar is to wish you a happy and safe Christmas while sharing our volunteering opportunities available to you within Essex Police. You will hear about a full-time primary school teachers who uses her volunteering experience to help with her day job, Specials who have volunteered since before the millennium, volunteer detectives who lock away the most serious offenders and other volunteer police officers who help protect Essex.

The advent calendar can be found on our social media accounts from Sunday 1, December:

Specials are volunteer police officers who have the same equipment, powers and passion as regular officers but sacrifice their time for free.

Essex Police's Special Constabulary is the fastest growing Special Constabulary and the second largest in the country, with more than 500 serving Specials.
