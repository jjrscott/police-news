The Business Crime Team will be launching later this year and the Essex Chambers of Commerce has assisted in selecting its officers.

Crimes against businesses in Essex accounts for 17-20% of crime reported annually. This ranges from shoplifting and criminal damage to fraud and cybercrime.

The team will be focused on issues that affect local business owners and their employees such as theft, staff safety and fraud. Working with them to encourage increased reporting, improve crime prevention and to help make our communities a safer place where business can thrive.

They will be working alongside the Town Centre Teams who work with local town centre business and the Rural Engagement Team who work with the rural and farming businesses within Essex.

The team led by Chief Inspector Terry Balding will comprise of two police constables, a sergeant and an analyst, all of whom are current serving officers and will bring their skills and knowledge with them.

The CEO of Essex Chamber of Commerce Denise Rossiter was invited to sit on the interview panel for the new candidates. When asked about the team she said:" Last year we saw the introduction of 23 Town Centre Teams which have made a huge difference to our County, so naturally I am delighted that at a dedicated Business Crime team will be operational soon, to help Businesses operate in a safer environment'.

When speaking about the selection process Chief Inspector Terry Balding added: "The partnership between officers and the communities we serve is vital in our fight against crime.

"We asked Denise to sit on the interview panel as we knew she would bring with her a wealth of knowledge and insight from a business's point of view.

"I look forward to leading this new team and working with local business and our partners.

Sergeant Terry Jacobs (pictured), who will be joining the team said: "I'm really looking forward to be a part of the new team and can't wait to start working with partners to support our local businesses, to helping to tackle and prevent the issues they face."
