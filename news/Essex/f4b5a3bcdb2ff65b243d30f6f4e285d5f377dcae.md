### A paedophile who admitted a string of sexual offences over course of more than 40 years has been jailed.

A paedophile who admitted a string of sexual offences over course of more than 40 years has been jailed.

Colin Disney abused children seven children between 1972 and 2016.

His offences came to light when an assault was reported to us in June 2017.

After being interviewed and charged he admitted 17 offences, including indecent assault, sexual touching, and gross indecency on girls under the age of 14 at Basildon Crown Court on 20 January.

At the same court yesterday (Wednesday 16 December) the 69 year-old, formerly of Stambridge Road, Rochford, was jailed for 11 years and 10 months with a further five years on extended licence.

Stuart Smith, Non-Recent Child Abuse Team Manager, said: "Colin Disney is a dangerous and prolific sexual predator who abused children for more than four decades.

"His crimes are abhorrent and will have had a lasting impact on his victims.

"He will now spend the foreseeable future in prison and Essex is safer place for that.

"No sentence will ever make up for what Disney subjected his victims too but I hope that his sentence will represent justice to them and help them move forward.

"I hope this case shows that it is never too late to get justice and if you report an offence to Essex Police it will be investigated."
