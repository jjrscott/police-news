A reminder to check emails carefully following a ransomware attack.

We are reminding companies in Essex to ensure staff are careful while checking their emails following a ransomware attack.

We received a report from a company in Hatfield Peverel on Saturday 11 December that they had been targeted in an attack, which restricted the company's access to their servers.

We believe that a virus case into the business through what would at first appear to be a genuine email with attachments.

The attack is only made possible if a link or an attachment is opened or clicked.
We believe it is a new strain of ransomware that is not picked up on most common anti-virus programmes used - meaning people should be vigilant with emails.

"The company involved was a small business enterprise and this attack restricted access to their servers.

"Fortunately, they were able to use backup servers to reduce the impact of the attack.

"We suspect that the virus came into the company through an authentic looking email with attachments.

"By taking simple steps, there are many ways you can deter fraudsters.

"Make sure you have reliable security systems in place, remind staff to take five and check the authenticity of emails and links.

"And please, back up your data and install the latest software and app updates on your devices."

You can report fraud by calling 101 or reporting information online by visiting www.essex.police.uk

You can also report fraud to Action Fraud by calling 0300 123 2040 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
