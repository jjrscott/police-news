Officers dedicated the equivalent to an extra four days to a week of action targeting criminals involved in drugs and knife crime.

Officers in Chelmsford and Maldon carried out patrols, stop searches and executed warrants between 11 to 17 May under Operation Overwatch.

They dedicated more than 100 extra hours, made 15 arrests and carried out three warrants under the Misuse of Drugs Act.

PC Lily Erskine said: "These results were part of our ongoing work to target criminals involved in knife crime, drugs activity and gangs.

"The vast majority of residents will fortunately never be affected by this type of crime.

"But drugs crime is closely associated with violence, exploitation of vulnerable people and other crimes such as burglary and burglary.

"Information from the public is really important as it helps us gather evidence to target offenders. I want to thank the community for their ongoing support and ask them to please keep reporting any incidents to us."

The week of action was part of Operation Sceptre, our ongoing work to tackle serious violent crime including knife and drug-related crime.

If you know of someone who you think is being exploited by drug dealers, or you have any information which might help us prevent and detect crime, or protect vulnerable people, call us on 101.

Alternatively, contact the Crimestoppers charity 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or use the anonymous online form at Crimestoppers-uk.org.
