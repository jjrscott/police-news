A man has been jailed for two years after the remains of a cannabis factory were found in a Westcliff house.

A member of the public called police after seeing a group of men acting suspiciously in Wenham Drive on 19 December last year.

Officers found Alket Shyti in the back garden, and inside the house were the remains of cannabis plants and the equipment used to grow them.

The plants had been grown in the living room, three bedrooms and loft.

Shyti, 26, of no fixed address, admitted being concerned in the production of cannabis when he appeared at Chelmsford Crown Court on 5 March.

He was jailed for two years. The £480.52 found in his pocket at the time of his arrest has been seized and forfeited, and the remaining cannabis and growing equipment will be destroyed.

Investigating officer PC George Watts said:
"It was a professional cannabis factory and the drugs had the potential to sell for up to nearly £90,000.
"The production and dealing of cannabis, just like any drug, is not a victimless crime.
"Criminals exploit people, particularly those who are vulnerable, and employ them to grow or sell drugs on their behalf.
"Drugs supply also goes hand in hand with violent crime.
"It's why we're working every single day to target criminals involved in drugs supply.
"If you have information about drug dealing in your community, or are worried someone you know is being exploited, please report it."
