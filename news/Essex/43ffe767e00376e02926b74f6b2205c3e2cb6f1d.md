Thirty-two people have been charged with 109 alleged offences in total during an investigation into drugs supply in North Essex.

We focused on 12 drugs lines operating in and around Chelmsford, Braintree, Witham, between February 1 to 14.

Warrants were executed at more than 30 addresses in Essex and London, involving hundreds of officers.

In total, 39 people were arrested as part of our ongoing investigation, of which 32 have been charged with alleged offences.

Crack cocaine and heroin, and cash, with a total value of around Â£30,000 was seized.

Detective Chief Inspector Lewis Basford said: "This is just a snapshot of the work we're doing every day to keep our communities across Essex safe from drugs gangs.

"We are dismantling them at every level of the chain and making sure they can't make money at the expense of the children and vulnerable people they exploit.

"Despite the challenges of the covid-19 pandemic, we've never stopped catching criminals and making our streets as safe as we possibly can.

"You can help us with our work by telling us about any concerns you have about drug dealing in your neighbourhood.

"Your information really does make a difference."
