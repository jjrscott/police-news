A drug dealer arrested following a routine vehicle stop on Canvey Island has been jailed for nearly three years.

Officers stopped a blue Renault Megane in Somnes Avenue on the afternoon of 17 October 2017.

Inside officers found a pot which contained a number of bags of what was later identified as herbal cannabis as well as four mobile phones, and wraps and bags of white powder.

They also discovered an A4 piece of paper with a list of names and cash amounts owing/paid inside the trouser pocket of the driver - Jamie Marshak - who had been arrested.

When the wraps and plastic bags were forensically tested, the white powder inside was confirmed to be cocaine.

Marshak, 35, of Timberlog Lane, Basildon, was later charged.

At Basildon Crown Court on 16 July 2020 he pleaded guilty to two possession with intent to supply Class A drugs, one count of possession with intent to supply Class B drgus, and failing to surrender to custody.

At the same court on 30 July he was jailed for a total of two years and 11 months.

Investigating officer PC Warren Lamb said: "Jamie Marshak was found not only with drugs in his car, but what also appeared to be a list of people who was buying from or selling too.

"This conviction shows how effective tactics such as routine stop checks can be in keeping you safe and catching criminals.

"I hope Marshak's sentencing sends a clear message out to anyone else involved in selling drugs, that we won't stop our endeavours and it's only a matter of time until you're removed from our streets and put before a court."
