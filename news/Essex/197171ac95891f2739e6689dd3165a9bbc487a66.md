A drug dealer has been jailed after being caught during an investigation into a drugs line in south Essex.

Officers carried out a search warrant at Stephen Reynolds' home in Mapledene Avenue, Hullbridge, on 17 September this year.

They found a mobile phone which showed the 30-year-old was supplying crack cocaine and heroin on a daily basis as part of the 'Frank' drugs line.

They also seized knives and an extendable baton.

Reynolds admitted two counts of being concerned in supplying class A drugs and possession of cannabis when he appeared at Southend Magistrates' Court on 18 September.

He was jailed for three years at Basildon Crown Court on Tuesday 8 December.

The weapons and drugs will be destroyed.
