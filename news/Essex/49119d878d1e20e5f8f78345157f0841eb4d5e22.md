### Friday 26 February

We are investigating the death of a man in Leigh-on-Sea and are looking to speak to anyone who saw what happened.

We were contacted just after 6pm today, Friday 26 February, after an 18-year-old man was admitted to hospital with stab wounds. Sadly he died a short time later.

From our initial enquiries, we believe he was attacked near The Peterboat pub in High Street, Old Leigh.

Two people have been arrested in connection with our investigation.

Officers are in the Old Leigh area carrying out enquiries and we'd like to thank people who have come forward so far.

Anyone who saw what happened or has mobile phone, CCTV or dash cam footage, is asked to speak to officers on scene.

You can submit information to us online at https://mipp.police.uk/operation/4201020121P63-PO1

Information can also be given to independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or https://crimestoppers-uk.org
