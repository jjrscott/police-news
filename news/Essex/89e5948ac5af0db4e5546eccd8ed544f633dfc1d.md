A drug dealer who was brought to justice just a day after being arrested has been jailed for two-and-a-half years.

Orhan Ahmedov was stopped by officers in Wharf Road, Chelmsford, on 4 November last year after they saw him acting suspiciously near to a car park by Iceland.

They searched him and found 342 wraps of suspected Class A drugs as well as two mobile phones and more than £120 in cash.

Another 71 wraps were found when he was searched again in custody.

Tests identified the drugs as cocaine and heroin.

Ahmedov, 19, of no fixed address, was charged with two counts of possession with intent to supply heroin and cocaine.

He pleaded guilty when he appeared at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court the following day.

He was jailed for 30 months at Chelmsford Crown Court on Wednesday 20 May.

He was also ordered to pay £180 victim surcharge and £124.95 found on him was seized under the Proceeds of Crime Act.

Investigating officer Sergeant Harriet Ware said: "This investigation is another example of the fantastic work from a number of different teams across Essex Police to bring to justice those who cause so much despair to our communities.

"It is testimony to all those involved that Ahmedov had no option but to plead guilty less than 24 hours after being arrested.

"He can now look forward to time behind bars.

"Drugs are a scourge on our society and we continue to do everything we can tackle and bring to justice those infecting our communities with them."
