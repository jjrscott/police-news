### A man's been charged with possessing a paedophile manual by officers investigating indecent images of children online.

We received a referral on 6 May relating to allegations indecent images of children had been accessed from an address in Chelmsford in May last year.

Officers from the Police Online Investigation Team (POLIT) carried out an investigation and arrested a man on Friday (15 May).

Callum Leeder, 28, of Rubensgate, Chelmsford has now been charged with being in possession of a paedophile manual.

He appeared at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court on Saturday 16 May.

He has been remanded in custody and is next due to appear at Chelmsford Crown Court for a pre-trial preparation hearing on 12 June.
