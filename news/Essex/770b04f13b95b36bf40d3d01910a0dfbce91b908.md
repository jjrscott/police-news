### We understand that as the weather improves and the restrictions upon us relating to the pandemic are eased people want to have a good time.

### We do all need to be mindful of our own safety and the safety of others.

It is still unlawful to meet in large groups - both inside and outside. We all continue to have a role to play in keeping ourselves and others safe.

Residents in Essex have in the vast majority been adhering to all the new measures being put in place to slow the spread of the virus.

Following tragic events in the county last weekend we would like to remind residents and those visiting the county to be alert to their safety and the safety of others when in and around water.

**Chief Supt Glen Pavelin said:**

"We had the sad death of a teenager last weekend which acts as a terribly tragic reminder that water can present hidden dangers.
It's going to be really hot this weekend and there will be a temptation to find ways to cool off, and some of that may involve water. My plea to you is please only go in water where it is safe to do so and make sure someone else knows where you are at all times. Please do not go beyond your depth or swimming capabilities and please above all stay safe."

##### **Please continue to socialise safely and protect the NHS as we all continue to fight the virus together.**
