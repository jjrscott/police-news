### A statement from Assistant Chief Constable, Rachel Nolan following this evening's government announcement.

"All of us have been affected by the impact of coronavirus in some way and the enormity of this cannot be underestimated.

"Our focus has always been and will continue to be to protect and serve our communities.

"Our officers have taken a fair and common-sense approach to policing the government's COVID-19 measures and we will continue with this approach.

"We will continue to engage with people, explain the regulations and encourage people to the right thing.

"Where reasoned attempts to encourage someone to stick to the regulations have been unsuccessful, and where necessary and proportionate, we will take enforcement action.

"We know this is a really challenging time and we're all having to make sacrifices, but your efforts do make a difference.

"I would like to thank all those who have followed the government legislation and guidance, taking steps to protect themselves and others and helping to reduce the spread of coronavirus.

"By following the regulations you help us to focus our main efforts on what we do best - helping people, keeping them safe and catching criminals."
