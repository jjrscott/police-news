## Police Dogs, Dexter, Oreo and Alfie have become the latest additions to our Dog Unit, having completed their search training.

PD Dexter, PD Oreo & PD Alfie

The trio took part in a six-week training programme with their handlers, where they learnt to detect drugs, weapons and cash, which had been hidden.

Police dog trainer PC Andy Gaw said: "All three dogs did really well throughout the training process, and met the high standards we have learnt to expect from our police dogs.

"Following a demonstration of their new skills , they were officially licenced as drug, weapons and cash search dogs on Friday 17 July and are ready and waiting to be deployed to their first jobs.

"A special thanks goes to our colleague PC Andy Dean, from Cambridgeshire Police, who awarded all three dogs with their search licences, after they proved their abilities."

PD Dexter is a two-year-old Cocker Spaniel and is teaming up with PD Rex, and PD Alfie, who is also a two-year-old Springer Spaniel, will be teaming up with PD Vin.

PD Oreo is the fourth dog to join our unit from the Dogs Trust, after being rescued by the charity.

"We have a fantastic relationship with the Dogs Trust" added PC Gaw.

"PD Oreo, another two-year-old Springer Spaniel, is our most recent addition from the Dog's Trust to have successfully completed our training programme.

"Not only have we gained an excellent police dog, but also given him a home, enabling our friends at the charity to help more animals."
