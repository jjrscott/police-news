As part of our continued commitment to get officers into your communities, we have welcomed 76 new police officers at adapted ceremonies today, Friday 22 May.

We put special measures in place to ensure the officers could train and celebrate while respecting the government guidelines, which has included 2.5m spacing at the recognition ceremonies as a precaution.

Today's celebrations follow changes to the way we trained the officers.

Classrooms contained smaller numbers of people with plenty of space and many sessions were held online.

These measures are unprecedented in the 180 year history of Essex Police.

Chief Constable BJ Harrington greeted the officers and said: "Today's event is testament to the hard work and determination of the officers, and of course their trainers, in completing their studies under strict restrictions.

"I know many of you are not just colleagues, you're friends, and it's been a while since some of you have seen each other. I really hope you had a special day together.

"I'm proud to say your family and friends are being sent videos of the day to thank them for their continued support.

"It's important that we continue to mark the achievements of our officers in the face of the pandemic and these events shows our commitment in the recruitment of officers.

"I would like to wish our new officers every success and I hope you will all welcome them, just like I have today."

There are now 3,293 officers in Essex Police - 75 more than the 3,218 initially promised - and we have more than 500 Special Constables.

This means we are well on track to recruit our target of 3,369 officers by 31 March 2021.

Last month, we had 472 people apply to work as a either a detective or regular officer, the highest we've had in one month - EVER.

From these applications, almost half (43 per cent) were from women and 11 per cent were from a BAME background.

In addition, 50 people applied to be a Special Constable.

We have many exciting opportunities for you here at Essex Police.
