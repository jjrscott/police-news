### A cocaine dealer who provided us with a fake name and identity documents has been jailed for more than three-and-a-half years.

Florjan Hidri, 27, of no fixed address, provided false documentation in the name of Alexandru Buculut after he was arrested in April 2020 on suspicion of drugs offences.

As our investigation continued, we were able to prove that the documents had been falsely obtained.

Hidri admitted possession with intent to supply cocaine and cannabis, perverting the course of justice and possession of false documents at Chelmsford Crown Court on Thursday 4 February.

He has been sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison for drugs offences, with a further three months for perverting the course of justice.

Officer in charge of the case, PC John James Hogan of Chelmsford CID, said:

"Hidri was stopped by officers on West Hanningfield Road in Great Baddow on 16 April 2020.

"Upon searching the car they found 116 bags containing cocaine with an estimated street value of Â£5700, and a further quantity of cannabis. He continued to try and evade justice by giving a false identity and a fake driving licence, but later admitted his true name.

"Hidri has finally shown he can be honest about something - and that was done in admitting his guilt at court."
