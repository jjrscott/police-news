### Thurrock's Town Centre team have been out and about in Tilbury this weekend, working with Thurrock Council to target waste carriers and speeding motorists in the Town, after concerns had been raised by local residents.

Town Centre Team officers reported two drivers for speeding on St Chad's Road, while Thurrock Council issued four fix penalty notices after two people failed to produce a waste transfer note or licence and another two people didn't have a waste carriers licence.

Furthermore an investigation has been launched after a motorcyclist failed to stop after they were requested to by officers for speeding.

**Town Centre Team officer PC Adam Walker, who was overseeing the operation said:**

"After residents raised their concerns with us about these issues, it was important that we took action.
"These offences not only present problems for the local community, but can cause harm to people and the environment and these legislations are in place to protect people and keep them safe.
"Working together with our colleagues at Thurrock Council means we can ensure that offenders are held accountable for their actions."
