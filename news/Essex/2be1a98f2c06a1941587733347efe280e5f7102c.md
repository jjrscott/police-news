Twenty people were arrested during an operation to disrupt criminals using the roads in the Thurrock district and east London.

Our road crime unit were supported by the dog section, Special Constables and Metropolitan Police on Thursday 30 April.

The arrests included nine on suspicion of drug-driving, and a 39-year-old man from Rainham was arrested in Aveley after being found with suspected drugs and two knives in his car.

The Metropolitan Police also made arrests for offences including dangerous driving and theft of vehicles.

Officers also carried out 51 stop searches, seized 12 cars for no insurance, and recovered one stolen vehicle.

Four community resolutions and two penalty tickets were also issued for cannabis possession.

Road crime manager Matt Hine said: "So far our road policing operations with the Metropolitan Police in March and April have resulted in more than 50 arrests for a range of offences, including drugs, theft and robbery.

"We regularly carry out operations such as these alongside our everyday patrols to disrupt criminals and organised crime groups who are travelling across Essex and over county borders to commit crime."

Superintendent Craig Saunders said: "Keeping people safe and catching criminals remain our top priorities and we are continuing to carry out proactive patrols to target and deal with offenders.

"We regularly work with colleagues in the Metropolitan Police and neighbouring forces to keep our communities safe by stopping criminals who travel between counties."
