## Original news item

Two buildings operated by local councils where we have front counter provision have closed to the public.

Maldon District Council offices and Uttlesford District Council Offices in Saffron Walden , temporarily closed from today, Thursday 26 March.

Their decision will mean you will not be able to speak to Essex Police staff face-to-face from these buildings. However, Essex Police officers will continue to police these towns as normal.

You will still be able to telephone the local number, with calls diverted to the nearest main police station.

If you feel it is necessary to attend a police station in person, while being mindful of the social distancing direction from the Government, as well as only making essential journeys, you can go to your nearest main police station which will be either Police HQ in Chelmsford or Braintree Police Station.

Most services can be accessed via our website so please visit essex.police.uk This includes reporting crime. The 101 telephone service remains in service for you to call with non-emergency matters.

In an emergency always dial 999.

We will continue to work with both councils to ensure our services in these buildings re-opens at the earliest possible opportunity.
