### A man was arrested on suspicion of shoplifting last week by a Grays Town Centre Team officer who was in the middle of hosting a community engagement event.

**PC Stuart Mackinnon was joined by Thurrock's newly appointed Community Safety and Engagement Officer, PC Neil Brand and Thurrock Council's Community Safety Partnership Manager, to host the pop-up event in the High Street.**

The team were there to talk to residents, shoppers, local businesses and workers about the work we are doing to help the community and keep them safe, as well as finding out if they had any concerns that they wanted to raise with us.

However, during the event, PC Mackinnon was called upon to assist colleagues in pursuing a man who was acting suspiciously.

However whilst looking for the man, PC Mackinnon saw another man who he suspected had been involved in two incidents of shoplifting and quickly responded, arresting the 35-year-old local man on suspicion of two counts of theft.

**PC Mackinnon said:**

"As police officers, we have to be ready to respond to whatever happens, no matter what we are doing and that includes being off-duty.

"I will always act to stop anyone who causes harm to our community.

"Our job is to protect people, keep them safe and catch criminals and that will always remain our priority."

A 35-year-old man from Grays, arrested on suspicion of theft offences has been released on bail until Monday 24 August.
