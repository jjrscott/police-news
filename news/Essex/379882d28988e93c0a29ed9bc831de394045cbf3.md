A man has been jailed for eight years for stabbing another man.

Sean Thompson had sent threatening messages to the victim late in the evening and demanded he meet him to discuss a family dispute.

The victim, who knew Thompson but was not related to him, went to Thompson's then home address in Colebrook Gardens, Loughton.

They became involved in an argument, during which Thompson punched the 30-year-old man and threatened him.

He then went inside the house and returned with a large kitchen knife.
He stabbed the victim in the chest, causing life threatening injuries.

Thompson, 30, was arrested the following day following the attack on 30 August last year.

On 22 October he admitted wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and possession of a bladed article in a public place.

He was jailed on Friday 8 January for eight years.

Investigating officer PC Jamie Williams, of Loughton CID, said: "The court heard Thompson had been suffering from stress and substance misuse at the time of the attack, and had shown remorse for his actions.

"However this is not an excuse for the violence he used that night, which could so easily have been fatal.

"I hope the sentence will give Thompson time to reflect on the consequences of his actions, which have left a lasting emotional and physical impact on his victim."
