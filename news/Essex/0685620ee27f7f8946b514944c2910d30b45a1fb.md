### Officers protecting the public from some of the most dangerous offenders have been out across the county using special equipment to proactively detect child sexual offences.

The Management of Sexual Offenders and Violent Offenders team (MOSOVO) work to manage registered sexual offenders and reduce the risk they pose to the public.

Plain clothed officers were out over the weekend visiting registered sex offenders and using specialist, sophisticated equipment which quickly and effectively detects content such as indecent images of children.

During the visits officers were able to identify an offence which is now being investigated.

Detective Inspector Nathan Hutchinson, who leads the MOSOVO team in the north of the county, said: "My officers carry out really important work every day which often takes place away from the public gaze.

"It's really important to monitor registered sex offenders and these unannounced home visits act as a great deterrent and help to protect our communities.

"The operation over the weekend was really successful as we effectively utilised sophisticated equipment which is available to all of the MOSOVO teams.

"During these challenging times our priorities haven't changed: we continue to keep people safe and catch criminals."
