Seven men who were arrested during a major drugs investigation have admitted drugs offences in court.

Officers seized an estimated Â£100,000 in cash after executing warrants at 18 addresses in Harlow, and one in Suffolk, on 8 October last year.

The searches were part of an investigation into a network suspected of supplying cocaine to county lines drugs gangs in west Essex, Hertfordshire, London, and Suffolk.

Seven men admitted conspiracy to supply a class A drug when they appeared at Chelmsford Crown Court yesterday, Wednesday 24 March.

They were:

Christopher Golding, 39 of Hart Road, Harlow
Lee Collett, 37, of Perry Spring, Harlow
Robert Aldred, 30, of Pittmans Field, Harlow
Agirdas Gustaitis, 31, of Meadow Court, Harlow
Stuart Thurgood, 39, of Morley Grove, Harlow
David Wilkinson, 36, of Primrose Hill, Haverhill
Lee Wilkinson, 38, of Parsonage, Leys, Harlow

They are due to be sentenced in May. A hearing date has yet to be confirmed.

Twelve people who were arrested as part of the investigation remain under investigation.
