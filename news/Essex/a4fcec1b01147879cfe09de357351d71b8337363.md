Donny Archer, 21, was jailed for his part in a burglary at a house in Billericay Road, Herongate, on 8 March this year.

A window had been forced open but nothing was stolen.

Shortly before the burglary, witnesses had seen three men inside a dark car pull up outside. Two of them were seen to get out and go round the back of the house. Archer was identified as one of the pair.

The following day, officers spotted a stolen Vauxhall Insignia in the Ongar and Abridge area. It had been stolen from a house in Timberlog Lane, Basildon, on 8 January.

It failed to stop for police and was seen speeding, driving the wrong way around a roundabout and colliding with two vehicles in stationary traffic.

It then crashed into a railing in Pettits Lane, Romford.

The occupants were arrested, including Archer, who was a passenger.

He pleaded guilty to the burglary in Herongate and aggravated taking of a vehicle without the owner's consent when he appeared at Basildon Crown Court on 9 June.

Archer, of Oak Lane in Crays Hill, was jailed for a total of two years and four months.
