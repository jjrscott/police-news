### A paedophile's been jailed for 24 years after being found guilty of a string of sexual offences, including rape.

John Edwards abused two children over a seven period of time between 2010 and 2017.

The offences came to light when one of the victim's came forward to police in 2017.

Then, in 2018, the second victim reported the offences against them.

Edwards, 44, of Gordon Road, Basildon, was arrested and later charged with 18 offences including eight counts of rape.

He denied the charges but on Tuesday 15 December was found guilty by a jury at Basildon Crown Court.

At the same court today he was sentenced to 24 years in prison, with an additional six years to be served on licence.

Throughout the investigation the victims were supported by our specialist officers and staff who work in our Child Abuse Investigation Team (CAIT).

Investigating officer Detective Sergeant Pitchford, from CAIT, said: "John Edwards carried out a series of horrific attacks on two children over a period of time.

"He is a dangerous sexual predator who will now spend the foreseeable future behind bars. Essex is a safer place for this.

"I want to praise the strength of Edwards' victims.

"They were made to re-live their ordeal through the trial process and have shown incredible courage to report what happened to them.

"No sentence can ever make up for what Edwards subjected them to but I hope this sentence will go some way to helping them move forward."
