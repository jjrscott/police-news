### Officers appeal for witnesses following two car collision on Main Road.

**Officers investigating a road traffic collision in Danbury on Friday 30 October, are appealing for dash cam footage.**

We were called shortly after 6.30am with reports that a BMW and a Volvo had been on collision on Main Road.

No serious injuries were reported but the driver of the BMW, a woman in her 50s, was taken to hospital as a precautionary measure.

If you were driving in the area around this time and saw the collision or the moments leading up to it, we would like to hear from you.

We are particularly interested in speaking those with dash cam footage.

If you have any information, please go to our website home page and select the 'Live Chat' button at the bottom right of the page. Here, between 7am-11pm, you will be able to provide information by speaking to one of our online operators to ensure your report is dealt with as quickly as possible.

Alternatively, you can make an online report here or call 101.

Information can also be given to independent charity Crimestoppers completely anonymously.

**Please reference incident 136 of 30 October when providing any information** to ensure it gets to the investigating officer as quickly as possible.
