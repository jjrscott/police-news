A man who kicked and head-butted our officers in Rochford last week has been sent to prison.

Robert Hunter, 26, of no fixed address, appeared at Southend Magistrates' Court on Thursday 16 April where he was convicted of two counts of assault by beating of an emergency worker and using threatening behaviour.

He was also convicted for breaching suspended sentences given to him on 17 September 2019 for two counts of assault by beating of an emergency worker, possession of a knife, theft and threatening behaviour.

Hunter, who admitted the offences, was sent to prison for 12 months and has been made subject of a year-long restraining order.

At around 4.30pm on Wednesday 15 April, we were made aware of a disturbance in the Boulevard.

We attended the scene and one of our officers reported that he had been kicked to the chest.

Hunter was placed in handcuffs but they needed adjusting - this is when Hunter head-butted another officer.

Chief Inspector David Miles, District Commander for Castle Point and Rochford, said: "Attacks on my officers will not be tolerated.

"Hunter clearly has a disrespect for the law, having previously received a sentence for two other attacks on police officers.

"Fortunately, neither officer required hospital treatment and were able to continue their shifts.

"I hope this outcome offers some form of justice to them and acts as a reminder that you face time in prison for assaulting my officers."
