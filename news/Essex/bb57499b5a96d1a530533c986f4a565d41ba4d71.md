### A man has been jailed after close to 200 cannabis plants were discovered during a warrant in Chigwell.

Valmir Beqiri, 25, of Limes Avenue, Chigwell, received 12 months at Chelmsford Crown Court on Monday 6 April after admitting producing cannabis.

On Sunday 26 January 2020, we executed a warrant at around 12.40pm at an address in Limes Avenue and found 196 plants inside at varying stages.

Every room was filled with plants and had been modified to assist in producing cannabis. We arrested Beqiri, who was found in the kitchen.

Sergeant Robert Fitt said: "We responded to concerns from residents about drug activity at the address before gathering intelligence.

"We successfully executed a warrant, seized dozens of plants and arrested Beqiri inside - who has since been convicted for his actions.

"We will not tolerate drug crime in our communities, these cultivations fund organised crime groups as well as modern day slavery and human trafficking.

"Thanks to members of the public and proactive policing, we were able to take action and bring Beqiri to justice."
