### A man's been charged with a number of offences following an investigation by officers who protect the public from some of the county's most dangerous offenders.

Officers from the Management of Sexual Offenders and Violent Offenders team (MOSOVO) arrested a 23 year-old man following routine enquiries in Harlow and Bedfordshire.

Bradley Dorman, of no fixed address, has now been charged with four counts of breaching notification requirements of the Sexual Offenders Register, two counts of breaching a sexual harm prevention order, registering vehicles with false details, driving while disqualified, driving with no insurance, and obstructing a police officer.

He is due to appear at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court today (Wednesday 13 May).
