### A man has been charged following a fatal collision in Orsett on Monday (5 October).

We were contacted shortly after 4am, with reports of a collision on the A128 Brentwood Road at its junction with the B188 in Orsett, where a red Peugeot 308 taxi and a black BMW X5 had collided.

Sadly the taxi driver, a 65-year-old man from Grays, died at the scene. He was the only occupant in the car.

Edvinas Pupkis, 22, of Devonshire Road, Ilford has been charged with causing death by careless driving, aggravated vehicle taking, causing death by driving a vehicle while unlicensed and uninsured, failing to report a road accident, failing to stop, driving a motor vehicle otherwise than in accordance with a licence.

He is due to appear at Basildon Magistrates court on Thursday 8 October.

Investigating officer Detective Constable Alan Lamb said: "Our thoughts are with the family and friends who have been affected by this incident.

"We want to thank the local residence for their understanding and support and all those who came forward with information, your help has been vital to our investigation."
