### One of the stars of our new 'We Value Difference' recruitment campaign will be answering your questions about what it's like being a police officer for a special event hosted by Cosmopolitan magazine.

Sergeant Lucy Bearman is going to be on the 'Cosmo Careers Fest' panel talking about her experiences and why she loves to protect and serve Essex.

The webinar is taking place at 6.30pm on Tuesday 6 October and Sgt Bearman will be joined other inspirational panellists to discuss how you can find a career that gives something back.

Sgt Bearman, who's a mum of two and has been an officer since 2006, said: "I became a police officer 14 years ago after working with the police as a civilian member of staff for four years.

"I saw first-hand what amazing work the police officers were doing and how Essex Police were like an extended family to all its staff and officers.

"I could see how much the officers loved their jobs and how helping others made such a difference to society and the community we live in and I wanted to be able to play a part in that picture.

"The thing I love most about my job is the opportunities it brings.

"The opportunity to try and improve the community I work and live in, to be a good role model, to gain knowledge through training and support given by the organisation, to progress into other areas or for promotion and the opportunity to try amazing things that you would never be able to try anywhere else!

"I'm really excited to be able to share my experiences and give an insight into what it's like to work in the police.

"It's a job I love and I'd be delighted if my story can inspire others to sign up!"

We launched our 'We Value Difference' recruitment campaign on 15 September to highlight the force's dedication to diversity, inclusion, and equality.

It features case studies of 40 of our officers from a range of backgrounds who share their story with you.

Since the campaign launched, we have received nearly 230 applications.
