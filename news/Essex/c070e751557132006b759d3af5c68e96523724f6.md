Thanking all NHS workers and carers for the life-saving work they're doing every single day.

When our own life savers are not working - be it a dog handler and PCSO to welfare officer and District Commander - they're staying home and saving lives.
We would like to thank everyone in Essex for doing their part in helping to save lives during these unprecedented times. We clap for you all.
