### A man who sexually abused a vulnerable man with learning disabilities has been jailed for 12 years with an additional two years to be spent on licence.

Mohamed Bari, 22 of Lewes Road, Southend, was employed as a carer and helped provide support to a 65-year-old disabled man who required 24-hour assistance.

Between January and July in 2017, Bari forced the man to engage in Sexual activity on multiple occasions.

The 65-year-old disclosed the assaults to another carer on 24 July 2017 and Bari was arrested and subsequently charged with having sexual activity with a mentally disordered male by penetration.

Bari denied the allegations but was found guilty by Jury on Monday 20 January 2020.

He was sentenced at Basildon Crown Court today, Thursday 14 May, to 12 years in prison with extension of two years to be spent on licence. He was also given a lifelong sexual harm prevention order.

Following the sentence, Investigating officer, PC Sarah Jackson from the Adult Sexual Assault Investigation Team said: "Mohamed Bari took advantage of a vulnerable man to further his own sexual gratification.

"This man relied on Bari to help him, and instead of improving his quality of life, Bari took away the man's dignity and basic rights, which understandably caused the victim considerable distress and upset.

"Bari is now paying the price for his action and the impact these had on a man he was meant to be caring for."
