Two of our PCSOs from Brentwood and Epping Community Policing Team helped a vulnerable man after he was found injured in the street.

On Tuesday 10, September, PCSO Laura Ashcroft and Norma Harrison were on high-visibility patrol in the Epping area when they were called to reports of an elderly man who had fallen over and injured himself near the railway station.

When Laura and Norma arrived at the scene they found the man being treated by two paramedics.

They treated his initial injuries while Laura helped them keep the man alert until the ambulance arrived. Norma stepped in to manage the traffic as the man had fallen in the road when he fell over.

Between our officers and the paramedics, the man was kept safe until the ambulance arrived. His injuries were not serious and he has since recovered from the incident.

"We were more than happy to assist our ambulance colleagues to help keep the man safe.
"We often deal with incidents where we work in partnership with our colleagues from the ambulance or fire service to create the best outcome for the victim or injured resident."
