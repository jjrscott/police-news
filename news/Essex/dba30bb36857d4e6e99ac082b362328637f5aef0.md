A driver has been found not guilty of causing the death of his passenger on the M11.

However a jury convicted Ryan Farthing of careless driving and driving whilst over the specified limit for a controlled drug.

He had been driving southbound during heavy snow when he lost control of the car near junction 7 at Harlow just after 8.15pm on 2 March 2018.

The BMW collided with the central reservation and spun, causing it to face oncoming traffic.

Farthing managed to get out and take refuge behind the crash barrier.
His passenger, Reece Gnazalo, attempted to cross the motorway but was struck by an oncoming taxi.

Sadly, the 22-year-old from Bexleyheath, died at the scene.

The taxi driver, who was unable to see him due to his dark clothing, has not faced any legal action.

Farthing, now aged 25, later tested positive for traces of cocaine and cannabis in his system. He was found to be driving whilst over the legal limit for Benzoylecgonine, a by-product of cocaine.

Farthing, of Bedonwell Road in Bexleyheath, Kent, denied causing death by careless driving when over the specified limit for a controlled drug.

He stood trial at Chelmsford Crown Court on Monday 8 March and was found not guilty by a jury today, Friday 12 March.

He was convicted by the jury of the two other driving offences and was banned from driving for 18 months. He was also fined Â£175.
