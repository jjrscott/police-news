**A man who ran over a woman at the Amazon distribution centre in Tilbury has pleaded guilty to attempted murder.**

We were called to Windrush Road at around 9.35am on Sunday 12 July following reports a woman had been hit by a car and seriously injured.

Another woman had also been assaulted.

They were both taken to hospital.

Thirty year-old Afrax Ahmed was arrested at the scene.

While in custody an emergency worker was also assaulted.

Ahmed, of Peartree Way, Greenwich was later charged and at Basildon Crown Court on Monday 29 March he admitted charges of attempted murder and assaulting an emergency worker.

He had previously admitted a charge of ABH.

He is due to be sentenced at the same court on 6 May.

Investigating officer Detective Constable Emma Barnes, from Grays CID, said:

"Afrax Ahmed deliberately ran over the victim intending to kill her.

"His actions left her with serious injuries that will take a long time to recover from, both physically and mentally.

"Ahmed has at least admitted his guilt meaning the victim won't be subjected to re-living the ordeal through a trial."
