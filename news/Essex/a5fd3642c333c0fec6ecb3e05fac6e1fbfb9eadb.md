A prolific burglar who targeted homes across Essex before stealing cars and then using the owners' bank cards at takeaways and petrol stations has been jailed for nine years.

James Hearne, 29, of no fixed address, appeared by video link at Chelmsford Crown Court on Thursday 16 July.

He received eight years for six counts of burglary and six months for two counts of theft.

He received concurrent sentences for a further three counts of theft and for four counts of fraud.

We linked Hearn to burglaries in Brentwood, Harlow, Chigwell, Woodford Green, Wickford and Witham between 25 November 2019 and 18 March 2020.

The first incident was reported in Brentwood where several watches were stolen.

Hearne went on to burgle a house in Harlow overnight on 17 January while the occupant was away before stealing a vehicle and using her bank card to order food.

On 3 March, Hearne burgled properties in Chigwell and Woodford Green, once again taking two cars and using bank cards at a petrol station and at a McDonald's restaurant.

He went on to burgle an address in Wickford on 16 March and used a bank card at a shop before burgling a home in Witham on 17 March.

Hearne stole vehicles during these burglaries and was then arrested in Romford on 31 March.

Detective Sergeant David Wilkinson, of Brentwood CID, said: "Hearne is prolific burglar who has received a substantial custodial sentence for his crimes.

"He was brazen, targeting homes across Essex to steal the occupants' vehicles before using their bank cards to pay for food and other items.

"Hearne left a trial of evidence behind and we made it our mission to bring him to justice.

"His DNA was found at burglary scenes and within the vehicles we located and his image could clearer be seen during his visits to petrol stations and fast food restaurants.

"I know our communities and our homes are safer with Hearne locked in a prison cell."
