Last weekend we received information that an unlicensed music event had been planned in the area of Southend.

The event would have been a clear and blatant breach of the Government's COVID-19 restrictions and would have put lots of people at risk.

Thanks to the information we received from you, we were able to act quickly to prevent this from happening and put a dispersal order in place.

A dispersal order is used to reduce the likelihood of antisocial behaviour and prevent any crime and disorder. The order gives our officers the power to move people on from an area where necessary.

The information we received from you meant that we were able to stop the event from going ahead, prevent the potential for the virus to be spread further and keep people safe. Thank you.

If you want to report a clear and blatant breach you can do so using our digital 101 system on our website.

Between 7am-11pm, you will be able to make an online report directly to one of our digital 101 operators, by selecting the 'Live Chat' button at the bottom of the page.

This will ensure the information you provide is dealt with as quickly as possible.
Alternatively, you can submit an online report or call 101.

For more information relevant to where you live, please visit your local council's website.
