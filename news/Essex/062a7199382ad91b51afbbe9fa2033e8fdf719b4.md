### A local man has appeared at Chelmsford Magistrats' Court and admitted to setting fire to a village hall in Ardleigh, near Colchester.

****

**Anthony Kleingeld, 28, of Ardleigh Court was arrested following a joint investigation with officers from Tendring's Community Police Team and Essex County Fire and Rescue Service into a fire at Ardleigh Village Hall on Station Road shortly before 11.45pm on Tuesday 7 July.**

CCTV footage identified that the fire had been started deliberately.
Thankfully no one was hurt and the fire was quickly extinguished by the fire service, limiting the amount of damage caused to the building.

Following his arrest, Anthony Kleingeld was charged with arson and breaching a Criminal Behaviour Order, which banned him from setting fires.

He appeared at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court on Thursday 30 July and pleaded guilty to both charges.

He has been remanded in custody and is due to be sentenced on Friday 28 August.

**Tendring Community Police Team Sergeant, Aaron Heard said:**

"Buildings like the village hall are often at the heart of a community, so it was important that we found the person responsible and held them accountable for their actions.

"Investigating officer PC Ryan Kent has done a fantastic job working alongside our colleagues at Essex County Fire and Rescue Service to find the person responsible for this fire.

"Once the fire service had established that the fire was started deliberately, it was important that we found the person responsible and prevent the risk of further damage or harm being caused."
