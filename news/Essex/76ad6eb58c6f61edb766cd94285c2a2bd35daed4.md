#### Last weekend saw the deaths of three people on our roads and with more hot weather expected this weekend we are conscious that people will be likely to take to the roads to travel to beauty spots, beaches and to visit relatives and we want to ensure they can do so safely.

##### Chief Supt Glen Pavelin said:

"The investigations in to the circumstances of the collisions last weekend remain ongoing so it would be wrong for me to suggest the causes, however I would like to appeal to anyone driving a vehicle or riding a motorcycle to do so thinking about their own safety and the safety of all other road users.

"We will have officers out on the county's roads this weekend, both to keep people safe and prevent and detect crime.

"Please do not drive under the influence of drink or drugs. Please do not drive in excess of the speed limits - they are in place for a reason. Enjoy your weekend whatever you chose to do but please make sure you do so safely."
