**Did you know that privately owned e-scooters are illegal to use, other than on private land?**

With the rise in the popularity of electric scooters (or e-scooters) we wanted to provide some clear direction around the law and their use.

Essex County Council are running a trial of a new e-scooter rental system in Basildon, with further trials planned in Braintree, Brentwood, Clacton, Chelmsford and Colchester. You can read more about the trial on the Essex County Council website

E-scooters which are part of the authorised trial look different to private scooters.

Essex County Council trial SPIN e-scooter and non-trial e-scooter.

Any e-scooter which is not part of this trial, remains illegal to use other than on private land which must not be accessible to the public.

We really don't want anyone to inadvertently break the law and we are urging retailers to make the law clear to anyone thinking of buying an e-scooter, or giving one as a gift this Christmas.

"An e-scooter is classed the same as a motor vehicle"

**said Chief Inspector Emma Bullock, Head of Roads Policing at Essex Police.**

"It is illegal to use a motor vehicle without the appropriate licence or insurance.

"As it is not possible to get insurance for private e-scooters, that means it is illegal to use them in a public place.

"It's really important to emphasise that if you're not hiring an e-scooter from SPIN as part of the council pilot scheme, and using it within the 6 areas which are part of the scheme, you'll be breaking the law.

"Safety is really important too, and we will take action against anyone breaking the law. That could mean not only seizing the e-scooter but it may also mean prosecution for using a motor vehicle and not having insurance or the appropriate licence."
