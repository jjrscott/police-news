A teenager has been jailed after throwing a bottle at a stranger, causing a deep cut above her eye.

The woman needed stitches following the unprovoked attack near Websters Way in Rayleigh on 14 June.

She was talking to a friend in a small shelter in the early hours of the morning, and Levi Bellfield and another man were sitting on a nearby bench drinking beer.

The victim - who did not know him - stood up to stretch because she had a cramp in her leg.

Bellfield became aggressive and asked why she was standing up.

He then threw a bottle at her, which caused a one inch cut down to the bone.

He fled the scene and police and paramedics were called.

Bellfield, of no fixed address, was arrested on 17 June.

He admitted causing grievous bodily harm without intent when he appeared at Southend Magistrates' Court on 18 June.

The 19-year-old was remanded in custody and sentenced at Basildon Crown Court yesterday, Tuesday 6 October, to two years and four months in a Young Offender Institution.

Bellfield must also pay £250 compensation to his victim and £190 costs.

He was already subject of a criminal behaviour order at the time of the attack, which the judge extended until 22 January 2024.

The teenager is banned from Rayleigh, and must not be in a group of two or more people unless with a parent or guardian over the age of 25.

He also cannot associate with three other named individuals, or be in possession of any glass bottle, container, vessel in a public place.
