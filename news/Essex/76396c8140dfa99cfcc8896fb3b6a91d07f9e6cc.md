**Keep the kids amused this Easter with our new colouring picture of Essex Police mascot Baloo.**

Baloo is surrounded by Easter eggs and needs you to add some colour to her life by grabbing your pens and pencils and getting creative.

The picture, designed by children's author and artist Tom Knight, will give children of all ages plenty of opportunity to show off their artistic talent and is the perfect way to relax after a chocolate treat or two.

Brave Baloo retired from duty after losing a leg in an accident responding to a call, but the much-loved Belgian Malinios has since become a local celebrity.

She can't wait to see the colour combinations you come up with, even if they're barking mad!

Once your artworks are complete, take a quick snap and share them with us by tagging @EssexPoliceUK on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.
