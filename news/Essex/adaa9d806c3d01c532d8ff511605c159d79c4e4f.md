### A man's due in court later this month charged with sexual offences following work by officers who protect the public from some of the county's most dangerous offenders.

Officers from the Management of Sexual Offenders and Violent Offenders team (MOSOVO) carried out enquiries at an address in Harebell Drive, Witham on 23 September assisted by officers from our Cyber Crime team.

Electronic devices were seized from the property.

A 53 year-old man was arrested at the time.

Sanjoy Rajput, of Harebell Drive, was later charged with breaching a sexual harm prevention order (SHPO) and failing to comply with notification requirements of the sex offenders register.

He appeared at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court on 24 September and is next due to appear at Chelmsford Crown Court on 22 October.
