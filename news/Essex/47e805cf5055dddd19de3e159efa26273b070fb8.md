Abbie, Dom and Hannah are three of Essex Police's newest recruits who have completed their initial training and are now joining their teams, who help to keep you safe from harm.

Watch this short video to hear why they joined us and how we've made them feel welcome:

Dom joins one of our teams in Colchester. To anyone thinking of joining us, he says: "I'd definitely say 'Go ahead with it'."

And Abbie, who is heading to Canvey Island, adds: "Do it. It's a big step but you will honestly never regret it in your life."

Hannah will be policing the Harlow area. We've ensured her uniform has been adjusted to take account of the fact that, as a Type 1 diabetic, she needs to inject herself with insulin.

On Thursday 29 October at a COVID-Secure event, they pledged their commitment to serve Essex residents, in front of Chief Constable Ben-Julian Harrington, Deputy Chief Constable Pippa Mills, Essex Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner Roger Hirst and other senior officers.

### We're recruiting

More people from all walks of life are applying to join Essex Police. So why not join them and join a team that values difference: www.essex.police.uk/ fitthebill
