### A man from Colchester has admitted sexually assaulting a vulnerable woman.

Stephen Pilgrim was arrested in July following allegations a woman had been assaulted in Manningtree on 31 December 2019.

The 71 year-old from Harwich Road, Bradfield, was charged with two counts of sexually assaulting a mentally disordered person.

He admitted those charges when he appeared at Colchester Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 21 October.

He is due to be sentenced at Chelmsford Crown Court on 18 November.

Detective Constable Reuben Brame, from the Adult Sexual Assault Investigation Team, said: "Stephen Pilgrim took advantage of a vulnerable woman for his own gratification.

"For these despicable acts he now faces the prospect of time behind bars."
