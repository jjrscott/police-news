A man has been sent to prison for five years and four months after a man was stabbed to the chest while parked in Benfleet.

Antonio Betancor, 44, of Trinity Road, Southend, received 65 months for grievous bodily harm with intent at Basildon Crown Court yesterday, Monday 7 September.

He also received 24 months, to run concurrently, for possession with intent to supply cocaine.

Betancor pleaded guilty to both offences at an earlier hearing.

In the early houses of Saturday 16 March 2019, a man called emergency services to report being stabbed in the chest while parked in Eastleigh Road.

The victim sustained a wound that had punctured his diaphragm and spleen and he was taken to critical care after going into cardiac arrest.

He continued our enquiries and we arrested Betancor after executing a warrant the following day.

We found over 40 wraps of class A drugs in the property.

Senior Investigating Officer Detective Chief Inspector Stuart Truss said: "There was clear evidence that Betancor left his home at around 3am before driving to the scene and stabbing the victim as he sat in his car.

"He suffered a deep, single stab wound to the chest and he underwent emergency care in hospital.

"Following our investigations, we discovered this was a drugs related incident and Betancor was found to have wraps of cocaine in his home.

"Betancor, who has been on remand, left a man with life-threatening injuries and yesterday he continues to remain in prison for his actions."
