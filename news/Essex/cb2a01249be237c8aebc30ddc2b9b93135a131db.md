We have increased our patrols near to woodland in Little Baddow following complaints about anti-social and lewd behaviour.

We have received reports concerning activity on land near to Hurrells Lane and our Community Policing Team officers have been patrolling the area.

We are also working closely with partners including Essex Wildlife Trust and Chelmsford City Council.

Sergeant Graham Thomas, of Community Policing Team, said: "We've been carrying out our patrols to try and deter anti-social and lewd behaviour in this beauty spot.

"We understand this activity may be going on both night and day and we're proactively policing the area, including giving advice to members of the public, carrying out vehicle checks and carrying out uniformed patrols.

"We are liaising with the land owner and our partners and I want to reassure you that we will take action against anyone caught committing any offences.

"I want to thank the community for their support and I want to reassure you that the majority of people visiting the area are doing so lawfully.

"We want people to visit this beauty spot and we would urge you to be vigilant and to report any information to us."

We would urge people to report information to Chelmsford Community Policing Team on 101 or you can report information by visiting www.essex.police.uk.

Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
