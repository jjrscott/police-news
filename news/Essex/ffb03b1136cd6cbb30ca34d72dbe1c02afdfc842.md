Christmas has come early for a family reunited with the French Bulldog puppy they thought they would never see again.

Officers from our Rural Engagement and Braintree Community Policing teams found an abandoned puppy in Coggeshall Road, Braintree, while out making inquiries with staff from Braintree District Council and the RSPCA.

A quick bit of detective work saw our officers reunite the puppy with her family, who live in Bedford. It turned out Zara, who is only eight months old, had been taken from their garden in July, leaving her owners distraught.

After PC Jas Thorndyke and PCSO Jo Cooper returned Zara to her home, grateful mum Rita Jurkuviene said her two children, Aironas and Lukas were shocked when they first saw Zara again because they didn't recognise her, she had grown so much.

"We had given up and didn't think we'd see her again but after four months, she's back just before Christmas. Our life will now be busy again and different. The kids are smiling and I can't say how happy we are.
"A big thank you to Essex Police, you brought our happiness home again."

Acting Sergeant Steve Mugridge, of Braintree Community Policing Team, said the team thought Zara 'looked out of the ordinary' when they found her.

"When we looked further, she had a scar where a microchip would be."

Braintree Council staff took Zara to a vet, who checked her over and confirmed that the microchip had, indeed, been cut out.

"This would normally make a dog difficult to identify. But I checked the website doglost.co.uk and found details of a dog matching her description which had been reported stolen in Bedfordshire in July. I contacted Rita and we swapped photographs, which confirmed Zara was theirs. Zara has some distinctive markings which made the job easier.
"When Jas and Jo visited the family to give her back, Zara immediately ran across the kitchen to the exact spot where her dog bowl would be, which only confirmed what we already knew. It was a privilege to reunite Zara with her family, who obviously love her so much!"
