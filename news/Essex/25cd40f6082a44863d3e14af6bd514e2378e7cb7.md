We are asking the people of Essex to protect the heroes of today when celebrating the VE Day anniversary this weekend.

Assistant Chief Constable Paul Wells, who is leading our response to COVID-19, said: "This is an incredibly significant anniversary and it is right that we all mark this historic occasion and pay respect to our World War Two heroes."

"This year, things will have to be different, so that we can protect the heroes of today and honour the heroes of VE Day."

"The people of Essex have been brilliant at staying home and by doing this you have saved lives - I can't say thank you enough."

"We know that when celebrations present themselves during these challenging times it can be more difficult to stick to the rules. Please, for the sake of the most vulnerable in our community and those working to protect us all, continue with the great work of staying at home."

"I know we'd usually be crowding the streets with parades, hosting parties with our neighbours, and visiting cenotaphs to pay our respects. However you choose to celebrate, it's imperative that you continue to make sure you follow the government regulations - stay in your yards or gardens and only leave your house for essential journeys or exercise. Please don't gather in groups in public places or in the street."

"When our officers are off-duty, they're doing the same. Those who are on duty this weekend will be out and about to engage with any concerns from members of the public and to ensure that everyone is staying safe and keeping up the good work."

"Essex has done an amazing job so far - let's carry this on - let's save lives by staying at home and protect the heroes of today when we're remembering the heroes of VE Day."
