A man who kicked and spat in the face of our officers following a disturbance in Brightlingsea has been jailed.

At Colchester Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 12 August, he was sentenced and ordered to pay compensation.

At around 10.50pm on Wednesday 4 March, we attended Samsons Road and were flagged down by Higgins.

He was unsteady on his feet, he had slurred speech and he became agitated towards the officers before being arrested for being drunk and disorderly.

While being put into a police van, Higgins kicked out and struck an officer in the head.

He also began spitting in the back of the vehicle and caused damage inside.

At around 12.20am on Thursday 5 March, one of our officers was carrying out a welfare check on Higgins while he was in custody.

Higgins, who had pretended to be asleep, then got up and spat in the officer's face.

Chief Inspector Lily Benbow, District Commander for Tendring, said: "Our officers attended a disturbance and found Higgins who was clearly intoxicated.

"Higgins then assaulted two of my officers in one instance spitting in the face of an officer checking his welfare.

"His behaviour was totally unacceptable and the courts have sent him to prison for his actions.

"I hope this will cause others to think twice about assaulting my officers. Such behaviour will not be accepted."
