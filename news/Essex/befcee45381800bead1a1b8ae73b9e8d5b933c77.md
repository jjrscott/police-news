We are investigating three burglaries at shops in Orsett, Tilbury and Stanford-le-Hope.

We were contacted shortly after 1.35am on Friday 19 March with reports a silver Nissan Terrano had driven into the front window of At Your Convenience Stores in High Street, Orsett.

Someone attempted to take money from a cash machine inside, but left empty-handed.

The suspects left in the car towards Stifford Clays Road.

While officers were on scene, a further call came in at 1.50am with reports a vehicle matching the same description had driven into the front window of Moylers in Calcutta Road, Tilbury.

It is not yet clear if anything was taken.

Officers attempted to stop the vehicle, but it failed to stop and was later found damaged in Christchurch Road.

We are treating the incidents as linked. We believe they are also linked to a burglary at Linford Food & Wine in East Tilbury Road, Stanford-le-Hope, at about 1.15am yesterday, Thursday 18 March. Nothing was stolen in that burglary but extensive damage was caused to the front of the building.

Our enquiries remain ongoing and we'd like to speak to any witnesses and anyone who lives in the area of this morning's incidents and has CCTV or doorbell footage.

Contact us quoting incident 42/47591/21.

You can speak to an online operator at https://www.essex.police.uk between 7am-11pm or call 101.
