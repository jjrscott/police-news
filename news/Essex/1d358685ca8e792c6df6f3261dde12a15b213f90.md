### A drug dealer's been jailed following great, proactive work from our Op Raptor team.

Officers from Op Raptor North were carrying out proactive patrols in the Moulsham Street area of Chelmsford on 16 January when they received information that a black Ford Focus was suspected of being used in the sale of drugs in the area.

The car had been found in the same area over a period of time.

Searching the area, the officers tracked the vehicle to Writtle Road and stopped it.

They searched the driver, 26 year-old Jason Habibo, and found cash as well as a number of wraps of what was later confirmed to be crack cocaine and heroin in the car.

Habibo, of Lonsdale Close, London E6, was arrested and later charged with possession with intent to supply Class A drugs.

He initially denied the charges but later changed his plea to guilty.

At Snaresbrook Crown Court on 14 October he was jailed for five and-a-half years.

Detective Sergeant James Pammett, from Op Raptor, said: "Drug ruin lives and cause misery to our communities and we work tirelessly to take drugs of our streets and put those selling them behind bars.

"Jason Habibo was found with a large amount of cash and 23 wraps of Class A drugs on him but still tried to deny he was a drug dealer.

"Fortunately, due to the quality of our thorough and comprehensive investigation he had no choice but change his plea and admit the charges.

"I hope this serves as a warning to other people selling drugs across Essex that we are watching you and we will bring you to justice."
