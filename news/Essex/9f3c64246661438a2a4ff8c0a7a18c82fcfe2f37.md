### A Halstead man has been jailed after admitting child sex offences.

Dean Carey, 48, and of Clovers in the town, was arrested in 2017 and 2019 for exchanging explicit messages to teenage boys.

In 2017, he exchanged messages on social media with a 13 year-old boy and in 2019 he started speaking to someone he believed was a 14 year-old boy who he later arranged to meet in Pitsea last September.

In March Carey pleaded guilty to a series of offences including causing a child to engage in sexual activity, engaging in sexual communications with a child, attempted sexual communications with a child, facilitating the commission of a child sex offences, breaching a pre-existing Sexual Harm Prevention Order, and three counts of making indecent images if children.

On Thursday 16 April he was sentenced to four years in prison with a further six on licence for causing a child to engage in sexual activity.

Carey has also been given an indefinite Sexual Harm Prevention Order.

Investigating officer, Detective Constable Gemma White, said: "Carey is a dangerous individual who poses a real risk to children.

"Thanks to the work of numerous teams across the force, including the Police Online Investigation Team and Braintree CID, we were able to get a great result today.

"He will spend a significant amount of time behind bars and will still serve strict conditions when released on license."
