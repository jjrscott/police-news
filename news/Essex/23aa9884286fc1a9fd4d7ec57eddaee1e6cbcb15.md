The Chief Constable, Ben-Julian Harrington, has said the following after the Government announcement of how the first 6,000 officers from the 20,000 uplift will be allocated across the country.

He said:

"Today's announcement by the Home Office means that my team and I will be able to press ahead and recruit extra officers to protect and serve the people of Essex. Of the 6,000 who will be recruited nationwide between now and March 2021, Essex Police will be allocated funding for 135 additional officers. This means by March 2021 Essex Police will have grown to 3,353 officers. This 135 builds on the 368 increase over the past two years. I am delighted that September was a record month for new applications to join our ranks. We have great opportunities for people who feel they would #FitTheBill either as a uniformed officer, as a detective or as a Special Constable and I would welcome anyone who wants to make Essex an even safer place to live and work to step forward and join us."
