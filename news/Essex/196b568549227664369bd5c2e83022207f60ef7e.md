It's Question Time for the Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner for Essex and the Chief Constable of Essex Police.

Do you have a question for Roger Hirst, the Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner for Essex or Essex Police's Chief Constable BJ Harrington?

Would you like to know more about the growth of policing in Essex, how Essex Police is tackling anti-social behaviour or violence or how they are helping the vulnerable in our society?

If so, get in touch with your questions and they will be put directly to them both by Gateway 97.8fm's Johnny Jenkins who has agreed to act as an impartial host for the question time style event. The interview will be recorded and then posted on our social media channels for you to see.

Johnny Jenkins said: "I'm looking forward to chairing this Question Time with two of Essex's top figures in policing and community safety. Whatever your question is, I will put it to Roger Hirst and BJ Harrington to make sure you get an answer!"

If you have a question that you would like Johnny to ask, please email pfcc@essex.police.uk

Questions will close at midnight on Tuesday 11 February, 2020.

The interview will be published on both the Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner for Essex and Essex Police Facebook pages and YouTube Accounts on Monday 17 February. It will also be available via Gateway 97.8fm.
