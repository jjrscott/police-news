#### We are appealing for witnesses after a woman was subjected to racial harassment.

We were called just before 1.10pm on Friday 7 August with reports of harassment at Mayflower Retail Park, Basildon.

It was reported a woman in her 30s was subjected to racial harassment when leaving a store by two women.

The first was described as in her 50s, with blonde hair tied back and glasses.
The second was described in her late teens early 20s, black hair pulled back and slim.
Both women left in a grey Citron.

We believe a man and a woman both witnessed the event and spoke to the victim after encouraging her to report the incident to us and would ask them to please call us on 101.

If anyone else saw what happened to please call us or report it online quoting crime reference 42/122296/20
