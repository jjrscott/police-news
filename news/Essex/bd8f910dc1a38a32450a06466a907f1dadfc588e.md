### Dozens more drivers could be asking themselves whether 'the high is worth the low' after being arrested on suspicion of drug driving in Essex last month.

We made 145 drug driving arrests in February, with 131 people arrested on suspicion of drink driving, and 30 failing to provide a specimen arrests.

Head of Roads Policing, Adam Pipe, said: "Officers continue to work to keep our roads safe by detecting suspected drug drivers.

"We're still finding that people aren't aware that they could be over the drug driving limit 24, 58, 72 hours after last having cocaine or cannabis.

"Just because you don't feel stoned, it doesn't mean you're not over the limit.

"If you're over the limit you could lose you licence, then your job and your home. Even worse you could kill yourself or someone else.

"We've got more officers trained to use drug wipes than ever before so if you drug drive you're more likely to be caught than ever before.

"You have to ask yourself - is the high worth the low?"
