We have released this e-fit following reports a teenager complained of burning to his mouth after drinking a liquid in Grays.

The 14-year-old reported that he was in conversation with a man about health and fitness in Elm Park Road on Wednesday 26 August.

The man then produced a bottle full of liquid and then put a yellow tablet in it.

The boy took it home and drunk from it at around 11pm the following day, where he reported he suffered a sudden and severe burning sensation.

He quickly spat it out and did not require hospital treatment.

The suspect has been described as being black, 5'11, had short black hair and he was of a muscular build.

The victim said he spoke softly and slowly and her wore charcoal grey running shorts and a lighter grey vest that had sweat patches on it.

Detective Inspector James Healy, of Grays CID, said: "We want identify this man in connection with our investigation and we would urge people to come forward.
