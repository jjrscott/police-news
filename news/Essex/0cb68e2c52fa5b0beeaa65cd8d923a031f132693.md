Criminals had nowhere to hide during a policing operation covering the main roads and rail network between Essex, Kent and London.

Officers from Essex, Kent, the Metropolitan Police and British Transport Police worked together to mainly target criminals crossing borders to transport drugs yesterday, Monday 8 June.

The intelligence-led patrols also used Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras to identify suspect vehicles.

Overall, 27 people were arrested including a number for drugs and weapons offences.

In Essex, there were nine arrests for suspected offences including drugs supply and drug-driving. Four uninsured vehicles were also seized.

A woman was arrested on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon after officers stopped an Audi A3 near the M11 at Chigwell and officers found a large knife while searching the car.

The driver, a 19-year-old woman from Hertford, was arrested and later released under investigation while we continue our enquiries.

The operation was part of our ongoing work in Essex under Operation Sceptre to take robust action against those involved in drugs supply and the violent crime and exploitation of vulnerable people that often goes hand in hand with the drugs market.

We also work closely with other organisations and charities to educate people around the dangers of drugs and knife crime to help them make better choices for their lives.

Operation Sceptre lead Chief Inspector Lewis Basford: "Working with our colleagues in Kent, the Metropolitan Police and British Transport Police, we targeted the road and rail networks because we know these are the arteries of crime used by criminals associated with drugs and serious crime.

"We disrupted a number of criminals, and we know even offences such as drug-driving and traffic offences are linked to some of our serial offenders and the few individuals responsible for our most harmful crimes.

"Crime has no borders, so joint operations such as this are key to disrupting criminals who cross into Essex and neighbouring counties."

If you have information about anyone involved in drugs, weapon carrying or exploitation, please tell us so we can take action and ensure vulnerable people are protected.

If you don't want to speak to the police, contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or https://crimestoppers-uk.org. They are an independent charity and you will remain 100% anonymous.
