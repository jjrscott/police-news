### A man who attacked another teenager with a hammer following a dispute over a picture posted on Instagram has been jailed.

Lee Sexton had sent the victim a series of abusive messages on 4 April after the victim had tagged Sexton's girlfriend in a picture on Instagram.

Later that day Sexton confronted the victim in the car park of the Co-op in East Street.

He struck the victim over the head with a hammer causing him to fall the floor.

The victim managed to get way and Sexton then left the scene.

The entire attack was caught on dash cam footage while a forensic examination of a hammer found by officers at the scene had DNA matching Sexton's on it.

Sexton, 19, was arrested at his home address in Elm Walk, Rayne that evening and was later charged.

Appearing at Ipswich Crown Court in January he admitted GBH with intent and possession of an offensive weapon.

A charge of possession of a knife in a public place was allowed to lie of file.

At the same court on 28 April he was jailed for a total of three years.

Investigating officer PC Vicki Fairchild, from Braintree CID, said: "This was an extremely vicious attack which could have left the victim with some really serious injuries.

"Lee Sexton had become angered by a photo on the internet and armed himself for a violent confrontation.

"He will now spend the next few years in prison and I hope he uses that time to consider the consequences of his actions.

"I would also like to thank the member of public who helped us by providing the dash cam footage.

"Dash cam footage can provide really important evidence, as it did in this case, and we really appreciate it."
