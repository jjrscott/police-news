### A special portal has been set up for anyone who wants to report to us information about the murder of Dwayne Forrester in Pitsea.

Dwayne was just 21 when he was found stabbed in Little Garth at around 8.45pm on 7 July 2018.

Officers have taken 377 statements, seized 755 exhibits, and viewed more than 180 hours of CCTV footage.

Six people were arrested in connection with Dwayne's murder and three men - aged 19, 23, and 24 - arrested on suspicion of murder remain released under investigation.

Officers have been out across Pitsea delivering leaflets with details of the Crimestoppers reward of up to Â£10,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for Dwayne's death.

You can find out more about their reward here: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/campaigns-media/news/2019/sep/we-offer-reward-to-help-catch-those-responsible-fo

A portal has now been set up to allow you to report information to us: https://mipp.police.uk/operation/4201020118N33-PO2

Senior investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Julie Gowen, from the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said: "The answers to Dwayne's murder are out there and they're in the community.

"Dwayne's family have been left devastated by his death and it's really important we can provide them answers about who killed him and why.

"Relationships and loyalties can change in two years and if you have information about what happened to Dwayne and haven't come forward, now is the time. You could really make a difference."

As well as reporting information through the portal, you can also call us on 101 quoting incident 1418 of 7 July 2018.

If you don't feel comfortable speaking to us, you can also contact Crimestoppers 100 percent anonymously on 0800 555 111.
