This week we will be recognising and celebrating the work of our response officers in support of the first national Response Policing Wellbeing and Recognition Week.

Response officers in our Local Policing Teams are often the first on scene following a 999 or 101 call and must be prepared to deal with an exceptional range of incidents that may be complex, life-threatening or confrontational.

At the start of their day, they will not know what incidents they will respond to and could be called to an assault, burglary, arson or concern for welfare when on duty. Although each case may be different, our officers will be there to detect and prevent crime, and to support and protect members of our community when they may be at their most vulnerable.

Our Local Policing Teams consist of police officers, Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs) and Special Constables all dedicated to responding to incidents. When not attending emergencies, they also carry out high visibility patrols and gather intelligence to act on crimes in their community.

Assistant Chief Constable Rachel Nolan, who oversees the Local Policing Teams in Essex, said: "Our response officers will often be the first on scene to support members of the public in their time of need. They attend a huge variety of incidents prepared for any challenge they may face and no two situations are ever the same.

"I'm delighted that the hard work of our officers is being recognised this week and look forward to showcasing the variety of this vital area of policing and jobs our officers may respond to on any given shift."

As part of the week, we will be following the journeys of some of our local response officers and showcasing the work they do to catch criminals and keep Essex safe. Our District Commanders will also be accompanying local officers on patrol, so if you have a question or concern, please stop them and say hello!

Chief Constable Ben-Julian Harrington praised the hard work of our Local Policing Teams, saying: "I would like to take this opportunity to thank our response officers for the incredible work they do. Not only do they prevent, tackle and investigate crime right from the very start of an incident, but they are a constant reassurance and visible support to members of the Essex community right across Essex.

"The assistance they provide leaves a long-lasting impression of Essex Police on both residents and visitors to Greater Essex. I am immensely proud of their decisive, often life-saving, actions which take place every hour of every single day."
