A man who hit another man in the face with a glass bottle in a bar in Billericay has been jailed for 11 years.

Charles Cory, 34, of De Paul Way, Brentwood, was sentenced at Basildon Crown Court on Tuesday 31 March for grievous bodily harm with intent after he previously admitted the offence at court.

On 30 March 2019, Cory was talking to a woman in French Martini, in Western Road. She went on to dance with another man, frustrating Cory, who threw liquid from a glass at the man before striking him in the face with a glass bottle.

This caused several deep cuts to his face and the victim was left heavily bleeding.

We arrived on scene and located the victim and witnesses and obtained all accounts.

We identified Cory as the suspect before finally locating him to his place of work the following day and arresting him.

He was jailed for nine years and seven months for the assault, and another one year and five months for breaching a suspended sentence, to run concurrently.

Investigating officer PC Tyler Hadlow said: "Cory approached the victim from behind, threw liquid over him and then struck him in the face once he turned around.

"The glass shattered as it hit his face and Cory ran from the scene after staff attempted to detain him.

"As a result of the attack, the victim suffered from several permanently visible injuries, which consisted of deep cuts to his forehead, nose and cheek, as well as severe bruising.

"This was a completely unprovoked attack and it was found that Cory had used a weapon intending to cause as much damage as possible.

"This week he received 11 years in prison for his cowardly actions."
