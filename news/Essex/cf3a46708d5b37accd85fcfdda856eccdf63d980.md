### Officers investigating an incident where a woman was subjected to racial abuse in Harlow have charged a man with 13 offences.

We were made aware of a video circulating on social media which reportedly showed a woman being racially abused in the Terminus Street area.

It was also reported the victim had been subjected to similar abuse outside the ASDA at the Watergardens on Friday.

A 20 year-old man was arrested shortly before 7am yesterday (Tuesday 19 May).

Jake Hamill, of Peterswood, Harlow, has now been charged with four counts of assault by beating, two counts of racially or religiously aggravated intentional harassment, six counts of using threatening, abusive, or insulting words or behaviour to cause harassment, alarm or distress, and one count of stalking.

He is due to appear at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court today (Wednesday 20 May).

The charges relate to a number of incidents between 21 January and 18 May this year.
