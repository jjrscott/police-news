### Watch as one of our officers chases down and arrests a teenager who had been seen to throw a knife under a car.

Officers from B shift of the Community Policing Team and the Special Constabulary were on patrol in Greenstead after a Section 60 Stop and Search Authority had been put in place, following an increase in reports of weapons being used in the area.

They saw a man acting suspiciously when, after seeing the officers, he pretended to trip over near to a parked car.The officers approached, searched under the car and found a knife.

As the officers went to arrest the man, he ran off. However, despite his efforts, he was caught and arrested.

Jordan Salifatu, 18, of Radbourne Crescent, London, was charged with being in possession of a knife in a public place and was sentenced to a four month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court on Monday 10 August after pleading guilty to the offence.

"We are committed to doing everything we can to tackle serious violence, particularly knife crime in Colchester," said Sergeant Jones from the Community Policing Team.

"We will continue to work hard to keep people safe, take weapons off our streets and take action against those who choose to carry them."

Chief Constable BJ Harrington said: "This is an example of the work going on across Essex and what my officers do day-in, day-out.

"The officer showed professionalism in the measured approach to carrying out the stop and search, and persistence and dedication to catch up Silifatu after he made off.

"This kind of work is taking place across the county as my officers catch criminals and keep you safe."
