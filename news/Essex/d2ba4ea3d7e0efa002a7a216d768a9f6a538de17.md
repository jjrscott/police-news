### A drug dealer found with cocaine on him during a vehicle stop has been jailed for four years.

Besjan Mustafaj was stopped in a car on the A124 in Barking by officers investigating six deaths in south Essex last July which were believed to be linked to Class A drugs.

The investigation later found there was no clear, significant evidence to link those who died.

When he was stopped Mustafaj, 26, of Ashford Road, London E6, was found to have a bag of white powder which, when tested later, was confirmed to be cocaine.

A number of mobile phones were also found within the vehicle and when officers carried out a search of an address linked to Mustafaj, they found more than Â£1,300 in cash and suspected Class A drugs.

He appeared at Basildon Magistrates' Court on 6 March where admitted one charge of possession with intent to supply Class A Drugs and one charge of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs.

He was jailed for a total of four years.
