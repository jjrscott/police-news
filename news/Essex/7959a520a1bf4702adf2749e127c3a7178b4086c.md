Between 26 March 2020 when national lockdown measures came into force and 28 February 2021:

 * we attended 194,754 incidents, of these, 13,765 were Covid-related incidents which is 7.1% of the total
 * we arrested 59 people on suspicion of Covid-related incidents
 * we handed out 1,242 fixed penalty notices** for Covid-related offences
 * 1.7% of people think we have been too tough*

Our officers and staff have had to adapt to the challenges of the past 12 months, the same as everyone else.

As you can see, the vast majority of people in Essex have stuck to the Covid regulations and united to help to keep everyone safe from coronavirus. Thank you.
