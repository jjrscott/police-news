The local boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was charged following a disturbance in Witham on Sunday 12 January.

Detective Chief Inspector Julie Gowen said:" This was a horrific crime, where the victim's home was invaded, and she was subjected to a violent attack. No-one should have to go through this in their own home, which is the one place where you should feel safe.

"I would like to praise the courage of the victim for her assistance she has provided to the Police in this case. We will be continuing to provide her with support throughout the investigation."

The 17-year old is next due to appear for sentencing on Monday 30 March at Chelmsford Crown Court.
