**We are investigating a robbery in Stanway, Colchester, which took place late last night, Thursday 25 March.**

The victim was walking near to a lake off Churchfields Avenue, at about 10pm, when he was attacked by at least five men, all of whom were wearing masks.

They were also carrying knives and hammers.

The victim, a man in his 20s, was hit on his head with a hammer and then set upon while he was on the ground.

He had his wallet, Â£50 in cash and a gold chain taken before he was able to get away from the group.

He then managed to make contact with a friend who in turn called the emergency services.

The victim was taken to hospital with facial injuries, including a fractured eye socket, and bruising to his torso.

We are appealing for any witnesses who may have heard or seen anything in the area around that time.

Unfortunately, we do not have any additional details of the attackers.
