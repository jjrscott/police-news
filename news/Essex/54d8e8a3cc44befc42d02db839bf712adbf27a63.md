### We would like to speak to them about theft of bank cards earlier this month .

It was reported that on Saturday 12 September, at around 10.50am, a man approached a woman whilst she was loading shopping into her car in Morrisons supermarket carpark on Wycke Hill in Maldon.

While the man was asking for directions, bank cards were removed from the woman's purse, which were in her bag on the front seat of her car.

The cards were then used to withdraw a three figure sum of cash.

It is thought that the man could have been with another man, who was reported to stand very close to the woman as she used her PIN to pay for her shopping.

If you recognised these men or have any information about who they are, please get in contact with the Maldon Local Policing team by making a report online.

Alternatively you can call us on 101 or provide information completely anonymously by contacting independent charity Crimestoppers, completely anonymously.

**Please reference 42/145717/20 when providing information.
** This will ensure your information gets to the right person as quickly as possible.
