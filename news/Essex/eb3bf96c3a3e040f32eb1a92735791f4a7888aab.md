A man has been found not guilty of his alleged involvement in the death of Daniel Adger in 2017.

Mr Adger was attacked inside a flat in Eden Green, South Ockendon, on the afternoon of Monday 21 August 2017.

After he'd left the flat, he managed to raise the alarm to passers-by, whilst a man continued to attack him with a machete causing injuries to his legs, body and head.

Despite the quick intervention and first aid from passers-by, he died whilst being transferred to hospital.

On Tuesday 2 March, Luis Jordan was found not guilty of murder after a trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court.

The 36-year-old, of Church Road in Manor Park, was found guilty of conspiracy to supply crack cocaine and heroin, but not guilty of robbery, possession of a firearm, and causing grievous bodily harm.

He was sentenced the same day to eight years in prison.

Senior investigating officer, Chief Inspector Daniel Stoten, of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said: "This was a complex investigation that needed to be considered by a jury. My thoughts are with Mr Adger's family at this difficult time."

Two men have previously been jailed for Mr Adger's murder.
