**A man who carried out a series of burglaries and robberies in Brentwood has been jailed.**

Between 26 October and 8 November last year, Jamie Estabrook carried out three burglaries and four robberies at business premises in Brentwood.

In one incident he assaulted a shop worker as they were closing up, punching him to the face from behind before grabbing his bag and making off.

He also targeted the same Tesco Express store in London Road four times - burgling it three times and carry out one of the robberies there.

Officers studied CCTV footage from the shops and were able to identify the 34 year-old seized clothing worn during the incidents from his address in Kings Road, Brentwood.

He was charged and later admitted three counts of burglary and four counts of robbery.

At Basildon Crown Court on Tuesday 30 March he was jailed for four and-a-half years.

Detective Sergeant David Wilkinson, from Brentwood CID, said:

"Jamie Estabrook is a prolific burglar and robber and has little regard for the possessions of others.

"He will have created a huge amount of fear to those working in the shops during the robberies and no-one should be left feeling that way in their work place.

"Through our thorough investigation we were able to gather evidence against him which left him with no option but to admit his crimes.

"He will now spend the foreseeable future in prison."
