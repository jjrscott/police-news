**We're appealing for witnesses after it is thought a car was deliberately set on fire in Great Dunmow.**

We were called around 8.30pm on Tuesday 10 November with reports that a car was on fire outside an address on Ash Grove.

The victims reported hearing a loud bang and when they looked outside, they saw that their car was on fire.

Thankfully the fire didn't spread any further and no one was hurt, but the car was completely destroyed.

Detectives from our criminal investigation department are keen to speak to anyone who lives, or was in the area, around this time and saw or heard any suspicious behaviour.

We're particularly keen to hear from those who have dash cam, CCTV or doorbell footage.

If you have any information, please go to our website home page.

Between 7am-11pm you can provide information directly to one of our online operators by selecting the 'Live Chat' button at the bottom right of the page.

This will ensure your report is dealt with as quickly as possible.

Alternatively, you can submit an online report or call 101.

Information can also be given to independent charity Crimestoppers completely anonymously.

**Please reference incident 1268 of 10 November when providing any information** to ensure it gets to the investigating officer as quickly as possible.

Thank you to all those who have come forward with information so far.
