We are continuing to patrol Bradwell-on-Sea today, Thursday 13 August, as part of our operations to tackle an unauthorised music event.

These patrols follow the enforcement action we took in the district yesterday.

Two men, aged 23 from London, were arrested yesterday on suspicion of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance.

They have since been released under investigation.

The vehicle, music equipment and vehicle continue to remain in our possession.

We put a dispersal order in place in Southend last night to help deal with a large group that had gathered close to Sealife Centre.

We arrested a 20-year-old woman from London on suspicion of using threatening behaviour to cause harassment. She has since accepted an adult conditional caution.

Chief Superintendent Glen Pavelin said: "I understand local people in Bradwell-on-Sea have concerns that groups of people may come to the beach today.

"Our operations continue to remain in place and I want to reassure people that this event will not take place.

"We would like to thank the communities in Bradwell-on-Sea and Southend for their support yesterday.

"We took robust action, we seized a second generator ahead of its arrival and we made another arrest.

"A small section of the group threw objects at my officers. This will not be tolerated and we will carry out our enquiries to locate those individuals.

"We continue to rely on your information about unauthorised events. Please report any info, no matter how small, on 101 or by visiting www.essex.police.uk.

"Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
