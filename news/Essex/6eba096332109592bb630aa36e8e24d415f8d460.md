Here at Essex Police, we are constantly thinking of new and innovative ways to help people, keep them safe and to catch criminals.

We have seen many changes over the decades with some really fantastic capabilities but one thing has remained strong over our 180 year history - our commitment to protecting and serving all communities.

As part of Essex 2020's celebration of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Maths (STEAM), we will be showcasing the abilities of our many teams.

Today's video features our drones team and the vital role specialist equipment plays in many varying scenarios.

Essex 2020 is a year-long, countywide celebration that highlights the county's enterprising past while inspiring a future for science and creativity in Essex.

We are recruiting police officers, special constables and detectives at Essex Police.
