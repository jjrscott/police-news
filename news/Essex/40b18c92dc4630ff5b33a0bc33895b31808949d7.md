### We know that the last six months have been really challenging and we want to say thank you to everyone across Essex who've been doing their bit to keep each other safe from COVID-19.

We're urging you to keep doing what you've been doing now the Government's 'Rule of Six' regulations have come into force.

Assistant Chief Constable Andy Prophet said: "I know the last few months have been really challenging for everyone.

"The vast majority of people across Essex have been doing the right thing and I want to thank you for that.

"We are now being asked to go that little bit further again and not meet up with friends or family in groups of more than six.

"I know that'll be really tough for some people and I appreciate the sacrifices we're being making to help keep everyone safe.

"My officers will continue to be out across Essex, in your communities.

"Our approach has been, and will continue to be, engaging with the public, explaining the regulations, and encouraging people to do the right thing.

"We've found that approach has been really successful.

"Where it is absolutely necessary, reasoned conversations have failed, and it's right to do so, we will issue people with fines.

"The compassion, resilience, and determination from the community to keep each other safe has been outstanding and is important to getting us through these unprecedented times.

"Our job is to protect and serve the people of Essex, catch criminals and keep you all safe.

"We'll be out patrolling our open spaces and town centres to tackle any criminals who may seek to take advantage of the situation through anti-social behaviour or by attempting to carry out more serious crimes.

"Please keep reporting anything criminal or suspicious to us. We are here to protect and serve the county."
