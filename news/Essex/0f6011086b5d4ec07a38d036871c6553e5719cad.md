Officers have seized drugs and cash totalling around Â£85,000 during ongoing work to disrupt criminals involved in drug dealing in the Maldon district.

The Maldon Town Centre Team has been working with colleagues in other teams across the force to gather information and evidence to identify offenders and carry out search warrants under the Misuse of Drugs Act.

They have made a number of arrests, taken a significant quantity of drugs out of circulation and seized cash believed to have been earned through criminal activity.

PC Ryan Mutlow said: "We are working every day to ensure our communities are safe and are taking robust action against the minority of people who are involved in the sale of illegal drugs.

"We will not tolerate drug dealing, which is closely associated with violence and the exploitation of vulnerable people.

"I want to thank the community for your ongoing support, as your information is really important in helping us gather the evidence we need to target those involved and bring offenders to justice."

On Saturday 8 August, officers searched a car in Hillary Close, Heybridge, and found a five figure sum of money, a hammer, metal pole, and a large quantity of suspected class A and B drugs.

Two men aged 22 and 31 from Heybridge were arrested on suspicion of a public order offence, possession with intent to supply drugs, possession of offensive weapon, and criminal damage. They have been released under investigation while we continue our enquiries.

We've also carried out search warrants at an address in Wood Road, Heybridge, on 29 July and another in Fitch's Crescent, Maldon, on 4 May.

A large quantity of cash and suspected drugs were seized.

At the Heybridge address, a 19-year-old woman from Maldon and a 25-year-old man from Heybridge were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply drugs.

At the Maldon address, we arrested a 56-year-old man on suspicion of being concerned in supplying a controlled drug, and a 20-year-old man on suspicion of possession with intent to supply drugs and possession of drugs.

All four have been released under investigation.

Richard Holmes, director of service delivery at Maldon District Council, said; "I am really pleased that this operation has been so successful and that a large quantity of drugs and weapons have been taken off of our streets.

"The excellent work of Essex Police's Town Centre Team is ensuring that criminal activity in the district is disrupted and those responsible are brought before the courts, and this gives a clear message that such activity will not be tolerated."

We're carrying out work every day under Operation Sceptre to target those involved in serious violence, such as knife crime and drugs crime. Find out more at https://www.essex.police.uk/opsceptre
