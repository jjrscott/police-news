**We are appealing for witnesses after a man was attacked with a machete on Canvey Island.**

The victim, a man aged in his 30s, suffered injuries to his neck and wrist during the attack, at about 10pm on Saturday 27 March.

He reported cycling through an alleyway between The Weald and Link Road when he was confronted by a group of four or five, which included boys and girls, all of whom were dressed in black.

When he asked what they were doing, he was attacked by members of the group and was stabbed in the wrist and shoulder area.

The victim was taken to hospital for treatment. Thankfully his injuries are neither life-threatening nor life-changing.

One of the boys is described as 6ft tall and was wearing a grey hooded top and a green gilet.
