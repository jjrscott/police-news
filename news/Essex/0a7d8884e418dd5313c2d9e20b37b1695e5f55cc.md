### We're appealing for dash cash footage after a woman was taken to hospital with potentially life-changing injuries following a road traffic collision in Basildon yesterday, Sunday 9 August.

****

**We were called around 5.30pm with reports that a motorcycle had been in collision with a pedestrian on St. Nicholas Road at the junction with Leinster Road as she crossed the road.**

Officers and paramedics arrived and a woman in her 40s was taken to hospital by air ambulance, with serious, potentially life-changing, injuries.

The motorcyclist failed to stop following the collision.

A 26-year-old man from Basildon was later arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving, failing to stop at the scene of an accident and failing to report an accident.

He remains in police custody.

##### Anyone who witnessed the incident or has dash cam footage of the collision, or the moments before it, are asked to please email our Serious Collision Investigation Unit

Alternatively you can call 101 or independent charity Crimestoppers completely anonymously.

Please reference 42/122600/20 when reporting any information in relation to this incident.
