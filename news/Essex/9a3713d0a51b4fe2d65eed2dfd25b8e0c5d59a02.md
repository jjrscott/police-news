Twelve people were arrested during a joint operation with our colleagues in the Metropolitan Police.

Our roads policing, operational support group and dog unit teams, including Special Constables, were looking for criminals using the roads in the Thurrock district and east London on Thursday 2 April.

It was part of Operation Sceptre, our ongoing work to tackle serious violent crime, especially knife crime.

The arrests included:

Three men were arrested on suspicion of robbery.

 * Two people were arrested on suspicion of theft of fuel after a car failed to stop for police in Thurrock. It was later found to contain a number of cans of suspected stolen fuel.
 * A driver was arrested on suspicion of handling stolen goods after a Range Rover with false number plates was stopped. It was found to have been stolen.
 * A driver was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving, drug driving and failing to stop for police.
 * Two people were arrested on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon. Two large knives were seized.

Superintendent Craig Saunders said: "We regularly work with neighbouring forces to help catch criminals who cross over county borders to commit crime and this was just one example of this partnership work.

"Every day we're targeting offenders involved in violent crime and we're committed to keeping our communities safe

"Information from the public is vital to our work and really does make a difference.

"If you know someone is carrying a weapon or involved in crime, or you are worried that someone is being exploited by criminals, please tell us so we can take appropriate action."
