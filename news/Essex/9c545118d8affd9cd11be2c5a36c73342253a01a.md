### A man's due to appear in court later this month following an investigation by officers investigating sexual offences against children.

It followed a call reporting concerns about contact between a man and a 15 year-old girl in Maldon on 25 March.

A 31 year-old man was arrested following day by officers from the Management of Violent Offenders and Sexual Offenders team (MOSOVO).

Joe McCallum, of Destination Drive, Colchester was then charged with four counts of breaching an interim sexual harm prevention order.

He appeared at Colchester Magistrates' Court on 27 March and is next due to appear at Chelmsford Crown Court on 24 April.
