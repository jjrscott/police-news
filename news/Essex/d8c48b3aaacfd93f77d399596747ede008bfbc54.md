### A convicted sex offender has been jailed after he was found with indecent images of children.

Officers from our Police Online Investigation Team (POLIT) executed a warrant at a Sible Hedingham address in November 2019 after receiving information that Stuart Broom had indecent images of children on his phone, contrary to his Sex Offender Notification Requirements.

During the search, officers found a mobile phone secretly hidden within the premises, to prevent officers from finding it during routine monitoring visits.

Officers also found a small quantity of cannabis at the address.
The phone was checked and found to contain indecent images and videos of children.

Broom, 41, of Bewick Court, appeared at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court on 27 January this year.

He admitted three counts of making indecent images, one count of possession of extreme pornographic images and possession of cannabis.

He was jailed for 18 months and given a 10-year Sexual Harm Prevention Order when he appeared at Chelmsford Crown Court on 24 February for sentencing.

The investigating officer Pc Adam Colbear, said:

"At the heart of every one of this vile images is a child victim, who is being abused for the gratification of people like Broom.

"Each time those images are viewed or shared, those children are exploited time and again. No child should ever have to suffer like that."
