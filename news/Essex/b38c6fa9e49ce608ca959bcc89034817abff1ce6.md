We are continuing to investigate a disturbance in which a man was injured in Southend.

Officers are carrying out enquiries and extra patrols following the incident in the High Street, near The Peterboat pub.

A group of men were reported to have been involved in a fight shortly after 6.10pm yesterday, Saturday 20 June.

A 26-year-old man from Wickford was taken to hospital with multiple cuts. He was treated for his injuries and has been discharged from hospital.

A 30-year-old man of no fixed address was arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. Has been released under investigation while we continue our enquiries.

Chief Inspector Chris Bradford said: "Officers were on scene quickly last night to respond to this incident and have been carrying out extensive enquiries overnight.

"Detectives continue to progress their investigation today to establish the circumstances behind this incident and identify those responsible.

"Officers have been speaking to witnesses and reviewing camera footage, and I'd like to thank members of the public who have been assisting us so far.

"One man has been arrested in connection with the incident and we continue to progress our enquiries to identify anyone else that may have been involved.

"We are working alongside Southend Borough Council to have extra patrols in the area today, and I'd ask anyone with information about the incident or any concerns to please speak to them, or to call us."

Following the disturbance, officers were authorised to use additional stop and search powers under Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.

This was in place between 6.39pm until 9.39pm in parts of Southend.

Chief Inspector Bradford said: "We used these additional powers to help us identify anyone who may have been intent on causing crime and to keep people safe.

"Fortunately no further offences were identified, which is positive."

Anyone with information or CCTV, dash cam or mobile phone footage, is asked to call Southend CID on 101 quoting reference 42/89754/20.
