A man who raped a teenage girl has been jailed for five years.

Daniel Stott, 27, attacked her at a block of flats in the Boxted Avenue area of Clacton in November 2019.

He was arrested the following day and charged.

Stott, of Coke Street, Harwich, pleaded guilty to two counts of rape, one count of sexual assault by penetration, and one count of possession of cannabis when he appeared at Chelmsford Crown Court on Friday 5 March.

He was jailed for five years in total and placed on the Sex Offenders Register for life.

Detective Constable Reuben Brame, who carried out the investigation, said: "These were horrendous offences and have had a lasting impact on the young woman he attacked.

"I am pleased Stott has pleaded guilty to save her the further trauma of having to give evidence in court.

"She has shown great bravery in coming forward and speaking about what happened on that terrible day.

"Stott has been placed on the Sex Offenders Register for life and once he serves his prison sentence he will be regularly monitored.

"I would urge anyone who is a victim of sexual offences to please not be afraid of coming forward and reporting it. We will investigate and work to bring offenders to justice, and we work closely with other organisations to ensure you have the support you need."
