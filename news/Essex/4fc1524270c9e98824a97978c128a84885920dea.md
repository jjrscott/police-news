Following information about an unauthorised music event in Bradwell-on-Sea, we have taken steps to ensure that it will not take place today, Wednesday 12 August.

We received reports this morning about a possible event on Bradwell-on-Sea beach and we have officers at this location.

We have made two arrests for conspiracy to commit a public nuisance.

We are also considering dispersal order powers and we have the authority to stop any vehicle we suspect is travelling to the event within five-miles of the destination.

Chief Superintendent Glen Pavelin said: "We've acted swiftly after receiving reports of an unauthorised event on our beaches in Bradwell-on-Sea.

"We have officers at the location and two people are currently on their way to custody.

"We understand people and vehicles are travelling into Essex to attend this event.

"The message is clear, turn around or face being directed back home by our officers.

"We will use powers at our disposal to ensure this event will not take place.

"If you're coming to Bradwell-on-Sea to attend this event, you'll be disappointed."
