A man has appeared in court for drugs offences after officers on patrol in Harlow witnessed a drugs deal.

Semega Matoko was arrested on Tuesday 17 March following the incident in the area around Rectory Wood.

Suspected class A drugs were found in his possession and at his home address.

The 35-year-old, of Chelsea Gardens, Harlow, was charged with possession with intent to supply heroin and cocaine.

He admitted the charges when he appeared at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 18 March and is due to be sentenced at Chelmsford Crown Court on Wednesday 15 April.

The patrols were part of Operation Sceptre, which is part of our ongoing work to tackle serious violence in a public place, particularly knife crime.

Detective Sergeant James Paget said: "Tackling violence and protecting vulnerable people are our highest priorities and we will continue to do everything we can to keep people safe from harm.

"Those involved in supplying and dealing drugs are part of a world where vulnerable people are exploited and live in fear of violence.

"If you have any concerns about drug dealing in your area, please tell us so we can take action."
