**We're offering more ways of reporting non-emergency crime and antisocial behaviour, making it easier and more convenient for you to get in contact with us.**

We're encouraging people to go online to make non-emergency reports to help ease demand on our 101 telephone service, enabling us to provide a better, more efficient service for our communities, and assist those asking for our help as quickly as possible.

One of the new ways of contacting us is through 'Live Chat'; our online chat service, which allows people to send and receive real-time direct messages with our online operators.

Every day between 7am-11pm, you can report non-emergency crime or provide us with information through this service, which you can access on the homepage of our website by selecting the 'Live Chat' button at the bottom right of the page.

The service can be accessed from a desktop computer, laptop, tablet or even a mobile phone, making it easier and more convenient for you to report non-emergency crime, antisocial-behaviour or share information with us.

If you don't want to use our Live Chat service, there are also options to submit a report or request information through our website. You can also do things like report a road traffic collision, tell us about something you've seen or heard, or report a COVID-19 breach.

**In an emergency you must always dial 999.** We still have our 24-hour 101 service which people can call if they feel it is more appropriate to speak to us or don't have access to the internet.

We are encouraging people to take time to visit our website and see for themselves the services available to them.
