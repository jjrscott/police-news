### We care about our communities and our priority is to protect and serve the people of Essex.

But we're not the only ones who care.

There are so many words to describe those who have gone above and beyond to help others during this challenging time; kind, considerate, reliable and of course caring.

Monday 18 May, marked the start of Mental Health Awareness Week with the focus being around kindness.

We wanted to once again show our carers, just how much we appreciate them and the kindness they show to others every day.

Thank you.
