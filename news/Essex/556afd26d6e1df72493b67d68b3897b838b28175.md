Our police officers and staff continue to be grateful for the life-saving work of the NHS.

Our Police Dogs from Essex Police's Dog Section are also frontline workers and they wanted to say their own thanks for Clap for Carers, or bark their support at least!

We hope you are all well and enjoy our video.
