Two people will appear in court on Monday 4 January, to face a charge of murder.

Leighton Snook, 28, of no fixed address and a 16-year-old boy from Leicester, who cannot be named for legal reasons, will both appear at Colchester Magistrates' Court to face a charge of murder.

The pair have been charged in connection with the death of Donald Ralph.

Tributes have been paid to an Aldham man, who was described as a unique character with boundless energy and enthusiasm.

Donald 'Don' Ralph, 83, (pictured above) was sadly found deceased at his home in Halstead Road shortly after 1pm on Tuesday 29 December.

His niece Tina Ralph said: "Don was a very young at heart, fit 83-year-old, with boundless energy, enthusiasm and enjoyment of life.

"He was a man who loved all things countryside, particularly fishing and the Norfolk Broads, as well as being an avid bird lover.

"He loved horse racing and spent many a happy Saturday having a little flutter.

"Don was a unique character, who will much missed by his wide circle of friends, and all his family."
