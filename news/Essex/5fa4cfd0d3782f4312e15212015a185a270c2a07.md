### A man from Grays has been sentenced over sexual activity with a child.

Luke Davis, 24, of Boscombe Avenue, Grays, has been jailed for 35 months and will remain on the registered sex offenders register indefinitely.

At Basildon Crown Court on 17 February 2020, Davis pleaded guilty to the charge and on 7 October 2020, he was sentenced to 35 months in prison.

He is prohibited from having unsupervised contact with any child under the age of 16 and will remain on the Registered Sex Offenders register indefinitely.

This case saw joint working between our Child Abuse Investigation Team, Adult Sexual Abuse Investigation Team and Investigating Officers at Grays police station.

From the Forensics Unit obtaining evidence from both parties' phones that secured the conviction, to the Officer In Case's report to the court listing how dangerous an offender David is, ensuring bail was not granted, all Essex Police officers went the extra mile to ensure this dangerous offender will no longer prey on children.

Investigating officer PC Ray Jackson of the Child Abuse Investigation Team said: "The victim showed exceptional bravery in coming forward and seeing the case through in support of police action.

"This was a successful prosecution of a dangerous individual preying on some of the most vulnerable in society."
