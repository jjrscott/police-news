A national scheme has been launched for people to hand in dangerous weapons.

It is illegal to have blades and weapons including knuckledusters, flick knives, batons, and rapid firing rifles in a public place.

But they will soon also be banned from private premises under The Offensive Weapons Act.

The Home Office is leading the national surrender scheme for people to hand in weapons that fall under the legislation.

It runs until 9 March 2021.

Specially trained officers will arrange for the safe collection of firearms.

Firearms owners are asked to make an appointment by contacting firearms@essex.police.uk or calling 101 extension 121222.

Anyone wishing to hand in knives under the scheme should make sure they are transported safely.

They can be handed in at the following police stations:

**South Essex**
Basildon Police Station, Great Oaks, Basildon SS14 1EJ
Southend Police Station, Victoria Avenue, Southend-on-Sea, SS2 6ES

**West Essex**
Harlow Police Station, The High, Harlow, CN20 1HG
Grays Police Station, Brook Road, Grays, RM17 5BX

**North Essex**
Colchester Police Station, 10 Southway, Colchester CO3 3BU
Clacton Police Station, 8 Beatrice Road, Clacton CO15 1ET
Braintree Police Station, Blyths Meadow, Braintree CM7 3DJ

Lawful owners of surrendered weapons can also claim compensation for items valued at more than Â£30 by completing a form at the above link.

Knives and bladed weapons can also be deposited in designated amnesty bins across Essex, however these will not be covered by the government's compensation scheme.

A list of locations can be found here.
