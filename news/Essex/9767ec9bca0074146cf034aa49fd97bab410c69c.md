A convicted sex offender has been jailed after he was found with indecent images of children.

The Management of Sexual Offenders and Violent Offenders (MOSOVO) team carried out a regular monitoring visit in February 2019 to ensure John Addy was complying with Sex Offender Notification Requirements.

His computers and a hard drive were checked and found to contain indecent images of children.

While under investigation for these offences, a further routine monitoring visit was carried out on 11 December.

Further computers and a hard drive were checked, and there was evidence Addy had used software designed to not retain his internet history. He was banned from doing this under the terms of a sexual harm prevention order.

The devices were checked and found to contain indecent images.

Addy, 69, of Carnarvon Road, Southend, appeared at Southend Magistrates' Court on 19 October this year.

He admitted six counts of making indecent images and one count of breaching a sexual harm prevention order.

He was jailed for a year at Basildon Crown Court on 3 December and his computer equipment will be destroyed.

Addy was also made subject of a sexual harm prevention order for ten years and was placed on the Sex Offenders Register for the same amount of time.

PC Emma Edwards said: "These types of offences are among the most abhorrent we investigate as police officers.

"Behind every image is a vulnerable child who is being exploited, causing immense emotional and physical harm.

"We will do everything we can to ensure children are kept safe and will take robust action against individuals such as Addy who seek out these vile images for their own gratification."
