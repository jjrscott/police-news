A drug dealer who was caught during an extensive investigation into the supply of heroin and crack cocaine in Clacton has been sentenced.

Officers carried out an investigation into two county lines between July 2019 and January this year, gathering evidence that resulted in a series of dawn raids across Clacton, Colchester, Braintree and London in February.

It was part Operation Sceptre, our ongoing work to tackle serious violent crime including drugs and knife crime.

Barry White had been caught supplying drugs four times between October and November last year for the T Line, one of the gangs lines taken out during the police operation.

White, who also used the name Barry Hales, was arrested on 15 May.

The 41-year-old, of no fixed address, admitted supplying drugs during police interview.

He said he was addicted to drugs, spending up to £50 a day on his habit, and sold them in return for getting drugs for himself.

White was charged with four counts of supplying diamorphine and three counts of supplying crack cocaine, which he admitted at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court on 16 May.

He was sentenced at Chelmsford Crown Court on Monday 27 July to two years in prison, suspended for two years.

He was ordered to complete 100 hours of unpaid work and placed on a rehabilitation programme. He was also ordered to pay a £149 victim surcharge.

Detective Sergeant Phil Terry, of Clacton CID, said: "The court spared White an immediate jail term in order to give him a chance rehabilitate and consider if this criminal lifestyle is really worth it.

"I hope he takes the opportunity to do so.

"Drugs gangs exploit vulnerable people, including those with addictions.

"They use them to sell and store drugs, which keeps them under the gangs' control and traps these individuals in a vicious circle of crime and addiction.

"There is no long term future to be had in dealing drugs, and those involved will only ever be looking over their shoulder, because not only will the police be watching them, but so will rival criminals.

"However there is an alternative and we work with other organisations within the criminal justice system, local authorities and charities to support people who want to get out of the criminal lifestyle."
