### Two drug dealers have been sentenced after officers seized 134 wraps of cocaine.

Owen Kelly and Joseph Okello were arrested at Okello's home in Boleyn Gardens, Brentwood, on November 19 last year.

Thirty wraps of cocaine were found inside Okello's trainers. A wrap of cocaine was found in the luggage compartment of Kelly's moped and another 103 were inside in the property.

Officers also confiscated Â£390.

Both were arrested and charged with possession with intent to supply cocaine.
They admitted the charges at Basildon Magistrates' Court on November 20 and were sentenced at Basildon Crown Court on Monday 23 March.

Okello, 21, of Boleyn Gardens, Brentwood, was jailed for three years.
Kelly, 20, of no fixed address, was given a two year jail term suspended for two years. He must complete 200 hours of unpaid work and a rehabilitation activity.

Investigation officer PC Jodie Barnes said: "Drug dealing causes so much harm on many levels. Dealers groom and exploit people who may not realise they are being used by the people they consider to be friends.

"They also take advantage of vulnerable people and use violence to maintain loyalty.

"We work hard every day to take down drugs gangs and bring those involved to justice.

"But we also need your help.

"Information from the public is vital to help us identify and deal with offenders, but also to identify and support vulnerable people who may be exploited by criminals."
