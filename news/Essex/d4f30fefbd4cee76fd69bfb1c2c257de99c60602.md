Despite appalling running conditions and no crowds to cheer him on, Special Inspector Andy Jamieson completed his first London Marathon for eight years, raising Â£350 for a very special charity.

Andy is a member of Harlow Community Policing Team so, of course, when it came to organising his virtual 26.2-mile route, he chose to go local and picked one which took him around Harlow.

"I'm not a runner but I did the London Marathon in 2012 and wanted to do it again. Having applied every year since, I was fortunate enough to get a ballot place for this year only for COVID-19 to strike! I've deferred my place until next year when, hopefully, we can run a more traditional Virgin Money London Marathon.

"But, as I was running to raise money for the Care of Police Survivors charity, I entered this year's virtual race. Although the conditions on Sunday were appalling, made even harder without the crowds to lift my spirits, I managed to complete the distance in just over seven hours, after getting cramp from about halfway. Whilst I won't be giving the elite runners any sleepless nights, I hope to improve next year!

"I wanted to raise money for COPS as I get to see first-hand the amazing work my colleagues do and how they put themselves in danger to protect others.

"When one of us tragically pays the ultimate price, as Sgt Matiu Ratana did in Croydon last month, there is a public outcry but the families of those officers need ongoing support and this is provided by COPS."
