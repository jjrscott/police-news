### Essex Police has been successfully using dispersal order powers to prevent and deter people who have been planning to hold unlicensed music events in recent weeks.

Orders placed in Chalkwell and Benfleet last weekend were the results of successful work between police, partners and the local community, to put measures in to place to prevent illegal activity and keep people safe.

Information about such events from the local community is a key part of our ability to establish whether events are being planned and put measures in place to stop them for the safety of everyone.

Dispersal orders give officers the power to direct anyone causing antisocial behaviour to leave a defined area.

The decision to put one in place is done so with the safety of the local community in mind as well as those who are looking to possibly attended an illegal event. We appreciate the support from the public on reporting these matters, and we encourage the continued reporting of any illegal events they hear about.

**We understand that as the weather improves and the restrictions upon us relating to the pandemic are eased people want to have a good time. We do all need to be mindful of our own safety and the safety of others.**
