**In the tenth week of#ClapForCarers** **, we 've called upon some of our brilliant volunteers to lend a hand.**

Special Constables Green and Williamson are joined by Special Sergeant Nowicka to lead this week's clap to say thank you to our carers, key workers and community volunteers for keeping our county safe during this challenging time.

Our Specials are volunteers who help to do just that and, ahead of National Volunteers' Week next week, we'd like to say a huge thank you to them for all their dedication, with many putting in extra hours to support the local community during the past few months.
