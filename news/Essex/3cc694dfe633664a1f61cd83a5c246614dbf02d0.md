### Drugs thought to have an estimated street value of more than two millions pounds, have been recovered by officers in Southend.

Almost 3000 suspected cannabis plants were found at Grainer Road industrial estate, after a warrant was executed during the early hours of Sunday 19 April.
Five units containing a total of 2,878 plants were found during the search.

The operation was led by the Southend's proactive policing team and supported by officers from the force's search team and operational support group. Officers continue to work in partnership with colleagues at Essex County Fire and Rescue Service, UK Power Networks and the local authority to remove and destroy the drugs.

Two men from Southend were arrested and subsequently charged with being concerned in the production of Class B drugs.

Emiljan Gjura, 31 of no fixed address and Ermir Reshiti, 35, of no fixed address have been remanded in custody and are due to appear at Chelmsford Magistrate's Court on Monday 20 April.

Southend District Commander, Chief Inspector Ian Hughes said: "This is an excellent result, not just for Southend, but the entire county.

"Drug expert witnesses estimate the drugs would have been worth in excess of two million pounds on the street, and I have no doubt this seizure will have a big impact on the drugs market in Southend.

"Drugs destroy lives and we will continue to do everything in our power to get them off our streets and bring those responsible for supplying and distributing them, to justice."
