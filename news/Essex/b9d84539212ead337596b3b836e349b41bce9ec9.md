### We are appealing for witness following a stabbing in the underpass on Third Avenue, Harlow on Saturday 7 November.

We were called at around 2.30pm after a teenage boy had been found with stab wounds and taken to hospital with serious injuries.

We are keen to speak to a group of four men seen in the area of Northbrooks shortly before and after the incident.

A 16-year old boy was arrested on Tuesday 10 November, on suspicion of GBH and two counts of robbery. He has been released on bail until Saturday 5 December.

If you have any information, please go to our website home page.
Between 7am-11pm you can provide information directly to one of our online operators by selecting the 'Live Chat' button at the bottom right of the page.

Alternatively, you can submit an online report here or call 101.

Information can also be given to independent charity Crimestoppers completely anonymously.

Please reference incident 639 of 7 November when providing any information to ensure it gets to the investigating officer as quickly as possible.
