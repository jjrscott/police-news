A drug dealer has been jailed after officers responded to community concerns about drug taking.

Officers went to the multi-occupancy house in Ipswich Road, Colchester, on 22 March following reports of a strong smell of cannabis.

They carried out a search and inside Nathan Barber's room they found a £6,925 in cash and a large quantity of cocaine and cannabis. They also found a canister of CS spray.

In total, they recovered cannabis with a street value of around £10,800 and cocaine with a street value of up to around £10,560.

He appeared at Ipswich Crown Court on 11 June where he admitted possession of a weapon for the discharge of a noxious liquid, and possession with intent to supply cocaine and cannabis.

The 28-year-old was jailed on Wednesday 17 June for three years and four months.

PC Tim Knights said: "Every day we are working hard to identify and take action against dealers who sell drugs in our communities.

"Selling drugs is not a victimless crime. The drugs supply network exploits vulnerable and young people, who are groomed or coerced into helping criminals run their illegal activities.

"They will also be at risk of violence and abuse, including sexual exploitation.

"We are working hard every day to protect vulnerable people and keep them safe from the criminals who use and abuse them for financial gain."
