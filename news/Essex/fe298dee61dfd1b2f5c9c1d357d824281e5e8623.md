We have served a closure order on a flat in Chelmsford following reports it was linked to drug dealing and anti-social behaviour.

We had received reports of drug use and drug dealing at the property in Cressy Quay, and concerns for the welfare of a vulnerable woman at the premises.

Officers worked closely with the property's landlord, Moat Homes, and applied for a closure order, which means no-one can live at the flat for three months.

It was granted at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 26 February.

The order means that anyone caught trying to enter the property within the next three months could face jail for breaching the conditions.

Safeguarding and support has also put in place for the vulnerable woman previously living at the property.

Sergeant Graham Thomas, of the Chelmsford Town Centre Team, said: "We had received numerous concerns about this particular address, which had become more frequent in the last three months.

"We continue to investigate these incidents and we hope the closure order will provide respite for residents living nearby.

"We will not tolerate drug dealing, which often involves the exploitation of vulnerable people and the threat of violence.

"I'd like to thank Moat Homes for supporting us with obtaining this order and we will continue to work closely with our partners to deal with issues around persistent crime and anti-social behaviour.

"I ask anyone with any concerns to please continue reporting them to us so we can take appropriate action."
