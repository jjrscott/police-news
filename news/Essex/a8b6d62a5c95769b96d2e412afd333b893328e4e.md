### Our thoughts are with the family of Janet Lewis today as her husband is jailed for 14 years for her murder.

Robert Lewis, 82, was found guilty by a majority jury yesterday, Thursday 28 January, following a two-week trail at Chelmsford Crown Court.

Janet Lewis, 76, was beaten in her bed by her then 80-year-old husband, before he fatally stabbed her several times in the neck at their home in Padgetts Way, Hullbridge, on 1 September 2019.

During the trial, the court was told Lewis suffered from some cognitive impairment, but he had convinced himself he had dementia.

Following his arrest by detectives, Lewis claimed to have no recollection of killing his wife, but a majority of the jury found that not to be the case.

Senior investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Julie Gowen, of Essex Police's Rayleigh Major Crime Team, said:

"The family of Janet and Robert Lewis have had their lives changed forever. In a way, they lost two of their loved ones following the horrific events of September 2019.

"Our thoughts are with them as they come to terms with the conclusion of this tragic case."
