We are appealing for information after a fight broke out between two groups which left two men injured.

The incident happened in Magdalen Street, Colchester, shortly after 7.30pm on Sunday 21 February.

One of the men who was injured sustained serious facial injuries which led to him falling into the road where we believe he may have been struck, or nearly struck, by a vehicle travelling towards the town centre.

The man, aged in his 30s, was treated for his injuries at the scene and was taken to hospital. Thankfully his injuries are not life-threatening.

The other injured man did not sustain serious injuries.

Three men have been arrested and bailed in connection with our investigation.

**Investigating officer, Detective Constable Ryan Morrison, of Colchester CID, said:**

"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed or has CCTV or dashcam of this incident.
"This was a very serious assault whereby one of the victims sustained serious facial injuries."

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has information on it should submit a report online or use the 'Live Chat' button to speak to an online operator between 7am-11pm.

You can also call us on 101 and cite 42/32802/21.

Information can also be given to independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously.
