A man has been jailed for attacking a woman and knocking her unconscious.

Octavian Petre had been drinking and smoking cannabis before having an argument with the 33-year-old woman, which then escalated into violence.

She managed to flee her home and knocked on a neighbour's door for help.

However, Petre followed her, dragged her to the floor and stamped on her. He continued to punch and kick and spit on her. When another neighbour came out to help the victim, Petre hit him in the face.

Both victims sought safety at a neighbour's flat, but Petre repeatedly kicked and punched the door and slashed at it with a knife.

Police were called to the block of flats in Southernhay, Basildon, and he was arrested.

Following the terrifying incident on 22 January, the 33-year-old (pictured below) was charged with attempting to cause grievous bodily harm, assault by beating and criminal damage.

He admitted the charges when he appeared at Basildon Crown Court on 12 March and was jailed for two-and-a-half years on 7 May.

Investigating officer, DC Jonathan Wilson, of the Southend Domestic Abuse Investigation Team, said: "This was a horrific and violent attack that continued when others tried to intervene to stop him.

"We worked hard to gather the evidence to secure a charge and a guilty plea from Petre.

"We know there are times when victims may feel unable to support our investigations but we will continue to do all we can to bring violent offenders such as Petre to justice and safeguard vulnerable people."
