A drug dealer has been jailed after being caught three times selling crack cocaine and heroin.

Armani Wilkin was jailed for four-and-a-half years for offences dating back to 2018.

He was arrested in February 2018 in Chatham, Kent, after the car he was driving initially caught the attention of police officers because it was in a poor state of repair and uninsured. On speaking to him, they noticed the smell of cannabis and carried out a search, during which they found crack cocaine and heroin.

He was stopped again in July 2019, this time in Challis Lane, Braintree, because the car he was driving was linked to drugs supply in the local area.

Special Constables searched Wilkin and the car and found more than £1,200 in cash, 29 wraps of drugs and a flick knife.

The 24-year-old was arrested a third time in April this year, after officers carried out a search warrant in Barley Court, Wivenhoe, and found more than 300 wraps containing heroin and crack cocaine.

He had admitted three counts of possession with intent to supply crack cocaine, three of possession with intent to supply heroin, and three of possessing criminal property.

Wilkin, of Farthings Close, Chingford, was jailed on Thursday 27 August. He also had £1,329 forfeited under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.

Detective Constable Gemma White said: "Wilkin is a serial offender who has now lost his freedom because of his crimes.

"We will also use legislation to ensure criminals don't benefit from their crimes, and will apply to the courts for any assets to be seized that we think have been gained illegally, as in this case.

"Drugs cause so much harm to our communities because dealers take advantage of vulnerable people and use them so they can continue their illegal trade.

"Drugs are also associated with violence and anti-social behaviour, and the exploitation of young people who are fed false claims about the lifestyle they could lead.

"There is never any good to come out of being involved in this criminal lifestyle, only risks and harm."
