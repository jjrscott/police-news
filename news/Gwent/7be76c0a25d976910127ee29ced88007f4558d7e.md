We are appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Newport.

We received a report of a robbery which took place in Morgan Way at around 12.25pm on Friday, October 2.

A man reported that he was stopped by two people in a white van who said his van had a flat tyre.

The 64-year-old man left his van to check the tyre and was pushed to the floor. His transit van was taken but was located a short time later in Newport.

The victim did not sustain any injuries during the robbery.

One of the suspects is described as being a white boy, believed to be aged 15 to 16, with short black hair. He was wearing a black Covid face mask and a grey T-shirt.

Anyone who may have witnessed the incident or has any dash-cam footage of the area at the time is asked to call 101 quoting reference 2000359888.

You can also send us a direct message with any information. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
