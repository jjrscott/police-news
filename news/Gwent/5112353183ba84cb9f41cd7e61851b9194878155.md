A Newport man has been jailed for 40 months for drug offences.

Ricky Dupon, 28, was sentenced at Cardiff Crown Court on 25th November after pleading guilty to possession with intent to supply class A, B and C drugs and possession of criminal property.

PC Sean Higgins said:

"Through his offending Ricky Dupon took advantage and exploited the most vulnerable people in our communities.

"Drugs bring nothing but misery to our communities and we will continue our work to target those involved in the supply of drugs in our area and bring them to justice.
