A 40-year-old Newport man has been given a criminal behaviour order (CBO) following theft offences, including theft from vehicles, in the city.

Arnis Nassa was given the two-year order at a hearing at Cwmbran Magistrates Court on 5 February.

The order states he must not:

 1. Enter the area marked in red on the following map (areas including Newport city centre and Pill), save for attending pre-arranged appointments.
 2. Remain stationary near any unattended vehicles, between the hours of 01.00 and 07.00am, where there's opportunity to physically interfere with said vehicle, trailer, or anything carried on/in a motor vehicle or trailer.

Newport Crime and Disorder Reduction Officer, PC Chris Butt, said:

"We know the order will be welcomed by those working and living in the city.

"Applying for a CBO is always a last resort. Before then, we work with our partners to try and engage and support individuals involved in numerous offences.

"We hope the CBO will now act as a deterrent and help Nassa change his ways."

Anyone who sees Nassa breach this order should call 101, quoting reference 2100003619. You can also direct message Gwent Police on Facebook or Twitter.
