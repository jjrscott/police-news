A Tredegar man's starting a two-and-a-half-year sentence after being caught with cocaine.

30-year-old Lewys Hudd pled guilty to two offences at Cardiff Crown Court on 22 February:

 * possession with intent to supply a controlled drug of class A - cocaine
 * acquire/ use/ possess criminal property.

Officer in charge of the case, PC Matthew Jacob, said:

"Hudd was found with of a large amount of cocaine and cash. Following his arrest, he tried to mislead the enquiry by concocting an elaborate alibi for his involvement in the supply of class A drugs.

"As a result of the officers' thorough investigation we were able to disprove his alibi, leading to a guilty plea.

 "We're committed to disrupting the illegal activities of these individuals and would ask anyone with information that can help to contact us, so we can continue to put offenders behind bars."
