A boy's been reunited with his bike after a robbery in Blaina.

We issued an appeal earlier this month after the 12-year-old was approached by three teenagers on Cwmcelyn Road and assaulted, leaving him with a facial injury.

The offenders made off with his bike, but it was recently found abandoned on the roadside and has now been returned to him.

The robbery happened near the skate park at about 4.30pm on Wednesday 2 December.

We are still trying to trace the offenders, anyone with any information can call us on 101 quoting 2000438611.

You can also direct message us on Facebook or Twitter or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
