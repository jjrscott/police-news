25-year-old Darryl Skym, from Senghenydd, Caerphilly, has been sentenced to three and a half years in prison for the production and supply of drugs.

Skym pleaded guilty to being concerned in the supply of a class A drug (cocaine) and the production of a class B drug (cannabis) and was sentenced at Cardiff Crown Court on Tuesday 23 March.

Officer in charge of the case, PC Rhys Jones, said: "We welcome the prison sentence imposed by the court today, the result of which will take another dealer off our streets and help deter others from committing these crimes.

"We will continue to deal with these offences robustly and bring any offenders to justice, and, again, would like to thank the community for their ongoing support.

"If you have any concerns about drugs in your local area and have information that can help us remove their harmful effects on our communities, you can report it to us via 101."
