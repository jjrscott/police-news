A Blaenau Gwent man has been jailed for more than four years for being concerned in the supply of cocaine and possession of a stun gun.

Ross Mark Hutchings, aged 31, from Tredegar, was sentenced to 56 months imprisonment at Newport Crown Court, on Monday November 30.

He was charged with being concerned in the supply of a controlled drug of class A - cocaine and possession of a prohibited weapon.

He pleaded guilty at a previous hearing.

A warrant was executed at an address in Rhondda in October of this year where a stun gun device was seized.

PC Matt Jacob, officer in the case, said: "The supply of controlled drugs ruins the lives of those in the communities we work so hard to protect. I hope this sentence serves as a warning to all those involved in the supply of controlled drugs that Gwent Police is dedicated to disrupting their activities and bringing individuals before the courts to face justice.

"The information we received from the community is vital in our efforts to tackle the supply of drugs. Please keep telling us about your concerns so we can take action. You can call us on 101 or report anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
