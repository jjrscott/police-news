A 20-year-old man has been sentenced to more than two years after leaving a man with serious injuries.

Connor O'Halloran, aged 20, from Pontypool, appeared at Cardiff Crown Court on Monday, December 14, charged with unlawful wounding/inflicting grievous bodily harm without intent.

He pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing.

The defendant was sentenced to 25 months in a young offender institute.

The assault took place in Pontypool on June 15 of this year. The victim, a man in his 40s, required hospital treatment after sustaining a punctured lung during the attack.

DC Isaac Gott, officer in the case, said: "O'Halloran used a double-pronged item to stab the victim a number of times which caused an injury to his lung. This assault has had a profound effect on the victim and I hope the sentenced imposed will bring him some closure to start moving on with his life.

"I must commend the paramedics from the Welsh Ambulance Service who treated the victim at the scene.

"Knife crime and serious violence has no place in our communities. I hope this sends a message to anyone thinking of carrying a knife or bladed article to think of the consequences.

"If anyone has any information about individuals involved in knife crime or has any concerns, please call Gwent police on 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. In an emergency always dial 999."
