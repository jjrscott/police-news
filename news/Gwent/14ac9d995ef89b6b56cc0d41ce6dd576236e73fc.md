## Jamil Bin-Salah, 22, of Aberthaw Drive, received a sentence of two years and eight months after quantities of cash and cocaine were found by officers.

A Newport man, whose drug dealing activity was uncovered by officers following a chase, has been jailed for more than two-and-a-half years.

Jamil Bin-Salah, 22, of Aberthaw Drive, appeared at Cardiff Crown Court on Wednesday 3 February.

He pled guilty to two offences: acquire, use or possess criminal property and possession with intent to supply a controlled drug of class A - cocaine.

After driving away from officers, a search of his home address on Monday 11 January revealed vast quantities of cash and bags of white powder, which was later revealed to be cocaine.

PC Craig Andrews, the officer in the case, said:

"Jamil Bin-Salah is another young person who chanced his arm in the drug dealing business and is now facing the consequences of his actions.

"Drugs have no place in our society; they often ruin lives. Gwent Police is committed to tackling this form of illegal activity in our communities.

"Hopefully this significant sentence will deter others who are considering getting themselves involved in the supply of drugs."

He received a sentence of two years and eight months - or 32 months - in total: 32 months for the possession with intent to supply offence and six months concurrent for the possession of criminal property.

A Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA) hearing will take place at a later date.
