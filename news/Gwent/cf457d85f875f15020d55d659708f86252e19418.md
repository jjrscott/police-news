We would like to say thank you to everyone who contributed to our virtual victim focus groups earlier this month.

The groups were run by the force's survivor engagement co-ordinator to engage with survivors of domestic violence and sexual violence.

Liz Lowther, survivor engagement co-ordinator, said: "Your voice is important to us and feedback from the focus groups will help us to shape and improve our service. I would like to say thank you to all those who took part in the virtual sessions and to those who have been in contact with me about your experiences.

"If you weren't able to join the virtual session but would like to talk to me about your experience and how we can improve the service we offer to victims, then please get in contact."

You can get in contact with Liz Lowther by calling 0300 1232133 or via email Elizabeth.Lowther@gwent.pnn.police.uk
