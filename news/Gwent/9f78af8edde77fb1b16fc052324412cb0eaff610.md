* **Scam Alert** *

This week, an elderly man from the Cwmbran area was contacted by a fraudster pretending to be a member of staff from Halifax bank, stating his confidential customer details had been shared.

They advised him that they need to come to the house and once there they created a 'dummy order' using his bank card details. This was a real order for an expensive watch.

Fortunately, the bank was contacted, no money was stolen and Action Fraud have been notified.

Please remember: Fraudsters can phone people and pretend to be from Halifax, the police, or other well-known companies. Scam calls can sound real and professional. But stop and think - is this call genuine?

Anyone can find themselves the victim of fraud. If you suspect you may have been scammed or involved in fraudulent activity, or have information about a possible fraudster, visit: https://www.gwent.police.uk/ro/report/fo/fraud/ or contact Action Fraud https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/

What to look out for:

 * Unexpected calls - if you didn't expect the call then it could be a scam. If you're not sure, you can call back.

 * Pressure calls - fraudsters want to hurry you into making a quick decision. They may also ask you to 'keep it quiet' and not tell anyone about the call. Don't trust anyone who does this.

 * A need to transfer money - scam calls can try to get you to transfer money for security purposes or to a safe/secure/holding account. Do not do this. A bank would never ask you to move money to a 'safe' account.

 * Refunds - if a call offers you a refund it's a scam. A bank would never call you about a refund.

 * Test transactions - if a call asks you to do a test transaction then it's a scam. A bank would never ask you to do this.

 * You're asked to log on to your computer - a scam call may tell you there's something wrong with your computer or ask you to download something. They could pretend to be from your broadband provider or trusted software company. But if you didn't ask for this call, it's a scam.
