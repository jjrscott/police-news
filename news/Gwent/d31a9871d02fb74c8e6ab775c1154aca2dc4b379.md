We're investigating an assault that happened at Morrisons in Cwmbran on Saturday 5th December.

A dispute broke out between two men at about 10.40am and an 80 year old man was assaulted whilst he was sat in his car.

The offender fled in a VW Transporter, grey in colour.

Directly after the assault a witness spoke to the victim and we're appealing for that man to come forward as he could have vital information that will help the investigation.

If you can help call us on 101, quoting 2000442067, or you can direct message us on Facebook or Twitter. You can also call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
