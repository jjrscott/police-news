We're appealing for information after a 17 year old boy was stabbed in the leg on Somerton Road, Newport yesterday evening, Wednesday 3rd February.

The boy was followed by four males from Black Ash Park, onto Wright Close, Kitty Hawk Drive and onto Somerton Road from around 7.45pm - 8pm. He was first assaulted with a hit to the face outside Perfect hairdressers on Somerton Road, and then stabbed in his leg outside St Andrew's Church. The offenders then made off from the scene.

The 17 year old was taken to The Grange hospital for treatment, where he remains in a stable condition.

An area search took place yesterday evening and the investigation to locate the offenders continues today.

One of the offenders is described as being black, approximately 5'8" - 5'9" tall and was wearing a North Face style black coat and black trousers. A second offender is described as being Asian, approximately 5'10" - 5'11" tall and was wearing a grey tracksuit.

We're keen to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time of the incident or has CCTV in the streets mentioned, or anyone who may have been travelling through the area with dashcam footage.

Please contact us on 101 quoting 2100040126, or via our Facebook or Twitter pages if you can help.
