A dealer who advertised drugs for sale on Snapchat has been sentenced to three years.

Ethan Pope, aged 18, from Caerphilly, was sentenced at Cardiff Crown Court on Monday, January 11.

He was charged with being concerned in the supply of cocaine, being concerned in the supply of cannabis, being concerned in the supply of ketamine, being concerned in the supply of ecstasy and being concerned in the supply of a Class C drug -xanax.

Pope was also charged with possession with intent to supply cannabis and possession of a Class B drug - ketamine and Class C drug - xanax.

He pleaded guilty to all charges at an earlier hearing.

The defendant was sentenced to three years in a young offender institution.

The offences were committed between December 2017 and November 2020.

Pope was arrested at his home address in Caerphilly on November 24, 2020. A quantity of cannabis was found during a search of his home.

Officer in the case, PC Rhys Jones said:

"We welcome the sentence imposed by the court. Pope was supplying Class A, B and C drugs throughout the Caerphilly borough which would have ultimately contributed to the misery of drug use on others.

"He boasted how much money he was making and had taken over as the main supplier from his other defendants who are now in prison.

"Again, we thank the community for their support which has led to this conviction.

"Please keep telling us about your concerns about drug dealing so we can take action. You can report any concerns to us on 101 or alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
