We are appealing for information to find Brogan Joseph Hooper who breached his licence conditions after being released from prison on 1st May.

The 27 year-old, from Newport, received a 12 year prison sentence for conspiracy to murder at Cardiff Crown Court in June 2014.

Due to the fact that Hooper, who was released on licence, breached his conditions he has now been recalled to prison.

Anyone who can help is asked to call 101 quoting 2000193744, you can also direct message Gwent Police on Facebook or Twitter. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
