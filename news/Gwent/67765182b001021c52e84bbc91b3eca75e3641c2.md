Have your say in our victim focus groups taking place next week.

We want to hear your views and experiences of how we investigate domestic violence and sexual violence.

Your views and opinions will help us to improve our response to ensure we keep people safe from harm.

The next virtual focus groups will take place on:

 * Monday, November 30, at 6pm
 * Wednesday, December 2, at 6pm

The group will be run by the force's survivor engagement co-ordinator and will be confidential.

Liz Lowther, survivor engagement co-ordinator, said: "We've had a great response from survivors during the focus groups we have carried out over the past few months. The feedback has influenced our service including helping to enhance training for officers and staff.

"Your views are very important to us and will help to improve the service we offer to victims of domestic abuse and sexual abuse.

"In the focus groups coming up, we will also be discussing proposed plans to create a victims' reference group. The aim of this proposed group will be to hold regular meetings with victims to hear how their experiences can guide changes and improvements in victim care across the force.

"We want to offer the best possible service to victims and I would encourage anyone interested in taking part in the virtual focus groups to get in contact with me for more information about the event. If you are unable to attend but would like to contribute feedback about your experience then please get in contact with me."

Anyone interested in taking part can get in contact with Liz Lowther by calling 0300 1232133 or via email Elizabeth.Lowther@gwent.pnn.police.uk
