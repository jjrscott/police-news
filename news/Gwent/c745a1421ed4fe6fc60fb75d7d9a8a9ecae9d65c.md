A Caerphilly man has been jailed for more than two years for drug offences.

Joe Hughes, aged 21, from Trinant, Caerphilly, was sentenced to two years and four months imprisonment at Cardiff Crown Court on Monday, December 21.

He pleaded guilty to supplying a controlled drug of class A - cocaine, supplying a controlled drug of class B - cannabis and possession with intent to supply cannabis.

The defendant was stopped by officers on October 15, of this year in Trinant. He was found with snap bags of cannabis, two mobile phones and two bags of cocaine.

A search of his home address found more than Â£5,000 and cannabis in a safe.

PC Mark Ling, officer in the case, said: "Gwent Police's Serious Organised Crime and Disruption Team work tirelessly to disrupt those involved in the supply and distribution of drugs. Hughes was caught carrying out a drug deal, subsequently his house was searched whereby officers found more drugs and evidence of his dealing.

"I welcome the sentence handed to Hughes which I hope sends a message that we will not tolerate the supply of drugs in our communities. Please keep telling us about your concerns about drug dealing so we can take action.

"You can report any concerns to us on 101 or alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
