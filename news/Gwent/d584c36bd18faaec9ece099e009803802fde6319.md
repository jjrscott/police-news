A 24-year-old Newport man has been sentenced to 22 months in prison for drug supply in the Newport area.

Marcus Paul Reynolds, who pleaded guilty to Class B drug supply offences was sentenced to 22 months in prison following his appearance at Cardiff Crown Court on Monday 21st December 2020.

Officer in the case, PC Mitchell Harris said:

"Marcus Reynolds was arrested through proactive work in Maesglas, Newport, following concerns from members of the community regarding anti-social behaviour and drug supply in the area.

"His sentence is welcomed by Gwent Police and shows the serious nature of the offence in which he was committing. Drugs bring misery upon people's lives and ruins communities.

"I hope this sentence acts a deterrent to other people involved in drug supply and evidences to the local communities that Gwent Police are committed to disrupt such activity in the areas they live."
