The family of a woman who was found deceased in Pontypool has described her as an 'amazing mum and nan' and 'dear friend' to many.

Officers responded to a report of a woman found deceased at a property in Sebastopol, Pontypool at approximately 09:20am on Saturday 6 February 2021.

Linda Maggs, formerly Linda Minahan, aged 74, was declared deceased by the Welsh Ambulance Service.

Her family, who are being supported by specially trained officers, have issued the following tribute:

"Linda was an amazing mum, nan and dear friend to many, who was tragically taken away too soon.

"She was a dear mum who was always at the end of a phone to give us love and advice when we needed it. She was adored by her son Andrew, daughter Kerry, daughter-in-law Lisa, son-in-law Allan and all her grandchildren.

"She was beautiful inside and out and will be sorely missed by all who had the pleasure of knowing her.

"She had the kindest heart and would do anything for anyone.

"Our lives will never be the same and her memory will be treasured by us forever.

"We request that you please respect our privacy at this sad time."

A 70-year-old man from Pontypool was charged with murder and appeared in Cardiff Crown Court on Tuesday 9 February 2021.
