A Caerphilly man has been jailed for multiple drug offences.

Liam Chapman, aged 21, of Pontllanfraith, was sentenced to two years and nine months at Cardiff Crown Court on March 9 after pleading guilty to being concerned in the supply of cocaine, possession with intent to supply cocaine and possession of cannabis.

The offences took place between 2018 and February 2021.

A warrant was executed at his address in February 2021 where officers found a quantity of cocaine.

PC Mark Ling, officer in the case, said: "We welcome the sentence imposed on Chapman by the courts, the result of which will take another dealer off our streets and help deter others from committing these crimes.

"Removing those involved in the supply of class A drugs from our streets is a priority for us as it has a hugely detrimental impact on our communities.

"If you have any concerns about drug dealing, we would encourage you to report those concerns so we can take action.

"I would urge anyone with any information to call us on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
