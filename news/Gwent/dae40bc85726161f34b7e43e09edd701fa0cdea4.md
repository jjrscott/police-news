We're appealing for information after Â£35,000 worth of copper cable was stolen from St Woolos Hospital in Newport.

The cable was stolen overnight 4-5th February.

Due to the length of cable stolen, a large vehicle would have been needed for transportation.

If you saw anything suspicious in the area at the time or have been offered large amounts of copper cable, please contact us on 101 quoting 2100041685 or direct message on Facebook or Twitter.

A spokesman for Aneurin Bevan University Health Board said: "This despicable theft has caused significant cost and disruption to local NHS services at a time when we our staff are facing extra pressures due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

"Thankfully, the incident did not affect patient care. However, the theft disabled our emergency electrical generator at St Woolos Hospital and patients could have been harmed, or even lost their lives, in the event of a power cut.

"We would ask anyone with information to do the right thing and contact Gwent Police immediately."
