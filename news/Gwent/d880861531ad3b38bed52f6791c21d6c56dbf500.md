We're appealing for information to locate 49 year old Stephen James who has been reported as missing from his home in the Blackwood area.

Stephen was reported as missing on 23rd February, but was last seen on 29th January in Blackwood. He is known to have links to the Tenby area.

Unfortunately the only images we have of Stephen are these CCTV stills which were captured in the Manmoel area on 18th January.

If you have any information relating to Stephen's whereabouts, please call 101 quoting log 114 23/02/21, or direct message us on Facebook or Twitter.
