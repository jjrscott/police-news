Ahead of the firebreak lockdown coming into place within Wales at 6pm tonight (Friday 23 October), Temporary Assistant Chief Constable Ian Roberts said:

"Since the start of the health pandemic we have been working with our local communities to keep everyone safe.

"As we move into the next stage of combating this virus, we have a simple ask. We all have a part to play, and now we must follow the new Welsh Government restrictions and stay at home wherever possible. By doing so we prevent local hospitals being overwhelmed and protect our communities.

"Throughout this firebreak lockdown we'll be continuing to engage with our communities and explain the importance of keeping Wales safe.

"For those that knowingly go against these restrictions, we will take enforcement action.

"Across Gwent we will be carrying out additional patrols, in particular over the Halloween and Bonfire Night period.

"Working with local businesses and partners, we'll be ensuring that everyone is doing all that they can to help us prevent the continued spread of this virus.

"We remain committed to responding to all reports of crime and providing an effective service to the communities of Gwent."
