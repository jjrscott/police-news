We're appealing for information to find 19-year-old Bradley Hemmings from Chepstow.

He failed to appear at Newport Magistrates' Court last month, after being charged with breach of a criminal behaviour order and a warrant has been issued for his arrest.

Anyone with any information on his whereabouts can call us on 101 quoting 2000378028, or you can DM us on Facebook or Twitter. You can also call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
