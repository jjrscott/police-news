We're appealing for witnesses following a fatal road traffic collision in Caerphilly.

We received a report of a vehicle having left the road on the A472 between Nelson and Ystrad Mynach at 1.50am on Wednesday, February 3.

The driver of a black Vauxhall Corsa was declared dead at the scene.

The family of a 39-year-old man from Pontypool are being supported by specially trained officers.

Officers believe the car was involved in a collision at around 9.15pm the previous night, Tuesday February 2, and are appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the collision or anyone who may have been driving through the area at the time to get in contact.

Any motorists with dash-cam footage of the area at the time of the collision is also asked to come forward.
