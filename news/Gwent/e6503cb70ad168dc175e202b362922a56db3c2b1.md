28-year-old Newport man, Haydn Daniel Davies has been sentenced to three years and three months in prison after pleading guilty to a charge of:

Arson with recklessness as to whether life was endangered.

He was sentenced on Monday 4 January at Cardiff Crown Court.

Office in the Case, DC Ceri Parker said: "This was a callous act in which Hayden Davies set fire to a vehicle owned by his vulnerable victim. The vehicle which was set ablaze was in close proximity to houses and other vehicles which could have easily been catastrophic if not for the quick response from emergency services on the night.

"The victim has had to deal with the financial and psychological effects of having his vehicle set on fire. I hope that the sentence passed out will provide some comfort that justice has been served and that the victim will be protected from further targeted abuse by Haydn Davies in the future."
