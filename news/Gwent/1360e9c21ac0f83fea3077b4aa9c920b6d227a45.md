A 41-year-old Newport man has been sentenced to two years in prison following a robbery at a launderette in Newport.

Gareth Jasons, pleaded guilty to Robbery contrary to section 8(1) of the Theft Act 1968, following the offence that took place during October 2020.

On Monday 14th December 2020, at Cardiff Crown Court, he was sentenced to two years in prison, a restraining order for five years and a fine to be paid to the victim of Â£190.00.

Officer in the case, DC Carla Watkins said:

"This was a very distressing incident for the elderly victim.

"Gareth Jasons gained entrance into the victim's property and grabbed the victim by the neck and hair.

"Jasons then let go of the victim and went towards the till drawer where he stole money belonging to the victim. The victim then escaped through a window that Jasons had removed.

"I hope that the sentence imposed will bring the victim some closure."
