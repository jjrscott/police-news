Jason Deakin, aged 34, from Caldicot, has been sentenced to 14 months in prison after pleading guilty to two counts of dwelling burglary and one count of burglary other than a dwelling.

The charges relate to a burglary at a property in Devauden on October 8, 2020, in which a TV, DJ equipment and cash were stolen and a burglary at an address in Caldicot on January 7 in which tools, a nail kit and a torch were stolen.

A coat, toys and a lamp were stolen from a shed in Caldicot on January 6.

Deakin was sentenced at Cardiff Crown Court on February 1.

Officer in the case, DC Alistair Frame, said:

"We welcome the sentence imposed on Deakin by the court. Dwelling burglaries can leave a lasting effect on victims, so we hope this outcome can offer some closure for Deakin's victims.

"We will continue to deal with these offences robustly and endeavour to bring offenders to justice."
