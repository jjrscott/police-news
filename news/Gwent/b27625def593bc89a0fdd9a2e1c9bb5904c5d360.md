**We are looking to get your thoughts around the use of automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) in Gwent.**

ANPR technology is used by police forces across the UK, including Gwent Police, to help detect, deter and disrupt criminality, including organised crime groups and terrorists.

The registration plate cameras are governed by strict codes of practice. They are most commonly used to alert officers to stolen vehicles, vehicles that have been involved in crime or to help locate missing people. The data they collect can also be used in subsequent investigations.

You've probably seen how ANPR works on TV programmes, or you may even use a petrol station or car park which uses the system to keep you safe. Just in case you haven't, we've got a short film to show how ANPR Is used.

**The video shows how West Midlands Police use ANPR to locate a missing person:**
