We're appealing for information to locate 54-year-old, Richard Coyle from Blackwood, who has breached his licence conditions after being released from prison on Wednesday 16 December 2020.

Coyle, who has links with the Blackwood, Caerphilly and Swansea area, received a 6 month prison sentence for animal cruelty offences after being sentenced at Newport Magistrates Court in November 2020.

Due to the fact that Coyle, who was released on licence, breached his licence conditions, he has now been recalled to prison.

If you have any information please call 101 quoting: 2000462965 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
