We're appealing for information to locate Jamie Challis, aged 22, from Newport, who has been recalled to prison.

Challis was sentenced to five years imprisonment at Cardiff Crown Court in August 2018 for wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.

He was released on licence in January 2021 but has since been recalled to prison for breaching his licence conditions.

If you have any information on his whereabouts, please call 101 quoting 2100092779 or send us a direct message on Facebook or Twitter.

Alternatively, you can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
