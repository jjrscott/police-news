## Tekli Gebray, 24, of no fixed abode, was jailed for more than three years after pleading guilty at Cardiff Crown Court.

A Newport man has been jailed for more than three years after officers found a quantity of heroin about his person.

Tekli Gebray, 24, of no fixed abode, appeared at Cardiff Crown Court on Friday 5 February following his arrest in Newport on Thursday 21 January for drug dealing.

He later pled guilty at court to one count of possession with intent to supply a controlled drug of class A.

DC Andrew Dabinette, the officer in the case, said:

"Tekli Gebray attempted to make money from an illegal activity which can often ruin lives.

"This significant sentence indicates that drugs have no place in our society. Hopefully this will deter others from venturing down the same path as this individual.

"Gwent Police is committed to tackling this form of illegal activity in our communities. If you're concerned about drug supply in your area, report it to us."

He received a sentence of three years and four months for the possession with intent to supply offence.
