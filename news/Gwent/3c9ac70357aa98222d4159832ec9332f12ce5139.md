A Newport man's been jailed for 3 years for a host of drug and motoring offences.

21-year-old Harris Mann pleaded guilty to 6 offences at Cardiff Crown Court:

 * possess with intent to supply a controlled drug of class A - crack cocaine
 * possess a controlled drug of class B - cannabis/ cannabis resin
 * drive a motor vehicle dangerously
 * use a motor vehicle on a road/ public place without third party insurance
 * drive a motor vehicle otherwise in accordance with a licence - endorsable offence
 * possess with intent to supply a controlled drug of class A - heroin

PC Andrew Rosen said:

"Through his offending Harris Mann put innocent members of the public and police officers in danger.

"He used a high-powered electric bicycle on a footpath as a means to deal controlled drugs, including heroin and crack cocaine.

"This sentence serves as a reminder to those who choose to ride electric bikes illegally, we will take action and put you before the courts.

"Our efforts to rid our communities of illegal drug activity will continue, call us on 101 if you're concerned about this happening in your local area, or you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
