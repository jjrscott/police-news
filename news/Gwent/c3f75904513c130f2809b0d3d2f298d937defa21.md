Ahead of New Year's Eve, Chief Constable Pam Kelly asks communities to help stop the spread of COVID:

"New Year's Eve is always a busy time for policing and we will continue to maintain a visible presence across Gwent.

"New restrictions introduced by Welsh Government mean that friends and families will be unable to get to together and celebrate the new year. Alert level four means that people should remain in their own household and only travel when necessary.

"Alongside our partners we're asking the people of Gwent to do the right thing for their community and celebrate differently this year by staying home.

"I'd also like to remind those thinking of visiting our many wonderful beauty spots, to stop and consider their actions.

"Coronavirus levels remain high across much of Gwent, and by following Welsh Government advice we're all saving lives and protecting the NHS."
