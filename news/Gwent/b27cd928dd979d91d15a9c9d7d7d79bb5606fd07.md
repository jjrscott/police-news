We're appealing for information following a fire that took place in Abersychan.

The fire, which is being treated as deliberately set, was at the Twyn-y-Ffrwd Inn on Ffrwd Road at approximately 11.30pm on Saturday 24th October.

The residents of the property were home at the time. Fortunately no one was injured and little damage was caused.

It is reported the offender ran towards the pub from Lower Harpers Road and made off back up that road.

If you can help please call 101, quoting 2000388815, or direct message us. You can also call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
