We're appealing for anyone who may have been offered this bike for sale to get in contact.

Officers are investigating a robbery which took place in Cwmcelyn Road, Blaina, near the skate park at around 4.30pm on Wednesday, December 2.

A 12-year-old boy was approached by three teenagers, one of whom assaulted him and made off with his bike. The boy sustained a minor facial injury during the assault.

The suspects are described as three white boys aged between 15 and 16-years-old, of average build, who were wearing black tracksuits and all riding on scooters.

The bike is distinctive as it has been specifically constructed. It's described as an On-One yellow hardtail mountain bike with Fox front shock absorbers.

DC Andrew Houghton, from CID, said: "This was a traumatic incident for the young victim who was assaulted and then had to watch as the offender rode away with his prized possession. Thankfully, the boy was not seriously injured.

"We are appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the robbery or who may have seen the bike - which is distinctive - to get in contact. We want to get this bike back to the victim and we need your information in order to make that happen."
