Our message to Gwent communities from Chief Superintendent Mark Hobrough:

"We know this is a very difficult time for all and we want to thank members of our community for their continued support as we all work together to keep everyone safe.

"Restrictions on gatherings remain in place and over the weekend we issued a number of fixed penalty notices for large gatherings including for a house party in Tredegar.

"During this pre-Christmas period, we'll be continuing to carry out proactive patrols across our force area to engage with our communities and to ensure that everyone is taking on their personal responsibility. For the minority who flout the Welsh Government restrictions, we will take enforcement action.

"We all know that Christmas this year will not be like any other but by working together and adhering to regulations, we can help prevent the spread of the virus and keep our communities safe."
