A drug dealer who was found in possession of class A drugs has been jailed.

Negos Pyke, aged 26, of Caerleon, was sentenced to 27 months imprisonment at Cardiff Crown Court on Tuesday, December 9.

He previously pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply a class A drug - cocaine, possession with intent to supply a class A drug - crack cocaine, possession with intent to supply a class A drug - heroin, possession of a class B drug - cannabis and possession of a bladed article in a public place.

Officers found Pyke in possession of heroin, crack cocaine, cannabis and a lock knife when he was stopped in Caerleon in March of this year. A search of his home was carried out where a quantity of cocaine was found.

PC Adam Griffiths, officer in the case, said: "I welcome the sentence imposed on Pyke which I hope sends a clear message to those involved in the supply of illegal drugs that we will not tolerate drug dealing or the carrying of knives in our communities. We will proactively pursue those involved in drug supply and protect vulnerable members of society from those who exploit them for financial gain.

"Knives have no place in our communities and anyone found in possession of a knife in public will be stopped and put before the courts.

"I would encourage anyone with information about drug dealing to contact us so we can take action. You can do so by calling us on 101 or reporting information via direct message on social media. Anyone can report information anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
