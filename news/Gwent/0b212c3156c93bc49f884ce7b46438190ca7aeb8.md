A Caerphilly man has been jailed for 28 months for breaching a serious crime prevention order.

38-year-old Leon Wells was sentenced at Cardiff Crown Court on 30th November after pleading guilty to three charges of failing to comply with the order.

Detective Constable Sean Meyrick said:

"We welcome the sentence imposed which shows the commitment of the criminal justice system to work with police forces to protect and reassure the communities of Gwent.

"Wells decided to ignore the conditions of the serious crime prevention order by hiding a mobile phone, connecting him to the criminal world. These orders are not taken lightly and are imposed upon individuals to protect the public from their offending.

"I hope this sentence serves as a warning to anyone who believes they can continue their criminal lifestyle after being released."
