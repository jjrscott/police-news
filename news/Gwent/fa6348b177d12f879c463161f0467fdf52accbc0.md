Callum Williams, 27 from Caerphilly, has been sentenced to four years in prison after pleading guilty to two counts of possession with intent to supply class A drugs.

Williams was sentenced at Cardiff Crown Court on 27th January.

Office in the Case, DC Michael Coles said:

Office in the Case, DC Michael Coles said: "I welcome the sentence imposed by the court. This is another dealer operating in the Caerphilly area successfully off our streets.

"I hope this sentence deters others from getting involved in this kind of criminal activity and demonstrates to the local community our commitment to targeting illegal drug supply in Gwent."
