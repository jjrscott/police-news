A man's starting a 5-year prison sentence for a burglary in the Caerphilly area.

28-year-old Thomas Sykes, from Wiltshire, was sentenced at Cardiff Crown Court on 25 January after pleading guilty to burglary dwelling, theft and burglary dwelling with intent to steal.

Officer in the case, PC Jenna Herbert said:

"This was a callous and calculated offence on a vulnerable elderly female in Trecenydd.

"Thomas Sykes went into her home, under the pretence of collecting payment for gardening work that she'd been pressured into having done, and stole money.

"This has, understandably, left the victim frightened in her own home.

"The sentence reflects the severity of the offence and the long-standing impact it will have on the victim."
