A Torfaen man has been jailed for 18 months and given a 5 year restraining order for assault and criminal damage.

Scott Terrance Taylor, aged 33 from Cwmbran, was sentenced after pleading guilty at Cardiff Crown Court on 9th December.

He was charged with three counts of assault by beating as well as criminal damage to property valued under Â£5000.

PC Carla Roderick-Jones, officer in the case, said: "Taylor carried out nasty, violent attacks on a vulnerable victim. I welcome the custodial sentence given, this, coupled with the 5 year restraining order, will allow the victim freedom to move on with her life with confidence."
