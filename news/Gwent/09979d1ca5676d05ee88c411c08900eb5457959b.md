**29-year-old Michael Griffin from Llanhilleth, Abertillery is starting an 18 month prison sentence following charges brought against him, including two dwelling burglaries and aggravated vehicle taking.**

Michael Griffin pleaded guilty to the offences at Cardiff Crown Court on Thursday 4 March and was sentenced to 18 months in prison and disqualified from driving for two years.

Police Staff Investigator, Scott Thomas said: _ "Michael Griffin targeted the same victim twice in the space of four weeks, causing the victim significant trauma. _

_" On the first occasion, the victim returned home from work to find his door kicked open and his laptop had been stolen. On the second occasion, the victim awoke in the early hours and found Michael Griffin in his living room. The victim managed to get Michael out of his home and minutes after doing so he noticed his car and house keys were missing. Michael then used the keys to steal the victim's car._

_" The identification of Michael Griffin at this second burglary led to his prompt arrest and recovery of all of the victim's property. It is hoped that the sentence handed out provides some comfort for the victim and makes the local community a safer place."_
