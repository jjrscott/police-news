**Do you have presents under your Christmas tree? Can they be seen from a window?**

Don't give thieves an easy target.

 * Keep windows and doors secure at all times
 * Keep presents and valuables out of sight
 * Dispose of all boxes and packaging carefully, particularly from expensive presents, and do not leave it on show outside the house.
 * Security mark gifts and valuables with your postcode and house number.

Register items using the free service: **www.immobilise.com** which enables police to identify the owner of valuables if they are stolen.

**If you are visiting the shops this Christmas, be careful how you leave your car.**

Don't give thieves an easy target.

 * Do not leave valuables or shopping on display in your car
 * Close windows, sunroof, lock doors & activate security alarms when leaving your car
 * Park in a busy, well-lit area or secure car park if possible - Visit http://www.parkmark.co.uk/ for details of approved local car parks
 * Take valuables with you when you leave your car, eg: cash, credit cards, mobile phones, sat nav systems etc
 * Avoid going back to your car to leave your shopping part-way through your trip
 * If you have no choice, make sure valuables and shopping are locked in the boot; taking care no-one is watching you
 * Do not leave your bag unattended on your trolley whilst loading your car.
