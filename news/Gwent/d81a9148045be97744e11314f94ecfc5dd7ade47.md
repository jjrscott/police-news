Three men are serving prison sentences after burgling a house in Abertridwr.

They all pleaded guilty and were sentenced at Cardiff Crown Court on 25 January.

31-year-old Gary O'Brien, from Bridgend, was sentenced to 18 months for burglary, going equipped and possession of a class A controlled drug. He was also disqualified from driving for 12 months for driving a motor vehicle otherwise than in accordance with a license.

27-year-old Aaron Mckeown, from Cardiff, was sentenced to 18 months for burglary and going equipped.

21-year-old Courtney Daley, from Bridgend, was sentenced to 24 months for burglary and going equipped.

Officer in the case, PC Michael Haines said:

"In October 2019 these three men burgled a family home and stole a child's motorbike, all while using a vehicle on false plates.

"Burglary can have a huge and long lasting impact on the lives of those affected.

"We strive to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice and victims are supported throughout the investigation."
