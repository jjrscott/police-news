A 38-year-old Newport man has been sentenced to over two years in prison following an attempted theft from an ATM in a Pontypool petrol garage this summer.

Ras Tassiyah Thomas pleaded guilty to the offence of:

Attempted theft from an automatic machine and criminal damage to property, valued over £5000.

On Friday 18th December, Ras Thomas was sentenced at Cardiff Crown Court to 25 months in prison for the attempted theft from an ATM and ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £181.00.

Officer in the case, PC Sarah Gray said:

"We welcome the sentence that has been handed down and hope this sends a message out to our communities that Gwent Police deals robustly with criminals, particularly those that travel across country to commit crime and target specific locations. We hope that this will provide closure to our victim."
