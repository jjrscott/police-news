We were called to a fire at a disused public house in Cwmfelinfach at approximately 6pm yesterday, Thursday 29th October. On arrival we discovered a large scale cannabis factory at the property.

The small fire was in the basement of the property on Maindee Road. No one was injured.

In excess of 2000 plants of varying maturity were located at the premises as well as hydroponics equipment.

The cause of the fire is still under investigation.

Local Inspector, Andrew Boucher said; "Officers and our crime scene investigators are making further enquiries at the scene this morning. I would appeal to anyone with information relating to the fire or cannabis factory to get in touch. I would also encourage all members of our local communities to contact us if they see any suspicious activity in their neighbourhoods, especially around derelict buildings."

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 or direct message us on Facebook or Twitter.
