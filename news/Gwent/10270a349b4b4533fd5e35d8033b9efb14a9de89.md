**Today is Holocaust Memorial Day, which takes place on 27 January every year to commemorate the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.**

It is a time when we seek to learn the lessons of the past and recognise that genocide does not just take place on its own - it's a steady process which can begin if discrimination, racism and hatred are not checked and prevented.

Although we're not at the immediate risk of genocide here in the UK; discrimination in its many forms has not ended, nor has the use of the language of hatred or exclusion.

There is still much to do to create a safer future. Holocaust Memorial Day is an opportunity to start this process.

The theme of HMD2021 is: be the light in the darkness. It encourages everyone to reflect on the depths humanity can sink to, but also the ways individuals and communities resisted that darkness to 'be the light' before, during and after genocide.

We will never tolerate any form of hate crime and we stand together with all members of our communities.
