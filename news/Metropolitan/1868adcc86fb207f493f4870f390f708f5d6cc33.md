**On Sunday, 27 December, Met officers arrived outside an address at Highbury Quadrant, N5.**

There was loud music coming from within the address and it was clear there was a party going on with a large number of people inside.

The occupants refused to engage with police. A woman left the address and was issued an FPN for being a participant in a house party of more than 15 people in a private dwelling.

 **Acting Chief Inspector Pete Dearden, from the Met’s Central North BCU, said:** “Thousands of people in London were not allowed to see their loved ones over the Christmas period as the spread of Covid has happened so quickly – partly due to people flagrantly ignoring the rules and attending house parties and accelerating the spread of the disease.

“Anyone who is seen to be breaking the rules and attending a house party or Unlicensed Music Event can expect to be fined by the police.”
