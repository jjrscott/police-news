**The owners of a gym in Hackney have been issued with a fixed penalty noticed after breaching Covid-19 regulations.**

On Friday, 8 January, police were called to reports of the breach at a fitness centre on Stean Street, Hackney.

Officers attended at 09:20hrs and upon entering, found that the gym was open with three people present inside the premises.

The business owners were informed of the important need to comply with Covid regulations and reminded that non-essential businesses should not be open during lockdown.

They were subsequently reported for consideration of a £1,000 fixed penalty notice.

 **Chief Inspector Pete Shaw, the Covid lead for Hackney and Tower Hamlets, said:** ‘Whilst there are certain rules around people being allowed to exercise in public under this lockdown, nowhere in the legislation does it allow people to go to gyms to work out.

“Those found to be flouting the rules, as with this instance, should expect necessary enforcement action to be taken against them.

“We are thankful that the vast majority of people continue to follow the guidance and do their part to reduce the infection rate."
