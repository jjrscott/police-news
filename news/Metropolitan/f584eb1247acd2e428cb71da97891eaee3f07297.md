**The owner of a barbers on Bromley Road, BR1, will be considered for a fine after he was caught cutting a customer’s hair – a clear breach of the Tier 4 conditions.**

Officers attended the address on Tuesday, 22 December after reports of customers getting their haircut inside after London was placed into Tier 4.

When they arrived, a male customer was having his haircut.

Officers asked the owner, who was cutting the hair, what he was doing. The owner replied that he didn’t know he wasn’t allowed to cut hair in the new Tier.

Officers explained that this was a breach and that he will now be considered for a fine.

 **Chief Inspector Julian Hagley, from the Met’s South Area BCU, said:** “The rules and conditions for businesses in Tier 4 areas are clear and easily available on the internet. We will not be accepting the excuse that people didn’t know that London is in Tier 4.

“The rise in Covid infections in London affect us all, and we all need to play our part in following the rules and conditions that have been put in place to keep us, and our families all safe.”
