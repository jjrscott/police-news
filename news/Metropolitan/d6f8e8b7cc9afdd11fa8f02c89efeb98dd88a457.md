**Detectives from the Met’s Serious Collision Investigation Unit are looking to speak to a witness who comforted an injured woman following a collision in Barking.**

Police were called shortly after 17.00hrs on Tuesday, 15 December to reports of collision involving a car and a pedestrian outside Lidl supermarket in Ripple Road, Barking.

The car stopped at the scene.

Officers and the London Ambulance Service attended and a 60-year-old woman was taken to hospital where she later died on Monday, 21 December. Her next of kin have been informed.

As part of the investigation, police are trying to trace a female who was present at the scene who is described as holding the victim’s hand.

 **Detective Sergeant Eddie Coleman said:** “I am sure that the actions of this witness will provide comfort to the victim’s family. It’s really important that we speak to this woman as part of our ongoing investigation. If this was you, or you know who she is, please get in touch with us as soon as possible.”

There have been no arrests.

Anyone with information or who may have captured the collision on dashcam or other media devices is asked to contact the witness appeal line on 020 8597 4874, quoting CAD 5450/15DEC20. You can also call 101 or tweet @MetCC.
