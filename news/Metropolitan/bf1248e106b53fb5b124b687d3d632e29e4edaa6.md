**Detectives appealed for assistance to identify a man as part of an investigation into a serious assault that occurred on 23 June 2020, in Ponders End Park, Enfield.**

A 45-year-old man suffered facial injuries as a result of the attack.

As part of this investigation, images of a man police wanted to speak to were circulated in media.

On Friday, 26 February, a 30-year-old man attended a north London police station and was arrested on suspicion of GBH; he has since been bailed pending further enquiries to a date in late March.

Enquiries into the circumstances continue.

Anyone with information is asked to contact North Area CID via 101 or tweet @MetCC and quote CAD7416/24Feb.

You can also provide information anonymously via the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
