**Officers are appealing for information after a gun was fired during a burglary in Wembley.**

Police were called at approximately 01:25hrs on Thursday, 25 February to reports of a burglary at a residential property in The Drive.

Three men were reported to have entered the property before demanding money. They threatened the four occupants and hit one of them over the head with a gun.

The group realised there was no money and left the property. A shot was fired towards a nearby wall as they were leaving. No serious injuries were reported.

Officers from the Met's Specialist Crime Command (Trident) are investigating and are appealing for information from anybody who saw suspicious activity in the area at the time.

 **Detective Constable Steven Renny said:** "This was a terrifying experience for those inside the property and it was fortunate that nobody was seriously injured.

"I am appealing for those who were in the area at the time to come forward and report anything suspicious. I would also like to hear from anyone in the area with a dashcam or video doorbell."

If you have information that can help the investigation tweet @MetCC or call 101, quoting CAD 387/25Feb. To remain anonymous contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
