[CCTV still of man sought re: Kennington rape]

**Detectives investigating a rape in Kennington Gardens are re-appealing for information on the one-year anniversary of the attack.**

The incident occurred on Sunday, 29 December 2019 between 02:00hrs and 02:20hrs in the area of Kennington Park Road, Lambeth.

A woman in her 20s was walking in the street when she was approached by an unknown man who attacked her. She suffered a blow to the head during the attack and was taken to a London hospital and was later discharged.

Detectives are keen to identify and speak to a man captured on CCTV around the time of the incident.

The suspect is described as a black man who was wearing a dark three quarter length coat.

 **DC Gerard Collier Smith, of the Central South Safeguarding Command Unit, said:** “This was an atrocious attack on a lone woman who was targeted late at night and subjected to sexual violence.

"One year on, we still need the public’s help to find this attacker. If you recognise the man in the pictures we have released with this appeal, please come forward and speak to us.

“If you have any information, no matter how insignificant it may seem, it is vital you get in touch. It could lead to a dangerous man being taken off the streets.”

Any witnesses or anyone with any information is asked to call police on 101 or tweet @MetCC, quoting CAD783/29DEC19. To give information anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or online at crimestoppers-uk.org.
