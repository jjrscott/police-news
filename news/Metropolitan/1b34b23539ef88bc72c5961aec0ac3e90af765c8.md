**A man has been arrested in north London as part of the Met’s commitment to tackling organised crime.**

The 27-year-old man was arrested on the morning of Thursday, 25 March, at his address in Islington following an investigation into an organised crime group, who are believed to be involved in conspiracy to import heroin and cocaine into the UK.

The warrants - as part of Operation Eternal - were carried out by officers from the Met’s Specialist Crime Command and Taskforce officers who are investigating criminal activity being carried out on encrypted devices.

The man was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs between March and April 2020. Intelligence obtained by officers revealed he was linked to an Organised Criminal Network who are believed to be importing both cocaine and heroin into the UK and supplying them throughout London and the Home Counties.

 **Detective Chief Inspector Driss Hayoukane, from the Specialist Crime Command, said:** “Operation Eternal continues to yield some excellent results and we are still arresting those we strongly believe are involved in the importation of drugs.

“The importation of heroin and cocaine will lead to some serious jail time and the Met are making significant headway in tackling OCNs who are involved in this trade. My team will continue to proactively target those that bring violence and misery to the streets of London.”
