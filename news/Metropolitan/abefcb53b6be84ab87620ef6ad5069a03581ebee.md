**A man has been arrested after a disturbance at a residential address in Southwark.**

Police were called at 14:12hrs on Saturday, 2 January to a property in Great Dover Street, SE1.

Officers, including armed response officers, attended the scene and made contact with a man who refused to leave the property.

At approximately 22:20hrs armed officers entered the property and safely detained a man, aged in his 40s. He has been arrested on suspicion of affray and making threats to commit criminal damage. The man remains in custody at a south London police station.

A short time later, police cordons were lifted and residents whoâ€™d left neighbouring properties as a precaution were able to return home.

No injuries were reported.
