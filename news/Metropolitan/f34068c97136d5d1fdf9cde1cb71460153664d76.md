******Police in Camden have launched a boxing initiative for young people to give them the chance to learn new skills while diverting them away from crime.**

‘Off the Hook’ encourages children and teenagers to focus on positive and controlled fighting and includes educational opportunities, along with the physical benefits of sport.

The project, at the Queen’s Crescent Community Centre in Gospel Oak, will initially run for ten weeks whilst adhering to Covid regulations.

Those involved are given the chance to ask local officers about policing and take part in workshops about drug awareness, bullying, stop and search and knife crime.

The project is aimed at 10 to 18 year olds, and those who complete the 10-week programme will receive a qualification to help them progress to further education or work.

Neighbourhood officers from the Central North Basic Command Unit have developed the scheme alongside the Queen’s Crescent Community Association and the charity GOAL.

 **PC Jan Sher, who helped to organise the initiative, said:** “The aim of the club is to give young people living in the community the chance to get involved in something meaningful and aspirational in a safe environment.

“It also gives us a chance to engage with them constructively to educate them about the work of the police – but also to hear about their experiences and concerns.

“Tackling violent crime across London is the Met’s top priority and through engaging with these young people we are able to give them the skills and confidence they need to take the right path and to make a successful start in their adult lives.”
