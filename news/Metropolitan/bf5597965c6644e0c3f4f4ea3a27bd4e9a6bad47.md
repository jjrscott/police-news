******A serving officer has been dismissed without notice following the conclusion of a special case hearing.**

PC Rafal Kedziora, who was attached to the Central North Command Unit, attended the hearing on Friday, 26 February to answer allegations that his conduct amounted to a breach of the Standards of Professional Behaviour in respect of discreditable conduct.

On 30 November 2020 at Southwark Crown Court, PC Kedziora pleaded guilty, and was therefore convicted of the following offences:

\- Cause computer to perform function with intent to secure/enable unauthorised access, contrary to section 1 of the Computer Misuse Act 1990;
\- Possess prohibited weapon for discharge of noxious liquid/gas/electrical incapacitation device/thing, contrary to section 5(1)(b) of the Firearms Act 1968;
\- Harassment of another, contrary to section 2(1) and (2) of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997.

In respect of the computer misuse offence, PC Kedziora was sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment, suspended for 12 months. He was required to undertake Rehabilitation Activity Requirements for a maximum of 30 days and pay a victim surcharge of £122.

In respect of the remaining two offences, he received a 12 month conditional discharge.

The panel, chaired by Assistant Commissioner Helen Bell, found the allegations proven as gross misconduct and PC Kedziora was dismissed without notice.

Due to the current Covid-19 pandemic, it was necessary to hold the hearing in private.
