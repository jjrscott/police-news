**The manager of a shisha café in Wembley has been referred for a possible £10,000 fine after Met officers attended and found approximately 50 people breaching the Tier 4 rules.**

Officers from the North West BCU attended the venue on Tuesday, 29 December after reports of a large number of people smoking shisha pipes, watching football and playing loud music inside.

The group dispersed when officers arrived.

21 shisha pipes were lit and still warm when the officers carried out a search of the venue.

 **North West BCU Commander Louis Smith, said:** “I completely appreciate that 2020 has been a tough year for many of us, but now is not the time for people to start getting relaxed about the rules that have been put in place to help slow and reduce the spread of this virus.

“No one in the North West BCU, or anywhere else in London, is completely immune to catching or spreading Covid. Where officers see clear breaches we will use the powers available to us to enforce fines.”
