******The organiser of an illegal gathering in Greenwich - that breached Covid regulations - has been reported for a £10,000 fine.**

Shortly after 03:20hrs on Thursday, 24 December, officers were called to Bessemer Place following reports of a disturbance at a residential property.

After arriving on scene, officers came across a large group of people leaving the address.

Officers dispersed the crowds and identified a 20-year-old woman as the resident of the property. She was reported for consideration of a £10,000 fixed penalty notice.

 **Chief Superintendent Rob Atkin MBE, South East BCU commander, said:** "People in London and across the country have made sacrifices this Christmas and have followed the rules in place to help stop the spread of this deadly virus.

"There will come a time when we will all be able to meet up with all our friends and family again and enjoy parties and other celebrations like we did before the pandemic.

"Until then, officers will not hesitate to take action against those who flagrantly break the rules and put other people's lives at risk."
