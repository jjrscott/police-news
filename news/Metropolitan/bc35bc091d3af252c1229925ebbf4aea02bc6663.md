******Officers from the Metâ€™s Roads and Transport Policing Command, who were appealing to trace a man following three assaults, have made an arrest.**

A 30-year-old man from Barnet was arrested on Tuesday, 23 February.

The arrest follows an appeal that related to two incidents that happened on Wednesday, 11 November; one on a Route 83 bus and the other at a supermarket on Coppetts Centre in Barnet, N12.

A third assault on a Route 221 bus in Edgware was also reported to have happened the next day.

The man was arrested for the three assaults and on suspicion of a fourth that came to light following the appeal.

He was taken to a north London police station and later released under investigation.
