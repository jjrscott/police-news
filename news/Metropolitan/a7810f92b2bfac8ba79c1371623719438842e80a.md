******The special case hearing for a former Met officer concluded on Tuesday, 22 December.**

PC Mohammed Khan, who was attached to the North West Command Unit, was alleged to have breached the Standards of Professional Behaviour in respect of Fitness for Duty and Discreditable Conduct

It was alleged that on 16 January 2020, PC Khan was subject to a “with cause drugs test”. He was required to provide a sample of urine which was sent for laboratory analysis.

The analysis found the sample contained THC-acid (cannabis metabolite) at a concentration greater than 100 nanograms per millilitre.

The officer resigned from the Met on 7 December 2020. He did not attend the hearing.

The panel concluded at the hearing that had he remained a serving officer former, PC Khan would have been dismissed without notice.
