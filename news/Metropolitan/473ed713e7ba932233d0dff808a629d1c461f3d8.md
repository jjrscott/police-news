**Detectives are appealing for anyone with information about a stabbing that occurred in Ealing last weekend to come forward.**

Officers were called to Conway Crescent, Perivale, UB6 at 18:10hrs on Sunday, 20 December following reports of an assault.

A 16-year-old boy was found with stab injuries and was taken to a central London hospital. He remains in hospital in a serious but not life threatening condition.

A second boy, aged 15, was found with minor injuries that were not caused as a result of a stabbing.

 **Detective Constable Liam Owens-Reeve said:** “This was a violent incident that has understandably shocked the local community.

“The victim remains in hospital and while his condition is not believed to be life threatening, we shouldn’t underestimate the impact this attack will have on him and his family.

“I believe there are people out there who know what happened and can help us identify who is responsible. I would urge them to get in touch.”

Anyone who saw unusual or suspicious activity in the area on Sunday evening, or who has other information about the attack, should call police on 101 or tweet @MetCC quoting CAD5760/20DEC.

Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously, by calling Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
