Convicted: John Broughton

******A former private tutor has been convicted of indecently assaulting a young boy who he taught in the early 1980s.**

At Woolwich Crown Court on Tuesday, 5 January, John Broughton 75 (17.06.45) of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to a charge of indecent assault of a nine-year-old boy at an address in Sidcup between December 1981 and April 1982.

He was sentenced to one day's imprisonment concurrent with a sentence he is currently serving for a different offence.

The judge imposed this sentence due to the fact Broughton had already served a 40-month sentence in 1986 for a series of similar offences. The judge ruled that, if the judge in 1986 had been aware of the current case, he would not have imposed any greater sentence than he did.

Broughton must sign the Sexual Offenders Register for seven years.

 **Detective Constable Bethany Russell said:** "What this victim suffered was unacceptable. Broughton should have been protecting the victim in his role as his private tutor.

"I commend the bravery of the victim in coming forward to police after so many years. This case demonstrates that police will investigate and prosecute sexual offences, no matter how long ago they happened."
