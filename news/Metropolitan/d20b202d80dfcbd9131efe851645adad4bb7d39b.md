******A man has been charged after failing to stop for police in Newham.**

Uzair Ahmed, 21 [15.3.99] of Shrewsbury Road, E7 was arrested on Friday, 8 January and was taken to an east London police station where he was charged that same day with dangerous driving, driving without insurance, failing to stop for police, possession with intent to supply a class B drug and drug driving.

He is to appear at Thames Magistrates' Court on Thursday, 28 January.

The charges relate to an incident at approximately 13:55hrs on Friday, 8 January, where an officer approached a car in Barking Road, Newham, to speak with the driver due to the manner of his driving.

The 21-year-old male driver failed to engage with police and drove off.

Officers in an unmarked car began an authorised pursuit of the vehicle at approximately 14:00hrs.

The vehicle was subsequently involved in a road traffic collision with another car being driven by a member of the public in Katherine Road a few minutes later. The driver fled the scene of the collision on foot and was arrested by officers shortly after at Victoria Avenue.

There were no reported injuries.
