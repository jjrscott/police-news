**An investigation into a man arrested in south east London by the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command continues.**

On the morning of Wednesday, 24 February, officers arrested an 18-year-old man at a residential address in south east London.

The man was arrested on suspicion of dissemination of terrorist publications, contrary to Section 2 of the Terrorism Act 2006. The arrest was made under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE).

He was taken to a South London police station and while in custody the man was subsequently detained under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000.

A warrant of further detention under TACT was granted at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Thursday, 25 February, meaning the man can be detained up until Wednesday 3 March.

Searches of the address are complete.
