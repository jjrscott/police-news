******The organiser of an anti-lockdown protest faces the prospect of a £10,000 fine after police intervened to break up an unlawful gathering.**

Officers were called to Rye Lane in Southwark, SE15 at 15:17hrs on Sunday, 27 December following reports of a demonstration being held in breach of Covid restrictions.

When they attended, officers found approximately 100 people at the location. There were speeches being given by individuals with megaphones as well as dancing.

The event appeared to be pre-planned.

 **Acting Inspector David Smith, said:** “This sort of gathering is specifically prohibited under the Tier 4 restrictions brought in following the recent rapid rise in cases.

“We all have a responsibility to follow the rules, stay at home as much as possible and help stop the rapid spread of Covid-19 in our city.

“Anyone coordinating intentional breaches on this scale should know they risk very significant financial penalties.”

Officers engaged with those taking part in the protest to remind them of their responsibility and the requirement to adhere to the regulations.

The organiser, a 58-year-old man, will be reported for the consideration of a fixed penalty notice of up to £10,000.
