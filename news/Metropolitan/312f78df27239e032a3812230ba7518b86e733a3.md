[The males police would like to speak to]

**Detectives are appealing for people to come forward after an aggravated burglary in Walthamstow.**

On Monday, 11 January 2021 at approximately 14:30hrs, a man wearing an orange high visibility jacket knocked on the door at a residential address in Beresford Road, E17 and stated that he was a delivery driver.

Once the resident opened the door, four other suspects forced their way into the address, all were armed with knives.

The suspects entered several rooms in the house, searching for valuable items to steal.

The five suspects stole jewellery, phones, passports, iPads, a designer handbag, ear pods, ID cards and designer watches from the address.

Police are making an appeal to the public for any witnesses or information in relation to the suspects that could result in their identification.

Anyone with information or who recognises the suspects is asked to contact police via 101 quoting reference CAD 3600/11JAN21 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

There have been no arrests and enquiries continue.
