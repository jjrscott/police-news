**A man has been arrested following a linked series of commercial knifepoint robberies in west London and south west London.**

The 45-year-old was arrested on the morning of Thursday, 25 February, in the vicinity of Northfield Avenue, Ealing following a proactive operation by the Met's Flying Squad.

The arrest follows a series of seven incidents that are being treated as related. They took place between Friday, 16 October 2020 and Wednesday, 17 February at a number of supermarkets in Hounslow, Ealing, and Richmond.

Officers also recovered a large kitchen knife during the arrest.

In five of the cases, the suspect is alleged to have waited for the store to be opened by staff members, before threatening them with a knife. He then stole cash from the tills, and on occasion, cigarettes, alcohol, and scratch cards, which were placed into a black holdall and a bin bag/Sainsbury’s bags.

In total, over £25,000 worth of cash and goods were stolen.

The man is in custody at a south London police station.
