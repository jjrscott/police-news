Family members have been paying tribute to PC Andrew Harper.

Andrew's mum Debbie, said: "We are devastated and bereft but as Andrew always lived with dignity, honour and calmness, we intend to grieve in this way. "

"A big part of me has gone with you, I cannot imagine our lives going forward but we will do so with Andrew in our hearts."

His father Phil, said: "You would always put yourself forward to look after the people around you, and would always see the good in others.

"You always made us laugh, always bringing tears of happiness to our eyes."

Andrew's brother Sean, said: "We all love you so much, I promise you will never be forgotten, and I promise that I will do my best to try to make you as proud of me as I am of you."

His sister Aimee, said: "It takes my breath away every time the realisation sets in that I never get to see you again. But we were so, so lucky to all be together for the wedding which was perfect, you always brought us together.
