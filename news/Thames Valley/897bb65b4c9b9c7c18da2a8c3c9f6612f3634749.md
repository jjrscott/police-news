Following a Thames Valley Police investigation, a man has been sentenced to four months in jail after possessing a prohibited article whilst in prison.

Andre Griffiths, aged 25, who is currently serving a sentence at HMP Featherstone, pleaded guilty of possessing a prohibited article whilst in prison following a trial at Oxford Crown Court on Tuesday (9/2).

This follows an incident on 24 May 2020, in which a mobile phone was discovered in his prison cell. On 26 July 2020 Griffiths was also seen dropping a SIM card, and data was retrieved linking its usage back to Griffiths.

PC Andy Gold of the Prison Crime Team based at Banbury police station said: "Mobile phones can have a significantly detrimental impact on the safe day to day running of prisons, both for other inmates and staff.

"The sentence passed reflects the seriousness of the offence and the position of the Crown Court on these types of matters."
