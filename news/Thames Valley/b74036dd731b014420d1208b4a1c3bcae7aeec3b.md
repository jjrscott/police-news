A section 60 order that was put in place in Reading has been extended for a further 24 hours.

The first order was put in place following the death of 26-year-old Raheem Hanif in Dulnan Close, Tilehurst.

Following a murder investigation overnight in Caversham, an extension has been approved from 9pm today (14/2) and will last for a further 24 hours, concluding at 9pm tomorrow (15/2), however it will be reviewed and if necessary extended once more.

The order applies to the LPA of Reading in its entirety, which temporarily allows police officers greater powers to stop and search in a defined location when it is believed there is a likelihood that serious violence will take place.

Superintendent Nick John, LPA Commander for Reading, said: "Again we are keeping a section 60 order in place across Reading and the surrounding area.

"The decision to put these orders in place is never taken lightly, but it is deemed absolutely necessary in light of the incident which happened overnight and other incidents in the area during the past week.

"The aim of a section 60 order is to prevent incidents of serious violence and it gives officers greater powers to stop and search.

"Weapons and drugs have already been seized and we will continue to use these powers to remove these from our communities.

"You will see more police in the area as we have extra patrols underway.

"Please feel free to talk to our officers, they can help to answer any questions and will be able to provide some reassurance.

"Thank you in advance for your continued support and compliance."
