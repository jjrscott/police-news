Following a Thames Valley Police investigation, a man has been sentenced for burglary in Reading.

Christopher Lamb, aged 28, of no fixed abode, was convicted at Reading Crown Court of three counts of burglary.

He pleaded guilty to the three counts of burglary on Thursday (10/12) and was sentenced to four years and eight months imprisonment. One further burglary was taken into consideration.

The sentencing relates to incidents that took place between 17 May 2020 and 16 July 2020 whereby Lamb broke into three properties in Twyford and Surrey and stole personal property.

Detective Constable Naomi Padgett, based at Loddon Valley police station said: "I am pleased with this result and glad that Christopher Lamb is being held accountable for his offences.

"We work hard to protect our communities from offenders like Lamb and hope this is a warning to other offenders that we will investigate thoroughly, in order to bring offenders to justice.

"I hope this also offers some reassurance to his victims and the communities where his offences took place."
