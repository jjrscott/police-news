No one was injured during the incident.

"We are keeping an open mind as to the reasons behind this incident, but at this time we do not believe there was a wider danger to the public.

"Our patrols we will be stepped up in the area and members of the public will see an increased police presence whilst we conduct our enquiries.

"We would ask anyone who has information or may have CCTV footage to please get in touch if they feel they may be able to assist our investigation.
