Officers investigating a murder in Thame, Oxfordshire, can now confirm the formal identity of the victim.

Officers were called to an incident in Chinnor Road, Thame, shortly after 7pm on Wednesday (22/7).

Paramedics were also in attendance, but sadly, the man was pronounced dead at the scene.

The victim has now been identified as Joshua Harling, aged 19, from Oxford.

Joshua's family are being supported by specially trained officers and have requested that their privacy continues to be respected at this extremely difficult time.

A post-mortem examination was conducted yesterday and the cause of death has been confirmed as a stab wound to the chest.

Three teenagers, a 15-year-old boy from Oxfordshire and two 19-year-old men from Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire, who have been arrested on suspicion of murder, remain in police custody at this time.
