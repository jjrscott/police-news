**Investigation update: Reading terrorist incident**

Detectives from Counter Terrorism Policing South East (CTPSE) continue to appeal for anyone with information about the terrorist incident in Reading, to come forward.

A number of people sustained stab injuries during the incident which happened in Forbury Gardens just before 7pm on Saturday (20/6). And sadly, three people died as a result of their injuries.

A further three people who were taken to hospital with injuries following this incident, have now been discharged from hospital.

A 25-year-old man from Reading, was arrested in connection with this incident, by three police officers near to the scene. Detectives were today granted a warrant of further detention until Saturday 27 June, and the man remains in police custody.

Detective Chief Superintendent Kath Barnes, Head of CTPSE, said: "This investigation is continuing at pace.

"We have a large team of officers and staff working to establish exactly what happened in the lead up to, during and after this incident.

"Our thoughts very much remain with the family and friends of those who have lost loved ones and those who have been injured and affected as a result of this tragic incident.

"I would ask both the media and the public again not to speculate on any aspect of this case at this time as this could have an impact on the ongoing investigation and any future court appearances."

Counter Terrorism Policing have taken on the responsibility for this investigation and are keeping an open mind as to the motive for this attack.

More than 100 officers and staff are continuing to work through the information that has already been provided by witnesses and other members of the public and continue to appeal for anyone with any information to come forward.

They are particularly interested in hearing from anyone who may have been driving in the area before or at the time of the incident, and who may have dash-cam footage which could be of use to the investigation.

A number of items have been recovered from the scene and are currently being investigated by specialist teams.

DCS Barnes added: "I would like to take this opportunity to thank those who have already been in touch. We have had a large amount of information come in to us via the reporting portal on www.ukpoliceimageappeal.co.uk and via Thames Valley Police on 101, and have spoken to more than 50 witnesses at this time.

"Your information is vital and we would ask that you please continue to share this with us.

 "You may think your information is insignificant, but it could be a vital piece of this investigation, so please get in touch.

"We are aware of distressing mobile phone footage which was posted online in the immediate aftermath of the incident, and I would urge you not to re-share this. We would ask that this is shared with us as a priority."

A number of police cordons remain in place while the investigation continues and we thank those local residents who have been impacted by this. We will be releasing the cordons as soon as we are in a position to do so.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact Thames Valley Police on 101, quoting Operation Vaselike.
