South & Vale local policing area welcomes Chief Inspector Guy Elkins as the newly appointed Deputy Commander.

On Monday (4/1) Chief Inspector Guy Elkins started in the role, taking over from Chief Inspector Matt Bullivant who has held the role for the last two years.

C/Insp Elkins transferred to Thames Valley Police to work in the regional counter terrorism unit in 2015 following 11 years with Dorset Police.

Throughout his career, C/Insp Elkins has held a variety of different policing roles and has acquired extensive experience in combatting counter terrorism, serious organised crime, neighbourhood policing and criminal investigations.

Alongside his role as Deputy Commander, C/Insp Elkins chairs the force's internal network which provides support to staff from ethnic minorities and helps the organisation develop to become more representative of its diverse communities.

On starting the role, Chief Inspector Guy Elkins said: "I am really looking forward to joining the team here at South & Vale and working alongside Superintendent Lis Knight to continue the great work that is already underway in the area. These are exceptionally challenging times for us all and I want to make sure we continue to provide the best service to our communities.

"I am particularly keen to continue to build relationships between the police and the local community to tackle and prevent those crimes that impact local residents and business owners the most. I am also passionate about prioritising the welfare and wellbeing of our officers and staff whilst still ensuring that our response to incidents meets the expectations of our communities."
