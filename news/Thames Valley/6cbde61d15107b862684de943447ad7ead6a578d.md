The family of Tycoon Murungweni, aged 42, who tragically died in a road traffic collision on the A4421 near Newton Purcell on 14 November, have paid tribute to him.

"We are slowly coming to terms with the sudden loss of a loving and loved husband, father, son, brother, uncle and friend.

"Tycoon touched so many lives, anyone who knew Tycoon knew that he was very loving, supportive, motivating and fun loving.

"He was very hard working and loved spending time with his family and friends. He also spent his time in the gym exercising, watching football (his team was Liverpool) and playing with his children Tyra (10-years-old) and Thandeka (3-years-old).

"We will cherish the wonderful moments we created with him. Though we are pained at the sudden loss, we are grateful to God for the time we were able to spend with him."
