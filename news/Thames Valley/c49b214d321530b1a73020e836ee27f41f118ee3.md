Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following an assault in Eynsham.

At around 2.55pm on Monday (1/2) the victim, a 47-year-old man, was walking along the footpath on the A40 near to the BP Garage at Eynsham when another man passing by him threw a bike in front of him and proceeded to shout at the victim, punching and kicking him multiple times before spitting at him. The offender cycled off in the direction of Oxford.

The victim sustained injuries to his face and leg. He received treatment at the John Radcliff Hospital and was later discharged.

The offender is described as a white man in his early thirties, approximately 6ft tall, medium build with fair, thinning hair and stubble. He was wearing a black zip-up hoody, sand coloured work trousers and sand coloured work boots, and was holding a dark coloured pushbike that had a light green carrier bag hanging from the left handlebar.

Investigating officer Sergeant Gary Smales, based at Witney police station, said: "I am appealing for anyone with information about this incident or who may have dash-cam footage from driving down the A40 around the time of the incident to come forward.

"I am particularly keen to speak to the members of the public that assisted the victim.

"You can do this by using our online form or by calling 101 quoting reference number 43210043747. Or if you would prefer to remain anonymous, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website."
