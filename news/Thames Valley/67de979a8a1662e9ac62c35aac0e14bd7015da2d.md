A man has had six months added to his prison sentence after being found using a mobile phone while in jail.

Ian Greenwood, aged 33, pleaded guilty to the offence at a hearing at Oxford Crown Court last Friday (18/2).

Greenwood was found in possession of the phone during a search by staff in March last year.

He was sentenced to six months' imprisonment to be served consecutively to his existing sentence for failing to comply with a community order.

Investigating officer Detective Constable Rebecca Sewell, from Banbury CID, said: "We know that the use of mobile phones in prison can have a detrimental impact on the safe day-to-day running of prisons, both for staff and other inmates.

"Their use will not be tolerated and we will prosecute those found with them in their possession."
