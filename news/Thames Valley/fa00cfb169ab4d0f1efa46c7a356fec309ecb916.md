Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Finchampstead.

At around 8.45pm on Wednesday (10/2) a man was walking along Evendons Lane towards Finchampstead when a man walking in the other direction stopped in front of him.

The offender hit the victim's hand and took his jacket, which had headphones in. He made a comment to the victim and then ran off.

It is believed that the offender got into a vehicle and then drove off towards Wokingham.

The victim sustained a cut to his thumb and did not require hospital treatment. A jacket and a pair of headphones were stolen.

The offender is described as a white man in his thirties wearing a dark puffer-jacket and a balaclava.

Investigating officer Detective Constable Rebecca Clough, based at Loddon Valley police station, said: "I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed this incident or has dash-cam footage from Evendons Lane at around 8.45pm on Wednesday.

"If you have any information that could help with this investigation, please get in touch using our online form or by calling 101 with reference number 43210057856. Alternatively you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously via their website or on 0800 555 111."
