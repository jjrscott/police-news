Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following a stabbing at a shopping centre in High Wycombe.

At around 3.15pm yesterday (16/2), police were called to Chilterns Shopping Centre to reports of a stabbing outside of a mobile phone shop.

A man, aged 45, was found suffering stab injuries and taken to hospital. He has since been discharged.

A 68-year-old man from High Wycombe was detained nearby and arrested on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon and wounding with intent. He remains in custody.

Investigating officer Detective Sergeant Stephen Fox, of High Wycombe CID, said: "This stabbing happened in the middle of the day and we are keen to speak to anyone who may have seen what happened or the moments leading up to the incident.

"Our investigation is progressing well and we have already spoken to a number of witnesses, however we believe there are others who are yet to come forward.

"Anyone with information should call 101 or make a report online, with reference 43210066055 or you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
