A man and woman have been sentenced following a breach of a closure order in Banbury.

Rebecca Nuttall, aged 30 and Thomas Hassall, aged 32, both of no fixed abode pleaded guilty to one count each of breaching a closure order at a property in Juniper Close, Banbury.

On Saturday (23/1) they were both convicted at Oxford Magistrates' Court and issued with a Â£100 fine and a two year restraining order preventing them from contacting the occupant or attending the address in Juniper Close.

At around 5.30pm on Friday (22/1) they were found in a property that had previously been issued with a closure order following incidents of anti-social behaviour, and they were subsequently arrested and charged.

Sergeant Sarah Nash, of the Banbury problem solving team said: "A closure order was issued at this property to protect the vulnerable resident from exploitation and local drug users.

"Despite knowing this, Nuttall and Hassall continued to enter the property putting the resident at risk.

"We take breaches like this very seriously and work hard to protect our communities from this kind of anti-social behaviour and drug misuse."
