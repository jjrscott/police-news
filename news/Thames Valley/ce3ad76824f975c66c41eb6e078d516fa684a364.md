Officers investigating an incident of shoplifting and assault in Wantage are renewing an appeal for witnesses.

At around 1pm on Saturday (27/2) two men entered Boots in Market Place, Wantage, taking a quantity of facial products.

The men were challenged by a staff member, and he was then assaulted by the offenders, being kicked and sustaining a number of injuries, including a suspected broken nose, cuts and bruises.

The two offenders are both described as white men aged in their late teens to early twenties.

The first offender had medium length brown curly hair and was wearing a white short-sleeved t-shirt, jeans and white Nike trainers.

The second offender had brown medium length messy hair, a short dark-coloured moustache and hair on his chin.

He was wearing a black short sleeved t-shirt and blue jeans and had bracelets on his right wrist.

Investigating officer PC Jamie Gosling said: "I am appealing to anybody who was in the Market Square or Denchworth Road area of Wantage on Saturday and believes that they witnessed this incident to please get in touch with police.

"I am also very keen to hear from anybody who may have dash-cam footage from the area between 1pm and 2.20pm to please get in touch with us.

"You can do so by calling 101, or make a report online, quoting reference number 43210083009.

"Alternatively, for 100% anonymity, you can also call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
