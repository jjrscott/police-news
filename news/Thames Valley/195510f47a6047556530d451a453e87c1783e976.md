Officers investigating the robbery of two teenagers in Oxford are making a specific appeal for CCTV footage and images.

Between 6pm and 6.20pm on Saturday (6/2), two 18-year-old men were approached by a man in Broad Oak Park, adjacent to the Eastern Bypass Road in Wood Farm, Oxford.

The offender threatened the victims with a knife, making a stabbing movement towards one of them before stealing a black Adidas shoulder bag.

The victims were not injured in the incident.

The offender is described as a white man, aged in his early twenties, between 5ft 11ins and 6ft 3ins tall and of a slim build wearing dark clothing.

Investigating officer Detective Constable Archie Coyne of the Priority Crime Team based at Oxford police station, said: "We have now had some information suggesting that the suspect was riding slowly around the Wood Farm area prior to this offence looking into cars and driveways.

"Given this information, I am asking residents of Wood Farm and Headington to please check their CCTV and doorbell cameras between 5pm and 7pm on Saturday for a man as described, riding on a bicycle.

"You can upload your footage to our dedicated portal at https://unitedkingdom1cpp-portal.digital-policing.co.uk/serip/appeal/wood-farm-headington-cctv-and-ring-doorbell-appeal

"I am hopeful that some residents may have captured our suspect on their cameras, and so please do get in touch if you believe you have any footage or images that can assist this investigation.

"I would also again appeal to anybody who believes that they witnessed the robbery to call 101, quoting reference number 43210052011 or make a report online.

"You can also call the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111."
