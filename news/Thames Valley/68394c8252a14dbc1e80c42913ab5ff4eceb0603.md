Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following an incident in which a man was assaulted in Slough.

Between 4.10pm and 4.30pm on Thursday (17/12) the victim, a 56-year-old man, was driving a lorry in Fairlie Road, near the Mars factory.

His vehicle was overtaken by a dark green Toyota Yaris, which had the partial registration Y269, and did not have its lights on.

The offender stopped his car and got out before approaching the lorry driver and assaulting him by punching him to his face. During the incident the offender also threatened the victim.

The offender then drove away in his car and overtook multiple vehicles.

The victim sustained swelling to his lip.

The offender is described as a dark skinned man, aged 35 to 40 years old, 5ft 6ins to 5ft 7ins tall, and had short dark hair. He was wearing blue combat work trousers and a blue coat.

Investigating officer PC Charlotte Morris, of the Incident and Crime Response team based at Slough police station, said: "We are investigating this incident which left the victim with minor injuries and feeling fearful. I would like to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident as they may have a vital piece of information which could assist us."
