Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following an aggravated burglary in Reading.

At around 5.30am this morning (11/2), three offenders forced entry into a residential address on Highgrove Street, Whitley and attacked a female victim, aged 39, causing injury to her arm.

The incident then spilled out onto the street where another woman, aged 43, was also struck with a weapon. She was later taken to hospital for treatment.

The suspects are believed to be a white female, a white man and one black man; all fled the scene prior to police arrival.

It is understood that the victims and suspects were known to each other.

Investigating officer Detective Sergeant Ben Beasley, based at Reading Police station, said: "This was a violent attack in which weapons were used to injure two female victims.

"We know it was witnessed by a number of members of the public and we would appeal for any of those who have not yet spoken to us to come forward.

"Similarly anyone else who believes they may have any information that could help us identify these individuals is urged to contact us on 101 with reference 43210058087 or call Crimestoppers completely anonymously on 0800 555 111."
