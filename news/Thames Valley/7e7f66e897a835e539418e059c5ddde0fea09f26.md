Thames Valley Police is releasing CCTV images following an attempted robbery in Aylesbury.

At around 3pm on Monday 1 March the victim, a 13-year-old boy, was cycling along Great Western Street by the bus station, with a group of friends.

A man on a bike was cycling in the other direction when a disagreement occurred.

The man got off his bike and punched the victim in the face and shoulder and stamped on the victim's bike a number of times.

The man then cycled off along Long Lional.

One of the victim's friends followed the man and challenged him. The man tried to grab the boy's phone and in the process, pushed him to the floor.

The man then cycled off again.

The victims sustained minor injuries and did not require hospital treatment.

Investigating officer PC Jake Farrell, based at Aylesbury police station, said: "I am appealing for anyone who recognises the man in these images to come forward as I believe he may have vital information about this incident.

You can get in touch using our online form or by calling 101, quoting reference number 43210086100. Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their website."
