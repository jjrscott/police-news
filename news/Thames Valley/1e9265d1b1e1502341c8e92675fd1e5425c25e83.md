Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Wantage.

It happened shortly after 9.45am on Tuesday (22/12), when the victim, a man in his seventies, was in his car in Waitrose car park on Wallingford Street when he was approached by a woman with a clip board claiming to be collecting money for charity.

When the victim said he didn't have any money, the woman opened the car door and grabbed both of his wrists and stole his watch. She then left the scene on foot.

Nothing else was stolen and the victim sustained a small cut to his wrist but did not require any medical treatment.

The offender is described as a white woman in her mid-thirties, around 5ft 5in tall with a medium build. She had blonde hair tied back and was wearing a beige jacket and dark trousers. She spoke with an eastern European accent.

Investigating officer Detective Constable Fiona Boyce, based at Abingdon police station said: "I am appealing for any witnesses of this incident, or anyone who saw a woman matching the description, or if you were also approached by this woman, to please get in touch.

"Likewise, if you were driving in the area at the time please check your dash-cam footage as you may have captured useful information.

"You can make a report online or by calling 101 and quoting reference 43200435255.

"Alternatively, if you wish to remain 100% anonymous you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
