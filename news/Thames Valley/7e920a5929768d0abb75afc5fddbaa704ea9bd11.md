Following a Thames Valley Police investigation, a man has been sentenced for multiple offences, which occurred in Buckinghamshire.

Gary Atkins, age 43, of Sheepcote Dell Road, Holmer Green, was sentenced at Aylesbury Crown Court yesterday (29/3) to seven years' imprisonment and was also banned from driving for four and a half years.

At the same hearing he pleaded guilty to four counts of burglary, three counts of theft from a motor vehicle, two counts of vehicle interference, one count of business burglary, one count of assaulting a police officer and one count of possession of a class A drug.

These offences took place between December 2019 and February 2021 across Buckinghamshire in Holmer Green, Hazlemere and Tylers Green.

During these incidents, Atkins forced entry to a number of properties and stole various items as well as breaking into vehicles and taking items.

Further, when Atkins was arrested he assaulted a police officer.

Investigating officer, Detective Constable Kerry Hall, based at Amersham police station, said: "Gary Atkins has been committing offences in the Holmer Green area for a number of years, causing the residents a lot of distress and anxiety.

"The sentence he has received shows the severity of his criminality.

"Hopefully it will put a lot of people's minds at rest that he will not be in Holmer Green for some time."
