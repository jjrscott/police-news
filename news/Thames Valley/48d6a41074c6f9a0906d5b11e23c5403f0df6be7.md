Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following an assault and attempted robbery in Wokingham.

It happened at around 8.30pm on Thursday 31 December at the park on Latimer Road, when the victims, two teenage boys, were sitting on a bench at the park when they were approached by a man.

The man demanded that they hand over their phones, and when they refused he punched one of the victims on the back of his head. He then chased after the second victim and also punched him several times causing a cut below his eye.

The man then left the scene in the direction of the pavilion towards Latimer Road.

The victims did not require any hospital treatment and no property was stolen.

The offender is described as a white man around 19 years old and around 5ft 11in tall. He had a slit in his right eyebrow and short black hair. He was wearing all black at the time.

Investigating officer PC Akram Wasim, based at Loddon Valley police station said: "I am appealing for anyone who may have witnessed this incident, or saw a man matching the description provided to get in touch.
