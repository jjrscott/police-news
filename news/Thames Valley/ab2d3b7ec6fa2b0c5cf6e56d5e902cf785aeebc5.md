A further Section 60 order has been authorised in Reading following a stabbing on Monday (18/1).

The new Section 60 order will be in place between 4pm today (20/1) and 9am tomorrow (21/1).

It will cover the areas as defined by the map, which includes Oxford Road, Tilehurst Road, Bath Road, the A3290 boundary to the A3290 London Road roundabout, across the River Thames into Lower Caversham and the Thames and Kennet Marina.

Other roads include Northumberland Avenue, Elgar Road, Church Road through to the A3290 boundary and the Caversham Bridge.

Section 60 orders temporarily give police officers greater powers to stop and search in a defined area at a specific time when it is believed there is a likelihood that serious violence will take place.

During the previous order that was in place between 4pm on Tuesday (19/1) and 9am today (20/1) 10 stops were carried out no one was arrested and no weapons were seized. One stop resulted in the seizure of a quantity of cannabis.

Superintendent Nick John, Reading LPA Commander said: "There will be a continued increased police presence in Reading as a further Section 60 order has been authorised this afternoon.

"Please don't be worried if you are stopped by an officer, as this does not mean that you are in trouble.

"Section 60 orders are an important way for us to ensure that weapons are kept off the streets and to prevent serious violence from taking place.

"I would like to thank the local community for their continued support whilst these orders are in place."
