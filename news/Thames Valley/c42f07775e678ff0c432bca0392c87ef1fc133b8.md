Following an investigation by Thames Valley Police, a woman has been sentenced for multiple incidents of theft in Reading.

Siobhan Maven-Hazelton, aged 33, of no fixed abode was sentenced on Saturday (6/2) at Reading Magistrates' Court to one year imprisonment.

She pleaded guilty to 15 counts of theft from a shop and one count of theft of a pedal cycle at the same hearing.

These offences took place between August 2020 and February this year at various locations in Reading.

Investigating officer, PC Vince Moore, based at Reading police station, said: "I am pleased that Maven-Hazelton pleaded guilty to these offences. The evidence against her was overwhelming.

"Over the course of a few months, she persistently went out with intent to take items without paying for them.

"This behaviour is not tolerated by Thames Valley Police and I hope this result shows the seriousness with which we take these offences and that we work tirelessly to bring offenders to justice."
