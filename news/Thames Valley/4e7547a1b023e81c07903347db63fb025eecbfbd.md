The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is conducting an investigation after a 24-year-old man suffered a cardiac arrest whilst in the custody of police officers at Milton Keynes General Hospital on Wednesday, 27 January 2021.

On the night of the incident, Thames Valley Police referred the matter to the IOPC and it was taken as an independent investigation.

Thames Valley Police has since been informed that on Tuesday (2/2) the man sadly passed away. Our thoughts remain with the man's family at this very difficult time, who are being supported by the IOPC.

Thames Valley Police has been fully co-operating with the investigation from the outset and will continue to do so.

This incident is being investigated independently, as such it would not be appropriate for us to offer further comment at this time.
