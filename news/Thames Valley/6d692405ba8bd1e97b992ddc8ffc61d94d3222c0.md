Following the release of a CCTV image yesterday (12/10), Thames Valley Police is no longer appealing for information concerning an individual's identity.

An appeal was made in connection with a fail-to-stop collision shortly after 2.30pm on Sunday (11/10) in Friar Street. A cyclist was involved in a collision with a 23-month-old girl who was attempting to cross the road with her family. The rider stopped briefly at the scene but then rode away without leaving his details.

The child sustained a head injury and was taken to the Royal Berkshire Hospital by officers. She was discharged several hours later.

Following the appeal the cyclist was located. No arrests have been made in connection with the investigation, which remains ongoing.

Officers would like to thank the public and media for sharing the appeal.
