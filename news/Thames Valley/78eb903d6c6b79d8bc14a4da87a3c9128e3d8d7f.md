Thames Valley Police is appealing for information in connection with a fail to stop collision in Oxford.

The collision occurred in Great Clarendon Street at the junction with Hart Street at about 3.55pm yesterday (6/3).

A small white car and a van were in collision, during which a pedestrian, a woman in her fifties was seriously injured. The victim remains in hospital at this time.

The drivers of both vehicles left the scene before police arrived at the location.

PC Lyndsey Blackaby, of the Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "We need to identify the vehicles involved in this collision, and the occupants of the vehicles as soon as possible.

"Anyone who knows the occupants of the vehicles, any witnesses or anyone with footage who haven't already spoken to the police, are urged to contact the force immediately.

"The easiest way to contact the force is by visiting our website or by calling 101, quoting investigation reference number 43210094276."
