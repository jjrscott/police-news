A man has been charged after an attempted robbery at a McDonalds in High Wycombe.

Lee Davis, aged 32, of Station Close, High Wycombe, appeared at High Wycombe Magistrates' Court on Monday (1/3) where he was charged with one count of attempted robbery.

He was released on bail and will next appear at Aylesbury Crown Court on 12 April.

The charges relate to an incident in which a woman was sitting at the drive thru of McDonalds in Dovecot Road when a male approached her car and made an unsuccessful attempt to grab her phone through the window.
