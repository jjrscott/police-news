Officers investigating a murder in Tilehurst, Reading, can now confirm the formal identity of the victim.

Officers were called to an incident in Dulnan Close, Tilehurst, shortly before 7pm on Saturday (6/2).

Sadly, despite the best efforts of medical professionals, police and members of the public, the victim died at the scene of his injuries.

The victim has now been identified as Raheem Hanif, aged 26, from Tilehurst.

Raheem's family are being supported by specially trained officers, and we would request on their behalf that their privacy is respected at this extremely difficult time.

A Home Office post-mortem examination was conducted yesterday (9/2) and the provisional cause of death has been confirmed as a stab wound to the upper chest.

A 16-year-old boy from Reading has been charged in connection with this investigation and appeared at Reading Magistrates' Court this morning (10/2).
