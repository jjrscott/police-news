Thames Valley Police is releasing an image of a man officers would like to speak to in connection with a sexual assault in Reading.

At around 2.45pm on Thursday 17 February, the victim, a woman aged 18, was in the Broad Street Mall shopping centre when a man started following her.

He then grabbed her bottom before leaving the scene.

The suspect is described as white, of stocky build and around 6ft tall.

He was wearing a blue tracksuit with a black parka type jacket at the time of the incident.

PC Matthew Fairman, based at Reading police station, said: "This kind of behaviour is completely unacceptable and not something that anyone should have to put up with.

"We are appealing for anyone who saw the incident or a man acting suspiciously to contact us on 101 with reference 43210067618."
