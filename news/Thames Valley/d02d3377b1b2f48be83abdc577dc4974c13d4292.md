The rider of the motorcycle, a man in his twenties, was taken to hospital with serious injuries where he remains.

Investigating officer, PC Chris Weatherley, of the Joint Operations Roads Policing Unit, said: "I am appealing for witnesses to this incident to please come forward.

"I'd also ask any motorists who were in the local area around the time of the incident to check dash-cam footage in case it may have captured anything that could assist with the investigation.
