A man from High Wycombe has been given a civil injunction in connection with number of incidents of anti-social behaviour.

Sukhpal Singh, aged 42 of Oakridge Road, High Wycombe, was given the injunction at Oxford County Court on 9 December and it is due to be in place until December 2022.

The injunction prohibits Singh from engaging in disorderly behaviour or engaging or threatening to engage in conduct capable of causing harassment, alarm or distress to any person within the district of High Wycombe.

It also prohibits him from being in possession of any controlled drug or drug paraphernalia and engaging in or threatening to engage in violence, or using intimidating or aggressive behaviour.

Singh is also excluded from the areas of Oakridge and Abbey districts in High Wycombe.

Singh can be arrested if he breaches any of these conditions.

PC Abhi Bajwa of the Wycombe Problem Solving Team, said: "Singh's behaviour has affected the High Wycombe community for a considerable amount of time, so much so that some residents have moved due to his behaviour.

"The prohibitions that this injunction puts in place will help improve the quality of life of many local residents and gives us powers to effectively deal with Singh if he breaches any of these.

"I hope this injunction sends a clear message that Thames Valley Police will deal robustly and resolutely with anyone who commits criminal and anti-social behaviour."

MR

Sukhpal Singh
