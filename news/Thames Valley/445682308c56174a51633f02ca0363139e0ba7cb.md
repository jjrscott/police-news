Following a Thames Valley Police investigation, a man has been sentenced to seven months in jail after being found in possession of a mobile phone while in prison.

Sam King, aged 23, who is currently serving a sentence at HMP Bullingdon pleaded guilty to possessing a prohibited article whilst in prison following a trial at Oxford Crown Court on Tuesday (2/3).

This follows an incident on 19 February last year, in which a mobile phone was discovered in his prison cell.

PC Andy Gold of the Prison Crime Team based at Banbury police station said: "Mobile phones can have a significantly detrimental impact on the safe day to day running of prisons, both for other inmates and staff.

"The sentence passed reflects the seriousness of the offence and the position of the Crown Court on these types of matters."
