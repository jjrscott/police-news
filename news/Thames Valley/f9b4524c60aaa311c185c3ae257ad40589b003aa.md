A woman has been sentenced following a breach of a restraining order in Banbury.

Rebecca Nuttall, aged 30, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to one count of breaching a restraining order at Oxford Magistrates' Court on Friday (5/2) and was sentenced to nine weeks' imprisonment.

This follows an incident on Wednesday 3 February, in which Nuttall entered an address on Juniper Hill in Banbury which she was banned from entering or contacting the occupant.

She was charged with the offence the following day.

Sergeant Sarah Nash, of the Banbury problem solving team said: "We are pleased with this court result. Nuttall has breached several orders relating to this address and the vulnerable occupant.

"It is reassuring to see the court taking these matters seriously and we will continue to take robust action against those breaching closure and restraining orders."
