At around 4.25pm on Saturday 2 January, a 19-year-old woman was sexually assaulted while in a Clas Ohlsen store in Broad Street. An offender touched her inappropriately over her clothing, after also recording her with a mobile phone.

The victim was not injured during the incident.

"I would also ask that any members of the public who were in this store on Saturday 2 January and believes they either saw something, or have information on this incident, to make a report.

"Please call 101, quoting reference 43210001625. You can also make a report online, or contact independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 for 100% anonymity while making a report."
