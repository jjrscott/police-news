Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following a fatal collision on the A338 at Newtown, between Junction 14 of the M4 and Hungerford.

At around 12.20pm today (1/2), a red Saab 9-3 left the carriageway and collided with a tree.

The driver and sole occupant, a man in his nineties, was taken to the Great Western Hospital with serious injuries but has since sadly passed away.

His next of kin have been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers.

Senior investigating officer, Sergeant Chris Howlett of the Joint Operations Roads Policing Unit, based at Three Mile Cross, said: "Sadly a man has died following this collision and our thoughts remain with his family at this difficult time.

"We are keen to speak to anyone who may be able to assist our investigation and may have seen this collision or the vehicle being driven prior to the collision.

"Additionally we would appeal for anyone who was driving in the area at the time who may have a dash-cam to please check their footage to see if it has captured anything that may assist us in our investigation.

"Anyone with information can report online or through 101 quoting reference 43210043438."
