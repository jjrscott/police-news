Following a Thames Valley Police investigation, a man has been sentenced for the production of drugs in Reading.

Rigert Korrage, aged 31, of Dulverton Gardens, was sentenced in a hearing at Reading Crown Court on 28 January to two years' imprisonment.

He pleaded guilty to one count of producing a controlled drug of class B, namely cannabis.

On 10 November last year, officers discovered a cannabis factory at a property in Dulverton Gardens in which a number of rooms had been converted in order to grow cannabis.
