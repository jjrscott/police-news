Following a Thames Valley Police investigation, a man has been charged with wounding with intent, possession of an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence, and possession of a knife or sharp pointed article in a public place.

Lawrence Neptune, aged 21, of Chiltern Avenue, High Wycombe was arrested on Friday (22/1) and charged with the offences on Sunday (24/1).

This follows an incident that happened on Friday (22/1) in Oakland Way in Flackwell Heath in which a man in his twenties was stabbed in his arm and required hospital treatment and has since been discharged.

Neptune appeared at High Wycombe Magistrates Court on Monday (25/1) and was remanded in custody until his next court appearance scheduled for 22 February.
