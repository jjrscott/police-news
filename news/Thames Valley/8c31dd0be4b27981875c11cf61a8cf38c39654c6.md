A new Section 60 order has been authorised following a stabbing in Reading.

Previously, a Section 60 order was put in place yesterday evening (18/1) until 9.30am this morning (19/1) following an incident in Church Street in which a man was stabbed.

A new Section 60 order has since been authorised to run from 4pm this afternoon until 9am tomorrow (20/1).

The order applies to the area as defined by the map and including Oxford Road, Tilehurst Road, Bath Road, the A3290 boundary to the A3290 London Road roundabout, across the River Thames into Lower Caversham and the Thames and Kennet Marina.

Other roads include Northunberland Avenue, Elgar Road, Church Road through to the A3290 boundary and the Caversham Bridge.

Superintendent Nick John, Reading LPA Commander said: "A new section 60 order has been authorised this afternoon. This gives officers extra powers to prevent serious violence.

"I appreciate the concern that this will create within the local community and I wish to reassure local residents that this order is in place to prevent any further incidents and I would encourage you to speak to one of our officers with any concerns you may have.

"There will be an increased presence of officers in the local area whilst the order is in place and officers are able to stop and search anybody within the defined area while it is activated, with or without reasonable grounds to do so.

"Please don't be worried if you are stopped by an officer, as this does not mean that you are in trouble.

"I would also ask anyone who may have information about the incident in Church Street to contact Thames Valley Police by calling 101 or making a report online, quoting reference 43210023526."
