Following a Thames Valley Police investigation, a man has been charged with burglary in High Wycombe.

Paul Chappell, aged 46, of Bridle Gate, High Wycombe, was arrested on Friday (5/2) and charged with the offence on Saturday (6/2).

This follows an incident that happened on Friday (5/2) in which a man attempted to gain entry to the dental clinic on Amersham Hill by smashing a window.

Chappell appeared at High Wycombe Magistrate's Court on Monday (8/2) and was remanded in custody until his next court appearance at a later date.
