A man has been charged with robbery, theft and possession of a bladed article in Bletchley.

Andrew O'Grady, aged 47, of Granby Court in Bletchley was arrested and charged with the offences on Thursday (31/12).

This is following an incident in which the previous day (30/12), a man entered the Tesco Express store on Melrose Avenue on multiple occasions and stole alcohol.

When challenged by security staff the man became aggressive and threatened staff with a large knife.

O'Grady appeared at High Wycombe Magistrates Court on Saturday (2/1) and was remanded in custody until the next court hearing on a date to be confirmed.
