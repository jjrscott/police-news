Thames Valley Police has issued a closure order on a pub in New Bradwell.

The partial closure order was granted by Milton Keynes Magistrates' Court today (16/12) and lasts for one month.

Officers applied for the order against The New Inn on Bradwell Road following a warrant that was carried out at the property on 11 December.

A quantity of drugs and a substantial amount of money was recovered from the address. Drugs swab testing showed high levels of drugs on a number of areas within the pub.

The partial closure order prohibits anyone other than individuals listed on the order from entering the pub. Anyone not named who enters the premises will commit a criminal offence.

Investigating officer PC Adrian Cafe, based at Milton Keynes police station, said: "It is rare for a closure order to be granted on a commercial premises but this order aims to prevent criminal behaviour at this address and to ensure public safety.

"Drugs are a blight on our community and whilst I understand that this closure order will have an impact on the local area, this kind of behaviour will not be tolerated.

"We will continue to work closely with the premises owners and our partner agencies to conduct a licensing review and ensure appropriate measures are taken to maintain public safety."
