Following a Thames Valley Police investigation, a man has been sentenced for abuse of position of trust in Reading.

Oliver Glass, aged 33, of Causeway Head Road, Sheffield was sentenced to one year and ten months' imprisonment in a hearing at Reading Crown Court yesterday (16/12).

He pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing on 7 October to three counts of adult abuse of position of trust by causing/inciting sexual activity with a child between 13 and 17-years-old.

Glass will serve 11 months in prison and the rest of the term on license.

The offences happened between June 2019 and August 2019.

Glass was charged on 21 August 2020.

Investigating officer, Detective Constable Helen Gasson, based at Reading police station, said: "Glass abused his position of trust and took advantage of a vulnerable child.

"He also abused the trust that was placed in him by her parents and the school she attended.

"I would like to thank the victim for her courage and bravery in coming forward to report this to us.

"Thames Valley Police takes reports of this nature very seriously and will investigate thoroughly."
