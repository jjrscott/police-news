Thames Valley Police's Major Crime Unit is continuing its murder investigation following an incident in the Watlington Hill area on Friday (23/10).

At around 5.53pm on Friday (23/10) the body of a woman in her sixties was located in woodland in the Watlington Hill National Trust park.

A post-mortem was conducted yesterday (26/10) but the cause of death has not yet been established. Further specialist forensic tests will be undertaken which will take some time.

Formal identification of the victim is still to be carried out and we will update in due course.

The woman's next of kin have been informed and they continue to be supported by specially trained officers.

A 23-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition.

Scene watches remain in place around the park area.

Detective Superintendent Kevin Brown, Head of the Major Crime Unit, said: "Our thoughts remain with the family at this very difficult time.

"Detectives are carrying out a thorough investigation and our enquiries are continuing.

"We would like to again thank the public for their co-operation, and I would continue to ask if anyone has information that they feel may be able to assist us in our investigation please call 101 quoting reference 1300 of 23/10/20.

"If anyone wishes to report anonymously they can do so by calling Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
