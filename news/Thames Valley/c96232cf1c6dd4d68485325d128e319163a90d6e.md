A man has been charged with a drugs supply offence following a stop and search in High Wycombe.

Bilal Ashraf, aged 22, of Adelaide Road, High Wycombe, was arrested on Tuesday (23/3) and was charged the following day with one count of being concerned in the supply of class A drugs (heroin).

The charge relates to an incident on Tuesday 23 March when officers from the Wycombe Stronghold team stopped a vehicle in Station Road car park in the town.

Following a search of three men who were in the vehicle, 30 wraps of heroin were located.

Ashraf was remanded in custody to appear at Aylesbury Crown Court on a date to be confirmed.
