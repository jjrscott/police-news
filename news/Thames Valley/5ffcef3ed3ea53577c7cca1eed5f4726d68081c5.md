Following a Thames Valley Police investigation, a man has been convicted of driving a vehicle while above the alcohol and drugs limit in Aylesbury.

Regan Purton, aged 23, of Nene Close in Aylesbury, was convicted of a count each of driving a vehicle whilst over the alcohol limit, and driving a vehicle with a proportion of a specified drug above the specified limit at High Wycombe Magistrates' Court on Friday (26/3).

He pleaded guilty to both counts.

The charges relate to an incident at 12.20am on 20 September 2020, when there was a road traffic collision in Lower Road, Stoke Mandeville between a Fiat Punto, driven by Purton, and a Fiat 500.

A woman in the Fiat 500, aged in her sixties, sustained life changing injuries as a result of the collision.

Purton, and another man aged in his twenties, who was in the car with him, both also sustained serious injuries.

All three people received hospital treatment but have since been discharged.

Purton's next court appearance will be on 10 May at High Wycombe Magistrates' Court.

Investigating officer, PC Sandra Terry, of the Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "Regan Purton has now been convicted of these driving offences after pleading guilty in High Wycombe Magistrates' Court.

"He will now return to court on May 10 for a sentencing hearing."
