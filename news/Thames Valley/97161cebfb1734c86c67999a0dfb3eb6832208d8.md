Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following a robbery in High Wycombe.

Between 2.30pm and 3.00pm on Thursday (10/12) a van was travelling along Lucas Road when he saw the rider of a black motorbike travelling towards him come off.

The van driver stopped and got out of the van to offer assistance to the rider on the floor.

The van driver then has no memory until waking up in an ambulance whilst receiving treatment.

He sustained a head injury and lost consciousness but has since been discharged from hospital.

He has since discovered that his mobile phone and a large amount of cash has been taken.

Investigating officer PC Paulina Wodzynska, based at High Wycombe police station, said: "I am keen to hear from anyone who has any information about this incident.

"We are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances of this case and are particularly keen to identify the rider of the motorbike. He is described as a slim Asian man in his early twenties who was wearing black clothing and a face mask.

"If you were travelling along Lucas Road between 2.30-3.00pm on Thursday and have a dash-cam then please check this to see whether you have captured anything that could assist with this investigation.

"You can contact us using our online form or by calling 101, quoting reference number 43200418291.

"Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously via their website or on 0800 555 111."
