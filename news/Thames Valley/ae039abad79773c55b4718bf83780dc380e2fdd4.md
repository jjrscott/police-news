Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following a serious injury road traffic collision on the M40 near Bicester.

It happened at 2.26pm yesterday (27/1) when a collision occurred between a white DAF HGV and a white Mercedes Sprinter flatbed van whilst travelling eastbound on the M40 just after junction 10.

The driver of the van, a man in his forties, and his passenger, a man in his fifties, both sustained injuries that requited treatment at the John Radcliffe hospital. They have since been discharged.

Investigating officer PC Daniel Watford of the roads policing unit based in Bicester said: "I am appealing for anyone who was driving in the area at the time and may have witnessed this incident or has dash-cam footage to please get in touch.

"You can get in touch by calling 101 or reporting online quoting reference 43210036458.

"You can also report 100% anonymously by calling Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
