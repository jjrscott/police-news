Thames Valley Police is appealing for information following a fatal road traffic collision in Taplow, Maidenhead.

At around 3.05pm yesterday (15/2), a grey Ford B-Max was involved in a collision with a garden fence on Institute Road, Taplow.

The driver, a man aged 78, was taken to hospital but sadly died later the same day.

No other vehicle was involved.

The victim's next of kin have been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers.

Senior investigating officer Sergeant Matt Cadmore, of the Joint Operations Roads Policing Unit, said: "Our thoughts remain first and foremost with the family of the victim at this very sad time.

"This happened in broad daylight and we believe there must have been people who witnessed it or saw the car in the moments leading up to the incident.

"We would ask any drivers who were in the area at the time to think about whether they remember seeing anything before the collision.

"We would ask drivers to check their dashcam footage in case it inadvertently captured anything that could help our investigation."

Anyone with information should call 101 with reference 43210064291.
