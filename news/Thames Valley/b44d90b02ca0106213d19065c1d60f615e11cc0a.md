A man has had six months added to his prison sentence after being found in possession of a mobile phone while in jail.

Aqib Jawaid, aged 23, pleaded guilty to the offence at a hearing at Oxford Crown Court yesterday (2/3).

The phone was found under a pillow during a search of his cell in June last year.

He was sentenced to six months' imprisonment to be served consecutively to his existing sentence for drugs offences.

PC Andrew Gold, from the Prison Crime Team, said: "The use of mobiles in prison has a significant impact on the safe day to day running of prisons and will not be tolerated.

"We will find those who have them in their possession and make sure they are brought before the courts to face justice."
