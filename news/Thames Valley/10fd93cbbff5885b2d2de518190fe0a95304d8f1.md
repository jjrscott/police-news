**The family of Jay Fathers, who died following an incident in Walshs Manor, Stantonbury, Milton Keynes, on New Years ' Day (1/1) have released the following tribute.**

"Our handsome, cheeky little boy Jay.

"Life has stopped for us all. Never did we have to expect to feel heartache and pain like this.

"A piece of our hearts was tragically ripped away in such a cruel and sickening way.

"Jay was an 18-year-old boy, our boy, just starting his life as a young man and ready to show us all what a great man he planned to be.

"Those dreams, those hopes, those wishes, have all been taken away.

"Jay, you would light up any room you walked in with that cheeky smile of yours.

"You loved your football, your music, festivals, and so much more.

"You are our only son, our only brother, our only uncle.

"How can we be complete now that a piece of our puzzle is missing forever?

"You loved going on your little adventures, but this is one we wish you didn't have to take alone.

"Until we see you again, our beautiful boy, we love you to the moon and back and so much more.

"Another senseless stabbing, when will they stop?"
