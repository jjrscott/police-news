Two teenagers have been charged following a robbery in Milton Keynes.

Mohamad Hasan, aged 19, of Cornwall Grove, Bletchley and Tinashe Motsi, aged 18, of Aldergill, Heelands, were arrested on Sunday (21/2) and later charged with one count of robbery.

Both appeared at Milton Keynes' Magistrates Court on Tuesday (23/2) where they were bailed to appear at Aylesbury Crown Court on Monday 29 March.

The charges relate to an incident earlier on Sunday in which a boy aged 16 was threatened and had his coat, phone and wallet stolen as he rode his bike on Dansteed Way near Saxon Street, Heelands.
