Officers from Thames Valley Police's Major Crime Unit investigating a murder in Stantonbury, Milton Keynes, have this evening (2/1) obtained a warrant of further detention from Magistrates, granting a further 36 hours to question a 21-year-old man in custody.

Officers were called to reports of an altercation in Walshs Manor just before 3am on New Years' Day (1/1) and found two men with serious injuries.

Sadly, an 18-year-old victim died in hospital, despite the best efforts of medical professionals.

A 49-year-old man suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospital, where he remains in a stable condition.

Senior Investigating Officer Detective Chief Inspector Andy Howard of Thames Valley Police's Major Crime Unit, said: "We are continuing to investigate this tragic incident and would re-assure the community that we are exploring all avenues to ascertain the full circumstances.

"I would ask people not to speculate as to the incident, but would urge anybody with any information to please call 101 or make a report online quoting reference number 43210000167.

"Alternatively, you can also call the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
