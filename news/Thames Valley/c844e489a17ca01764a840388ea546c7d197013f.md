A Section 60 order that was enacted in Reading on Saturday (6/2) has been extended for a further 24 hours.

The order was put in place following the death of 26-year-old Raheem Hanif in Dulnan Close, Tilehurst and has been in place ever since.

Following the latest extension, this order is now in place until 9pm tomorrow evening (12/2), upon which it will be reviewed again and extended if deemed necessary.

The whole Local Policing Area of Reading is covered by this Section 60 order which temporarily allows police officers greater powers to stop and search in a defined location when it is believed there is a likelihood that serious violence will take place.

Superintendent Nick John, Reading Local Policing Area Commander, said: "We do not take the decision lightly to enact these orders and the decision has been taken to once again extend the current order for another 24 hours.

"There continues to be a large number of officers and staff deployed to the investigation and a number of high visibility patrols in Reading.

"Then purpose of these Section 60 orders is to prevent serious violence and it gives officers extra powers in order to do this.

"We have now stopped and searched 165 individuals since the order was put in place, and as a result of these searches, weapons, including sharply-bladed articles, knuckledusters and a ball bearing gun have been seized.

"We have also located and seized class A and B drugs as a result of these searches and a number of arrests have been made and offenders are being dealt with accordingly.

"Our finds have clearly justified the use of our Section 60 powers, and the order will remain in place until a time we feel it is proportionate to lift this.

"If you are approached by an officer, please do not be worried, you are not in trouble.

"If you have any concerns, please do not hesitate to speak to one of our officers who will be able to offer advice and reassurance."
