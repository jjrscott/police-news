Thames Valley Police's Major Crime Unit has launched a murder investigation in Milton Keynes.

At around 10.10am this morning officers were called to a house in Beresford Close, Emerson Valley, Milton Keynes.

On attendance, officers found a deceased woman in her forties with significant injuries.

Her next of kin have been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers.

A scene watch is in place while enquiries are ongoing.

Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Superintendent Justin Fletcher of Thames Valley Police's Major Crime Unit, said: "We have launched a murder investigation following the death of a woman.

"Our thoughts remain with her family at this difficult time.

"We are in the very early stages of our investigation; however at this time we believe this to be an isolated incident and a man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.

"We are carrying out house to house enquiries, but would appeal to anyone who may have information that could assist us in our investigation to please call 101 quoting reference 43210042051, or alternatively you can report 100% anonymously to the independent Charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

"Members of the public are likely to see an increased police presence whilst enquires are ongoing.

"We would advise anyone with any information or concerns to please speak to one of our officers."
