Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following a road traffic collision in Holmer Green in which a man aged in his fifties tragically died.

At approximately 12.15pm yesterday (17/2), a blue Skoda Octavia travelling towards Holmer Green was involved in a collision with a grey Jeep Wrangler, which was travelling towards Amersham.

The collision occurred on the A404 between the turning for Mop End and the road into Holmer Green.

Sadly, the driver of the Skoda, a 57-year-old man from Widmer End, died at the scene of his injuries.

The man's family have been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers.

The two occupants of the Jeep, a couple from Hazlemere, were taken to the Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury where they both remain in a stable condition.

Investigating officer PC Darren Baker of the Serious Collision Investigation Unit, based at Bicester, said: "A man sadly died in this collision, and I am urging anybody who was travelling along the A404 near to Holmer Green at around the time of the collision to please contact us if they saw either of the cars involved.

"I would also been keen to hear from anybody who has dash-cam in their vehicles. Please check this, and contact the police on 101 or online, quoting reference number 43210067209.

"The thoughts of all of us at Thames Valley Police remain with the family of the man who has passed away."
