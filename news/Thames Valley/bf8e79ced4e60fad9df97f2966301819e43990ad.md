Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following a road traffic collision in Banbury which left a motorcyclist with serious injuries.

At approximately 4.20pm on Sunday 13 December, a white 125cc motorcycle was riding on Lower Cherwell Street towards Upper Cherwell Street when it was in collision with a grey BMW 3 Series that was pulling out of the junction of Canal Street onto Lower Cherwell Street.

The motorcyclist, a 23-year-old man, was taken to hospital with serious injuries, including a fractured knee and fractured wrist, but he has since been discharged.

The driver of the grey BMW 3 Series stopped at the scene of the collision.

Investigating officer PC Liam Calvert of the Joint Operations Roads Policing Unit, based at Bicester, said: "This collision occurred on a stretch of road which is usually busy at that time of day, and I believe there would have been lots of vehicles on the road.

"I am appealing to anybody who was in the area and witnessed the collision, or who may have dash-cam footage, to please check this and contact police if it has captured anything that can help this investigation.

"You can make a report online or call 101, quoting reference number 43200422321."
