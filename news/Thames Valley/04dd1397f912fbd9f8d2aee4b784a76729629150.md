It is with deep sadness that Thames Valley Police is today mourning the death of a serving police officer, Sergeant James Urwin.

James had served for 16 years and worked in the Milton Keynes local policing area.

He passed away suddenly on Friday (12/6) at the age of 44.

James's death is being treated as unexplained, but not suspicious, and a file is being prepared for the coroner.

Our thoughts and prayers are with James's family, friends and colleagues.

James's family are being supported by specially trained colleagues from Thames Valley Police and we would ask that their privacy is respected at this extremely difficult time.

**Superintendent Marc Tarbit, Local Policing Area Commander, Milton Keynes**

**Note to editors: **James was 44-years-old and worked out of Milton Keynes police station.
