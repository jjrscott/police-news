Thames Valley Police has arrested a man in connection with incidents of burglary which occurred in Tylers Green, near High Wycombe.

The 43-year-old man from Holmer Green in Buckinghamshire was arrested on Monday (22/2) on suspicion of two counts of burglary and one count of possession of a Class A drug.
