The family of Collette Mead, aged 59 from Watford, have paid tribute to her after she tragically died following a road accident on Friday 3rd July on the M25 / M40 Slip-Road.

"Collette was a colourful and vibrant soul with so much to offer. She worked so hard and became friends with all of her clients. She loved giving everything she could to anybody she could and, as cliche as it sounds, really did put everybody else before herself.

"Collette's infectious laugh and loving heart were a true testament to her joyous personality. She was and still is incredibly loved and cherished by her whole family and will leave a gaping hole behind. We will always remember with special fondness, for her love of dancing, the Pink Panther, swimming and the great outdoors.

"We are devastated by our loss and incredibly overwhelmed by the love, support and kindness we have received over the past week; she clearly made a huge impact on everybody from her Husband to the local checkout cashier.

"Whilst we are deeply saddened and grieving; we will continue to honour her wishes and live our lives each day to the fullest. She really was the sunshine of our lives, and we hope one day that the Sun may rise again.

"We request that our privacy is respected during this difficult time."

Collette Mead
