Thames Valley Police officers in West Berkshire carried out an operation which lasted four days and concluded on Sunday 8 November which saw 17 people arrested including 10 for drug supply, five for drug driving, and four people were given penalty notices and referred to the drugs diversion scheme for drugs possession.

Across the four days, £4,500 in cash was recovered and over £5,000 worth of Class A drugs and cannabis were seized.

The activity saw three warrants executed, 21 stop checks and 65 vehicle checks were undertaken.

 Detective Inspector Alice Broad from West Berkshire CID, said: "This operation was very successful with four days of activity leading to a number of arrests and also seizure of drugs and cash.

"Here in West Berkshire we are committed to tackling criminal activity related to drugs, organised crime and the associated harm it causes. It simply will not be tolerated in Thames Valley.

"We will continue to target those who see fit to make a living out of selling harmful drugs, whilst also supporting vulnerable people through diversion schemes.

"Additionally we will continue to work with the public and partners in order to protect our communities and make them safer."
