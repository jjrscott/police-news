Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following a road traffic collision in Slough in which a pedestrian has suffered serious injuries.

At approximately 5.25pm yesterday (10/12) a grey Audi was in collision with the pedestrian, a 35-year-old man, on the A4 Bath Road at the junction with Windmill Road.

The man suffered a serious head injury as a result of the collision and was taken to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, where he remains at this time in a serious, but stable condition.

No arrests have been made.

Investigating officer PC Richard Goreham of the Joint Operations Unit for Roads Policing based at Taplow, said: "I am appealing to anybody who was in the area of Bath Road yesterday and witnessed this collision to please get in touch with the police.

"The collision occurred on the eastbound side of the A4 and this would have been a fairly busy time of the day.

"I would particularly appeal to anybody who has dash-cam in their vehicles to please check this and contact police if it has captured anything that can assist this investigation.

"You can call us on 101 or make a report online, quoting reference number 43200418441."
