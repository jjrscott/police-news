Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following a serious injury road traffic collision in Reading.

A grey hatchback car and a motorcycle were involved in a collision today (18/12) at around 8.15pm in Rose Kiln Lane at the junction with the Skoda dealership and the Casino.

The motorcycle rider, a man in his forties, sustained serious injuries and has been taken to hospital in a life-threatening condition.

His next of kin has been informed and are receiving help from specialist officers.

The driver of the car, a man in his thirties, was uninjured.

Senior Investigating Officer, Sergeant Gary Doughty of the Joint Operations Road Policing Unit, based at Three Mile Cross, said: "I am appealing for anyone who witnessed this incident, or who has any information, to please come forward.

"In particular, I would ask any motorists in the area at the time of the collision, who have dash-cams, to please check any footage in case it may have captured something that could assist with this investigation.

"I would also ask anyone who saw this happen to come forward and speak to us, if you haven't done so already.

 "Anyone with information can contact Thames Valley Police by calling 101 or making a report online. Please quote reference 43200430959.

"The road has been closed but a diversion route is in place."
