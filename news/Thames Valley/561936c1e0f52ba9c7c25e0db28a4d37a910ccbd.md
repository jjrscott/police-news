The victim in a murder investigation in Oxford has now been formally identified.

Thames Valley Police was called to Foresters Tower in Wood Farm Road, Oxford, last Tuesday (24/9) to reports that a man had fallen from the upper floors of the block of flats.

Following a search of flats, a 42-year-old woman was located in a flat on the fourth floor.

The victim has now been formally identified as Emily Rebekah Goodman.

A post-mortem conducted on Friday (27/9) concluded that the cause of death was incised wounds to the neck and applied neck pressure.

A 37-year-old man who died after falling from the upper floors of Foresters Tower has not yet been formally identified and work is continuing to identify and inform his next of kin.

Deputy senior investigating officer Detective Inspector Sally Spencer of Thames Valley Police's Major Crime Unit, said: "The family of Emily Goodman are being supported by specially trained officers as our investigation continues.

"I would re-iterate that we are not looking for anybody else in connection with the murder of Emily or the death of the 37-year-old man.

"However, if anybody has any information that can assist our investigation, please call 101, quoting URN 1469 (24/9)."
