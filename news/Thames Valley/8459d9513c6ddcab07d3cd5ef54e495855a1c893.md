Officers investigating the robbery of a teenager in Milton Keynes have made an arrest.

At around 4.10pm on Thursday 18 February, a 13-year-old boy was on Shenley Road at the junction with Burchard Crescent in Shenley Church End when he was approached by an older teenager on a bike.

The offender verbally abused the victim and pushed him before cycling away. Two minutes later he returned, demanded the victim's hat and trainers before punching and pushing him and taking his property.

He then cycled away from the scene.

A 17-year-old boy from Milton Keynes was arrested on suspicion of robbery earlier today (3/3) and remains in custody.
