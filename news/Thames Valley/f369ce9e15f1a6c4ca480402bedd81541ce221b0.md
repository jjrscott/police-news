Thames Valley Police is renewing its appeal for witnesses following a road traffic collision in Ascot, in which a man has sadly since died.

At approximately 5.50pm on Monday 2 November, a Silver Toyota Auris was travelling along the A329 London Road when it was involved in a collision with a cyclist just prior to the Heatherwood roundabout.

The cyclist, a 52-year-old man was taken to hospital, however he has since sadly died.

His next of kin are being supported by specially trained officers.

Senior Investigating Officer, Sergeant Mark Gawthrop of the Joint Operations Roads Policing Unit, said, "Our thoughts are with the cyclist's family at this time.

"We are still appealing for witnesses to this collision and we would also like speak to anyone who was in the area at around the time it happened.

"We would also ask any motorists who were in the area at around the time of the collision to check any dash-cam footage in case it may have captured anything that could assist the investigation.

"Anyone with information can contact Thames Valley Police by calling 101 or making a report online, quoting reference 43200356242.

"Alternatively, if you wish to remain anonymous, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
