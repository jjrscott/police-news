**Following a road traffic collision in Chalfont St Peter on Saturday 10 October, which resulted in the death of Simran Johal, known to friends as Simi, her mother, Anita, has released the following tribute.**

**Tribute to my beautiful daughter Simran**

"Simi was my whole world and my everything. Even though you have been taken away from me too early, you will always be my Baby Gal. I am honoured and privileged to have had 23 years being your mother.

"My Simi had a heart of gold and was always happy to help anyone. She was so caring and funny and enriched the lives of her family and friends. The world will be a much sadder place without her unique wit and charm.

"Simi had started to pursue her dreams whilst still making time for her friends who she had great banter with. Simi worshipped her grandparents and would often help her grandad on many occasions. She was never scared of hard graft.

"My Simi was well known and will be greatly missed by the many people whose lives she touched.

"I would like to thank my friends, family and neighbours who have offered their kindness and support at this very difficult time.

"Simi, I will always love you until my last breath. Until we meet again. Mum. X"
