Following an investigation by Thames Valley Police's Major Crime Unit, a teenage boy has been sentenced to four years and four months' imprisonment.

The 17-year-old from Milton Keynes, who cannot be named for legal reasons due to his age, was today (1/3) sentenced at Oxford Crown Court.

It follows his conviction on one count of manslaughter, after he pleaded guilty at a hearing at Oxford Crown Court on 4 February 2021.

His conviction relates to the death of 43-year-old Robin Williamson, of Awgar Stone Road, Oxford.

Mr Williamson was assaulted and stabbed with a screwdriver in an incident on 27 October 2019 in Wood Farm, Oxford. He sadly died on 12 November 2019, with a post-mortem later revealing his death was as a result of the assault.

A 16-year-old boy from Banbury was acquitted of all charges against him.

Senior investigating officer, Detective Chief Inspector Stuart Bosley, said: "I am satisfied that the teenager in this case has admitted his involvement and has now been sentenced.

 "This case shows once again the consequences that assaulting someone with a weapon can have and the subsequent impact on family, friends and our communities.

"Our thoughts remain with Mr Williamson's friends and family and I hope that the sentencing will bring some closure to them.

"I would like to thank Mr Williamson's family for their support throughout the investigation."
