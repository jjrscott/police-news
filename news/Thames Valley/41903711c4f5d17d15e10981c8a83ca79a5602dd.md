A man has been sentenced to jail after pleading guilty to burglaries in Berkshire and London.

Jamie Matthews, aged 29, of Midsummer Avenue, Hounslow, appeared at Isleworth Crown Court on 12 March where he pleaded guilty to two counts of burglary (dwelling) and one count of burglary (non-dwelling).

He was sentenced to 29 months' imprisonment for a burglary in Isleworth, London and an additional 16 months for the burglary of a car sales showroom in Datchet, to be served concurrently. He was also sentenced to 876 days following a burglary at the home of his former partner in Slough, to be served consecutively to the above.

On 9 December 2019, Matthews entered the property of his ex-girlfriend in Slough and stole electronic items and jewellery to the value of Â£1250.

He also took keys to her vehicle which he then used during the burglary of a car sales showroom in Datchet two weeks later on 24 December.

In January 2020, he was arrested by the Metropolitan Police in relation to a separate burglary in Isleworth and was later charged with all three offences.

Investigator Lynn Brandon, based at Slough police station, said: "Matthews targeted a property he knew well and callously stole from someone he had previously been in a relationship with.

"He thought he could get away with his offending but we were determined to bring him before the courts and face up to his actions.

"We know the impact burglaries have on victims and the wider community and we will continue to do all we can to prosecute those who cause this kind of harm."
