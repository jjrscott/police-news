Following a Thames Valley Police investigation, a man from Slough has been charged with two counts of GBH with intent.

Piotr Malinowski, aged 34, of Adelphi Gardens, Slough, was charged today (30/12) with two counts of grievous bodily harm with intent and possession of a bladed article.

It follows an incident in Adelphi Gardens on Monday (28/12) during which two women, both aged in their fifties, sustained stab wounds.

Both victims received hospital treatment but were discharged the next day.

Malinowski appeared at Reading Magistrates' Court today (30/12) but no pleas were entered. He was remanded into custody until his next court appearance which is yet to be confirmed.
