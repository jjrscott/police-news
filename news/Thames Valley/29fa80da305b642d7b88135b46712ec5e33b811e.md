Thames Valley Police is releasing a CCTV image of a man officers would like to speak to in connection with an incident of criminal damage in Windsor.

At around 11.20pm on 13 October, three men entered the Broadleys building in Sawyers Close where they damaged a door of a flat on the ground floor by kicking it.

Investigating officer PC James Wallis, based at Maidenhead police station, said: "This was a distressing incident as the property which had its door damaged was housing a family at the time.

"We are investigating the incident and would like to speak to the man shown in the CCTV image, or anyone who recognises him, as he may have important information about what happened."

Anyone with any information which could assist officers should contact the 24-hour non-emergency number 101 quoting the reference 43200323356.

If you do not wish to speak to police, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111.
