Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Slough.

At around 6.45pm on Wednesday (13/1), the victims, two teenage girls, were walking along Hillary Road past Springate Field when they were approached by a teenage boy who asked them if they wanted to buy drugs.

The victims ignored the boy and continued walking. Around thirty minutes later at 7.15pm, the victims were walking past Springate Field again when the boy approached them for a second time.

He threatened them with a knife and demanded that one of the victims hand over her scooter.

The other victim ran to a nearby house to ask for help whilst the other had an altercation with the offender after refusing to hand over her scooter. The offender then ran from the scene on foot.

Nothing was stolen, and one of the victims sustained minor cuts and bruises but did not require any medical treatment.

The offender is described as a light-skinned Asian or mixed race teenage boy with a chubby build. He was wearing a dark puffy jacket and a black balaclava.

Investigating officer Detective Constable Conor Campbell, based at Slough police station said: "I am appealing for any witnesses of this incident, or anyone who saw a boy matching the description in the area at the time to please get in touch.

"You can make a report online or by calling 101 and quoting reference 43210015162.

"Alternatively, if you wish to remain 100% anonymous you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
