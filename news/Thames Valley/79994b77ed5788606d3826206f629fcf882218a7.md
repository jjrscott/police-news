Thames Valley Police's Chief Constable John Campbell has released a video message updating on the Force's response to the current coronavirus pandemic.

Chief Constable John Campbell talks about the measures we have in place to make sure we can continue to protect the public.

He discusses Thames Valley Police's approach to policing the new legislation, which will be one of engagement, explaining and encouragement to comply, with enforcement used as a last resort.

Additionally the Chief Constable talks about the changes in demand that we are seeing and the increase in online fraud being experienced nationally and how we are closely monitoring domestic abuse which may increase due to people being confined in their homes.

Anyone who is a victim of domestic abuse can report it to Thames Valley Police through 999 if they are in immediate danger. If you cannot talk press 55 and we will respond.

Anyone who has been a victim of fraud should contact Action Fraud who have advice on avoiding Fraud.
