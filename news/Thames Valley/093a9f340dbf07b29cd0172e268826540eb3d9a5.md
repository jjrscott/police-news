Thames Valley Police is releasing CCTV images following a robbery in Aylesbury.

At around 12.10am on Sunday 20 September two men and a woman were sat on a bench between the Horse and Jockey public house and Prince Rupert Drive when they were approached by three men.

They asked if the victims had anything on them and chased one of the men on to Prince Rupert Drive while shooting BB pellets at him. He sustained minor injuries.

The woman was also shot with the BB gun causing facial injuries which required hospital treatment. She has since been discharged.

The man who assaulted the woman then punched and kicked the other man who had remained on the bench.

All the offenders made off towards Prince Rupert Drive and took a handbag containing phones and bank cards.

One of the stolen bank cards was used later that day in stores in Cambridge.

Investigating officer PC Lauren Suffling, based at Aylesbury police station, said: "I am releasing these images as I believe that these men have information that would assist with this investigation.

"If you recognise either of them then please get in touch with us or contact Crimestoppers for 100% anonymity.

"You can contact us using our online form or by calling 101, quoting reference number 43200295103, or you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers via their website or on 0800 555 111."
