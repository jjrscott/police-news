Thames Valley Police is releasing an image of two men officers would like to speak to after anti-Semitic graffiti was painted on a door in Oxford.

At 10.07pm on 31 January, the offenders approached a residential property on Stubbs Avenue, Oxford and sprayed a swastika on the front door.

They later returned at 10.23pm and used a pole to break a CCTV camera installed on the property.

Investigating officer PC Stephanie Greenfield, based at Cowley police station, said: "Criminal damage of this kind will never be tolerated and we are asking anyone who recognises these men to come forward and speak to us."

Anyone with information should call 101 with reference 43210042799.
