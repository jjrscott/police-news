Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses after a motorcyclist suffered serious injuries in a road traffic collision in Aylesbury.

At 4pm on Tuesday (30/3), the rider of the motorcycle, a 33-year-old man, was involved in a single-vehicle collision and suffered serious head injuries and fractures to his right arm.

The collision occurred on the A41 northbound towards Aylesbury just after the on-slip from Lower Icknield Way, Buckland when the motorcycle, a blue Yahama YZF 1000R left the carriageway and collided with a central barrier.

The man was taken to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, where he remains at this time.

Investigating officer PC Christopher Miller of the Roads Policing Unit, based at Amersham, said: "This was a single vehicle collision and I am appealing to anybody who witnessed the incident or who has any information to please contact Thames Valley Police.

"I'm particularly keen to hear from anyone who may have dash-cam footage from the area at around 4pm yesterday to please check this and contact us if it's captured something that could assist the investigation.

"You can call 101, quoting reference 43210133897, or make a report online."
