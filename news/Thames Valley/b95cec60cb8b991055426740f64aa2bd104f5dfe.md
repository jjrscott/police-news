A tribute has been released following the death of 29-year-old Ewen Lever from Swindon.

Ewen sadly died following a road traffic collision on the A361 near Burford on Wednesday (9/12).

Ewen's wife, Abbey Lever, said: "Our Ewen, he was my everything and he was our world, the most amazing Husband, Daddy, Son, Brother and Friend. He loved life and was the largest character and voice of any room. He truly is one in a million and loved by so many. He will be sorely missed by his wife, babies, family and friends.
