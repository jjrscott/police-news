The family of Darren MacCormick have issued the following tribute to him, after the sentencing of Brookton Lagan and Taison Cyrille at Oxford Crown Court today (21/12).

"Our family is heartbroken. There is a piece of us missing forever. None of the family can come to terms with the violent death of their son, brother, uncle. His three children are now without a Dad.

"It is a massive loss to all his family and friends that will miss him dearly.

"It has been the hardest, saddest year ever for us all mentally and physically. Our lives have changed forever.

"The grief is overwhelming and anyone who has lost a child will know the pain and heartache this leaves.

"Darren is in our thoughts and memories every day, and will be always. It is impossible to put into words how much Darren meant, and still means.

"Darren had an amazing, happy go lucky character, and always bought joy to us all. He was full of laughter and full of love. This will all be sadly missed.

"We are facing our first Christmas without him, with an empty chair in place, along with his mum who spent her last 10 months praying for justice for her son. Unfortunately she didn't even get to grieve the tragic loss of her son as she lost her battle to cancer during the trial, on 13th November 2020.

"We would like to thank our FLO's, Katie and Christine, and the whole of the investigation team at TVP."
