Following an investigation by Thames Valley Police, a man has been convicted of burglary with intent to steal.

Anthony Binfield, aged 47 of Elderfield Road, Stoke Poges, was found guilty at Aylesbury Crown Court on Thursday (4/2) by a unanimous jury verdict.

It follows a burglary on 23 June 2019 at around 2.15am in Colne Orchard, Iver.

The victim, a 60-year-old woman, was woken up on hearing a loud bang on the front door which continued until the centre of the door collapsed.

A man went into the kitchen and went through the cupboards, taking food, then made his way to the bedroom and showed the victim what he was taking. He then left the property as she was calling the police.

Investigating officer, Detective Constable Kerry Hall based at Amersham police station, said: "This was a traumatic incident for the victim and her vulnerabilities were taken advantage of by Binfield.

"I hope the guilty verdict begins to give her some closure.

"Burglaries of this nature can be very distressing and I'd like to thank the victim for her support throughout the case."

Binfield will be sentenced at Aylesbury Crown Court on 18 March.
