Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following an aggravated burglary in Colnbrook, Slough.

At around 5.20pm on Friday (8/1) three men forced entry to a property in Kings Park, carrying weapons. They threatened the victim, a man in his thirties, and demanded money.

The victim managed to run out of the property and into Budgens store nearby.

The offenders then made off.

The victim sustained small cuts and bruises but did not require hospital treatment.

The offenders are described as three men wearing 'Joker' masks.

Investigating officer, Detective Sergeant Katy Lewis, based at Slough police station, said: "I am appealing for anyone who may have witnessed this incident or has information to please come forward.

"We believe that the offenders may have used Tan House Way as a route to access and leave the property.

"Anyone who has information can contact police by calling 101 or making a report online, quoting reference 43210009659.

"Alternatively, if you wish to remain anonymous, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
