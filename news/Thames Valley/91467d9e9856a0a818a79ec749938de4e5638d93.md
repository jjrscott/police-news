A Section 60 order in Reading has been extended for a further 24 hours.

It will remain in place until 9pm tomorrow (16/2).

The order follows the recent death of Raheem Hanif in Dulnan Close, Tilehurst as well as the launch of a murder investigation in Caversham yesterday (14/2) in connection with the death of a 24-year-old.

The two incidents are not currently being linked, however the decision has been taken to extend the order again to ensure the safety of the public.

The order applies to the whole of the Reading local policing area, and allows officers more powers to stop and search in a defined location when it is believed there is a likelihood that serious violence could take place.

Superintendent Nick John, LPA commander for Reading, said: "This order is being extended again following recent incidents which have occurred in the area.

"I would like to reassure people that none of these incidents are thought to be linked, however, extending the order is absolutely necessary while our investigations continue.

"The use of a Section 60 gives officers greater powers to stop and search and is designed to combat serious violence.

"As a result of the work we have done in recent days, an amount of weapons and drugs have already been seized.

"Members of the public will see more police in the area as we have extra patrols underway. This is for your safety.

"Please feel free to talk to our officers, they can help to answer any questions and will be able to provide some reassurance.

"I know this is a difficult and concerning time for many people, but I would like to thank everyone their patience and understanding."
