Thames Valley Police is releasing CCTV images following a racially-aggravated public order offence in Farnham Common.

At around 2.20pm on Monday 22 February, the victim was working in a shop on Beaconsfield Road when he noticed a woman enter the store.

Knowing her to be banned, the victim asked her to leave. She then made racist comments towards the victim.

Investigating officer PC Ben Flaherty, based at Amersham police station, said: "I am releasing these images as I believe the woman shown may have vital information about this incident.

"As the incident occurred in a shop, I believe that someone will have witnessed this and be able to help with this investigation.

"If you have any information, you can contact us using our online form or by calling 101 with reference number 43210075283. Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously via their website or on 0800 555 111."
