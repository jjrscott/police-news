Following a Thames Valley Police investigation, a man has been sentenced to four years' imprisonment after he was convicted of a robbery in Winnersh.

Gary Smith, aged 37, of no fixed abode, was found guilty on Friday (18/12) by unanimous jury verdict of one count of robbery in a trial lasting four days at Reading Crown Court.

At approximately 4.45am on 28 June this year, Smith went to the BP Triangle petrol station in Winnersh.

He knocked on the night pay window as the petrol station doors were locked, and he was let into the premises.

He went to the counter, producing a claw hammer from his pocket and demanded money from the tills.

The female cashier, aged 24, handed over the contents of two tills and Smith left with Â£265 in cash.

Smith was arrested on the same day and charged on 29 June.

Investigating officer Detective Constable Dennis Hicks, of the Priority Crime Team, said: "Smith was allowed inside by a staff member at the BP petrol station and threatened the cashier with a hammer, demanding money.

"The victim was naturally traumatised by this experience and I am pleased that Smith has been brought to justice.

"I know that the victim in this case will have to deal with the impact this incident has had on her for some time to come, but I do hope that the verdict and prison sentence will help her to move on from this."
