Officers investigating the murder of 22-year-old Amir Shafique in Aylesbury on 28 October have made two further arrests today.

Two 21-year-old men, both from Aylesbury, have been arrested on suspicion of murder and remain in police custody.

The arrests relate to an incident in Lembrook Walk, Aylesbury, on Wednesday 28 October, when officers were called to reports of a large fight taking place.

Two men were taken to hospital, where sadly, Mr Shafique died of his injuries.

Senior Investigating Officer Detective Chief Inspector Andy Shearwood of Thames Valley Police's Major Crime Unit, said: "We are continuing to thoroughly investigate the circumstances surrounding Amir's death, and have made two further arrests today.

"This continues to be a complex investigation and I would like to re-assure the local community that we are leaving no stone unturned to ascertain what happened.

"We would re-iterate the wishes of Amir's family to please respect their privacy while they grieve and come to terms with their loss, and our thoughts remain with them all."
