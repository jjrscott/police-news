Thames Valley Police has released an image of a man officers believe may have important information in connection with a theft in Banbury.

At around 12pm on Tuesday 10 November the victims, an elderly couple, were parking in the Morrison's car park in Swan Close, Banbury when they were approached by a man claiming to be helping them to register their car in the car parking machine.

During this time the man managed to get hold of their bank card and use it to withdraw an amount of cash on the neighbouring ATM machine.

Investigating officer PC Craig Naylor, based at Banbury police station, said: "If you recognise this man, or if you think it could be you, please get in touch.

"Likewise, if you witnessed this incident or have any information, we would like to hear from you.

"You can make a report online or by calling 101 and quoting reference 43200368997.

"Alternatively, if you wish to remain 100% anonymous you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
