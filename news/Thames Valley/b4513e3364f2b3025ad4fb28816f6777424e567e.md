Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Monkston.

At around 11.15pm on Sunday (27/12), a 19-year-old woman was walking along the underpass from Monkston Park to Monkston when two men walking towards her suddenly started running and shouting at her.

They shouted at her to hand over her bag and grabbed it. She kept hold of her bag and the men walked off laughing.

The woman was not injured and nothing was stolen.

The first offender is described as a black man, aged approximately 20-years-old and between 5ft 8ins and 5ft 10ins tall. He was wearing a black puffer jacket with the hood up, black joggers and black shoes.

The second offender is also described as a black man of a similar age and height to the first offender. He was wearing a thin black windbreaker jacket with the hood up with a reflective bit, black joggers and black shoes.

Investigating officer Detective Constable Matthew Acland, based at Milton Keynes, said: "I am appealing to anyone who may have information about this incident to come forward.

"You can contact us using our online form or by calling 101, quoting reference number 43200441665. Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously via their website or on 0800 555 111."
