Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following a rape which occurred in Oxford.

Shortly after 3am on Wednesday 17 February, the victim, a woman in her early 20s, got into a car and was driven to an address in the Crescent Road area where she was raped.

She then left the address and travelled home on foot and via bus.

She is being supported by specially trained officers.

Officers are asking anyone who was in the Crescent Road and Marsh Road area to get in touch if they believe they saw the victim or any activity that seemed out of the ordinary between 3am and 5.30am that morning.

Investigator Beth Stevens, from Oxford CID, said: "We are working hard to establish the circumstances of this incident and want to encourage anyone who believes they may have information to come forward.

"I would ask anyone in the area who may have dash cam or doorbell footage to please check it and see if you captured anything which could help our investigation."

Anyone with information should call 101 quoting reference number 43210070062 or make a report online. Alternatively, call independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
