Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following an exposure in Tattenhoe Park.

At around 9.50am on Wednesday 25 November, a woman was walking through Tattenhoe Park on the footpath between Hayton Way and the V1 when she was approached by a man wearing a long grey hoodie on a red and black bicycle.

He shouted at her and then exposed his genitals.

She screamed and he tried to grab her hand and she ran off in the direction of Hayton Way.

The man cycled off in the opposite direction.

Investigating officer PC Joseph Swan, based at Bletchley police station, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the Tattenhoe Park area last Wednesday morning and recognises the description of this man to get in touch.

"This was an upsetting incident for the victim and I am keen to hear from you if you have any information that could help with this investigation.

"You can contact us using our online form or by calling 101, quoting reference number 43200393550. Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously via their website or on 0800 555 111."
