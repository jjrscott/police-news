A man has been convicted of attempted murder after stabbing a woman in Reading last August.

David Rackett, aged 57, of Scours Lane, Reading, was found guilty by unanimous jury at Reading Crown Court following a six day trial which concluded on Monday (1/2).

He will be sentenced at the same court on Wednesday 17 March.

At around 9.45pm on Sunday 16 August last year, Rackett met a woman in her 40s on Oxford Road and they walked together to a boat in which he was living on Scours Lane.

Ten minutes after arriving at the address, Rackett attacked the victim by throwing her to the floor and strangling her.

She managed to free herself from his grip before he stabbed her in the throat, saying her life wasn't worth living.

He then thrust the knife towards her stomach but the victim was able to grab the weapon and run away to safety.

He was arrested the same day and taken into custody.

Investigating officers Sergeant Andy Philpott and Detective Constable Kevin Godding, of Reading CID, said: "Rackett carried out a sustained attack and given the level of violence used, it is remarkable that the victim was not left with more serious injuries.

"He is a dangerous offender and we hope this conviction shows that we will use all of our resources to prosecute those who commit such serious violence."
