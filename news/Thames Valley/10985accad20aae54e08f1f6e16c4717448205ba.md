Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following a serious collision in Milton Keynes on Monday (8/3).

At around 6.06am, a red Volkswagen Bora and a red Toyota Rav4 collided on the H7 Chaffron Way between Middleton and Monkston.

The driver of the Volkswagen, a man in his 20s, sustained serious injuries and remains in hospital.

Officers are asking anyone who may have seen the incident or the moments leading up to it to come forward.

Investigating officer PC Barry Gregory, from the Roads Policing Unit, said: "This collision has left a man seriously ill in hospital and our thoughts remain with him and his family.

"There may not have been much traffic on the road at that time of the morning and we would ask anyone who did travel on that route, especially those who may have dash cam footage, to think carefully about whether they saw anything that could help us with our investigation."

Anyone with information should call 101 with reference 43210096193.
