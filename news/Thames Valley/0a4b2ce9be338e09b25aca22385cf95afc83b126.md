Thames Valley Police is appealing for information after a man was stabbed in Banbury town centre.

The incident happened outside USC shop in Castle Quay Shopping Centre at about 1.45pm on Christmas Eve.

Two men had a verbal altercation, during which the offender assaulted the victim, a 34-year-old man.

The victim and a number of witnesses then chased the offender to Christchurch Court, where the offender attempted to flee in a yellow Seat Ibiza.

Police were called to the scene and arrested a 29-year-old man from Banbury on suspicion of GBH with intent. He has since been released on police bail until 18 January 2021.

The victim sustained a stab wound to his left thigh caused by an unknown weapon. The victim was treated at hospital but has since been discharged.

Detective Constable Samantha Bonner said: "The incident happened in Banbury town centre on Christmas Eve, therefore there are hundreds of potential witnesses. I would appeal to anyone who witnessed this incident or has any information about the stabbing who hasn't already spoken to Thames Valley Police to please contact the force.

"The easiest way to contact the force is by visiting our website or calling 101, quoting investigation reference number 43200438516.

"This is a shocking incident but I want to reassure the local community that an arrest has been made and a thorough investigation is ongoing."
