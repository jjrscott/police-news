Thames Valley Police is releasing CCTV footage in connection with a robbery investigation in Slough.

At around 11.45am on Friday 8 January, a woman in her sixties was offered assistance to bring shopping from her car into her home by two men in Washington Drive in Cippenham.

The victim declined the offer, before the offenders then searched the boot of the car, then followed the victim towards her front door, in the process taking from her a bank card and a quantity of cash.

The victim did not sustain any injuries during the incident.
