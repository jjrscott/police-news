Updated News Post

Thames Valley Police has released a CCTV image of a man officers would like to speak to following a robbery in Haddenham.

At around 9.25pm on Sunday 13 December three masked men knocked on the door and forced entry into a property in Millway Furlong, Haddenham.

Once inside the offenders demanded the occupants hand over their mobile phones.

One of the offenders stated they were in the wrong house, dropped the victim's phone and the three men left. They are believed to have driven off in a Vauxhall Zafira.

Nothing was stolen and no one was injured.

Investigating officer Detective Constable Gary Scott, based at Aylesbury police station said: "This was an extremely frightening experience for the victim's involved and fortunately no one was injured. I would like to reassure the local community that officers will be increasing their patrols in the local area.

"I am appealing to anyone who may recognise the man pictured in the image below or who has any information to get in touch.

"You can contact us using our online form or by calling 101, quoting reference number 43200422653. Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously via their website or on 0800 555 111."
