Thames Valley Police is releasing CCTV images of two men officers would like to speak to following a theft in Milton Keynes.

At around 2.10pm on Sunday 11 October, the victim, a woman in her sixties, was approached by a man whilst getting into her car in Tesco car park in McConnell Drive, Wolverton. Whilst this man distracted her, another man opened the car passenger door and took bankcards from the victim's purse.

The cards were then used to purchase a number of items before the victim had the chance to cancel her cards and any further attempts to use the cards were blocked.

Police believe the men in these images may have vital information that could help with their investigation.

Investigating officer PC Sophia Matthews, based at Milton Keynes police station said: "I am appealing for anyone who may have witnessed this incident, or recognise the men in these images, or if you believe it could be you, to please get in touch.

"You can make a report online or by calling 101 and quoting reference 43200320103.

"Alternatively, if you wish to remain 100% anonymous you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
