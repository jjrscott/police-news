Following the terrorist attack in Reading on Saturday 20 June, Counter Terrorism Policing South East (CTPSE) is now in a position to confirm the post-mortem examination results of the three men who were killed.

David Wails, aged 49, Joseph Ritchie-Bennett, aged 39, and James Furlong, aged 36, each died of a single stab wound.

Three other victims sustained stab injuries as a result of the incident which happened in Forbury Gardens just before 7pm. They were all taken to hospital for treatment and have since been discharged.

The incident was declared a terrorism incident by Deputy Assistant Commissioner Dean Haydon, Senior National Coordinator for Counter Terrorism Policing.

A 25-year-old man from Reading, arrested in connection with this incident, remains in police custody.

Detectives from CTPSE continue to appeal for anyone with information about the incident on Saturday evening, to come forward.

Anyone with any information about this incident or who was in the area before, during or after it and hasn't already spoken to police, is asked to contact Thames Valley Police on 101, quoting Operation Vaselike.
