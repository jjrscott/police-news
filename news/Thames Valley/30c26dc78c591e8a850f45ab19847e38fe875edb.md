Investigating officer PC Ben Flaherty, based at Amersham police station said: "I am releasing this e-fit image in the hope that someone recognises the man depicted and appeal for anyone who does to contact us using our online form or by calling 101, quoting reference number 43200342545.

"Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously via their website or on 0800 555 111."
