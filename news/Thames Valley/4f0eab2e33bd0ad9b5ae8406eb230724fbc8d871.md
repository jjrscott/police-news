Following an investigation by Thames Valley Police, a man has been jailed for a string of robbery offences in Reading.

Aaron Theodore, aged 26 of Elm Lodge Avenue, pleaded guilty at Reading Crown Court on Friday (8/1) to one count of robbery, four counts of attempted burglary and one count of burglary.

All the incidents took place on 8 November 2020 in Bath Road and Hatford Road.

The robbery in Bath Road, Reading on the 8 November 2020 happened between 5.30am and 6.30am. A man and woman were injured in the incident.

The victim, a 48-year-old man, was grabbed around the neck by Theodore which caused marks on the victims neck. His phone and bank card were stolen.

On the same night, attempts were made to break in to multiple houses and cars, waking multiple victims up.

There was also an incident of burglary at the house of a 94-year-old. Theodore ransacked the house and only fled the property when he was disturbed by the victim.

Theodore has been sentenced to six years' imprisonment at the same hearing.

Investigator, Zoe Purnell based at Reading police station, said: "I am pleased that Theodore will be serving a custodial sentence for his crimes.

"The investigation team had overwhelming evidence which left him with no choice but to plead guilty.

"These were very for the victims in these incidents and I'd like to thank them all for their assistance in this case."
