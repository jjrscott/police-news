Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following a fatal road traffic collision in Milton Keynes.

The incident happened yesterday (13/3) at about 10.55pm on the A5 southbound between the junctions of Caldecotte and Fenny Stratford.

A white Tesla model 3 car was involved in collision with a stationary grey Ford Transit Connect van.

The driver of the van, a man aged in his twenties from Luton, is believed to have been hit by the car.

He was sadly pronounced dead at the scene. His next of kin have been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers.

The driver of the Tesla was uninjured. No arrests have been made.

Investigating officer, Sergeant Darren Brown, of the Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "This was a tragic incident in which a man has been killed.

"If you saw either vehicle prior to the collision, the collision itself, or have dash cam footage from around this time please call the Thames Valley Police non-emergency number on 101, quoting reference number 43210106024.

"Alternatively, you can call the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, or make a report online."
