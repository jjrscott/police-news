A partial closure order has been issued on a property in Reading.

The order was granted by Reading Magistrates' Court yesterday (18/2) and will last for three months.

Officers applied for the order against the house in Ruston Close following a number of reports of regular gatherings that were breaching COVID lockdown regulations and incidents of anti-social behaviour.

The closure order prohibits entry to all persons other than the occupant of the property. Any other person found inside the address will be arrested and prosecuted.

Neighbourhood officer PC Jonathan Bowness, based at Reading police station, said: "This closure order was issued following repeated breaches of the coronavirus regulations. The behaviour of those involved was causing a significant impact on the local community and affecting their day to day lives. I hope this sends a clear message that this kind of behaviour will not be tolerated.

"The majority of the local community are doing all they can to stay at home and protect others. This shows that we will take action against the few who choose to disregard the rules and put others in danger."
