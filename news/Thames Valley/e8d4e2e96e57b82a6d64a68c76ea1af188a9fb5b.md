A man has been sentenced to one year and ten months in prison after being convicted of an assault in Dorchester-on-Thames.

Robert Newman, aged 33, of no fixed abode, was found guilty of assault by beating and committing an offence (assault) with intent to commit a relevant sexual offence following a trial at Oxford Crown Court on 4 February.

Yesterday (1/3), at the same court, he was sentenced to 22 months' imprisonment.

At around 10.30am on 3 August 2020, Newman started following a woman, aged in her 60s, as she walked her dogs on Hurst Water Meadow, Dorchester-on-Thames. She managed to evade him by finding someone else to walk with and he left her alone.

However, 20 minutes later, Newman then followed another woman, aged in her 40s, who was walking her dog alone. He pushed her to the ground and repeatedly tried to climb on top of her, but she managed to get away and call for help.

Newman fled the scene but was arrested in the area a short time later.

Investigating officer Detective Constable Jen Gibbons, of Abingdon CID, said: "Newman deliberately targeted women who were walking alone and these incidents understandably left the victims very shaken.

"We are pleased he is now unable to cause any further harm to the community and hope this result brings some kind of closure to those involved."
