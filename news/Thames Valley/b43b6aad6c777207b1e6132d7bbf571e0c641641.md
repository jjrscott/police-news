Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses after a road traffic collision in Kidlington.

At approximately 4.50pm yesterday (22/12) a Volkswagen Caddy van was in collision with another vehicle on Grovelands in Kidlington before colliding with the front of a house, causing substantial damage.

The vehicle then left the scene.

Nobody was injured in the collision.

Investigating officer PC Jonathan Simpkins, of the Joint Operations Roads Policing Unit, based at Bicester, said: "I am seeking information from anybody that may have seen a VW Caddy van in the Kidlington area at around the time of this incident.

"The vehicle is likely to have significant front-end damage, a missing passenger wing mirror and a dirty or obscured rear number plate.

"If anybody believes that they have seen this van parked up on a driveway or road anywhere in the locality, please get in touch with police.

"Similarly, if you saw this incident, or have dash-cam footage that may have captured the collision, please contact us.

"You can do so by calling the 24-hour non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 43200435927, or by making a report online."
