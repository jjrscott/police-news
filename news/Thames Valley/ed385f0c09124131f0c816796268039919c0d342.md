The group started to hit him and one of them was carrying a hammer.

The man sustained bumps and a cut to the back of his head. He received treatment at Milton Keynes General Hospital and has since been discharged.

Damage was also caused to the victim's car which was parked in the car park.

The offenders are described as a group of five men aged 18-21-years-old. Three of the men are black and two are Asian. They were wearing dark clothing and face masks.

Investigating officer PC David Smith, based at Bletchley police station, said: "This is a concerning incident and we are following up on a number of enquiries to identify and apprehend those involved.

"This incident took place at a busy time of day in an area where many may have dash-cam or mobile phone footage and so I am appealing to anyone who has any information to get in touch.
