Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following a fatal road traffic collision on the A4421 near Newton Purcell.

At around 5.50pm yesterday (2/12) a white articulated lorry left the road and collided with a tree.

The driver, a man in his sixties, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

His next of kin have been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers.

Investigating officer, PC Jonathan Simpkins, of the Joint Operations Roads Policing Unit, said: "Our thoughts remain with the man's family at this time.

"We are appealing for anyone who may have witnessed what happened to please come forward.

"We would also ask any motorists with dash-cams, who were in the local area around the time of this incident, to check the footage in case it may have captured something that could assist with our investigation.

"Anyone with information can contact Thames Valley Police by calling 101 or making a report online, quoting reference 43200405758.

"Alternatively, if you wish to remain anonymous, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
