Following a Thames Valley Police investigation, a man has been jailed for sexual offences committed in Milton Keynes.

Craig Hughes, aged 37, of Adams Close in Buckingham, was jailed for four years at Aylesbury Crown Court on Friday (8/1).

He was convicted of five counts of paying for the sexual services of a girl on 24 November last year.

A jury found him guilty by a unanimous verdict following a six day trial.

The charges relate to incidents that took place in February 2018 in both Milton Keynes and Buckingham. Hughes paid for the services of two victims who were aged 16 at the time.

Investigating officer, DC Vince Higgins of Milton Keynes police station, said: "I am satisfied that Craig Hughes has been sentenced following his conviction of sexual offences in November last year.

"He denied the counts against him but a jury found him guilty of five counts, and not guilty of a further two.

"He will now face a prison sentence whereby he can reflect on his actions, and the damage it will have caused to the victims.

"Thames Valley Police will always investigate reports of this nature extremely seriously, and target offenders with a view to bringing them to court."
