A Section 60 order that began in Reading on Saturday (6/2) has been renewed to last a further 24 hours.

The order was put in place following the death of 26-year-old Raheem Hanif in Dulnan Close, Tilehurst.

As well as this incident, an aggravated burglary took place on Thursday (11/2) during which a woman sustained a laceration injury to her arm. https://www.thamesvalley.police.uk/news/thames-valley/news/2021/february/08-02-2021/witness-appeal-following-aggravated-burglary--reading/

Then today, a man sustained a wound to his hand near to Forbury Road

From 9pm today (12/2) the order will last for a further 24 hours, concluding at 9m on Saturday (13/2), however it will be reviewed and if necessary extended once more.

The order applies to the LPA of Reading in its entirety, which temporarily allows police officers greater powers to stop and search in a defined location when it is believed there is a likelihood that serious violence will take place.

Superintendent Nick John, Reading Local Policing Area Commander, said: "The decision has been made to extend this order until 9pm on Saturday, meaning it will run for a further 24 hours from this evening. This is not a decision that has been taken lightly.

"A continued police presence will be visible, as officers continue to be deployed for patrols. The aim of this order being in place is to stop incidents of serious violence from taking place, and officers have greater powers while the order is active.

"Since Saturday, 165 individuals have been stopped and searched. Weapons have been seized that range from bladed articles, knuckle dusters, and a ball bearing gun. Class A and B drugs have also been seized.

"Approximately 12 arrests have so far been made since the order was activated on Saturday.

"The seizing of these dangerous weapons, and drugs, as well as arrests made show that this order justified.

"I would like to remind the people of Reading that it is in place to prevent serious violence. Just because you may be stopped does not mean you are in trouble.

"Please speak to officers should you wish to. They can help to answer questions and provide reassurance."
