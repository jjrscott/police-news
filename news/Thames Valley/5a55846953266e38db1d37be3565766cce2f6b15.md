Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses after a woman and her elderly mother were verbally abused in Milton Keynes.

At around 1.30pm on Sunday (14/3), two women, aged 51 and 80, were walking on the Redway close to the junction with Peterborough Gate/Landsborough Gate when a man sped past on his bike.

He stopped and shouted abuse at them before leaving the scene. Shortly afterwards, he turned back and rode directly at them, continued to verbally abuse them and spat in their direction.

He then returned again about ten minutes later wearing a different, black-coloured top and rode past slowly, reaching into his pocket as if he was going to take something out.

The offender is described as black, in his late teens to early 20s and of average height and slim build.

He was wearing a white baseball cap and a white top with a big blue band across it, as well as a scarf across his face.

Investigating officer PC Grant Hebblewhite, from Milton Keynes police station, said: "This incident left both women shaken to the extent that the 80-year-old victim no longer wants to go walking outside.

"No-one should feel scared to leave their own home and we need to identify this man to make sure he doesn't repeat this kind of behaviour.

"Anyone who believes they witnessed the incident or saw him in the area should contact us as soon as possible."

Any information can be reported by calling 101 with reference 43210106607.

Alternatively call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
