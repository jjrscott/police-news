Following an incident in which a man was stabbed, a Section 60 order has been enacted in Reading.

The incident occurred at around 8.15pm in Church Street. The victim, a man in his forties was assaulted by a group of unknown offenders with weapons who fled the scene after the assault.

The victim has been taken to hospital with injuries consistent with having been stabbed.

No arrests have been made at this time.

The Section 60 order is in place for 12 hours until 9.30am tomorrow (19/1) whereupon it will be reviewed and extended for a further period if deemed necessary to do so.

The order applies to the area bounded by Narcot Road to the west, the River Thames to the north, London Road, Berkley Ave, Pell Street to the south and the A3290 to the east.

Inspector James Tribe, based at Reading police station said: "A Section 60 order has been authorised following an assault in Reading this evening.

"Thames Valley Police does not take the decision to enforce Section 60 lightly, and these orders exist to help the police prevent serious violence.

"A Section order gives officers the right to search people without reasonable grounds where serious violence has taken place or where we think it may take place.

"This order is in place to prevent any further incidents from taking place and I would encourage anyone with concerns to speak to one of our officers.

"I would also like to appeal to anyone who may have witnessed or who may have information about the incident in Church Street to please come forward.

"Anyone with information can contact Thames Valley Police by calling 101 or making a report online, quoting reference 43210023526.

"Alternatively, if you wish to remain anonymous, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
