Following a Thames Valley Police investigation, a man has been jailed for three years after he was convicted of burglary in Windsor.

James Clark, aged 37, of Sawyers Close, Windsor, was found guilty by a majority verdict of one count of burglary in a trial lasting eight days at Reading Crown Court, which concluded on 15 October.

Returning to the same court for sentencing on Friday (11/12), Clark was sentenced to prison.

At approximately 6.15pm on 28 June 2019, Clark entered a property in Hanover Way in Windsor.

The victim, a woman aged in her fifties, returned home from work and noticed a knife from her kitchen drawer in her bedroom.

She then encountered Clark hiding behind the door of another room in the property.

The victim asked Clark what he wanted, and he asked for money.

Aware that there was a knife in the other room, the victim gave Clark Â£40 in cash, and he then left.

Clark was arrested on 29 June 2019 and following an investigation, he was charged with one count of burglary on 3 January 2020.

Designated investigator Pippa Rouse of the Maidenhead Priority Crime Team said: "I am pleased that justice has been served for the victim in this case.

"No-one should return home to a stranger in their house with a threat of violence in a place they should feel safe and secure.

"This was a frightening ordeal for the victim, and I hope that this conviction and sentence will serve as some solace to her."
