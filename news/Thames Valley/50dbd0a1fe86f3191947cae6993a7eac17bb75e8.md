A man has been sentenced to six years in jail after being found guilty of rape.

Thomas Cowley, aged 21, of no fixed abode, was sentenced today (4/3) following a hearing at Oxford Crown Court.

Cowley was found guilty of one count of rape and one count of actual bodily harm in November last year. He also pleaded guilty to one count of coercive control.

Between 2017 and 2020, Cowley carried out a campaign of abuse against the victim, aged in her 20s. As well as controlling her finances, he also dictated where she went, who she spoke to and even what she ate. On one occasion he pushed her, grabbed her by the throat and threw her across the room. On another, he raped her.

Cowley was arrested on 28 April 2020 and later charged.

Investigating officer, Detective Constable Jessica Godfrey, based at St Aldates police station, said: "Cowley controlled almost every aspect of the victim's life, at times leaving her fearful for her own safety.

"We are pleased he is now behind bars and unable to subject anyone else to this kind of horrific behaviour.

"The victim in this case must be commended for her courage and bravery throughout the investigation and the trial, and the key role she has played in bringing Cowley to justice.

"We will always take reports of this nature very seriously and I hope the result today will encourage other victims to come forward.

"We will listen, there is support and help available and, wherever possible, offenders will be prosecuted."
