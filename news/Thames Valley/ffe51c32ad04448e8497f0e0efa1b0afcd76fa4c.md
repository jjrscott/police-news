Thames Valley Police is appealing for the public's help in tracing a man who is wanted in Oxford.

Abdul Rahiim, aged 26, of no fixed abode, is wanted in connection with an incident of attempted burglary which occurred in Oxford city centre.

On 31 August this year, an offender attempted to gain entry into a property in Iffley Road at around 6.30pm. However a neighbouring resident confronted them, before they left the scene on foot in the direction of the city centre. Nothing was taken.

Rahiim is described as a black man with an athletic build and around 5ft 9ins tall. He has black hair in a braided style.

He is known to have connections in Birmingham as well as Oxford.

Investigating officer, PC Donal McGuckin, of St Aldates police station, said: "I am appealing to anyone who recognises Rahiim, knows of his whereabouts, or any witnesses to the incident of burglary in August this year.

"Rahiim could be in Oxford, but he is also known to have connections in Birmingham.

"If you can help, please call Thames Valley Police to make a report, quoting 43200272372. You can also make a report online here.

"If you see him, please do not approach him, but call police instead.

"Alternatively, if you wish to make an anonymous report then you can call independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 for 100% anonymity."
