A man has been given a suspended sentence after robbing a man in Holmer Green last summer.

Jordan Cox, aged 18, of Sheepcote Dell Road, Holmer Green, appeared at Aylesbury Crown Court on Wednesday 24 March where he pleaded guilty to robbery and was handed a 12 month sentence suspended for two years and ordered to pay £1000 in compensation.

He was also sentenced to four months, suspended for two years, after pleading guilty to assault on an emergency worker, and ordered to pay £1,000 in compensation.

He must also pay an additional £500 in compensation for pleading guilty to assault by beating.

On 20 July last year, Cox approached the victim and his girlfriend, both aged 20, on the Common Recreation Ground, Holmer Green and forced him to hand over two phones, saying he had a knife.

He then demanded the victim's watch which he removed with the knife, causing a small cut to the victim's hand.

He was arrested at the scene during which time he assaulted an officer as he was detained, injuring the officer's knees.

Investigating officer, Detective Constable Jenna Wilde, based at Amersham police station, said: "The victims in this case were simply trying to enjoy a picnic in the park when they were targeted by Cox and robbed.

"He not only caused them to fear for their safety but by approaching them so closely during a global pandemic, put their health at risk as well as that of the officers.

"We will never tolerate violence towards members of the public or our staff and will prosecute those who act in this way."
