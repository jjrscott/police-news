Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Reading.

Between 9.50pm and 10pm on Monday (1/2) two women were walking along Kings Road, near to the Prudential building, when an argument started as one demanded money from the other.

The suspect then grabbed the victim and assaulted her to try and steal money from her.

The suspect took a leopard print scarf that the victim was wearing but did not take any money. The victim sustained a cut to her face. She did not require hospital treatment.

The offender is described as a white woman aged in her late teens to early twenties and approximately 5ft 4ins to 5ft 7ins tall. She was wearing a red or pink coat that was unzipped, with the hood up.

Investigating officer Detective Constable Phil Marchant, based at Reading police station, said: "This incident took place on a busy main road and so I'm keen to hear from anyone who may have dash cam footage of the incident or who saw this happening.

"You can get in touch using our online form or by calling 101, quoting reference number 43210044282. Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their website."
