Thames Valley Police is appealing for information after a car was driven through a red light and collided with a motorcyclist in Oxford.

At 5.27pm yesterday (14/3), the driver of a car attempted to evade police by driving through a red light.

While on Henley Avenue, at the junction with Iffley Turn, the car then collided with a motorcyclist, knocking the rider off his bike before being driven off at speed.

The motorcyclist, a 17-year-old boy, suffered a wrist and neck injury and was treated by the ambulance service at the scene.

The car involved was a dark blue Audi A4 convertible with partial registration plate YC05. It was later found abandoned and has been seized by police.

Investigating officer PC Alex Norrish, of the Roads Policing Unit, based at Abingdon, said: "The driver of the car involved in this incident had complete disregard for the safety of other road users and did not stop even when it was clear he had collided with a motorcyclist.

"The rider is fortunate not to have suffered more serious injuries but has understandably been left shaken.

"I am asking anyone who was in the area at the time, especially anyone who may have dash cam footage, to please get in touch. The information you provide could be vital to our investigation."

Anyone with information should call 101 with reference 43210107212.

Alternatively call Crimestoppers completely anonymously on 0800 555 111.
