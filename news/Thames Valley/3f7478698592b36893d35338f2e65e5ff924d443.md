Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Headington.

Between 10.45am and 11.45am on Tuesday (1/12) the victim, a 49-year-old man, was followed by two people in a grey Saab from the Natwest Bank on London Road, Headington to Underhill Circus in Barton.

The victim left his vehicle unattended, whilst inside the property one of the offenders got out of the grey Saab, partial number place DY07 ***, and stole an amount of cash from the victim's vehicle.

The victim confronted the offender and retrieved the cash. He was then threatened before the offenders drove off.

One of the offenders is a white man, of large build and wearing dark clothing, a black face mask and a black beanie hat.

Investigating officer PC Robert Fisher, based at St Aldates police station, said: "I would like to speak to anyone who witnessed this incident or anyone who has any information which may assist our investigation."

"If you have any information please make a report online or contact the 24-hour non-emergency number by calling 101 quoting the reference 43200403357.
