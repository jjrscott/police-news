Updated News Post

Thames Valley Police is releasing a CCTV video following a road traffic collision in Oxford.

At around 9.15pm on Sunday 8 November, the victim, a woman in her thirties, was crossing the road on Hollow Way outside the Corner House pub in Cowley when she was struck by a white van.

The driver of the van, described as a white man in his forties, stopped and got out to speak to the victim before leaving the scene without exchanging any contact details or waiting for emergency services to arrive.

The victim attended the John Radcliffe hospital and was treated for a deep cut to her lip that required surgery, and she has since been discharged.

Investigating officer PC Daniel Watford, based at the roads policing unit in Bicester, said: "I am releasing this CCTV footage as there were a number of vehicles passing the scene at the time and I am appealing for any witnesses to come forward.

"If you witnessed this incident or have any information that might help our investigation, particularly dash-cam footage, please get in touch.

"You can make a report online or call 101 quoting reference 43200366394.

"Alternatively, if you wish to remain 100% anonymous you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
