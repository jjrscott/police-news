Officers investigating a robbery in Milton Keynes are renewing an appeal for witnesses two weeks on from the incident.

Between 1.45am and 3.45am on Wednesday 25 November, a lorry driver was parked outside Magna Park, near to John Lewis, where he was waiting to unload his trailer.

While he was waiting, his cab was broken into by four men who held him down at knifepoint and ordered him to drive to a layby on the A5 near Caldecotte.

The offenders unloaded most of the contents of his trailer, a large quantity of electrical goods, and placed this into a large van or small truck, before unhitching the driver's trailer from his cab.

The offenders drove the victim in his cab to a layby southbound on the A5 near Little Brickhill and forced him to walk into the woods, before setting the cab on fire at around 3.45am.

The victim, a 37-year-old man, was unhurt during the ordeal.

One man, a 31-year-old from Milton Keynes, was arrested on 4 December on suspicion of conspiracy to commit robbery and has been released under investigation.

Investigating officer Detective Constable Jo Hudson of the Priority Crime Team based at Milton Keynes police station, said: "This was a frightening ordeal for the victim, who thankfully was not injured.

"I am re-appealing to anybody who was in the area of Magna Park, Caldecotte or Little Brickhill in the early hours of Wednesday 25 November and think they may have witnessed any suspicious activity to please get in touch with police.

"I am particularly appealing to any drivers who were at any of these locations and have dash-cam installed, to please check this and contact police if it has captured anything that may assist this investigation.

"Similarly, if there are any other drivers who were parked in the vicinity of Magna Park that morning, please contact police if you witnessed any unusual activity.

"The lorry that was robbed was a 40-tonne Man truck with a white cab and a white and blue trailer, and the offender's vehicle was a van or truck.

"A large quantity of Bose electrical goods was stolen during the incident, and so if you have been offered any such merchandise in the last two weeks and do not know the source, please get in touch with us.

"You can also make a report online, quoting reference number 43200393163, or for 100% anonymity, call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
