Following an incident in Station Road, Slough this afternoon (5/11) Thames Valley Police has authorised a section 60 order.

At around 12.36pm officers were called to Station Road after a knife related incident that resulted in an 18-year-old sustaining injuries to his back and hand.

He has been taken to hospital for treatment and a man has been arrested in connection with this incident.

The Section 60 order applies to the areas shown in the map pictured, including the Langley area of Slough.

The order is in place until 3.30pm tomorrow (6/11) and will be reviewed and if necessary extended for a further period.

Inspector Matt Lugg, based at Slough police station, said: "We have authorised the order following an incident this afternoon in Station Road.

"I understand that this may cause concern within the local community, however please be reassured that there will be an increased police presence in the local area whilst we investigate this incident and throughout the duration of this order.

"Under this order, our officers have been given authority to use their powers under Section 60 to help the police prevent serious violence and we do not take decisions to enact them lightly.

"Please do not be worried if you are stopped by an officer as this does not mean that you are in trouble, this is just one method that we are using to ensure weapons are kept off our streets.

"Please do not hesitate to speak to one of our officers with any concerns that you may have. They will be happy to address these with you and also offer any advice or reassurance that you require."
