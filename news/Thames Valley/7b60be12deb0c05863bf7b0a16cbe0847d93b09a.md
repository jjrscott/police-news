Thames Valley police is releasing a CCTV image of three boys following a robbery in Slough.

At around 3.25pm on Wednesday 2 December, the victim, a teenage boy, was cycling along an alleyway between Langley Road and Alderbury Road that runs along Minster Way with his two younger siblings when he was approached by three older teenage boys.

The boys threatened the victim and demanded that he hand over his bicycle, which he did, and the boys then fled the scene.

Nothing else was stolen and the victim was not injured.

Police believe the boys in these images may have vital information that could help their investigation.

Investigating officer Detective Constable Conor Campbell, based at Slough police station said: "I am appealing for any witnesses to this incident, or anyone who saw these boys in the area at the time or recognises them, or if you think it may be you, to please get in touch.

"You can make a report online or by calling 101 and quoting reference 43200405530.

"Alternatively, if you wish to remain 100% anonymous you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
