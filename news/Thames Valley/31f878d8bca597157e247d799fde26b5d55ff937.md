Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Bracknell.

At around 2.30pm on Tuesday (2/3), the victim, a man aged 31, was walking on Ralphs Ride Close to Calfridus Way, Bracknell when he was approached by two men.

They asked him what was in his pocket before walking up to him and removing his wallet. They took out Â£200 in cash, pushed the victim to the floor and fled the scene.

The first offender is described as a white male, in his 20s and just over 5ft in height. He was of slim build, with ginger hair and was wearing a black hoody and black tracksuit bottoms with stripes down the side.

The other male was also white, in his 20s and had blond hair. He had a baseball cap on and was wearing a zip-up hoody and grey tracksuit bottoms at the time of the incident.

They were also walking a white Staffordshire bull terrier type dog when the robbery took place.

Investigating officer PC Wasim Akram, based at Loddon Valley police station, said: "This robbery happened in the middle of the day and we believe there may be people who witnessed the incident or saw individuals matching the description of the offenders nearby.

"The victim was luckily not injured but was left shaken and we are keen for anyone who has information to come forward and help us progress our investigation."

Anyone with information should call 101 with reference number 43210083009 or make a report online.

Alternatively, for 100% anonymity, you can also call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
