Thames Valley Police is releasing CCTV images following an assault in Iver Heath.

At around 9.35pm on Friday 15 January, three people entered the Esso Garage on Uxbridge Road.

One of them was not wearing a face mask and was asked by shop staff to put one on. The woman refused and became abusive. She pushed one member of staff, threw a receipt printer at another and removed glasses from the face of a third.

She then went behind the till and took two bottles of alcohol.

She then left the store with the two people she had entered with.

No one was injured during the incident.

Investigating officer PC Kayleigh Dean, based at Amersham police station, said: "I am releasing this image as I believe this woman has information that could be vital to this investigation.

"If you recognise her, please get in touch using our online form or by calling 101, quoting reference number 43210019877. Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously via their website or on 0800 555 111."
