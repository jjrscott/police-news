Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following an incident of robbery, which occurred in Caversham.

At a time between 5.20pm and 5.30pm on Wednesday (25/11), a man aged in his thirties was travelling along Henley Road on a scooter, when another man stopped him.

The man asked the victim how much his scooter was worth, before producing a knife, described as a Stanley knife, and told the victim to follow him.

However, the victim managed to get away and rode off on his scooter in the direction of Micklands Road, where he reported the incident to police.

No property was stolen and the victim sustained no injuries.

Officers have made one arrest in connection with this incident.

Investigator Chelsea Hughes, of Reading police station, said: "This was a terrifying incident for the victim in this case, who was stopped and then threatened by the offender who had a knife.

"Thankfully he managed to get away and no property was taken and neither was he hurt in any way.

"Officers have made an arrest in connection with this incident, but I am still appealing for information or any witnesses who may have seen this taking place.

"Anyone with information is asked to call Thames Valley Police on 101, quoting 43200394472, or you can make a report online here.

"Alternatively you can call independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 for 100% anonymity."
