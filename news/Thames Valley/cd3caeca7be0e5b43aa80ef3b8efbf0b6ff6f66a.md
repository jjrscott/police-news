Thames Valley Police has authorised a Section 60 order in Milton Keynes today (31/3).

The order applies to the borough of Milton Keynes in its entirety, and it has been authorised in response to an incident on Tuesday (30/3) evening during which two teenagers sustained stab wounds.

The order began at 10.47am today, and will be in place for 24 hours.

Around 10 people were involved in the altercation, involving bladed weapons, which took place on the Redway near to Furzton Lake at 7.30pm.

Two boys sustained injuries that are non-life threatening and are in hospital receiving treatment.

A man aged 18 and two boys, 17 and 15, all from Milton Keynes, have been arrested in connection with the incident and are in custody.

Inspector Gemma Price, of Milton Keynes Police station, said: "In response to the violent incident last night whereby two teenagers sustained stab wounds, we have put in place a Section 60 order for the entire borough of Milton Keynes.

"A section 60 order enhances the stop and search powers of officers, allowing them to search anyone without needing to suspect that they might be carrying weapons.

"The order is in place to prevent further violence from taking place, so we would encourage residents to feel reassured by a police presence rather than alarmed.

"Thames Valley Police does not take the decision to implement a Section 60 lightly, and following the conclusion of this order, it can be extended if deemed necessary. We take any incidents of knife related crime extremely seriously and so you can expect to see additional officers in the area. I would strongly encourage the people to speak to officers if they have concerns.

"I would also like to take the opportunity to further appeal for witnesses, or anyone with information about the incident near Furzton Lake last night.

"Anyone with information is asked to contact Thames Valley Police on 101, quoting reference 43210134271. You can also report online, or call independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
