Following a Thames Valley Police investigation, a man has been sentenced after he threw urine at prison officers.

Barry Veysey, aged 62, formerly of HMP Bullingdon, was sentenced to two and a half years' imprisonment at Oxford Crown Court on Friday (5/3) after a jury found him guilty of two counts of maliciously administering a poison or other noxious thing with intent to injure/ aggrieve/ annoy.

It followed a two day trial at the same court, relating to two incidents that took place in HMP Bullingdon on June 2 and 25 in 2019.

On both occasions, Veysey threw a cup of urine towards a prison guard, which struck them in the face and body.

Veysey was charged via postal requisition on 30 April 2020.

Investigating officer, PC Andrew Gold of Banbury police station, said: "Both of these incidents were incredible unpleasant experiences for the victims to have to endure, while simply carrying out their job.

"Prison officers work hard and in the best interest of prisoners, so should not be subjected to this form of behaviour while carrying out their duties.

"I am pleased that Veysey's sentence reflects the seriousness of his actions."
