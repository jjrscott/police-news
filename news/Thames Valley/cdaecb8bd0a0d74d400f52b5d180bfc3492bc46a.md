Thames Valley Police is releasing an image of a male officers would like to speak to in connection with an assault and robbery in Milton Keynes.

At around 4.10pm on Thursday 18 February, a 13-year-old boy was on Shenley Road at the junction with Burchard Crescent in Shenley Church End when he was approached by an older teenager on a bike.

The offender verbally abused the victim and pushed him before cycling away. Two minutes later he returned, demanded the victim's hat and trainers before punching and pushing him and taking his property.

He then cycled away from the scene.

Investigating officer Detective Constable James Schopp, based at Milton Keynes police station, said: "This is a shocking incident which left a young teenager shaken and suffering a sore back after being pushed and having his possessions stolen.

"These kind of incidents will never be tolerated in our communities and we are committed to finding the person responsible for this robbery.

"I am urging anyone who recognise the male in this image to contact us in order to help us progress our investigation."

Anyone with information should call 101 or report online with reference 43210069374 or independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
