Officers investigating a rape in Milton Keynes on Saturday 6 February have made an arrest.

A 32-year-old man from Derby was arrested on Monday (1/3) on suspicion of rape.

The arrest relates to an incident at around 5am on 6 February when the victim, a woman aged in her twenties, was approached by a man at Newport Pagnell Services, who asked her to sign up to a website dating service.

She initially refused, but then agreed to take part in a survey and was driven to an area in Pennycress Way where she was sexually assaulted and raped.

The man has since been released on conditional police bail, while the investigation continues.
