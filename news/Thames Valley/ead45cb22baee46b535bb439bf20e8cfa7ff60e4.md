Following a Thames Valley Police investigation, a man has been sentenced to three years' imprisonment after he was convicted of four counts of burglary in a trial at Aylesbury Crown Court on Thursday (26/11).

James Beard, aged 48, of Bossiney Place, Fishermead, Milton Keynes, was found guilty by unanimous jury of four burglaries, which all took place on the same day against the same victim on 29 May this year.

The offences, which took place in Calverleigh Crescent in Milton Keynes, were spotted when the family of the victim, a woman in her seventies, noticed a large rise in activity on CCTV clips from the house of the victim.

The offender was recognised as Beard, who had entered the victim's house numerous times on 29 May under the pretence that he was looking out for the victim, as he was worried about her.

Beard was arrested on 11 June and was charged with the offences the following day.

Investigating officer Detective Constable Damien Freeman of the Milton Keynes Priority Crime Team, said: "James Beard took advantage of a frail and elderly victim, using the excuse that he was a neighbour and simply making sure she was OK.

"But he had ulterior motives, knowing that his victim suffered from mobility issues and dementia, and entered the house at will four times in the space of four hours with the intention of stealing items belonging to the victim.

"This has been a distressing ordeal, both for the victim, and for her family and I am pleased that Beard is now behind bars.

"Beard also showed a complete disregard to the health and safety of the victim as these offences took place during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.

"His selfishness was such that he only thought of his own self-needs, and it took the jury just a matter of minutes to find him guilty of all charges.

"I hope that this sentence will show that Thames Valley Police is committed to tackling such invasive crimes as burglary, and that the victim and her family can move on with their lives."
