A further section 60 order has been put in place in Reading for 24 hours.

The order was put in place following the death of 26-year-old Raheem Hanif in Dulnan Close, Tilehurst on Saturday (6/2).

The order will be in place from 9pm today (13/2) and will last for a further 24 hours, concluding at 9pm tomorrow (14/2), however it will be reviewed and if necessary extended.

The order applies to the LPA of Reading in its entirety, which temporarily allows police officers greater powers to stop and search in a defined location when it is believed there is a likelihood that serious violence will take place.

Superintendent Amy Clements, said: "The decision to put this order in place is never taken lightly.

"There will be a police presence and extra patrols in the area while the order is in place.

"The aim is to stop incidents of serious violence from taking place, and officers have greater powers to stop and search during this time.

"A number of weapons and drugs have already been seized, taking these weapons off the streets in our community.

"However, it is important to note that if you are stopped, it does not mean you are in trouble.

"Please feel free to speak to officers, they can help to answer questions and will be there to provide reassurance during this time."
