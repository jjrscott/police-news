Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following a sexual assault on a child in Reading.

At around 3pm on Friday (29/1), two girls under the age of 13 were walking along Hemdean Road near Caversham Primary School when they were approached by a man.

The man touched one of the girls inappropriately over her clothing as he walked past them.

The man is described as white, in his twenties and with a slim build. He had shaggy brown hair and a bushy beard and was wearing a baggy grey or blue top.

Investigating officer PC Mark Ferrey, based at Reading police station said: "We are doing all we can to investigate this incident thoroughly, and you may have noticed an increased police presence in the area recently.

"This is being treated as an isolated incident and has not been linked to any other incidents, nor is there believed to be a wider risk to the public.

"I am appealing for any witnesses of this incident or anyone who saw a man matching this description in the area at the time to please get in touch.

"You can make a report online or by calling 101 and quoting reference 43210039975.

"If you wish to remain 100% anonymous you can also call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
