A man has been sentenced to more than two years in jail after being convicted of harassment.

At Oxford Crown Court on Tuesday (16/2), Harley David Webb, aged 31, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to two counts of Section 4 harassment (putting a person in fear of violence) and was sentenced to 26 months' imprisonment.

He also pleaded guilty to the unauthorised transmission of an image or sound or information by electronic communication from within a prison and was sentenced to six months, to be served concurrently to the above.

The court heard that while in prison, Webb sent threats to two female victims, aged 52 and 24.

Investigating officer Detective Constable Joseph Stevenson, of Banbury CID, said: "Webb was behind bars yet still managed to carry out these offences which left two women extremely fearful and suffering mental distress.

"We are pleased he has been given a further custodial sentence and hope it demonstrates we will do all we can to prosecute those responsible for this type of behaviour."
