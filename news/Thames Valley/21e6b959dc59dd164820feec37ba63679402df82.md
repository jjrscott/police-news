Thames Valley Police is going to be holding a one minute silence across the force tomorrow (23/8) at 11am in memory of PC Andrew Harper.

These are private events and we would ask that the privacy of our officers and staff is respected across the force area.

There will be a pooled media opportunity at Thames Valley Police Training Centre in Sulhamstead as a representation of these events.

There will not be any interview opportunities but some words will be read by a Force Chaplin which can be captured by the pooled filming.
