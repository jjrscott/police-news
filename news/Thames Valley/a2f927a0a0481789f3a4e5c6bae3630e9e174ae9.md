Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following a serious road traffic collision near Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire.

At 10.10pm on Wednesday (10/02), a grey VW Golf collided with a tree on the road between Rotherfield Greys and Shepherds Green.

The driver, a 22-year-old man, suffered serious head injuries and was taken to hospital where he remains.

No other vehicle is believed to have been involved.

Investigating officer PC James Mahony, of the Roads Policing Unit, said: "We are asking anyone who saw the collision or the moments leading up to it to contact us as soon as possible.

"In particular, we would ask any drivers who may have dash cam footage of the incident or the car to get in touch by calling 101 with reference 43210057909."
