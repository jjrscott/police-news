Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following an incident of indecent exposure in Lower Earley, Reading.

At around 12.40pm on Sunday (14/3), a family were walking through Laurel Park when they started being followed by a man.

He took off his trousers and exposed himself before making threats to kill and indicating he was in possession of a knife.

Police were called and officers attended the scene.

A man aged 23, from Earley, was arrested on suspicion of indecent exposure and threats to kill. He has since been bailed.

Officers are asking anyone who saw the incident or the moments leading up to it to contact them.

Investigating officer PC Ross Hutcheson, based at Loddon Valley police station, said: "While we have made an arrest in relation to this case we are still keen to hear from anyone who may have been in the park at the time and saw or heard the incident taking place.

"Similarly if you saw a man acting suspiciously or have any other information that may help our enquiries we would like to speak to you.

"Everyone has the right to feel safe when out in public and we are doing all we can to make sure no-one else is subject to the same kind of behaviour."

Anyone with information should call 101 with reference 43210106507. Alternatively call independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111.
