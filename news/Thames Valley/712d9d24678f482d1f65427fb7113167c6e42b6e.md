Thames Valley Police has successfully applied for a closure order on a property in Reading.

The full closure order against the property in Oxford Road was granted at Reading Magistrates' Court on Monday (15/3).

Officers applied for the order following a number of reports to police from the local community about drug dealing, drug consumption and anti-social behaviour on the premises.

Officers from the Oxford Road Neighbourhood Policing Team worked with partners including Reading Borough Council to address the ongoing issues.

PC Colin Boyes, from the Oxford Road Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "This closure order prohibits anyone, except for a small amount of specified individuals, from entering the premises for three months. If others do so, they will be committing a criminal offence.

"We recognise the impact anti-social behaviour has upon the lives of those living in the local community and will continue to work with our partners to tackle it. I believe that this initiative demonstrates that Thames Valley Police takes these matters very seriously and will not tolerate such activity."

Report incidents of anti-social behaviour on our website or by calling 101. If a crime is in progress, please call 999.
