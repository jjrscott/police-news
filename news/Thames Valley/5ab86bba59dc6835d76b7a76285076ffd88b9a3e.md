Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following a fatal road traffic collision on the A361 near Burford in Oxfordshire.

At around 7.40am yesterday (9/12), a van, a lorry and a 4x4 were involved in a collision on the A361 between Burford and Lechlade, near the hamlet of Signet.

Sadly the driver of the van, a man in his twenties, died at the scene. His next of kin has been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers.

Another man, aged in his fifties, was taken to hospital where he remains in a stable condition.

The occupants of the 4x4 were uninjured.

Investigating officer, PC Sandra Terry, of the Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the family of the man who has died at this very difficult time.

"I am appealing to anybody who may have been in the area and witnessed this incident to please come forward.

"I would also urge motorists to check dash-cam footage in case it has captured anything significant that could assist our investigation.

"If you have information, please contact police by calling 101 or making a report online, quoting reference 43200415646."
