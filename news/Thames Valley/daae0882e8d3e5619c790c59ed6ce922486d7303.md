**Following the conclusion of a coronial inquest yesterday (29/3) at Reading Coroners ' Court into the death of Huw Jones in Sonning last June, Huw's widow, Julia, has released the following tribute.**

The conclusion of the inquest was that Huw, who was cycling in Thames Street, Sonning on Wednesday 10 June 2020, died as a result of a road traffic collision, and no further action is to be taken against the driver of the car involved.

Julia says: "Huw's death has devastated not only our family, but a whole community.

"The support that we have received over the last ten months has been overwhelming.

"I would like to thank everyone - the witnesses and emergency service personnel who tried to help Huw that morning, those involved in the investigation, and everyone who has supported me and the children over the months that have followed.

"My heart goes out to the driver involved in what can only be described as an incredibly tragic accident.

"We miss Huw terribly but remember the wonderful man he was every day."

**Huw and Julia Jones**
