Thames Valley Police is releasing a CCTV image of two men officers would like to speak to following a burglary in Slough.

Between 2.50pm and 3.50pm on Thursday 10 December last year, unknown offenders forced entry to a property in Hazlemere Road by smashing a rear door.

Once inside they stole jewellery.

Investigating officer, Detective Constable Wayne Plowright, based at Slough police station said: "I am releasing this CCTV image as I believe that the two men may have information that could assist with this investigation.

"I would urge you to contact us if you recognise either of the men in the CCTV image, or if you believe it may be you.

"Anyone with information can contact Thames Valley Police by calling 101 or making a report online, quoting reference 43200418304.

"Alternatively, if you wish to remain anonymous you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website."
