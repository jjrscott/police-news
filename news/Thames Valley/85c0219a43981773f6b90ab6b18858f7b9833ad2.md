Officers investigating the death of a man in Tilehurst, Reading, on Saturday (6/2) have this evening (9/2) charged a 16-year-old boy.

The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, from Reading, was charged with one count of murder and one count of Section 18 grievous bodily harm with intent and has been remanded in custody to appear before Reading Magistrates' Court tomorrow morning (10/2).

The charge is in connection with an incident in Dulnan Close, Tilehurst, shortly before 7pm on Saturday in which a 26-year-old man sadly died and another man, aged in his forties, was injured.

Two 25-year-old men and a 22-year-old man previously arrested have now been released on conditional police bail.

A 16-year-old boy, a 17-year-old boy and a 23-year-old man who were also arrested remain in police custody.
