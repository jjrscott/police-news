Following a Thames Valley Police investigation a man has been jailed for more than five years after he was convicted of a drugs supply offence in Aylesbury.

Fayaz Zaman, aged 42, of Prebendal Farm Estate, Aylesbury, pleaded guilty to one count of being concerned in the supply of cocaine in a hearing at Aylesbury Crown Court on Tuesday (9/3).

Zaman was subsequently sentenced to five and a half years' imprisonment.

On 9 December 2020, officers executed a warrant at an address in Fairford Leys, Aylesbury.

This property was rented and controlled by Zaman and during the search, officers seized 269 grams of cocaine which was hidden underneath a sink.

Officers then attended Zaman's home address at St Catherine's Court, Aylesbury, where he was arrested while trying to escape out of a back window.

At this address, more than Â£14,000 in cash was seized from one of the bedrooms.

Zaman was charged and remanded in custody on 10 December before he admitted the offence this week.

Investigating officer Detective Constable Laurie Twine of the Aylesbury Stronghold team, said: "This conviction is yet another example of how the Stronghold team will tirelessly pursue anybody involved in organised crime.

"This sentence should serve as a warning to those who mistakenly believe that they are untouchable.

"Zaman will now have a long time in prison to reflect on his decisions.

"Anyone concerned about drug-related crime in their area or think someone may be a victim of drug exploitation, is encouraged to call us on 101, or 999 in an emergency. You can also report online or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
