Following an investigation by Thames Valley Police's Major Crime Unit a man has been charged with one count of murder.

Anil Gill, aged 46, of Beresford Close, Emerson Valley, Milton Keynes has been charged with one count of murder.

The charge relates to an incident in which officers attended a house in Emerson Valley, Milton Keynes on Sunday (31/1) and found a woman in her forties had died.

Formal identification processes are yet to be conducted, but we believe the woman to be 43-year-old Ranjit Gill from Emerson Valley, Milton Keynes.

Her family are being supported by specially trained officers. They have asked for privacy at this difficult time.

Anil Gill will appear at Milton Keynes Magistrate's Court on Tuesday (1/2).
