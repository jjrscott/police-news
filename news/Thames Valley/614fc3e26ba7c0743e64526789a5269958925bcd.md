At around 3.15pm on Monday (7/12) it was reported that a 12-year-old girl was approached by a man who she did not know, while walking in Slough Road.

The man spoke to the girl in a foreign language which she did not understand and touched her shoulder. She was able to walk away and go towards a car, which was waiting for her. She was not injured.

Following an appeal to identify the man involved, officers have spoken to him and confirmed he had mistaken the identity of the child, however was unable to speak English to explain.

Detective Inspector Arshad Mohmood, leading the investigation, said: "We are pleased we have been able to identify the man involved and establish why he approached the girl as I understand the concern this incident caused the girl, her family and the local community.

"I would like to thank the community and nearby Churchmead School for their understanding and assistance while we carried out our enquiries in the local area."
