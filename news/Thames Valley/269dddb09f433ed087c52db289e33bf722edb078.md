Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following a road traffic collision in Stone, near Aylesbury, which has left an 18-year-old man with serious injuries.

At approximately 9.30pm yesterday (21/12), a silver Volkswagen Golf was travelling towards Aylesbury through Stone when it left the carriageway on the near side, mounted the pavement and collided with a bus stop.

There was nobody at the bus stop at the time.

The driver of the vehicle suffered serious injuries and was taken to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, where he remains in a serious condition.

Investigating officer Sergeant Linford Baxter of the Joint Operations Roads Policing Unit based at Milton Keynes, said: "I am appealing to anybody who was in the area last night and witnessed this collision to please get in touch with police.

"I would particularly ask for anybody who has dash-cam installed in their vehicles to please check this and contact us if it has captured anything that can assist the investigation.

"You can get in touch by making a report online, or by calling the 24-hour non-emergency number 101, quoting reference number 43200434833."
