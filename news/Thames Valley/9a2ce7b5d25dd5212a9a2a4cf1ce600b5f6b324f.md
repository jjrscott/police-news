A further Section 60 order has been authorised in Reading.

Following a number of Section 60 orders that have been in place this week, a further order has been authorised for Reading this afternoon.

It will be in place between 4pm today (22/1) and 9am tomorrow (23/1), covering the areas as defined by the map, including Oxford Road, Tilehurst Road, Bath Road, the A3290 boundary to the A3290 London Road roundabout, across the River Thames into Lower Caversham and the Thames and Kennet Marina.

Other roads include Northumberland Avenue, Elgar Road, Church Road through to the A3290 boundary and the Caversham Bridge.

During the previous order that was in place, 32 stops were carried out. No arrests were made, however a quantity of cannabis was seized during one stop.

Superintendent Nick John, Reading LPA Commander, said: "Over the past week we have authorised a number of Section 60 orders to ensure we are doing all we can to keep our communities safe.

"Another order has been authorised today and I recognise that this may leave some in our community feeling concerned.

"The decision to authorise these orders is not taken lightly and they are used alongside a number of other visible tactics such as CCTV, and proactive intelligence-led patrols. There are also many security measures that you cannot see.

"In addition, we are being supported by officers from Thames Valley's Violence Reduction Unit who are helping us to better understand the causes of knife crime.

"It is important that you - the public - helps us in our fight against serious violence and knife crime. By reporting information to us, you could help save a life.

"You can make a report by going to our website or calling our non-emergency number 101, or by contacting Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
