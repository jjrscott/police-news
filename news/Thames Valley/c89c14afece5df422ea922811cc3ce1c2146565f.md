Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following an incident of violent disorder and assault in Small Dean, Wendover on Friday (26/3).

At approximately 8.30pm on Friday, there was a violent disorder where around 30 people attacked personnel from the HS2 construction site, injuring nine members of security staff and damaging property.

Much of the incident occurred on the A413 with passing traffic narrowly missing people on the road.

A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said: "This was an unacceptable outbreak of violent disorder where a number of people were attacked in what appears to have been a pre-meditated and orchestrated incident.

"This incident took place in close proximity to the A413, and although thankfully no one was seriously hurt, this was a serious incident.

"We are appealing to anybody who was driving in the area at around the time and who has dash-cam in their vehicles to please check this and contact the police if it has captured anything that could assist this investigation.

"You can call 101, quoting incident reference 2343 of 26 March or make a report online.

"You can also report 100% anonymously via the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
