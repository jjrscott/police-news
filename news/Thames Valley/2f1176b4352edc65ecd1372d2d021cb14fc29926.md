Thames Valley Police's Major Crime Unit have launched a murder investigation in Lower Earley.

At around 7.40pm last night (31/3) officers were called to an incident outside the BP petrol station in Chalfont Way, Lower Earley, Reading.

The victim, a 51-year-old man, was taken to hospital for treatment but he has since sadly died.

His next of kin have been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers.

A 25-year-old man from Wokingham and a 42-year-old man from Reading have been arrested on suspicion of section 18 grievous bodily harm and murder. Both men are currently in police custody.

Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Inspector Dejan Avramovic, of the Major Crime Unit, said: "We have now launched a murder investigation, following this incident and our thoughts are with the victim's family at this time.

"A scene watch remains in place in the area, and the Chalfont Square shopping precinct remains closed.

"Disruption to traffic is likely to continue with Chalfont Way remaining closed while officers conduct our investigation.

"I would like to again appeal to anyone who may have information about this incident to please contact us on 101, or by making a report online, quoting reference 43210136391.

"Alternatively, if you wish to remain anonymous, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
