Thames Valley Police is appealing for a specific witness to come forward in relation to an ongoing murder investigation in Reading.

At around 12.55am on Sunday, 14 February, officers were called to Managua Close in Caversham where a man, Yannick Cupido, aged 24, had suffered stab wounds.

Sadly, he was pronounced dead at the scene.

A 28-year-old man has been charged with murder in connection with the incident. A second man, aged 22, has been arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice and released under investigation.

Senior investigating officer, Detective Inspector Mike Roddy, of the Thames Valley Police Major Crime Unit, said: "Officers are continuing to investigate this incident, and we are keen to speak to a taxi driver who we believe collected two black men in dark clothing from the vicinity of Reading railway station before travelling to Amersham Road, Caversham.

"This would have occurred between 8.30am and 10.30am on 14 February.

"If this was you, or if you believe you know who it could be, please contact Thames Valley Police on 101, quoting reference number 43210062322, or make a report online.

"Alternatively, you can call the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their website."
