Thames Valley Police is appealing for the public's help in tracing a 16-year-old girl who is missing from Milton Keynes.

Chelsea Reed, aged 16, was last seen at her home in Milton Keynes just before 1pm on New Years' Day.

Chelsea is a white girl, approximately 5ft 3ins tall with a slim build and black hair in a bun with a clip in ponytail.

She was last seen wearing a black North Face jacket, black tracksuit bottoms and black Ugg boots.

Chelsea is also known to frequent High Wycombe, the Tottenham, Harrow and Upton Park areas of London and the Piccadilly Gardens and Barrington Street areas of Manchester.

Detective Inspector Jason Simpson, based at Milton Keynes police station, said: "I am appealing to the public for any information that can help to locate Chelsea.

"It is not known whether she has any access to money, and we are growing increasingly concerned for her welfare, as she has not been seen now for three days.

"If anybody knows of Chelsea's whereabouts, please contact the 24-hour number 101, quoting reference number 43210000830.

"Chelsea, if you see this message, please get in touch with us. We are concerned for you and want to ensure that you are safe and well."
