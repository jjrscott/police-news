A man from Oxford has been given an anti-social behaviour civil injunction in connection with number of incidents of anti-social behaviour.

Brian Ramsay, aged 19 of no fixed abode, was given the injunction at Oxford County Court on 3 December and it is due to be in place until May 2021.

The injunction has been granted under the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 and Ramsay is prohibited from engaging in threatening, aggressive, coercive or intimidating behaviour towards any person.

Ramsay is also excluded from the areas of Witney and Carterton and below is a map defining the area he is not allowed to frequent.

PC Charlotte Loten of the Witney Problem Solving Team, said:"Ramsay's behaviour has been causing significant demand on Police and other agencies and this injunction is a good result to help tackle anti-social behaviour in the area.

"I hope this sends a message to others who think they can cause disruption and misery to people going about their day to day business, that such behaviour will not be tolerated."
