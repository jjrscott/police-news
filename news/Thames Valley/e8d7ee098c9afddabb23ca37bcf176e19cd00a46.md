Thames Valley Police is releasing a CCTV image of a woman officers would like to speak to following a theft in Bletchley.

At around midday on Tuesday 24 November, the victim, a woman in her seventies, was shopping at Poundstretcher on Queensway when her purse was taken from her bag.

A large amount of cash was stolen, and her bank card was later used in an attempt to withdraw cash from an ATM but was declined.

Police believe the woman in this image may have vital information that could help with their investigation.

Investigating officer PC Stuart Folwell, based at Milton Keynes police station said: "I am appealing for any witnesses of this incident, or anyone who recognises this woman, or if you believe it could be you, to please get in touch.

"You can make a report online or by calling 101 and quoting reference 43200392051.

"Alternatively, if you wish to remain 100% anonymous you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
