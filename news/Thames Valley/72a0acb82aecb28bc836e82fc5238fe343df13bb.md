Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Fishermead.

At around 7pm on Tuesday (15/12) a man was unloading items from a van in Pencarrow Place when he noticed a man on the opposite side of the road stop and look at him.

This man then crossed the road and told the victim that he should hand over his money. The victim refused and the man punched him twice to his face and his neck.

He then took a black bag containing cash and medication from around the victim's waist and ran off in the direction of Evergreen Foods.

The victim did not require hospital treatment.

The offender is described as a young white man, approximately 6ft tall and of a big build. He was wearing a dark coloured jacket and a mask.

Investigating officer Detective Constable Sebastian Kuzoe, based at Milton Keynes police station, said: "I am appealing to anyone who has any information about this incident to come forward.

"I believe the area was busy at the time this robbery occurred so if you saw or heard anything that seemed unusual then please get in touch.

"You can contact us using our online form or by calling 101, quoting reference number 43200425923. Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously via their website or on 0800 555 111."
