Thames Valley Police is releasing CCTV footage in a renewed appeal for witnesses following a robbery in Oxley Park.

At around 11.30pm on Monday 22 February, three men were in a parked car in a residential car park by Harlow Crescent and Crawford Way when they were approached by three men.

The men outside the car started shouting at the victims and opened the car doors. They demanded items to be handed over and searched the car, taking cash from within, then ran off towards Harlow Crescent and Crawford Way.

Following the incident, one of the victims found that he had sustained a stab wound to his leg. He received treatment at Milton Keynes University Hospital and has since been discharged.

Two of the offenders are believed to have been carrying knives.

Detective Sergeant Gemma Robinson, based at Milton Keynes police station, said: "I am releasing this CCTV footage in the hope that someone recognises one or all three of these men. It is likely that these individuals have information that could prove vital to this investigation so I urge anyone who recognises them to come forward.

"You can contact us using our online form or by calling 101, quoting reference number 4321005747. Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their website."
