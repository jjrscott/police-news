A Section 60 stop and search order that was enacted in Slough on Wednesday (21/10) has now been lifted.

It was put in place after a 17-year-old boy was stabbed in Station Road at around 3.30pm that afternoon.

The order was enacted from 6.20pm on Wednesday (21/10) and ceased at 10am today (23/10).

It covered the Langley area of Slough.

Following this, a dispersal order has now been authorised and is in place between 1pm and 7pm today (23/10) covering the area of Langley, Slough as defined by the map.

Local Policing Area Commander for Slough, Superintendent Gavin Wong, said: "We have now taken the decision to lift this Section 60 order, but this will be replaced with a dispersal order which allows police to direct people to leave the area if they suspect it is necessary to reduce the likelihood of crime or disorder.

"There will continue to be an increased police presence in the area which I hope will reassure the local community.

"Although the Section 60 has now ceased, police officers will still be able to apply their ordinary stop and search powers, requiring police officers to have reasonable grounds to carry out a search where they think someone may be in possession of a weapon, controlled drugs or a tool that could be used to commit crime.

"I would like to offer my thanks the local community that were affected by this order and assure them that we will continue to listen to local concerns and act accordingly to keep our communities safe."
