A Section 60 order that was put in place in Langley has now ended.

The order temporarily allows police officers greater powers to stop and search in a defined location when it is believed there is a likelihood that serious violence will take place.

It was put in place following a number of incident throughout the week. Officers have found people in possession of weapons.

It was in place from 4pm yesterday (12/2) and the decision has been taken it will not be extended.

Superintendent Amy Clements, said: "The Section 60 order that has been in place yesterday has now been lifted.

"Thank you to the local community for their co-operation whilst this was in place.

"Although this order has now been lifted, anybody who feels that they can carry weapons should hear this warning, our officers will still be able to apply their ordinary stop and search powers.

"If anyone has any information about anyone who carries a weapon, I would urge you to report it to police by calling 101 or making a report online.

"Alternatively you can also report 100% anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or online."
