A man has pleaded guilty to attempted burglary following an investigation by Thames Valley Police.

Kevin O'Keefe, aged 38, of High Street, Slough, appeared at Reading Magistrates' Court today (10/2) where he pleaded guilty to attempted burglary with intent.

He was remanded in custody to be sentenced on a date to be confirmed.

O'Keefe was arrested after he was seen forcing open the front door of a residential property on Aldin Avenue North in Slough at around 2.30am on Sunday (7/2).

He was approached by members of the public and attempted to flee the scene, but was detained by them until police arrived.

He was arrested and found to be in possession of a tool used to force entry to the address.

Investigating Officer Detective Constable Wayne Plowright, based at Slough Police Station, said: "O'Keefe clearly set out that night intending to steal and it is only thanks to the vigilant members of the public that he was not able to do so.

"We will not tolerate this kind of behaviour in our communities and we are pleased O'Keefe is now in custody and unable to cause any further harm."
