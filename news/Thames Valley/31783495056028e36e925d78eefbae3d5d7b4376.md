Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following a robbery which occurred in Langley.

The incident happened on Thursday (11/3) at the Langley Memorial Ground in Langley Road at about 5.15pm.

The victim, a 17-year-old boy, was with his friends by the benches close to the play park when he was approached by a group of boys.

They exchanged words and one of the group produced a weapon which may have been a knife.

The group then stole the victim's bag, jacket and phone before leaving in the direction of Meadfield Road, down an alley near to the Choice chicken shop.

The victim was not injured during this incident.

Investigator Daniel Fallis, based at Slough police station, said: "I would like to appeal to anyone who saw this robbery, or who has any information relating to it, to get in touch.

"If you have any information which you think could help our investigation, please call the Thames Valley Police non-emergency number on 101, quoting reference number 43210102555."
