Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses following an incident of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in Witney.

At 5.30pm on Tuesday (22/12) the victim, a 54-year-old woman, was walking in New Bridge Street when she noticed she was being followed by a man.

The victim started to run through New Bridge Street where the man caught up with her. He punched the victim to her face and then used an implement to cut her face. He then ran away.

Nothing was stolen in the incident.

The victim sustained a swollen eye and superficial slash marks to her cheeks, which did not require hospital treatment.

The offender is described as being approximately 6ft tall, wearing all dark clothing and had an Eastern European accent.

Investigating officer PC Nick Manifold, of the Incident and Crime Response team based at Witney police station, said: "I would like to speak to anyone who witnessed this incident or who has any CCTV or details which could assist officers.

"The victim was understandably left feeling frightened after being chased and assaulted in such a way. The motive is currently unknown. If you have any information please speak to police."

Anyone with any information should contact the 24-hour non-emergency number 101 quoting the reference 43200436013 or make a report online.

Alternatively, you can call the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
