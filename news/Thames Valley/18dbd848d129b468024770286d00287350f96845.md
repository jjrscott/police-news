Chief Inspector Joanne Hutchings is appointed as the new Deputy Commander for the Cherwell & West Oxfordshire Local Policing Area (LPA).

Today (4/1) Chief Inspector Joanne Hutchings starts her new role taking over from Chief Inspector John Batty.

C/Insp Hutchings moves to her new role following her time as Detective Chief Inspector of Central Intelligence and Specialist Intelligence Support. Prior to that, she spent the last three years as an Intelligence Manager helping the force tackle organised crime groups, modern slavery, rural crime and cross-border criminality. She also led the intelligence activity for a number of high profile policing operations such as two Royal Weddings and the force's continued pursuance of county drug lines.

C/Insp Hutchings joined Thames Valley Police in 2003 where she started her career in Oxford as a response officer and spent several years in a variety of different detective and neighbourhood policing roles.

On her new appointment, Chief Inspector Hutchings said: "I am really excited to start my role in Cherwell & West Oxfordshire and know that I am in good hands joining a team of extremely enthusiastic and hardworking officers and staff.

"I believe that working in partnership is at the heart of everything we do and I am keen to further develop our relationships with partners and to work alongside organisations, local businesses and the public to ensure that our communities remain a safe and enjoyable place to live and work."
