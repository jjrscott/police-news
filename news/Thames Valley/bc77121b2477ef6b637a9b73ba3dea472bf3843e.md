A Section 60 order that was put in place in Reading has now ceased.

The order temporarily allowed officers greater powers to stop and search members of the public, and was implemented following a number of violent incidents in the town.

As a result of the order, a number of weapons and drugs have been seized.

The order was ended at 9pm today.

Superintendent Nick John, local area commander for Reading, said: "I would like to thank everyone for their understanding while this order has been in place.

"It has been extremely beneficial to us in keeping the public safe following the recent incidents in the town.

"Although this order has now been lifted, anybody who feels that they can carry weapons should be aware that our officers will still be applying their ordinary stop and search powers.

"People should never be carrying weapons, and we will always look to disrupt this activity.

"If anyone has any information about anyone who may be carrying a weapon, I would urge you to report it to police by calling 101 or making a report online.

"Alternatively you can also report 100% anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or online."
