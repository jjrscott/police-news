The family of a man who died following a fatal road traffic collision in Sonning have released a tribute.

The incident occurred at around 7.50am on Wednesday (10/6) following a collision between a car and a cyclist in Thames Street, Sonning.

Huw Jones, who was 42-years-old, from Wokingham, sadly died.

His wife, Julia, said: "Our hearts are broken by the loss of Huw.

"He was a wonderful husband to me and devoted father to Zoe (aged 6) and Ben (aged 4).

"Huw loved his family more than anything. He was very popular in the neighbourhood and much loved by his friends there, and from university, work and school back in Cardiff.

"Huw had been a keen cyclist since childhood and he will be terribly missed by us all."
