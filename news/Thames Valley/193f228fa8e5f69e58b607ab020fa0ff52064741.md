Thames Valley Police is appealing for information following a burglary in Winnersh.

Between 7.15pm and 8.30pm on Saturday (6/3), offenders broke into a property in Reading Road via a back bedroom window and conducted a messy search.

Approximately Â£40,000 worth of gold wedding jewellery was stolen in the burglary.

The victims, a man and woman both aged in their thirties, were not injured in the incident.

Investigating officer PC Victoria McNicholas, based at Loddon Valley police station, said: "I am appealing to anybody who was in the area of Reading Road in Winnersh on Saturday between 7.15pm and 8.30pm and think that they have witnessed any suspicious activity to please get in touch with police.

"I would appeal also to anybody who has dash-cam, CCTV or doorbell footage to please check this and contact the force if it has captured anything that may assist this investigation.

"If you have been offered any gold jewellery in the last couple of days and are suspicious as to where this has come from, I would also ask you to get in touch.

"You can do so by calling 101, quoting reference number 43210094624, or make a report online.

"You can also call the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111."
