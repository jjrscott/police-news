Following a Thames Valley Police investigation a man has been jailed for a total of 14 years after he was convicted of a number of serious sex offences, including rape.

Phillip Lewis, aged 41, of The Cullerns, Highworth, Swindon, was found guilty by unanimous jury verdict of one count of rape of a child, three counts of sexual assault of a child, one count of assaulting a child by penetration and one count of engaging in a sexual activity in the presence of a child in a trial at Oxford Crown Court, which concluded on 11 October.

The offences all occurred during the 2010s when Lewis groomed his victim and sexually abused her over a number of years in West Oxfordshire.

Returning to Oxford Crown Court for sentencing on Thursday (19/11), Lewis was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment and also ordered to sign the sex offenders' register indefinitely.

Investigating officer Detective Constable Phillipa Metcalfe, of the Child Abuse Investigation Unit, based at Banbury, said: "The nature of Lewis's offending was horrendous, and the victim has shown tremendous bravery and resilience in coming forward and reporting this.

"Lewis will now serve a lengthy prison sentence as a result, and I would encourage anybody who has been a victim of offence sexual offence to please come forward and report it to the police.

"You will be listened to and will be supported by experienced officers and staff."
