Thames Valley Police has arrested 20 people as part of an operation targeting knife crime and violent offences in Oxford City.

The operation took place across the city from Thursday 21 to Sunday 31 January, specifically targeting locations that have seen violent incidents in the last 12 months.

Officers from across Oxford conducted a series of activities to reduce violence, weapon carrying and combat drug dealing in the area, including visible and covert patrols to disrupt those choosing to carry knives and to build intelligence to support future activity.

During the operation, 44 stop and searches were carried out and 15 weapons were seized.

Twenty people were arrested for offences including drug and knife possession.

Additionally, a number of fines were issued to individuals breaching COVID regulations.

PC Leigh O'Sullivan, the officer in charge of the operation said: "This operation was very successful with ten days of activity leading to a number of arrests and the seizure of many dangerous weapons off our streets.

"In Oxford we are committed to tackling criminal activity in relation to knife crime and violent offences. These types of crime cause serious harm and have long lasting impacts on the community and we want to reiterate that it simply will not be tolerated in Oxford.

"We continue to work with the public and partners in order to protect our communities and make them safer."
