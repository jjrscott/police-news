Thames Valley Police is appealing for information relating to an ongoing harassment investigation.

Over the past year, officers have been investigating after the victim, a 76-year-old woman who lives in Farmoor, Oxfordshire, has received a series of anonymous cards through the post, harassing her.

Investigating officer, PC Ian Dring, based at Abingdon police station, said: "This ongoing harassment is causing great distress to the victim.

"We believe that all the cards are being sent by the same person, as the hand writing on all of them appears to be the same.

"I would like to speak to anyone who recognises the hand writing in the cards pictured, so that we can identify who is responsible for this harassment.

"If you can help, or if you have any other information which you think could be relevant, please call the Thames Valley Police non-emergency number on 101, quoting reference number 43200065069.

"Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, or make a report online."
