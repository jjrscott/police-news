A man has appeared in court charged over an alleged robbery in Newark.

Officers were called to an incident at the Co-op store in Beacon Hill Road shortly after 6pm on Sunday (6 December 2020).

It's alleged that a man threatened a staff member with a bottle of spirits before stealing items and making off on foot.

A suspect was quickly arrested by officers who were allegedly assaulted as they were detaining him.

Christopher Storton, 39, of no fixed address, appeared at Nottingham Magistrates' Court yesterday (Tuesday 8 December) charged with robbery, criminal damage and two counts of assaulting an emergency worker.

He was remanded in custody and is next due to appear at Nottingham Crown Court on 12 January 2021.

Sergeant Lee Mulligan, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: â€œAs a force we take robbery extremely seriously and will thoroughly investigate reports made to us.

"Our police officers find themselves dealing with situations on a daily basis to safeguard and protect the people and communities we serve. They are trained to a high level to deal with violent and confrontational situations, however being assaulted is not simply part of the job and it cannot be tolerated."
