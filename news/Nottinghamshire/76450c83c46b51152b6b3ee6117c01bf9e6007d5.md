Three people were arrested after a car sped away from police.

Officers spotted the car travelling northbound on the A611 through Annesley shortly before 12.45am this morning (Tuesday) and turned to pull it over for having no insurance.

However, on seeing the police car the vehicle sped away towards Kirkby-in-Ashfield. When officers caught up with it they found it parked in Marshall Avenue with nobody in the driving seat.

Two men, aged 48 and 34, were arrested on suspicion of driving with no licence and no insurance. The 48-year-old was also detained on suspicion of driving without due care and attention, drink driving and failing to provide a specimen of breath.

A 47-year-old woman was also arrested on suspicion of breaching Coronavirus self-isolation rules.

All three remain in police custody.

Sergeant Lee Mulligan, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Drink driving and other traffic offences put the lives of all road users at risk and will never be tolerated by Nottinghamshire Police.

“The consequences for those who break the law can be massive and life-changing in terms of the loss of their job, relationship and freedom to drive.

"However the most costly of consequences are for those who find themselves mixed up in drink or drug drive incidents where a loved one is lost.”
