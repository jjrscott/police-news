A man has been charged after a man was reportedly hit with an iron bar and hospitalised.

Jamie Frost, 40, of Fackley Road in Sutton-in-Ashfield has been charged with grievous bodily harm and will appear at court today (30 March 2021).

The victim was struck to the head, face, back and arms and he remains in hospital. His injuries have been described as life altering, but not life threatening.

Detective Inspector Stuart Temple is leading the investigation. He said: "We take incidents of violence such as this very seriously.

"Nottinghamshire Police officers were called at around 1am yesterday morning (29 March 2021) to High Street in Stanton Hill following a report of an assault.

"We know that incidents of this nature will be a cause of real concern for many people living nearby but I would like to reassure the community that our officers have responded quickly, which has made this arrest and now charge possible.

"We believe this is an isolated incident with no danger to the rest of the community."
