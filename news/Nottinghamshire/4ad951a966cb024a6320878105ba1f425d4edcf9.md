A boy is due to appear at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court today charged in connection with a report of a fight in Forest Fields.

The 16-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is charged with possession of an offensive weapon and affray in connection with the incident, that happened in Beech Avenue at around 5.50pm on Saturday 9 January 2021.

The charges relate to an incident where a victim required surgery after suffering a single stab wound to their stomach. They are on their way to making a recovery.

It comes as Reuben Deslandes, 18, of Welbeck Street in Sutton-in-Ashfield and two 17-year-old boys, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were charged in connection with the incident in January. They are next due to appear at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court on 9 March 2021.

The boy due to appear today has been remanded ahead of his court appearance.

Detective Sergeant Louise Bradford, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Violent crime has no place on our streets and we will always thoroughly investigate any reports made to Nottinghamshire Police.

"While we are making progress in this investigation, we still want to hear from anyone who was in the area around the time and saw this incident, or the events surrounding it.

"Any information you have, no matter how insignificant you think it may be, could go a long way to help us piece together what happened.”

Anyone with any information is asked to call Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 502 of 9 January 2021, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
