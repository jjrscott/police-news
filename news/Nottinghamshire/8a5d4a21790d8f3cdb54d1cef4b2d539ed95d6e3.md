A man has been arrested on suspicion of burglary after items were stolen from a student property.

The incident happened at an address in Hockley on the afternoon of Monday 14 September, when somebody climbed through an open window before stealing a bank card, a wallet and a pair of trainers.

A 48-year-old man was arrested by officers in Warwickshire yesterday and is now in Nottinghamshire Police Custody.

PC Tim Townsend of the Nottingham City burglary team, said: “Burglaries like these can have a lasting impact on victims who no longer feel safe and secure in their own homes. We will always investigate every report we receive with the same dedication and determination in order to get justice for victims.”
