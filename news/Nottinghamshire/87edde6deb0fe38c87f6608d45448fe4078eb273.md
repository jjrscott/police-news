Nottinghamshire Police will be showcasing the stories of successful apprentices and hosting an Instagram takeover and webinar to celebrate National Apprenticeship Week.

Starting today, the week is a chance to showcase some of the incredible opportunities on offer within the force, as well as celebrating the successes of those currently working for the force.

Expect to see interviews with two of Nottinghamshire Police’s superstars who are either currently undertaking their apprenticeship or have completed their qualification and are now in full time employment.

Alongside this, the force’s Instagram will be hosting an Instagram takeover to give an insight into what it’s like to be an apprentice in the force on a day-to-day basis.

There will also be a recorded version on a webinar hosted by Apprentice Officer Ron Lawrence, which will cover the Police Constable Degree Apprenticeship route into policing as well as other opportunities at Nottinghamshire Police.

Apprentice officer Ron Lawrence said: “I’m delighted that our partnership work with West Nottinghamshire College has put the force in a position to offer so many fantastic opportunities across the force.

“While next is a great celebration of the ongoing work we do, it really is just a snapshot of what it available and I’d encourage anyone who has any questions to engage with the content we release.

“We have had so many success stories as a result of the schemes we offer and I hope that people enjoy what we share."
