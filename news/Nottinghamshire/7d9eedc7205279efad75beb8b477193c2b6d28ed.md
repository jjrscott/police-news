Police would like to speak to the women pictured in this CCTV image in relation to a number of shoplifting offences.

The image was recoded on 12 December at the Victoria Retail Park in Netherfield, where items worth around £340 were stolen from several shops.

Two female suspects were challenged in Morrison’s Supermarket but fled before they could be detained.

"We have been working directly with the affected stores to investigate these matters and would now like to call on the public to help us identify the women shown in these images.

“We believe they may be able to help us with our investigation and would urge them to contact us directly.”

If you have any information about this case please call police on 101 quoting incident 609 of 12 December. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
