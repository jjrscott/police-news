Police are seeking the public's help after a man was stabbed in the thigh during a robbery in Clifton.

The 20-year-old victim was in his car when he was approached by two men wearing face coverings who opened his driver and passenger doors.

One of the men then punched the victim in his eye and stabbed him in the leg before they stole a small quantity of cash from inside the car.

The robbery happened at around 1am today (Saturday 30 January 2021) in Gabor Close.

The victim was taken to hospital to be treated for non-life-threatening injuries and he remains in hospital.

One of the offenders is mixed race, 6ft tall and of slim build and the other is white.

Detective Sergeant Louise Bradford, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "We are working hard to establish the full circumstances of this incident and checking CCTV footage as part of our ongoing enquiries.

"Nottinghamshire Police takes all reports of robbery and knife-related offences extremely seriously and we are determined to trace the suspects responsible for this attack which we believe is an isolated incident with no wider risk to the public.

"While our investigation is progressing I'd urge anyone who witnessed this incident or who saw any suspicious activity in the area around this time, anyone who may have CCTV footage or any drivers who may have captured dashcam footage to please get in contact with us by calling Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 48 of 30 January 2021, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
