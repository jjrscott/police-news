Police have made another arrest overnight after a man was found with stab wounds and a boy was found with suspected broken bones.

Officers were initially called to Cowley Street, Basford, at around 3.45pm yesterday (Wednesday 17 February 2021). When officers arrived, they came across a 16-year-old who had a number of injuries, including a suspected broken collar bone. He was taken to King’s Mill Hospital in Sutton-in-Ashfield for treatment.

Shortly after this, just before 3.55pm, officers received reports of a man with suspected stab wounds in Bar Lane, Basford. A 20-year-old man was taken to the Queen's Medical Centre and is due to undergo surgery for his injuries, which are not thought to be life-threatening or life-altering.

A 22-year-old man has been arrested overnight after two men, both aged 20, and a boy, aged 16, had already been arrested on suspicion of affray and grevious bodily harm yesterday.

Detective Sergeant Nick Wood, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "Officers have made another arrest overnight and continue their hard work to establish the circumstances of what happened.

“Our enquiries are ongoing but we believe this was an isolated incident that poses no threat to the wider public.

“We do, however, understand that incidents of this nature cause a lot of concern and we are dedicated in our approach to tackling and investigating reports of knife crime. There will be an increased police presence in the area to provide reassurance and to address any concerns the public have.

“We would urge anyone who was in the area around the time, or any drivers who may have captured dash-cam footage of the incident to please get in contact with us as soon as possible as this information could be vital. ”

Anyone with any information is asked to call Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 442 of 17 February 2021, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
