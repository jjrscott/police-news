Two men was rushed to hospital following a knife incident, causing injuries to their wrist and stomach at a home in Rainworth last night.

Officers were called to Station Road at around 10.30pm following a report of the knife incident, which saw one man suffering hand injuries, whilst another has suffered injured to his stomach.

A 33-year-old man was quickly detained and arrested for two counts of grievous bodily harm. He remains in police custody.

Detective Constable Helen Guttridge of Nottinghamshire Police is leading the investigation. She said: “Knife crime has a devastating impact on our communities and as a force we take all reports of incidents involving knives very seriously.

“Our officers did a fantastic job to arrest a man in connection with the report so quickly last night and we are now working to establish the circumstances of the incident.

“Luckily, both victim's injuries are not life-threatening or life-altering.

“We do believe that this was an isolated incident where the victim and suspect are known to one another. There is not thought to be any further risk to the public."
