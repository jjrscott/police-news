Detectives have launched an investigation after a teenager was taken to hospital with injuries to his stomach and arm.

Officers from Nottinghamshire Police were called to Hardstaff Road in Sneinton at around 9.45pm on Thursday evening (17 December 2020) following a report of an assault to a 17-year-old boy.

Officers were quickly on the scene and have closed the road as part of their investigation.

The 17-year-old boy was taken to Queen's Medical Centre for treatment. His injuries have been described as not life-threatening or life-altering.

Detective Inspector Craig Hall said: “This is still very early in our investigation and there is a scene in place as we try to establish the circumstances surrounding what has happened.

“It appears the victim has suffered stab wound type injuries but our enquiries are ongoing to uncover whether a weapon was involved.

"All violent incidents are taken extremely seriously and we will investigate the matter thoroughly to identify the culprits as soon as possible.

"Anyone who has any information that could help, is asked to call Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 701 of 17 December 2020.
