Nottinghamshire Police detectives are appealing for witnesses, including a man driving a white car, following a reported assault.

It was reported that a woman suffered a hand injury, which is not believed to be life altering and also had her handbag and coat ripped open in the early hours of 14 March 2021 in Unwin Road in Sutton-in-Ashfield.

Detective Constable Paul Crofts is leading the investigation. He said: "We are appealing to anyone who saw anything or anyone suspicious in the area between midnight and 2am on Sunday (14 March 2021).

"Thankfully the victim's injuries aren't believed to be life threatening. We believe this is an isolated incident with no danger to the rest of the community.

"The incident occurred close to the top of Unwin Road and the junction with the Mansfield Road.

"We believe a man in a white car may have driven past the incident, so we are appealing if that was you and you have any information then please get in touch to help with our investigations.

"We are also urging people to check their dash cam footage from that night too.

"If you can help please call 101, quoting incident number 488 of 24 March 2021."
