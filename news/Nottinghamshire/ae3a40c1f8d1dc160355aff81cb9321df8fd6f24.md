Police are appealing for the public's help as a multi-agency search operation continues after a report that a person had gone into the River Trent in Nottingham.

Officers from Nottinghamshire Police and Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service (NFRS) were called to the site near Trent Bridge in West Bridgford at around 5.15pm yesterday (Friday 8 January) along with crews from the East Midlands Ambulance Service.

Specialist search teams are continuing with their work today and CCTV enquiries are also being carried out as police try to establish the full circumstances.

Inspector Andy Wright, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "So far no-one has been located and our extensive enquiries are ongoing.

"We're urging any drivers who may have been travelling along the A60 London Road (Trent Bridge) at around 5.15pm yesterday who may have captured dashcam footage which could help us with our investigations to please come forward.

"We would also like to hear from any members of the public who may have been walking past at the time and may have seen something. Any information, no matter how small it may seen, could help us with our enquiries.

"If you have any information please call Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 458 of 8 January 2021."
