Police recovered an arsenal of weapons in a house search as part of an investigation into a report of a man being spat at and threatened with a Taser.

A Taser device, throwing stars, a sword, a crossbow, a lock knife and petrol can with a fuse cord were seized after officers searched the property in Beckingham Court, Mansfield, following the incident in the same street at around 10.35am yesterday (Saturday).

A 37-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence in relation to the Taser, as well as common assault.

He remains in police custody and enquiries are ongoing. The victim was not injured.

Detective Sergeant Matt Scott, who is leading the investigation, said: "A large number of weapons were recovered by police as part of enquiries into this incident.

"The two people are known to each other and there is no wider threat to the public from the incident, which came following an argument.

"We are continuing to question a man in connection with the incident and would appeal for anyone who witnessed the incident to contact us on 101, quoting incident number 178 of 13 March 2021."
