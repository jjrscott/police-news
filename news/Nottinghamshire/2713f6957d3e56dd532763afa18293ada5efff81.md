A man was assaulted and robbed moments after withdrawing a large amount of cash.

Police are appealing for witnesses and information after the man was targeted by two men in Plain Street, Hyson Green, at around 11.35am on Friday (12 March).

Shortly before the incident he had withdrawn £300 in cash from the Post Office in Gregory Boulevard.

The victim, a man in his 60s, was headbutted during the incident and also had his phone stolen.

The attacker fled the scene along Hubert Street in the direction of Caulton Street.

DC Laura McCullough, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “This was a frightening and upsetting incident for the victim and were determined to find the people responsible for this attack as quickly as possible.

“Enquiries are ongoing and we are eager to speak to anyone who may have wither seen this incident unfold, or seen two men running from the scene shortly afterwards. If you saw anything at all you then please give us a call on 101 quoting incident 261 of 12 March.”
