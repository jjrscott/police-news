Police working to monitor the behaviour of hundreds of sex offenders are turning to a new high tech solution to keep people safe from harm.

Officers from Nottinghamshire Police’s MOSOVO (Management of Sexual Offenders and Violent Offenders) team are now installing a software app on offenders’ computers, phones and tablets to more effectively monitor their activities.

The MOSOVO team, based in Mansfield and Nottingham, is responsible for the monitoring of some 1,300 individuals across the county – people whose previous offending has made them subject to the Sex Offenders’ Register and / or a specific Sexual Harm Prevention Order (SHPO) that prevents them from doing certain things.

Monitoring officers already have the power to seize and search electronic devices, to visit people’s homes at random and even to demand prior notification when they form new relationships. It is also forbidden for most offenders to operate devices that are not registered with the police.

The new app, funded by a Home Office grant, monitors words, images and behaviours that would constitute a breach of somebody’s SHPO – for example sexualised chat on an internet forum or the consumption of pornography.

Case officers, who started installing the software at the end of January, are notified of prohibited behaviour by officers and can then respond accordingly – potentially bringing a new charge if the breaches are serious enough.

Detective Inspector Luke Waller, of Nottinghamshire Police, leads the MOSOVO team. He explained: “My team are working every day to monitor offenders’ behaviour. By helping my officers to spot breaches as early as possible this software will help us to keep vulnerable people safe from harm.

“By recording activity the software is capable of alerting us to behaviours that we would then need to confront. A good example of how this software works in practice would be a known offender searching the internet for certain types of explicit material, or streaming a video showing the sexual abuse of a child.

“I would like to stress, however, that this technology is not being used instead of more traditional police work like knocking on doors. It is merely an additional tool we are using to keep vulnerable people safe from harm. In practice I believe it will generate considerable extra work for us, but if that work involves keeping vulnerable people safe then I and the rest of my team will be more than happy.”

Nottinghamshire Police has also used additional money form the Home Office’s Advanced on Offender Management (ATOM) fund to employ an additional civilian IT specialist whose job it is to support front-line officers in carrying out more complex investigations into offenders’ internet and computer use.
