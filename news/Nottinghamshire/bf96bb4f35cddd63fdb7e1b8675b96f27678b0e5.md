A stolen sports car was quickly recovered after eagle-eyed officers spotted it outside a shop.

The Mercedes C350 sports car was reported stolen at around 8.50pm last night (Friday 1 January 2020).

Police soon spotted the car parked in Bridgnorth Way in Toton.

Officers boxed the car in to prevent it from being able to drive off and arrested a 17-year-old boy on suspicion of theft and driving without a license in connection with the report.

The car was recovered and the boy remains in custody for questioning.

Superintendent Mat Healy, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Nottinghamshire Police takes theft very seriously and will investigate them thoroughly.

“Our officers did a great job to spot the car and prevent it from being driven away as well as making an arrest in connection with the report.

“An investigation is now underway to establish the circumstances.”

If you are a victim of theft, report it to Nottinghamshire Police on 101 or in an emergency, dial 999.

Over the last month, Nottinghamshire Police has upped enforcement activity targeting drug and drink driving.

Due to ongoing restrictions, it's predicted that more people will be drinking at home this year so there is also a focus on catching drivers who get behind the wheel the morning after despite still being over the limit.

If you suspect someone may be drink or drug driving, please call Nottinghamshire Police on 101. You can also call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
