A 32-year-old man will appear in court having allegedly smashed a kitchen window with a garden ornament and stealing a quantity of tobacco.

The incident was reported to have taken place on the evening of 12 November 2020 when a man tried to enter a property in Institute Street in Sutton-in-Ashfield.

Police investigating the report quickly arrested a man as part of their enquiries.

Christopher Beniston of Welbeck Street in Sutton-in-Ashfield has been charged with burglary.

He has been remanded into custody and is due to appear at Nottingham Magistrates' Court today (2 December 2020).

Detective Sergeant David Prest is leading the investigation. He said: "Burglary is totally unacceptable and as a force we take it incredibly seriously and will investigate all reports thoroughly.

“This incident would have undoubtedly been terrifying for the victim and we are now working hard to establish the circumstances.

“If you are a victim of burglary, please do not hesitate to contact Nottinghamshire Police on 101 or in an emergency, dial 999.”
