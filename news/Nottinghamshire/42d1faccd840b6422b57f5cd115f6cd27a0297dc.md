A trolley full of parcels has been stolen from a flat complex.

Officers from Nottinghamshire Police were called to a building in Talbot Street, Nottingham just before 5.40am on Friday 20 November to a report that a man had barged through the front door into a communal entrance hall before leaving the building with a trolley full of parcels.

Paul Johnson, 51, of Forster Street in Radford, Nottingham, has been charged with burglary and possession of a class B drug following the incident.

Police Constable Imran Ahmed, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Lots of us will be receiving parcels at this time of year, especially as we may be doing more shopping than normal online.

“Opportunist thieves could be on the look-out for parcels to steal, so I’d encourage everyone to be vigilant and to think about where things might be left.

“We will continue to make life as difficult as we can for potential thieves, but there are things that everyone can do to help.

“Look at the delivery options available and try to nominate a safe place or have deliveries arranged for when you’re at home where possible.”

Johnson appeared at Nottingham Magistrates' Court yesterday (3 December).
