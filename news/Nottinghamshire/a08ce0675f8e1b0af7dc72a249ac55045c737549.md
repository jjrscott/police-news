A driver rammed into another car before attacking the other motorist with a hammer during an incident in Hyson Green.

A couple was heading along Alfreton Road in a Ford Focus when Charles Knott drove a Vauxhall Astra into their vehicle multiple times.

After both vehicles had stopped in Radford Road, 33-year-old Knott got out, went over to the Focus and hit the male occupant with a hammer, striking him to various parts of his body.

A car window was also smashed and the Focus’ wing mirror was smashed off with the hammer during the incident which unfolded shortly before 9pm on 13 March 2020.

The man was taken to the Queen’s Medical Centre with head and leg injuries which required stitches.

Following police enquiries Knott, previously of Alwyn Road, Nottingham, was arrested and he subsequently admitted charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, affray, possession of an offensive weapon and dangerous driving.

Appearing at Nottingham Crown Court for sentencing yesterday (Tuesday 22 December 2020) he was jailed for a total of three years and one month.

He was also banned from driving for 22 months and will be subject to a mandatory retest before he can drive again.

Detective Sergeant Simon Carter, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “This was a frightening incident and Knott was clearly determined to cause significant harm.

“I’m pleased that he admitted to the offences and hope that his sentencing shows that we will not tolerate this sort of violence in our communities.”
