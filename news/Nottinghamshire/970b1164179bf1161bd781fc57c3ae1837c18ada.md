A man has been arrested after Nottinghamshire Police received a phone call from a man threatening to blow up Radford Road Police Station.

Officers were contacted at around 5.40pm yesterday. They carried out enquiries and arrested a man on suspicion of malicious communications in Melbourne Road minutes later.

The suspect was also arrested on suspicion of racially aggravated public order after allegedly making racist comments towards the arresting officer.

Sergeant Sharon Powar of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "It's completely unacceptable for police to be threatened and abused unjustly as they go about their daily jobs, and can be quite terrifying for those involved.

"This incident saw some great team working and quick thinking which resulted in a man being quickly arrested.

"He remains in custody while we continue to carry out our enquiries and we work to support the officers who were affected.

"This abhorrent behaviour will not be tolerated in Nottinghamshire."
