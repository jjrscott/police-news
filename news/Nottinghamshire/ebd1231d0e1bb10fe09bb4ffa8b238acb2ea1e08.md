Three store workers have been left shaken after being threatened with a knife after a man stole Â£100 from a shop.

Nottinghamshire Police detectives are now appealing for information and witnesses following the robbery.

Detective Constable Andy Fawcett of Nottinghamshire Police is leading the investigation.

He said: "This must have been a terrifying experience for those who were present last night.

"The incident happened at around 8.50pm at McColl's in Aspley Lane in Beechdale on Monday (21 December 2020).

"It was reported the man walked into a shop demanding money and scratch cards, threatening the store worker with a knife.

"The man has been described as mixed race, 5'7' tall, average build, wearing a black beanie hat, a black waterproof jacket and face mask.

"Our enquiries are ongoing and we're working hard to identify and trace the suspects responsible for this nasty incident. Thankfully no one was injured.

"I would like to hear from anyone locally who may have either seen this incident, anyone who may have CCTV footage which could help the investigation or any drivers who may have dashcam footage of the incident.

"If you were in the area around this time or you live nearby, please check your footage and get in touch if you have anything which may be of interest to us.

"If anyone saw anything please call 101, quoting incident 649 of 21 December 2020."
