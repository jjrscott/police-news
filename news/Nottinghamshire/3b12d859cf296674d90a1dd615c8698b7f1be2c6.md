A man has been charged in connection with a string of shop thefts following some good police teamwork to tackle retail crime in the Gedling south area.

Mark Edwards, 39, of Balmoral Road, Colwick, appeared at Nottingham Magistrates' Court today (Thursday 10 December 2020) facing six charges of shop theft and a charge of common assault. He was bailed to appear at the same court on 25 January 2021.

The charges relate to reported thefts of meat from the Co-op store in Victoria Road, Netherfield, between 12 November and 5 December. It's alleged that a member of staff was also threatened during one of the reported incidents.

Inspector Chris Pearson, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "These charges come on the back of some good proactive work to address shop theft in the Gedling South area in the run up to Christmas.

"We are working together with retailers and Gedling Borough Council to identify offenders and will be carrying out further operations this month. Nottinghamshire Police takes these types of offences seriously and will always strive to put suspects before the courts."
