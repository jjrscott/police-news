The charges relate to an incident in Melbourne Road at around 1am on 3 December 2020 where it was reported a taxi driver was attacked.

Nottinghamshire Police received a report that the driver had been stabbed to his body during a robbery in Melbourne Road just after 1am today (Thursday 3 December 2020). His injuries have been described as minor.

Inspector Simon Riley said: "This was a fantastic piece of policing by a police dog and handler to track down a man and make a swift arrest in connection with a knife-point robbery in Stapleford.

"The victim suffered minor injuries and needed to attend hospital following the reported robbery, during which a quantity of cash was reportedly taken.

"Some massive credit needs to go to the local policing and operational support teams for the successful outcome of this job. It was excellent work overnight to ensure the arrest and charge have now happened.

"I'd also like to reassure local residents that the force takes all reports of knife-related offences extremely seriously.

"We understand that incidents like this can be concerning for communities and if you have any concerns please do not hesitate to speak to one of our local officers in the area."

Gary Pearson has been charged with robbery. GBH, possession of an offensive weapon and criminal damage.

He has been remanded in custody having appeared at Nottingham Magistrates' Court on Friday (4 December 2020). His next court date is 15 January 2021.
