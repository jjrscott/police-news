Two shoplifters from Bestwood who went on a pre-Christmas spree are due to face justice in the New Year.

Michael Delaney, 31, and Toni Curtain, 23, both of Winterton Rise, were arrested thanks to good work by Nottinghamshire Police's City North Neighbourhood Policing Team.

The pair had been identified via CCTV and reports from Co-op stores in Beckhampton Road, Bestwood, and Coppice Road, Arnold, as being responsible for numerous shop thefts between 18 October 2020 and 18 December 2020.

Following their arrests on 27 December 2020 they were interviewed and subsequently charged with 15 and 14 shop thefts respectively.

They were remanded to Nottingham Magistrates’ Court on 28 December where they pled guilty to 26 of the 29 charges. Both admitted 13 charges.

They were both released on conditional bail, including not to associate with each other and not to enter any Co-op store in Nottinghamshire.

They are next due to appear at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court for sentencing on 15 February 2021.

Sergeant Oliver Vale, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "Shoplifting has a significant impact on businesses in our communities, many of which are already struggling due to the impact of Covid-19.

"We have worked with the affected stores to identify the suspects and get a strong evidential package together resulting in the pair pleading guilty to the vast majority of offences.

"While many members of neighbourhood policing team staff from Bestwood and Arnold have been involved in the investigation, I would like to thank PC Chris Armstrong for his tenacity and diligence in collating the offences and the time spent in bringing the pair to justice."
