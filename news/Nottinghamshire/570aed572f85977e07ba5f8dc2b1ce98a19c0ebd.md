Officers have arrested two men after finding drugs and a weapon.

The discovery comes after police attended a property in Graylands Road, Bilborough.

When officers entered the property at around 11.45pm on Monday (22 March 2021) they discovered a large quantity of what is believed to be Class A drugs and also a large knife.

Two men, aged 18 and 21, were arrested on suspicion of possessing an offensive weapon and possession with intent to supply Class A drugs.

Detective Sergeant Nigel Malik, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "We understand the concerns that communities have when it comes to drugs activity and knife crime, and we want to reassure them that we are dedicated to tackling this and all drugs and knife crime offences will be thoroughly investigated.

"Possession of drugs, and weapons, can be associated with wider criminal activity so it is important for us to intercept this at the earliest opportunity.

"We are here to listen to the concerns of the community and act upon information we receive, and we urge anyone with information to get in touch so we can respond as soon as possible.

"Enquiries into this incident are ongoing and any information on this can be reported to us by calling 101, quoting incident 972 of 22 March 2021."
