A man has been charged after police rushed to the scene of a disturbance.

Officers were called to Plantagenet Street, St Ann’s, shortly after 10.45pm on Tuesday when a man was reported to have been threatened with a knife.

After a Taser was drawn a suspect was detained and a knife recovered.

Jason Teer, 46, of Blue Bell Hill Road, Nottingham, has been charged with possessing a bladed article in a public place.

He appeared at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court yesterday and was remanded in custody.

Inspector James Walker, district commander for St Ann’s, said: “Nottinghamshire Police treats knife crime extremely seriously and dedicates considerable time and resources to preventing it and putting suspects before the courts at the earliest opportunity.

“I would also like to thank the officers involved for their profession bringing this incident to safe conclusion.”
