A man has died following a collision in West Stockwith this morning.

Officers from Nottinghamshire Police were called to Heckdyke at around 8.25am this morning (6 March 2021) to a report of a collision between a motorbike and a lorry.

The man was treated for his injuries by paramedics, but passed away at the scene of the incident.

Police Sergeant Iain Blackstock said: “Our investigation into this incident is well underway and we are working to establish the circumstances around how a man came to lose his life.

“Clearly this is a very serious matter and I would encourage anyone who saw what happened and has not yet spoken to the police to come forward. If you were in the area at the time, please check any dashcam footage and help us to find answers for the man’s family.”

A number of roads remain closed in the area, including the Main Street junction to North Carr Road.

If you have information which could help the investigation you should contact Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 149 of 6 March 2021.
