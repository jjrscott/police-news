Two teenagers are due to appear in court charged in connection with an alleged knife-point street robbery in Basford.

A 17-year-old boy, who can't be identified for legal reasons, has been charged with robbery and possession of cannabis and a 16-year-old boy, who also can't be identified, has been charged with robbery.

Both are due to appear at Nottingham Magistrates' Court today (Tuesday 16 February 2021).

The charges relate to a report of a 14-year-old boy being punched in the face and ordered to hand over his phone at knife-point during an alleged incident in Arnold Road, Basford, at around 5.30pm on Sunday (14 February 2021).

Detective Constable Dionne Love, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “A number of officers from different teams have pulled together on this investigation which has now resulted in charges.

“Nottinghamshire Police takes all reports of knife-related and robbery offences extremely seriously and will always strive to bring suspects before the courts."
