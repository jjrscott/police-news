An 65-year-old man had to go to hospital after a masked intruder assaulted him and stole cash from his bungalow.

It was reported the man knocked on the victim's door and when he opened it, he barged his way in to the property.

The man demanded that money was handed over, threatening the victim with a knife, before being punched him to the back of the head.

The victim, who suffered head injuries and cuts to his hands, pulled a lifeline chord which was fitted into the property to call for help.

The man was taken to hospital and treated for injuries and he has since been discharged.

Detectives at Nottinghamshire Police launched an investigation into this incident in Garfield Road in Radford at around 10.30pm on 22 January 2021.

Officers detained a 54-year-old man on Thursday (4 March 2021) afternoon.

Detective Sergeant Nigel Malik is leading the investigation. He said: "This incident would have undoubtedly been terrifying for the victim and we have worked hard to identify who did this.

"Through our enquires we have now arrested a man on suspicion of aggravated burglary. He remains in police custody.

"The force takes reports of burglaries and weapon-related offences extremely seriously. Time may pass but we will find those responsible‚Äù

"Enquiries into the incident are ongoing and I'm pleased that as a result of a lot of hard work we have now been able to arrest a man."
