Intruders have reportedly broken into a man’s home before hitting him on the head with a chair leg.

The man received a cut to the head.

Officers were called to Kelstedge Drive in Mansfield just before 4.50pm yesterday (27 November) to a report that a group of men had broken into a house, attacked the man who lives there and stole his mobile phone.

Three men aged 41, 49 and 51 have been arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary following the incident.

Detective Sergeant Matt Scott, who is investigating the incident, said: “We have all spent lots of time at home this year and that should be a place where we are able to feel safe.

“Nottinghamshire Police takes all reports of burglary seriously and any reports involving violence are something which we work extremely hard to tackle.

“I would urge anyone with information about this incident to come forward and help the investigation.”

Anyone with information should call Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 513 of 27 November 2020.
