A man who crashed into two parked cars and reportedly ran away from police at the scene has been arrested.

Nottinghamshire Police officers were on a proactive patrol in Bulwell when they spotted suspicious activity at around 9.30pm last night (27 March 2021).

The car reportedly drove on the wrong side of the road, driving through red lights and overtaking cars on dangerous bends through the town.

Officers continued to follow the vehicle, who made attempts to evade the marked police car.

The car then crashed into the parked cars, before the driver ran through gardens to try to escape. He was tracked down by a police dog and it's handler.

A 26-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving, driving with no insurance, failing to stop and failing to provide.

Police Sergeant Matthew Dumbrell said: "Officers detained a man following a short pursuit on Bulwell's High Road last night after a report of suspicious activity.

"It was reported that the man crashed into the vehicles on Leonard Street and then tried to leave the scene.

“Officers are now making enquiries into the circumstances of this incident and I’d appeal to anyone who may have seen something suspicious in the Bulwell area last night to get in touch.”

If you witnessed the incident or have any information or footage that could aid officers in their investigation, please do not hesitate to contact Nottinghamshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 821 of 27 March 2021.
