Detectives are investigating after a disused house was believed to have been set on fire in Old Basford.

Officers from Nottinghamshire were called to the Saxondale Drive area at around 3.40pm on Sunday (27 December) together with crews from Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue.

A joint investigation has determined that the blaze was started maliciously.

Detective Sergeant Rick Ellis, said: "We are keen to hear from anyone in the area who might have seen people coming or going from the derelict house in Saxondale Drive or who has seen anything suspicious over the past couple of days.

"Luckily the fire was put out before it had a chance to spread to any of the nearby properties and there were no reported injuries but there could have been much more serious consequences.

"We will continue to investigate the incident robustly and work to bring those behind the offence to justice."

**If you do have any information that could help, please call Nottinghamshire Police on 101 quoting incident 377 of 27 December. You can also call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.**
