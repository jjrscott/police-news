A man has appeared in court having been charged following an investigation where indecent images of children had been accessed online.

Nottinghamshire's paedophile online investigation unit located images on a phone during their enquiries in the Worksop area at around 10.45am on Tuesday (2 February).

Matthew Barber, of Russell Street in Loughborough, was arrested and has subsequently been charged with possession of indecent images of children.

The 27-year-old appeared at Nottingham Magistratesâ€™ Court yesterday and will next appear at Nottingham Crown Court on 18 February.

Detective Inspector Jamie Hill, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "We take reports of indecent images of children extremely seriously and will do everything we can to investigate who might be responsible and seek out any potential victims.

"In this case we were able to safeguard a victim and put measures in place to prevent them coming to any further harm.

"My team's quick thinking and tenacity has resulted in a man being charged.

"We continue to carry out our thorough enquiries as we await further court proceedings.

"If anyone has any information in relation to indecent images or any other child offences, please report it to us so we can put a stop to this abhorrent offence."
