Police in Mansfield continued an ongoing drive to round-up wanted suspects.

Officers from the Operation Reacher Team visited an address in Teal Avenue at around 7.30am on Tuesday looking for a suspect who’d previously failed to appear in court.

A 27-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of harassment and was later arrested on suspicion of failing to appear.

He has been released on police bail with strict conditions.

Sergeant Jay Lee, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “The Reacher team has been tasked with hunting down wanted suspects who’ve failed to appear in court. In the last month we’ve detained around 20 such people and the outstanding list in the Mansfield area is now a pretty short one.

“When people are summonsed to appear in court it isn’t a request – it’s a demand. If people ignore that demand they are displaying a level of contempt for the law that causes further pain for victims and – left unchecked – risks undermining public faith in the justice system.

“That’s why we take this issue so seriously and will continue to hunt down people are wanted by the courts."
