Officers were able to trace a small crane that was reported stolen after an increase in ANPR cameras.

The move is part of the Safer Streets Project in Newark, which is a partnership between the Nottinghamshire Police and Crime Commissioner, Nottinghamshire Police, Newark and Sherwood District Council and Nottinghamshire County Council to improve security in areas particularly affected by acquisitive crimes such as burglary, vehicle theft and robbery.

Nottinghamshire officers were made aware that the van was in the area and after tracking it they stopped it in Stodman Street, where they saw a small crane was being transported.

The crane was discovered to have been reported stolen and three men, aged 18, 28 and 30 were arrested on suspicion of theft. They have been released pending further enquiries.

District Commander for Newark and Sherwood Heather Sutton said: "This project is something we're incredibly pleased to be a part of and this boost in resources is a really positive development for us as police officers and for the communities of Newark.

"Wherever technology, such as ANPR, is available we will of course use it to assist us in serving our communities as effectively and efficiently as possible.

"Officers are dedicated to improving the lives of people in Newark,listening to their concerns and tackling crime in the area, and enquiries are ongoing following this particular vehicle stop."
