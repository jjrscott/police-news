Police investigating the stabbing of a teenage boy have made another arrest.

The 17-year-old boy was attacked at around 4.45pm on Wednesday in St Ann’s Valley, Nottingham.

He suffered a stab wound to the hip but managed to flee the scene on foot.

An 18-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of assault yesterday and has been released on bail.

Another 17-year-old boy was arrested in the early hours of yesterday and has also been released on bail.

Officers believe the attack took place near the junction of Luther Close and are still appealing for witnesses to come forward.

Detective Sergeant Jon Kerry, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “This was a violent and shocking assault committed in broad daylight and we are determined to find everyone who was at the scene.

“So if you saw anything at all either before or after this incident please contact us as soon as possible. You can do that by calling 101 and quoting incident 661 of 17 March, or by calling Crimestoppers anonymously in 0800 555 111.”

Additional police patrols are being held in the area to reassure local residents.
