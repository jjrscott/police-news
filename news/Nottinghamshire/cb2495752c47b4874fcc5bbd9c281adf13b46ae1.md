Nottinghamshire Police is appealing for information after a report of a burglary.

Staff were at the Ana Bedouin restaurant in Hadyn Road in Sherwood, Nottingham, preparing food for a takeaway service. At around 5.30pm on Saturday 5 December a man reportedly entered and stole a handbag.

He was spotted as he was running out of the restaurant.

The bag was later found in a front garden in Hadyn Road, with bank cards, a set of keys and cash missing.

Inspector Kylie Davies, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “It is horrible for anyone to have their personal belongings taken and then discarded in this way.

“Our investigation to find the person responsible is under way and includes looking at relevant CCTV and speaking to people in the area.

“We would like to talk to the man pictured, who we believe may have information about this incident.

“If you recognise the man, please get in touch with us.”

Anyone with information should call Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 525 of 5 December 2020.
