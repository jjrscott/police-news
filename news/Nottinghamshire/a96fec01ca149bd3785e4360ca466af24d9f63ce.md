Nottinghamshire Police made three quick arrests following a delivery driver being threatened with a knife this morning and her van being stolen.

Nottinghamshire Police were called to Renfrew Drive in Wollaton at 7.30am on Saturday following a report of a knife-point robbery.

Nottinghamshire Police were able to locate and arrest a man in Beeston. Further enquiries also led them to making two more arrests in connection with the incident.

Two men aged 19 and 31 were arrested on suspicion of robbery, meanwhile a woman aged 43 was arrested on suspicion of handling stolen goods. They remain in police custody.

Detective Sergeant Jon Kerry of Nottinghamshire Police is leading the investigation. He said: "Delivery drivers work hard to make an honest living and they do not deserve to be left out of pocket by the selfish acts of criminals.

"This must have been a terrifying experience for the delivery driver. Officers were swiftly on the scene following the call and supporting her welfare.

"This was excellent speedy work by local neighbourhood and response officers to locate the people in Beeston and arrest them in connection with the incident, as well as recovering the stolen vehicle.

"Thankfully the victim wasn't hurt in the incident.

"I'd also like to reassure local residents that the force takes all reports of knife-related offences extremely seriously.

"We understand that incidents like this can be concerning for communities and if you have any concerns please do not hesitate to speak to one of our local officers in the area."
