A man has been charged in connection with a burglary at a student property in Nottingham.

The incident happened at an address in Hockley on the afternoon of Monday 14 September.

Entry was gained through an open window before a games console, wallet and pair of trainers were stolen.

Simon Elkington, 48, of Hen Lane Coventry, was detained by officers in Warwickshire on Saturday and has now been charged with one count of burglary and five counts of fraud.

He appeared at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday and was released on conditional bail.

PC Tim Towsnend, of Nottinghamshire Police’s city burglary team, said: “Burglary is an invasive and upsetting crime for victims and we will always investigate every report we receive with the same dedication and professionalism to return property and get justice for victims.”
