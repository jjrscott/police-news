Nottinghamshire Police detectives have begun an investigation following two incidents in Mansfield town centre on Sunday which saw a man being cut with a knife.

Officers were first called to Mansfield bus station at around 12.30pm following a report that a man was approached by a group of three men.

They have threatened him with a weapon, described as a machete.

An hour later a second victim was walking down a path in Quarry Lane in the town when he was struck from behind, which knocked him down the floor.

Three men surrounded him and threatened him. He received a cut to his face and needed hospital treatment.

Detective Sergeant Matt Scott of Nottinghamshire Police is investigating both incidents. He said: "This must have been a terrifying experience for both victims.

"One man suffered facial injuries and had to be treated at hospital.

"We are now appealing to anyone who saw either incident or saw anything suspicious in the area at that time.

"Violence of any kind is completely inexcusable and we take all reports of it seriously.

â€œI would appeal to anyone who may have seen anything suspicious in the area to come forward and help us with our enquiries.

"If you can help please call 101, quoting incident number 218 of 3 January 2021."
