Rushcliffe Police have warned to the local community to be vigilant following a spate of van thefts in the area.

The force have received seven reports of vehicles taken across the Rushcliffe Borough in February and March.

The vehicles are stolen without use of original key and in almost every case the offense has occurred overnight.

Neighbourhood Inspector Craig Berry said: "Sadly we've had a succession of reports over the past five weeks now, with thieves targeting vans in the area.

"Of the seven thefts and three attempted thefts different makes and models of van have been targeted, but the most common being the Ford Transit van.

"Offences have taken place in West Bridgford and Rushcliffe South villages.

"The local neighbourhood and Op Reacher teams continue to work hard to establish who is committing these thefts and where these vans are going.

"We are encouraging local residents to report any suspicious behaviour to us immediately.

"Whilst we would ask van owners to consider their vehicles security and where they park their vehicles overnight.

"We will continue to have police officers out on patrol on the roads and villages overnight and we will be stopping cars to gather intelligence to help with our enquiries.

"I want to reassure people that our officers are working hard to find those responsible and bring them to justice.

"We would be keen to speak to anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious in the area. We would also be keen to speak to anyone local that may have CCTV footage."

If you can help with our enquiries please call 101.
