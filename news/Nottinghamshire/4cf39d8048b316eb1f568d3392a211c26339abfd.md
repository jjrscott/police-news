A woman was left frightened and Â£200 down after a brasen cashpoint robbery in the early hours of the morning.

A man reportedly approached the woman as she was drawing cash out on the junction of Berridge Road and Ewart Road, Forest Fields. He is then said to have grabbed her by the arm and forced her to give him the money.

Following the ordeal, which is believed to have happened just after 12.45am on Thursday 28 January 2021, he is said to have ran off in the direction of Burford Road.

Detective Sergeant Lee Cattell of Nottinghamshire Police is investigating, and said "Being approached like this and having her money forcefully taken from her, particularly during these quiet and dark hours, was absolutely distressing for the woman.

"Robbery is a crime that has a variety of effects on its victims and we are dedicated to tackling this in Nottinghamshire and thoroughly investigating such reports.

"We would reassure people that we are continuing to make enquiries and officers are working hard to gather all the information possible on what happened and who was involved.

"We would very much encourage anyone with information to get in touch."

Anyone who saw the incident or has information can contact Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 16 of 28 January 2021.
