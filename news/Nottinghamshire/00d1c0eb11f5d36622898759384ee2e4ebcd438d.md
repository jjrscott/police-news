A 20-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of drug supply offences after Nottinghamshire Police's dedicated knife crime team carried out a stop and search.

Officers were on patrol in Radford when they stopped a man in Churchfield Lane, at around 3.40pm on Saturday (9 January 2021) and recovered heroin, crack cocaine and cannabis.

The man was questioned before being released on police bail pending further enquiries.

Sergeant Matt Daley, of the knife crime team, said: "This was a significant quantity of Class A drugs - around 850 wraps were found during the search. Recovering Class A drugs and taking them off the street is always a positive result for the team.

"Whilst the team is dedicated to tackling knife crime we often encounter drugs offences as part of our work and we are committed to reducing offences in our communities."
