A woman has suffered injuries to her head and wrist after she was reportedly stabbed whilst smoking in her back garden.

The victim was taken to Queen's Medical Centre for treatment.

Officers were quickly on the scene in Trowell to arrest a woman.

Detective Sergeant Vincent Clark is leading the investigation. He said:
"Officers were called shortly after midnight yesterday (Monday 11

"They arrived along with paramedics to Ilkeston Road to treat a woman who suffered injuries to her head and wrist. The victim's injuries haven't been described as life altering or life threatening.

"A 21-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm. She remains in police custody.

"Although an arrest has been made, we are appealing to anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious to come forward to help with our enquiries. Please call 101, quoting incident number 1 of 11 January 2021.

“Nottinghamshire Police takes all reports involving knives extremely seriously.

“I would urge anyone who saw this incident to come forward and help us with the investigation.”
