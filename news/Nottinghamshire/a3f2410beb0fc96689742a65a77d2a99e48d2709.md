Nottingham Police officers have been praised after they detained a man for grooming offences after he reportedly drove through a red light and overtook cars to evade police.

Officers quickly caught up with the man and stopped the car in Cardale Road in Sneinton at around 7pm on Thursday (18 February 2021).

The 21-year-old was detained after officers on a proactive patrol spotted him driving erratically.

Following a quick investigation by the arresting officers, he was allegedly found in company of a teenage girl in his car and therefore arrested on suspicion of meeting a child following sexual grooming.

He was further arrested on suspicion of possession of cannabis, failing to stop at a red traffic light and driving without due care and attention.

Detective Sergeant Lloyd Goucher of Nottinghamshire Police is leading the investigation.

He said: "This was excellent policing as the officer stopped the car following his suspicions.

"The safeguarding of children is of paramount importance to Nottinghamshire Police. We are committed to preventing child sexual exploitation and will be relentless in apprehending those responsible for the sexual exploitation of children and holding them to account for their crimes.

â€œThe force takes incidents of reckless driving very seriously and will take proactive action against any drivers seen to be committing such offences.

"The man was detained and he has since been bailed. Officers at the scene also recovered a mobile phone as part of the investigation.

"Nottinghamshire Police takes reports of such matters very seriously and will investigate them, working with the Crown Prosecution Service, to put a robust case to the courts."

There are a number of different agencies who are able to offer independent help and support to survivors of sexual abuse in Nottinghamshire.
