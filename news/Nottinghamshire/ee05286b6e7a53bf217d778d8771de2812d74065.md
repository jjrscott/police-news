An 18-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of driving while under the influence of cannabis and cocaine after being stopped on a Nottinghamshire road.

Officers were carrying out enforcement activity in the Flamsteed Road area of Broxtowe at around 2pm yesterday (Wednesday) as part of the force's campaign to crackdown on drink and drug driving throughout December.

Chief Inspector Simon Allardice, of Nottinghamshire' Operational Support Department, said: "We have a number of additional resources and lots of enforcement activity planned throughout this month and we are actively stopping drivers.

"We also have more officers than ever before trained in the use of drug wipes and are determined to catch people who commit this dangerous act."

"Drink and drug driving is such an inexcusable offence where offenders take the innocent lives of others into their own hands. It's entirely avoidable and we will continue our hard work in seeking out these dangerous individuals and taking them off our roads."

The man has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.
