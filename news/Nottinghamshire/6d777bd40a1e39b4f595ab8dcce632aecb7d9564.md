A stolen motorbike was recovered and a suspect arrested after police were called to a break-in.

Officers were called to Ryecroft Street, Stapleford, at around 2.45am this morning after a resident disturbed two people attempting to start a motorcycle in his garden.

When challenged the suspects abandoned the bike and ran off towards Central Avenue.

A 22-year-old man was later tracked down by a police dog and arrested near Mackinlay Avenue on suspicion of theft. He remains in police custody.

The bike was found to have been taken from a garden shed in neighbouring Welch Avenue.

Inspector Simon Riley, district commander for Broxtowe, said: “This was a good bit of work from officers who were on the scene extremely quickly. The suspects fled through back gardens but one of them was unable to avoid the attentions of the police dog that sniffed him out.

“Nottinghamshire Police takes all theft offences extremely seriously and will always respond quickly when offences are in progress. I am delighted that on this occasion we were able to return this bike to its rightful owner.”

If you have any additional information that may help police track down the second suspect, please call 101 quoting incident 43 of 23 February.
