An extra £400,000 has been secured to ensure victims of domestic abuse and sexual violence in Nottinghamshire can access support.

The money will be fast-tracked to help charities and support providers meet increased demand during the Covid-19 pandemic.

The funding will be used to purchase equipment for providers to work remotely and increase staffing hours to deliver critical services such as the domestic abuse helpline.

Nottinghamshire Police and Crime Commissioner Paddy Tipping secured £424,514 of extra funding to support victims.

He said: "Across Nottinghamshire, our support workers and volunteers are working tirelessly to respond to the surge in calls for help and support during the pandemic.

"Their dedication and passion is extraordinary but they are under immense strain and it is vital these services have the resources and backup needed to cope under the pressure.

"Staying at home can be a terrifying experience for anyone who is suffering at the hands of an abuser, and seeking help far more risky. It is critical we reduce isolation and continue to offer survivors a safe and effective means of sharing their experiences so they can be protected from harm.

"Supporting victims of crime, especially victims of domestic abuse and sexual violence, is one of my highest priorities and through this additional funding we will ensure anyone who needs help has access to the best possible support available."

Detective Superintendent Andy Gowan, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "The money will help local charities to connect with victims who need it most at this difficult time.

"The Covid-19 restrictions have meant that some people have felt unable to access support in the same way.

“I cannot stress enough that we are there for everyone in their time of need and I want people who are in a difficult position to be aware of the ways in which they can still report abuse to us and access support.

“We understand how difficult it can be to seek help and what a very big step this can be to come forward, however I’d like to make it clear that if you do come to us for help we will listen to you, we will take you seriously and we will take action to help you.

“If you are in danger, please call 999 and we will come to your aid.

“If you feel more comfortable seeking support from another organisation such as a charity then that is fine, but I want you to know that the police are here to help you.”

Nottinghamshire Police is part of the Make Yourself Heard Campaign, which aims to show people how they can report an emergency when it is not safe to speak.

Dialing 55 after calling 999 takes you through to a silent call service, whereby call handlers will give you specific directions on how to report your emergency.
