Two people are in custody after a group of people were attacked with pepper spray on a park.

Police were called to Southglade Fields in Bulwell at around 6.20pm yesterday evening (Monday 1 March) after a man was alleged to have sprayed a substance in the eyes of three people.

The spray is not believed to have caused any serious harm to the victims, however, police quickly attended the scene and arrested a 36-year-old man on suspicion of actual bodily harm in connection with the report.

A 35-year-old woman was also arrested on suspicion of assault as part of enquiries into the incident.

Sergeant Jerone Taylor, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Nottinghamshire Police takes reports of assault very seriously and the alleged use of pepper spray in this attack is obviously concerning.

“Officers did a fantastic job to arrive at the scene quickly and make two arrests as part of their enquiries and we are now working to understand what happened.

“Violence has no place on our streets and we will take swift action against those who commit such offences.

“I am now appealing for anyone who may have seen something suspicious in the area at the time to get in touch with Nottinghamshire Police as soon as possible.”

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has any information that could aid officers in their investigation is asked to contact Nottinghamshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 593 of 1 March 2021.
