A man has been charged with possessing a knife and cannabis after officers on patrol sighted a man acting suspiciously.

A man was arrested on suspicion of the offences following a stop and search in the Carrfield Avenue area of Toton at around 8.55pm on Wednesday (10 March).

Ryan Guest, 26, of Ribblesdale Court in Chilwell, was subsequently charged and is next due to appear at Nottingham Magistrates' Court on 26 March.

Nottinghamshire Police Constable, Catherine Stafford, said: "We are actively patrolling our streets and are always keeping an eye out for anything that appears to be suspicious.

"Drug and knife offences are taken extremely seriously and I'm glad that that the officers quick thinking and tenacity has led to a man being charged for these offences and who now awaits the court process."
