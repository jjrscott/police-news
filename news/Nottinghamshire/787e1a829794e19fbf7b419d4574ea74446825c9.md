An investigation has begun after a distinctive and much treasured jacket with band names printed on it has been stolen from a house.

Nottinghamshire Police detectives have issued an image of the clothing following the incident in Sherwood.

It was reported a person walked into a house in Archdale Road on 21 January 2021 at around 4.45pm and stole the items.

Detective Constable Louise Turton is leading the investigation. She said: "We have issued an image of one coat, which is described as green parker Northern Soul jacket with band names printed on it.

"Burglary is an extremely invasive crime and has huge impacts for those involved.

"We would reassure people that reports such as this are taken very seriously and we will thoroughly investigate where this has happened.

â€œThe coat is green with a fur lining and a hood. It has the band names on it including The Who on the rear of the jacket and The Police and The Jam on each sleeve. It is treasured by the owner and a unique item.

"If anyone comes across the jacket, perhaps on online selling sites, then please do get in touch by calling 101, quoting incident number 573 of 21 January 2021."
