Armed officers arrested a man and recovered a viable firearm and ammunition after attending an address in Bestwood last night.

A 33-year-old man was detained outside an address in Caldbeck Walk on suspicion of possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.

Police also arrested a second man, aged 35, who was driving a vehicle nearby in connection with the recovery of the items.

He was arrested on suspicion of possession of conspiring to possess a firearm without a certificate.

The two suspects remain in custody while detectives progress the investigation.

Detective Inspector Jon Scurr said: "We are pleased that we've been able to take a dangerous weapon and ammunition off the streets of Nottinghamshire.

"We treat firearms offences extremely seriously and we will always thoroughly investigate the recovery of weapons."

Neighbourhood Inspector Christine Busuttil added: “I am pleased with these arrests and the recovery of a firearm.

"Two suspects are now being questioned and I'd like to reassure people that there's no wider threat to members of the public.

“Patrols will continue in the area to provide reassurance and I’d encourage anyone with any concerns to speak with our officers in the area.

"If anyone has any information about those involved in gun crime, or who knows where weapons are being stored, please keep contacting us so that these positive results continue."
