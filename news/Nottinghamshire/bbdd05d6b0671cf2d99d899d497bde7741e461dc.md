Nottinghamshire Police is looking has asked for residents to share their thoughts on Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) as part of a national survey.

ANPR technology is used by police forces across the UK to help detect, deter and disrupt criminality, including organised crime groups and terrorists.

The registration plate cameras are governed by strict codes of practice. They are most commonly used to alert officers to stolen vehicles, vehicles that have been involved in crime or to help locate missing people.

Detective Inspector Jonathan Naylor, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "The data ANPR collects can also be used in a variety of investigations.

"Fans of Nottinghamshire Police - Interceptors will have probably seen how ANPR works and you may even use a petrol station or car park which uses the system to keep you safe.

"A short video showing how ANPR Is used has been produced by West Midlands Police to illustrate the use in locating a missing person.

"It is a great example of how this vital tool helps police stay one step ahead of criminals and better protect people.

"That being said, your views play an important part in how we do this. The anonymous survey will only take a few minutes of your time to complete."
