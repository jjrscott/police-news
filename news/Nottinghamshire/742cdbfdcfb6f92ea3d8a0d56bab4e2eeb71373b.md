Broxtowe's Operation Reacher Team is continuing to make a positive difference after helping to uncover two cannabis grows within the space of days.

Two suspects were arrested and around 250 plants, worth an estimated £250,000, were discovered after a Misuse of Drugs Act warrant was executed at a property in Derbyshire Avenue, Trowell, yesterday morning (Thursday 3 December 2020).

The plants that were seized were found in three separate rooms. A quantity of cash was also seized from the address.

A 22-year-old man and a 21-year-old woman, both arrested on suspicion of production of cannabis and being concerned in the supply of cannabis, remain in custody while enquiries continue.

It comes after more good police teamwork involving Broxtowe's Operation Reacher Team and the Beeston Neighbourhood Policing Team resulted in cannabis plants, cash and a large knife being recovered from a home in Beeston on Tuesday.

A total of 22 plants and a substantial amount of cash were seized after a warrant was carried out at a property in Boundary Road.

A 33-year-old man and a 31-year-old woman are to be voluntarily interviewed in relation to those discoveries as the police investigation continues.

They are the latest example of the police's commitment to tackling and reducing the supply of drugs in Broxtowe and disrupting criminality which is having a detrimental impact on local communities.

Inspector Simon Riley, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "This was a significant cannabis grow in Trowell that is likely to be linked to organised criminality. It would have taken a great deal of time and money to set up and I am pleased that it has now been taken out of action.

“The large-scale production of illegal drugs has a significant negative impact on our communities that often brings with it violence and other related offending. We are determined to clamp down on the people responsible.

“It is often said that cannabis production is not a serious crime, but this is simply not true. The cultivation of cannabis can often be linked to serious organised crime and other serious offences like human trafficking and modern slavery.

“Drugs can have a devastating impact on our local communities and it is important that we continue to take proactive action against organised criminals who seek to profit from illegal activity.

"We want to send the clear message that criminal behaviour will not be tolerated in Broxtowe and we will continue to target people believed to be involved in drug-related crime in our district.

"The Reacher Team will continue to conduct high visibility patrols, alongside our neighbourhood policing colleagues, as we continue to work together to tackle issues that our local communities have told us matter most to them, including drug crime.

"I hope the positive impact and results we're achieving reassures the public of our determination to make our streets safer. Our work to reduce the supply of drugs in Broxtowe continues and we encourage the community to talk to us regarding any concerns or suspicions they may have regarding drugs-related criminality.”
