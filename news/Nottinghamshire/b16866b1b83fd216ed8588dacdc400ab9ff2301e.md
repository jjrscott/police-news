Emergency services are in attendance in Hoveringham after a report of a car drifting down the River Trent.

The car is believed to have entered the river near to Boat Lane in Hoveringham.

Nottinghamshire Police officers, the police aeroplane, the air ambulance and Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service are working to stop the car in order to retrieve it.

Inspector Frank Guddemi, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Nottinghamshire Police was called at around 4.15pm to the report and emergency services quickly attended.

“This is a live incident and I’d encourage the public to avoid the area while emergency services respond.”
