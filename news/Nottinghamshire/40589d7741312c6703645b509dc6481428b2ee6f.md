A man is due in court after homes in Church Laneham were evacuated following the discovery of an pipe bomb.

Officers were called to the incident at around 12.45pm on Sunday 28 February 2021 after suspicious device was spotted under a hedge in Riverview.

A large police cordon was in place while residents were evacuated as a precaution. Bomb disposal experts assessed the object and found that it had already been detonated.

Christopher Barber, 65, of Clayhough Lane in Church Laneham, is charged with cause an explosion to endanger life or damage property and doing an act with intent to cause an explosion likely to endanger life or damage property in connection with the incident.

Barber is due to appear at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court today.

Following a swift police investigation, the device is believed to have been activated in a separate incident on 26 February 2021. No one is reported to have been injured in the incident.

Detective Sergeant Jamie Moore, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “We understand that incidents of this nature can cause considerable local alarm, but this was an isolated incident and we are not treating it as terror related.

“I’d like to thank local residents for their cooperation when we had to evacuate the area.”
