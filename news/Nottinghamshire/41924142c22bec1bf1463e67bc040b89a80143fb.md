A county-wide clamp-down on drug-related criminal activity has led to the arrest of four people.

Warrants executed at addresses in Gedling, Bullwell, Arnold and West Bridgford this morning, were part of a number of investigations into organised criminal activity in the county.

Four men, aged between 32 and 40, were all arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to supply controlled drugs and further enquiries are ongoing.

Officers and detectives from across the force, including an Operation Reacher team, all undertook the activity as the force continued its commitment to tackling organised drug crime.

Detective Sergeant Emma Pollard, who is leading the investigations, said: “Our investigations are at an early stage but it is incredibly positive that we have made four arrests as part of our enquiries.

“Drug crime can have a devastating impact on our communities and as a force, we are committed to taking action against criminals who commit such offences.

“The warrants send out a clear message to criminals, we will not tolerate drug crime on our streets and we will take action.”

If you spot something suspicious in your area, please do not hesitate to contact Nottinghamshire Police on 101 or in an emergency, dial 999.
