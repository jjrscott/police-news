A man has been arrested on suspicion of affray after a man was grabbed by the throat.

Officers from Nottinghamshire Police were called to Hallam Road in Mapperley, Nottingham, at around 11.10pm yesterday (30 November) to a report that a man had barged into another man’s home, grabbed him by the throat and pulled him to the ground.

No one was hurt in the incident.

A 51-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of affray.

Police Sergeant Catherine Edwards, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Everyone deserves to feel safe in their own home. We believe the two people involved in this incident were known to each other but of course that does not excuse this type of behaviour.

“Violence of any kind is completely unacceptable and something that Nottinghamshire Police will not tolerate.”
