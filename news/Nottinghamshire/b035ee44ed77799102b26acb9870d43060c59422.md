Police officers visited a dog rescue centre to drop off a range of festive treats.

Members of the Ashfield Operation Reacher team and the Mansfield Neighbourhood Policing Team visited the Jerry Green dog rescue centre in Blidworth on Monday and dropped of donations of food.

The officers were joined on the day by Dingo, a seven-month-old Lurcher who’s recently arrived at the centre. After completing his settling in period Dingo will soon be available for re-homing.

PC Jade Massey, who organised the visit, said: "Building strong connections with the local community is a key part of local policing, and one of the things we're asked to do is to reach out to local good causes and see what they can do to help.

"As police officers we often work closely with dogs and there’s certainly a lot of dog lovers among us, so this seemed like a really worthy cause to help out.”

Centre manager Jo Clegg said: "Jerry Green Dog Rescue has been rescuing and re homing dogs in need since way back in 1961, and are entirely funded by generous donations and community support.
