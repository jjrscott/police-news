Nottinghamshire Police have issued an image of a man shown in local CCTV footage in connection with a shop theft and public order offence.

The incident happened at around 1.10pm on 8 November at B&M Bargains in Madford Retail Park in Mansfield Road where a man stole six bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey and attempted to leave the store. He was stopped by security who challenged him.

The man then became aggressive and threatened a member of staff.

Police Constable Ash Smith of Nottinghamshire Police is leading the investigation. He said: "This must have been a terrifying experience for the staff in the shop, but also any members of public who witnessed the incident.

"The man eventually left the store without the items. Thankfully no one was hurt in the incident.

"We now want to speak to the man pictured in connection with the incident.

"He has been described as a black man, aged mid-30s, 6‚Äù4 in height, stocky build with a shaved head. He was wearing a light blue Ralph Lauren baseball cap, blue jacket and grey jogging bottoms. He also had a black rucksack with him and a black mountain bike with green writing on it.

"We are appealing to anyone with any information to call 101, quoting incident 256 of 8 November 2020."
