A 48-year-old man has been remanded in custody after two officers were assaulted.

Colin Cousins, of Massey Gardens in St Ann's was arrested shortly after officers were called to a public order incident in Shrewsbury Road, Sneinton.

A man then threw liquid, believed to be juice, at officers, before grabbing a police constable by the throat and assaulting her. He also assaulted a PCSO who tried to assist her colleague.

It happened at around 3.40pm on Wednesday (24 March).

Cousins was subsequently charged with two counts of assault by beating an emergency worker and will next appear at Nottingham Crown Court on 21 April.

Neighbourhood Inspector Karl Thomas, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "This was a despicable act of violence against our officers as they carried out their daily duties.

"We take this really seriously and we have been conducting our enquiries around the clock which has led to a man being charged and remanded in custody to await the court process.

"Thankfully the officers involved didn't suffer any serious injuries, they have been provided with support."
