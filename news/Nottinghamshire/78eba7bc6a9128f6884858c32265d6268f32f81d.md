An investigation into organised criminal activity has led to the charge of a man in connection with a series of drugs offences.

Jordan Serrant, 37, of Helston Drive, was arrested as part of a warrant in a series of operations targeting organised criminal activity in Nottinghamshire.

He is charged with conspiracy to supply cocaine, heroin and cannabis in connection with an investigation into drugs supply between 31 March 2020 and 8 June 2020.

Serrant has been released on bail ahead of his next court appearance at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court on 22 February 2021.

Detective Sergeant Emma Pollard, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Nottinghamshire Police takes drug crime very seriously and will always thoroughly investigate any suspicious activity that may be linked to organised crime.

“If anyone has any information about drug crime in their area or has any concerns, please do not hesitate to contact Nottinghamshire Police on 101 or in an emergency, dial 999.”
