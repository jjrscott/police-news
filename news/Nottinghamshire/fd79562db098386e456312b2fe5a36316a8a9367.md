A man has been charged with assaulting four emergency workers.

The three paramedics were targeted as they responded to a medical emergency at an address in Caunts Crescent, Sutton in Ashfield, on Saturday night.

A police officer was also assaulted at Kings Mill Hospital later in the evening.

Kyle Evans, 28, of Leamington Drive, Sutton-in-Ashfield, has been charged with four counts of assaulting and emergency worker.

He was also been charged with making racially aggravated threats towards another police officer.

Evans appeared in court on Monday and was remanded in custody to appear at Nottingham Magistrates Court 25 February.

Sergeant Carl Holland, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "Police officers and other emergency services workers are working hard every day in these most challenging of times to keep people safe.

“They deserve our respect and thanks – not to be met with violence as they simply try to do their jobs.

"Assaulting our officers or any other emergency services providers will not be tolerated in Nottinghamshire under any circumstances and offenders will be dealt with swiftly.

"I am therefore very pleased that a suspect has been charged with these offences.”
