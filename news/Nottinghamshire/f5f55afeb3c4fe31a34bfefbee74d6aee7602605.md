A 15-year-old boy has been charged in connection with an alleged stabbing on Saturday.

Police were called Charlock Close in at around 5.35pm on Saturday (20 February) when a boy was reported to have been assaulted.

The 16-year-old boy’s injuries are not believed to be life-threatening, but are serious and he remains in hospital for treatment.

Detectives launched an investigation into the incident and following excellent police work by several departments working in partnership, tracked down and arrested the boy.

Detective Sergeant Jon Kerry, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "While we have now seen a teenager charged in connection with this incident, a team of detectives are continuing with their extensive enquiries and I would urge anyone who has any information which could help us with our investigation to please come forward.

“We appreciate it is a concerning incident and, as we have previously said, we have increased our police presence in the area to provide reassurance and to address any concerns that people may have."

“Nottinghamshire Police takes knife crime very seriously and will always thoroughly investigate reports with a view to taking appropriate action against those found to have committed such offences.

“There will be increased patrols in the area today for reassurance and I’d ask anyone who has any concerns to report them to police officers or via 101."

The 15-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has been charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent and two counts of possession of a bladed article. He has been remanded into custody after he appeared at Nottingham Magistrates' Court earlier today.
