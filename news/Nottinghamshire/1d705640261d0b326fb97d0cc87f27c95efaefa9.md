A man has been charged in connection with a spate of burglary and theft offences.

The offences all took place on the Arnold area over the Valentine’s Day weekend.

Officers were called on Sunday evening after a man walked into a property in Ashdale Road and attempted to steal a handbag.

After a brief tussle over the bag he left empty handed.

A spate of additional offences were also reported in the area on Saturday and Sunday, including two attempted burglaries, a robbery and an assault.

Michael Delaney, 32, was arrested late on Sunday night and has now been charged with the burglary in Ashdale Road, another attempted burglary in Ashdale Road, an attempted burglary in Smith Crescent, a robbery in Front Street, the theft of various items from a car in Worrall Avenue and four counts of theft from local shops. He has also been charged with common assault.

Delaney, of no fixed abode, appeared at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court yesterday (Tuesday) morning and was remanded in custody. He will next appear in court on 16 March.

Detective Sergeant Andy Hall, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “I am aware that this spate of offences caused considerable alarm in the local community over the weekend and hope that residents are reassured by the speed of our response. I am pleased we have now been able to bring charges against a suspect.”
