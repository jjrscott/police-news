Officers took just 20-minutes to arrest a man after a bike was reportedly stolen from a garden, with an eagle-eyed member of the public praised.

The man rang the police after spotting a man acting suspiciously, before challenging him and calling police.

The force was called at around 12.30pm Monday 8 February 2021 following a report that the bike was stolen from Loughborough Road in West Bridgford.

It was reported a man who matched a description given by the caller, ran towards Trent Bridge, but he was swiftly tracked down and detained with the assistance of a member of the pubic.

Inspector Craig Berry praised his team. He said: "This was excellent work to arrest the 48-year-old man on suspicion of theft, so quickly after the original report.

"We must thank the member of the public who rang in and spotted a suspicious man acting furtively, reportedly looking over a fence and then through a side gate.

"The man challenged him before ringing the police.

"Officers were able to speak to the caller, record a description of the alleged offender and track him down nearby.

"This forms part of our ongoing work around cycle theft and shed burglary and this investigation remains ongoing as our enquiries continue."
