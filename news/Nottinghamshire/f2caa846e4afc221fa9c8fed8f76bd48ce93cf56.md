Five people have been arrested on suspicion of breaching Covid-19 legislation following a report of a house party last night, with officers visiting the property twice to stop revellers.

This was the fifth time that the same residents had been reported to the police for large gatherings this week.

Occupants had previously been issued with fixed penalty notices on three separate occasions and now face the rest of the weekend in police custody.

The incidents follow yesterday's announcement by the Prime Minister of tougher restrictions to not see friends and family over the festive period due to a rapid spread of the new strain of Covid-19.

Nottinghamshire Police officers visited a house in Radford twice in quick succession following a report of a large gathering.

Officers were called to a house at around 10pm last night in Alfreton Road following the report, however residents refused to open the door.

They were able to gain entry and arrests were made. Further searches were conducted and six more people were discovered hiding in the loft and detained.

Several arrests were made, nine people were reported for summons to court and released, whilst a 22-year-old woman and a 19-year-old man remain in police custody.

Later that night at around 3.30am on Sunday morning, a further call was taken that the party had continued.

Officers again entered the house and found those who were released from custody a few hours earlier and reported for summons to court, still partying.

They were arrested on suspicion of breaching Covid-19 legislation.

Superintendent Kevin Broadhead, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "To have people flout the rules not once, not twice but several times and even after being arrested is just astonishing.

"And this coming just as the whole country has just been told that the five day relaxation bubble is now going to be limited to just Christmas Day due to the spread of the new strain of the virus, makes it even more disturbing.

"These people's actions put lives in danger and the fact they keep on repeating the same offence means they clearly don't care about anyone else and that is why they we will use all powers at our disposal to deal with them.

"It was clear that the people were flouting the Covid-19 restrictions and created a situation where harm was likely to be done to persons present within the address.

"These restrictions are in place to prevent the spread of this deadly virus and to save lives.

"The restrictions are in place for a reason and the only way we are going to stop the virus is if we all stick to the rules.

"Most people across the county have been playing their part in limiting the spread of the virus by obeying the law but sadly there are some people who refuse to adhere to our efforts to engage, explain and educate and consequently we will not hesitate to work with our partners to enforce the regulations."
