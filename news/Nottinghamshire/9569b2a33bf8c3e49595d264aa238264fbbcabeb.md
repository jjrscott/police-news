Two men have been arrested after officers on proactive patrols spotted two men suspiciously carrying a large amount of items in the early hours of this morning.

Newark response officers were driving along Lincoln Road at around 3.30am today (Friday 26 March) when they saw two men with a large quantity of plant pots and other items who then fled from them.

More officers arrived and two men were arrested nearby. A bag containing suspected class B drugs was also seized by police.

It's believed the items have been stolen from a store in Maltkiln Lane in the town centre.

Heather Sutton, District Commander, for Newark and Sherwood, said: "The men remain in custody having been arrested on suspicion of burglary and possession of class B drugs.

"This incident highlights how our teams are constantly patrolling the streets, throughout the day and night, looking out for anything suspicious.

"In this instance, we have recovered stolen goods before the shop owners have even discovered they had potentially been burgled.

"We have many operations in place to prevent crime before they happen and to catch people red handed. We are particularly keen to protect our businesses, many of which have already suffered financial losses having been closed for such a long time due to the pandemic."

Enquiries continue. If anyone saw anything suspicious or has any information that could assist this investigation, please call 101 quoting incident 64.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
