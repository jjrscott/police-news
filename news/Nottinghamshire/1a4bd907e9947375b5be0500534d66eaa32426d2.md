Police arrested a burglary suspect just minutes after a man was caught on a doorbell camera trying to open his intended victim’s front door.

Officers rushed to an address in Garside Drive, Worksop, when the attempted break-in was reported shortly after 3.45am this morning (Saturday).

The occupants reported that a man had tried to open the front door and had also attempted to gain access to a car parked outside.

Officers searched the area and arrested a 22-year-old man around 10 minutes later. He was also arrested on suspicion of a second attempted burglary at a property in nearby Kilton Road.

The suspect remains in police custody.

Detective Constable Jackie Price, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Any attempted intrusion into people’s homes can be a distressing and frightening experience. I am delighted that officers were able to respond so quickly to this incident and make an arrest within minutes of arrival.

"Doorbell CCTV cameras are relatively inexpensive, easy to install and a can prove extremely effective at deterring and solving crime.”

If anyone witnessed suspicious activity in the local area in the early hours of this morning please call police on 101 quoting incident 76 of 13 February.
