Police swiftly arrested a suspect after a report of a man who walked into a Hyson Green woman's home uninvited while she was watching television and asked if she wanted her windows cleaning.

The man was challenged by the victim's son who tried to detain him. He fled on foot and the victim called the police.

The suspected distraction burglary happened just after 8.45pm on Thursday (18 February 2021) in Cantabury Avenue.

Officers quickly carried out enquiries in the area and while on patrol in the Radford Road area spotted a man matching the suspect's description.

A 31-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of burglary.

Detective Inspector Ed Cook, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "The victim was left very shaken by what happened while she was sat watching television in her living room, as well as the other occupants.

"Burglars will often take advantage of unsecured doors or windows to gain entry to homes before making off with items so we'd remind people to make sure they keep their doors and windows locked at all times.

"If you see somebody acting suspiciously report it to the police immediately by calling 101 or, in an emergency, call 999.

"Tackling and reducing burglaries remains a priority for the force but we also need the public to help us by following our crime prevention advice.

“It is also incredibly important that people share advice with their potentially vulnerable relatives, neighbours or friends.

"With more people feeling isolated and alone during the Covid-19 pandemic, distraction burglars may see this as an opportunity to target people.

“If you know someone who could benefit from our advice, who is not on social media, please call them and make them aware.”
