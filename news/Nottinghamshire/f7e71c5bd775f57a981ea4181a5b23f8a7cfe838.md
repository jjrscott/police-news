It was reported that a man indecently exposed himself whilst in Pasture Lane on 29 and 30 November 2020.

Officers are now appealing for any information and warning the local community.

Inspector Craig Berry said: "Nottinghamshire Police take offences of this nature seriously and an active investigation is under way.

"We would like to reassure the public that the Neighbourhood Policing Team, together with our partners, are undertaking a number of measures in order to prevent further offending. We have already increased our visible presence in the area since the incidents.

â€œWe are appealing for anyone with information in relation to these offences to contact us.

"He has been described as a white man in his 60s, dark hair, wearing a dark blue padded jacket, dark blue jogging bottoms and brown woolly hat. He had an unkempt look.

"Anyone with information to the identity of the offender or witnessing the incidents, please contact the Control Room by calling 101, quoting incident 114 of 30 November 2020."
