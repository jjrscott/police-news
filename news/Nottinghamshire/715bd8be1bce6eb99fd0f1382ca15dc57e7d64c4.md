Officers quickly responded to a report of an intruder in a house in Retford last night.

Police were called to Pennington Walk at around 10pm after a victim reported that they had just disturbed a burglar at their property and that the suspect had fled the scene.

Within minutes of the call, police attended and undertook and area search in order to locate the suspect.

After a brief search, a 34-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of burglary and possession of cannabis after a small amount of drugs were recovered.

Bottles of alcohol that were reported to have been taken from the house were also found.

Detective Constable Nathan Fagan, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Officers did a fantastic job to quickly arrive at the scene and arrest a man in connection with the report.

“Burglary can have lasting impact on victims and can leave people feeling unsafe in their own homes.

“We take reports very seriously and will always thoroughly investigate them in order to take appropriate action against offenders.

“Our investigation into this incident is ongoing and I would now appeal for anyone who has any information or CCTV footage in the area to get in touch with us as soon as possible.”

Anyone who has information that could aid detectives in their investigation should contact Nottinghamshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 784 of 21 February 2021.
