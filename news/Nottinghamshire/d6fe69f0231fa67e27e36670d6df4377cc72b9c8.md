A stolen caravan was tracked down and officers discovered a large cannabis grow at the scene.

Ollerton police had responded to a report that the vehicle had been stolen from the Boat Lane area of Bleasby at around 9.10am on 19 March.

Their enquiries then led them to Spring Lane in Screveton where they located the caravan at around 10.30am on 23 March.

Having smelt a strong smell of cannabis, they uncovered a cannabis grow containing around 56 plants.

Wildlife officer Constable Jason Fellows, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "We take vehicle thefts really seriously officers are dedicated to investigating this type of crime and taking a proactive approach on any information we receive.

"We have been carrying out enquiries which led the caravan being recovered and reunited with its rightful owner.

"It also led us to uncovering a substantial cannabis grow with a street value of around Â£40,000 which has now been destroyed and taken out of the drugs circulation.

"Our enquiries continue and we are determined to get to establish who is behind these crimes. If anyone has any information that could help, please call us on 101 quoting incident 123."
