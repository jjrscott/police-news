Nottinghamshire Police has released CCTV images of two men they would like to speak to in connection with criminal damage.

It comes after two men attempted to prise open a parked van on a driveway in Carlton-in-Lindrick, at around 3pm on 21 November 2020. It is believed the suspects were attempting to steal tools from inside the work van, which was empty.

The men allegedly used a tool to open the van, but found nothing inside and were disturbed shortly after by the victims who saw the pair on the drive. The men then left the scene, fleeing in a dark coloured Ford Focus.

CCTV images have been issued in a bid to identify the men in the picture, as it is believed they may be able to assist with the investigation.

PC Jonathan Daniels, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “This incident occurred in broad daylight which shows the suspects had a blatant disregard for other people’s belongings and it was a frightening experience for the victims who caught them in the act.

“After the men were seen, it is said they got into the Ford and off up Tinkers Hill, going towards Doncaster Road.

“There has been a spate of van break-ins in the Worksop area and we are keen to speak to these men as we believe they may be able to help with our enquiries.”

Anyone with information is asked to contact 101, quoting incident number 441 of 21 November 2020. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
