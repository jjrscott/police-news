A man has received serious facial injuries after he was involved in a road rage incident.

The victim lost consciousness for a period of time and suffered facial fractures and multiple cuts after a verbal altercation in Sutton-in-Ashfield.

The reported argument stemmed from a speeding incident, which nearly caused an accident at a junction.

Officers were quickly on the scene and tracked down a vehicle in connection with the incident by using local ANPR cameras after he was sighted in Nottingham.

Detective Sergeant Mark Shaw is leading the investigation. He said: "Enquiries are ongoing but we believe a road-rage incident occurred between two drivers on Ashland Road West.

"Officers were called at around 2.30pm yesterday (18 March 2021) following a road of a road rage incident where the victim was assaulted.

"A 23-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. The man remains in custody pending further enquiries.

"Clearly this has been a terrifying ordeal for the victim and anyone who witnessed the attack. It highlights to us that road-rage should never get this far out of hand.

"If anyone saw the incident or has any dashcam footage, then please contact the force by calling 101, quoting incident number 466 of 18 March 2021."
