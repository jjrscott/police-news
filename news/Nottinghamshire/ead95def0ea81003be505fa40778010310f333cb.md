A woman who reportedly posed as a police officer in an attempt to gain entry into a Nottingham home is now spending her Christmas Day in custody.

Police received a report that a suspect knocked on a victim's door in Ilkeston Road, at around 5.45pm yesterday (Thursday 24 December 2020), and stated that she was the police.

When asked for ID she showed a bank card to the victim who didn't let her in, closed the door and called the police.

During the early hours of today police located a 42-year-old woman who, following enquiries, was arrested on suspicion of attempted burglary and impersonating a police officer. She is also being questioned in connection with further reported distraction burglaries.

Detective Sergeant Matt Scott, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "Distraction burglars often prey on our most vulnerable residents, tricking their way into homes by making up stories, by pretending to work for an official company or asking for help to try to gain entry.

“Nobody should become a victim of crime in their own home, but there are things that can be done to minimise the risks.

“Our advice is always to say no to cold-callers and to report any suspicious activity to police immediately. We want to remind people to be on their guard, especially if someone you’re not expecting – a man, woman or even a child – knocks on your door.

"Residents, particularly the elderly and those who live alone, should remain vigilant and ensure that their home is secure at all times, keeping their doors and windows locked.

“We’d also urge those who know people who are potentially at risk, to advise them of the signs, remind them to not let in unexpected callers and what to do if they are targeted.”
