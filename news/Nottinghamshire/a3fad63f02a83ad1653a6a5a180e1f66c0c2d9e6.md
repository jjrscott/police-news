A woman has died after a crash involving a car and a cyclist.

Police were called at around 4.33pm yesterday (Saturday 6 march) to Southwell Road West in Mansfield when a 49-year-old woman was reported to have been seriously injured in the collision.

The woman, who was riding a bicycle, was treated at the scene but sadly died.

Police Sergeant Mark Baker, of Nottinghamshire Police’s Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: “Our thoughts are with the woman’s family during this sad time”.

“We are now working to establish the circumstances of the incident and I’d appeal for anyone who may have seen what happened to get in touch as soon as possible.”

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has any dashcam footage should contact Nottinghamshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 534 of 6 March 2021.

Southwell Road was closed for some time but has since reopened.
