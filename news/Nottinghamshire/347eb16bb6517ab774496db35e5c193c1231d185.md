A teenager has been left with a bruised eye after he was hit in the face following a reported attempt robbery.

The victim was walking on Chantrey Road, West Bridgford at 5.30pm on Sunday (7 March 2021) when he was approached. A boy tried to wrestle the bike off him and in the commotion he was hit to the face.

Local residents heard the disturbance and came out to assist the injured teenager, whilst the offenders left the scene.

Detective Constable Nathan Fagan is leading the investigation. He said: "Officers moved quickly to arrest a 14-year-old boy on suspicion of attempted robbery this morning (Tuesday 9 March 2021). He remains in police custody.

"This was an upsetting incident for the victim and his family and we are determined to get to the bottom of what happened here.

"The teenager suffered minor injuries.

"Nottinghamshire Police takes robberies and attempt robberies extremely seriously and will investigate all reports thoroughly."
