Local officers have been praised after a 34-year-old man pleaded guilty to theft.

Officers were called to Morrisons in Gamston after a report of a man acting suspiciously, when they spotted a handbag being taken from a car parked next to a recycling centre.

It was reported a man entered the vehicle and allegedly stolen the purse from the front seat whilst a woman was unloading bottles into a bottle bank.

A man was swiftly arrested and was charged in relation to the incident on 20 December.

Inspector Craig Berry praised his team. He said: "This was fantastic work by the Rushcliffe policing team who came together in response to a crime in progress.

"They were able to detain a man swiftly and he has since been charged in connection with the incident.

"The neighbourhood and Reacher officers did a great job and ensured that it was a success.

"We would like to reiterate how important it is to keep vehicles locked whilst unattended. It can only take a few seconds for a thief to take your property, so please do keep your car locked.

"This is not the first offence of this type where the offender waits for the victim for the vehicle to be unlocked after completing their shopping or recycling before stealing a purse or handbag from inside the car.

"Officers continue to work hard to tackle this issue, working alongside local partners."

Lance Collins, 34, of St Stephens Road in Sneinton has pleaded guilty to theft from motor vehicle. He has been released on bail and is due to appear at Nottingham Crown Court on 11 January 2021.
