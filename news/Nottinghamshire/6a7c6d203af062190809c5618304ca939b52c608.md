A specialist drugs operation has seen a cocaine, heroin and cannabis dealer jailed and £17,000 worth of drugs destroyed.

Plain clothed officers from Nottinghamshire Police Knife Crime Team witnessed Renett Morrison conducting a suspected drug deal in the Holden Street area of Nottingham.

Officers detained and searched the 43-year-old, formerly of Maxey Road in Plumstead, London, and found a large quantity of suspected class A controlled drugs along with significant sum of cash.

Enquiries led officers to a flat in Alfreton Road which was regularly being used by Morrison and recovered several thousand pounds of cash along with a substantial amount of heroin, cocaine and cannabis with an estimated street value of £17,000.

Morrison, who is also known as Kevin Thomas pleaded guilty to possession of class A and B drugs, cocaine, heroin and cannabis, with intent to supply and was sentenced to four years, and one month in prison at Nottingham Crown Court on Wednesday (3 March).

Detective Constable Laura McCullough, who led the investigation, said: "Nottinghamshire Police are committed to the disruption of drug supply and prosecuting those responsible.”

"Morrison was clearly a well-established drug dealer, he has now been taken off the streets and locked up for his crimes.

"We will continue our proactive work in this area and hope that the level of sentence received by Morrison sends a strong message to those involved in drug related activity in Nottingham."
