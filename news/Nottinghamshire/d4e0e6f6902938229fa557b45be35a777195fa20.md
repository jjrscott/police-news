An estate agent had to sell her business after her accountant stole thousands of pounds from the company over a 12-month period.

Michael Twitty, 46, stole a total of £7,850 in cash letting payments from Pure Estate Agents in Bridge Street, Worksop, between March 2017 and February 2018.

He was sacked after his bosses discovered discrepancies over rental payments missing from the lettings paying-in book.

When he was challenged over the circumstances of the discrepancies and missing cash payments, Twitty admitted that he'd stolen money due to being in debt.

Twitty, of Rufford Street, Worksop, pleaded guilty to a charge of theft and was given a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, when he appeared at Nottingham Crown Court on Tuesday (16 February 2021). He was also ordered to carry out 100 hours’ unpaid work.

PC Rob Limmer, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "Twitty betrayed the trust placed in him and his dishonesty caused significant financial and emotional harm.

“His selfish actions left a trail of misery in their wake and the financial implications of his greed were significant, eventually resulting in the sale of the victim’s business.

“I hope that this conviction deters others from thinking that they can get away with committing these kind of offences. Offenders will be pursued and brought before the courts to face justice."
