A man is due to appear in court after a Selston home was allegedly ransacked and a television, watch and jewellery were stolen.

Oliver Hufton, 24, of Holland Crescent, Selston, is due to appear at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court today charged with burglary.

The charge relates to a report of a break-in at a home in Annesley Lane between 20 and 26 February 2021.

Detective Inspector Nick Hall, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "Burglary is a hugely invasive crime which causes significant upset to victims. People should always feel safe in their homes and that's why we're continuing to work so hard, working closely with our partners, to drive burglary down.

“I would like to reassure members of the community that we will investigate reports of burglary and continue to deal robustly with anyone believed to be involved in such crimes and work hard to secure justice for burglary victims."
