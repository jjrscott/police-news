Detectives are appealing for information following a fire in an outside storage unit in Stapleford this morning.

Nottinghamshire Police were called just after 4.30am to assist colleagues from Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service who responded to the blaze in Derby Road.

An area remains cordoned off while a joint investigation continues into the cause of the fire.

Derby Road was temporarily closed while the blaze was tackled.

One man was treated for smoke inhalation.

Halls Road onto Derby Road is currently closed while the investigation progresses.

Detective Sergeant Matt Scott, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “We are continuing to work closely with Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service and a joint investigation has begun to establish the circumstances of how the fire began.

“I’m particularly interested in locating and speaking to a young black female who was out jogging and who raised the alarm with local residents.

"This person may be able to provide key information and I am appealing for her to come forward and tell us what she knows.”
