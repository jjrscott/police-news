Detectives investigating the recovery of shotgun ammunition from a car in Basford have charged a man in connection with the find.

Police quickly responded to a report of a suspicious vehicle in Valley Road, Basford on Tuesday evening.

Shotgun ammunition was found in the car and a man was arrested in connection with the incident.

Adrian Keeling, 35, of Nottingham Road in Basford, is charged with possession of ammunition when prohibited and has been remanded into custody pending his appearance at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court today.

Detective Inspector Jon Scurr, who is leading the investigation, said: “Firearms offences are incredibly serious and Nottinghamshire Police will always thoroughly investigate any reports of such incidents.

“We work closely with local communities to gather evidence and information that could aid officers and detectives to make arrests and I would encourage anyone who has any concerns in their local area to contact police on 101 or in an emergency, dial 999.”
