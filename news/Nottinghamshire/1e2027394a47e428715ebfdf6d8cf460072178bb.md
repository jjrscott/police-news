A 19-year old man has been charged after a delivery driver was threatened with a knife and had her van stolen yesterday morning.

Officers from Nottinghamshire Police were called to Renfrew Drive in Wollaton at 7.30am on Saturday following a report of a knife-point robbery.

They quickly arrested a man in Beeston. Logan Brandt, 19, of Bourne Close in Beeston has now been charged with robbery, threatening with a bladed article in public, driving without insurance and without a licence.

He has been remanded to appear at Nottingham Magistrates' Court on 7 December.

A 31-year-old man arrested shortly afterwards has been released without charge while a 43-year-old woman has been released under investigation.

Detective Sergeant Jon Kerry of Nottinghamshire Police is leading the investigation. He said: "We have been working on this case around the clock and are making substantial progress.

"It's absolutely unacceptable for a delivery driver to be targetted in this way as they go about their job, making an honest living and the victim has been left shaken by what happened as you can imagine.

"We are grateful that she was unhurt and that officers were quickly at the scene to support her following the ordeal."

"We take all reports of knife-related offences extremely seriously and ask anyone with any concerns to report it to us or talk to one of our officers in the area."
