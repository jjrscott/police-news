Nottinghamshire Police negotiators were dispatched following a report of a domestic disturbance.

Officers spent three hours talking to a man after he barricaded himself inside the property.

They eventually gained entry and a 36-year-old man has been arrested for criminal damage, assault and affray. He remains in police custody.

Detective Sergeant Katie Hurrell of Nottinghamshire Police is leading the investigation. She said: "The emergency services were called to Elder Street in Sutton-in-Ashfield at around 7.40pm on Monday evening following the report.

"Officers were quickly on the scene to start their investigation and a man was located and arrested.

"This must have been a terrifying experience for all the victims and those in the area at the time.

"We believe this is an isolated incident, with no danger to the rest of the community.

"I'd like to praise and thank the good partnership working with the other emergency services.

“As a force, we are committed to tackling domestic abuse and we will always look to support victims with specially trained officers while we take appropriate action against those who commit such offences.

“If you need support, please remember that you are not alone and there are services available to help you.”
