A fraudster who conned money out of unsuspecting homeowners has been jailed.

Arfan Choudry, 48, was arrested by officers investigating a series of door-to-door scams where residents were conned into lending money that was never repaid.

Appearing at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court this morning Choudry admitted to two counts of fraud by misrepresentation.

The first incident took place in Thorncliffe Road, Forest Fields, on 20 January when a man claimed he needed £25 for an urgent trip in a taxi.

The second took place in Premier Road, Forest Fields, on 14 March when a man asked for £20 for another urgent taxi ride.

Choudry, of Pelham Road, Forest Fields, was jailed for 36 weeks and ordered to repay the money he stole.

Detective Sergeant Marc Lancaster, of Nottinghamshire Police’s specialist fraud team, said: “These kinds of offences can have a lasting impact on victims and are taken extremely seriously by Nottinghamshire Police.

“Choudry has a history of targeting vulnerable people and has previous convictions for similar fraud offences so I am pleased he has now been taken off the streets.

“I hope this case serves as a warning to others that if you commit these types of offences we will investigate, we will arrest you and we will do all we can to see you behind bars.”
