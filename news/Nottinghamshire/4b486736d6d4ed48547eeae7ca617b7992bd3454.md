A police officer was bitten on the hand as he fought to arrest a suspect.

Officers were called to an address in Kent Close, Worksop, at around 11.10pm yesterday (Tuesday) after reports that a man was breaching his bail conditions.

As they tried to detain him a struggle ensued, during which a male officer was bitten on the hand.

The suspect was eventually subdued with irritant spray and restrained.

After three knives were found in a bag a 28-year-old man was arrested in suspicion of breaching bail conditions, assaulting a police officer with intent to resist arrest, and possession of three bladed articles.

He was taken to hospital for assessment and later taken into custody.

Inspector Neil Bellamy, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "Our officers work hard to keep the public safe and should not have to endure violent, abusive and threatening behaviour in the workplace. We take assaults on our officers extremely seriously and will always take the strongest possible action those responsible.‚Äù
