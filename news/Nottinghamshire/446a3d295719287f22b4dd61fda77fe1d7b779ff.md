Nottinghamshire Police’s Mini Police have shared a festive message to say thank you to all key workers and wish everyone a merry Christmas and safe New Year.

The children, who go to Bentinck Primary School and Nursery, recorded the message this week.

Shareen, Alan, Zoya, Siart, Ewa and Haseeb, all in Year 5, donned their uniform to share the message and spread the festive cheer.

Police Community Support Officer Lucy Oram, who runs the Mini Police programme in Arboretum, said: “This year, we’ve had to adapt our Mini Police sessions to fall in line with government restrictions, but that hasn’t stopped the children from embracing the programme with enthusiasm.

“Throughout the pandemic, emergency services and key workers have worked tirelessly as part of the nationwide effort to stop the spread of Covid-19 and the pupils wanted to thank everyone for their efforts.

The force's Mini Police programme began in 2018 by seeking to engage with the children and staff with the aim of wider community engagement to build trust with the police. This interaction naturally led onto positive engagement with the parents and carers of the children involved in the programme.

The programme is exclusively for Primary School children age 9-11 years (academic years 5 & 6).

The Notts Mini Police is the fourth largest in the country and can boast more than 600 students across 22 schools across the county.
