A man has been charged and remanded in custody following a Nottinghamshire Police pursuit involving a vehicle suspected to be driving on cloned number plates.

Intelligence teams notified the operational support unit at around 10.30am yesterday (6 February) who then rushed to Ilkeston Road in Nottingham - but the vehicle failed to stop despite the team using pre-emptive reinforcement tactics.

A police pursuit followed and the vehicle was stopped after a couple of minutes.

A man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving, failing to stop for police and driving while disqualified. He was also arrested for possession with intent to supply class A drugs after officers recovered suspected drugs from the vehicle.

Mohsin Khan, 28, of Institute Street in Sutton-in-Ashfield, has subsequently been charged with driving while disqualified, driving without insurance and possession of Ketamine.

Firearms sergeant James Carrington said: "We utilise intelligence based on vehicles travelling through the county and act on any information that appears untoward.

"This incident highlights the collaborative working within several specialist teams at Nottinghamshire police who's fast work and tenacity resulted in a speedy arrest.

"We aim to combat crime on our roads and bring dangerous drivers to justice."

Khan has been remanded to be at Nottingham Magistrates' Court tomorrow (Monday 8 February).
