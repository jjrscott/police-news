Suspected counterfeit clothing worth around £20,000 has been seized following a warrant.

The early morning raid today (9 December) saw police break down the door to get into a house in Church Avenue, Sutton-in-Ashfield.

Once inside they discovered deal bags of cannabis and what are thought to be fake designer goods.The seized items included boxes and bags full of clothing, luggage, sunglasses and fragrances.

A 29-year-old woman and a 30-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply cannabis and selling counterfeit goods.

Sergeant Paul Peatfield said: “This was another proactive raid by the Operation Reacher Team, responding to feedback about supply of drugs which has such a big impact on the community.

“Seizing suspected counterfeit goods is also a great result. Although they may seem like an innocent way to bag a bargain, fake products haven’t been through the usual safety tests and could also be funding other types of crime – not to mention leaving genuine businesses out of pocket.

“We will continue to work tirelessly to tackle the issues which really matter to people. I hope everybody feels that we’re here for them and that we’re listening and acting on what people tell us.”
