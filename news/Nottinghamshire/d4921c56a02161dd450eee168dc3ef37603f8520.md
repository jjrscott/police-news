Nottinghamshire Police officers have issued two images of a man they would like to speak to in connection with a theft of a car.

Officers were called on the morning of 25 October 2020 following a car being taken outside a property in Broxtowe Lane in Strelley.

Police Constable Charlie Flatters is leading the investigation. He said: "The car was taken on the evening of 24 October.

"We have now issued two images of a man we'd like to speak in connection with the incident.

"Thefts have such an impact on the victims as not only are items taken, but it is an invasion of their property and indeed privacy.

"We want to reassure the community that we take reports such as these very seriously and we are doing everything possible to find those responsible."

If you recognise the man, or have any information which could help, please contact Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 208 of 25 October 2020."
