Nottinghamshire Police detectives are appealing for information after a resident was woken up by his dog barking at a man lurking in his back garden.

The offender was captured on local CCTV footage, which showed him fleeing the scene in the early hours.

Officers were called to Terrian Crescent in West Bridgford at around 2.30am on Sunday morning (3 January 2021) following the report.

Detective Sergeant Gary Hewson is leading the investigation. He said: "Officers were quickly on the scene following the report of a man in the victim's garden.

"We have worked closely with the victim who has been left distressed after seeing someone trespass into his own garden.

"The victim was awoken by his own dog barking and went to view the footage on his CCTV, before making the call to the police.

"Officers searched the nearby area, but couldn't track him down.

"Thankfully no one was injured and nothing was stolen.

“The man has been described as white, around 5’7’ tall, medium build, wearing a black hat, grey hoodie and black trousers.

"We are appealing to anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area at that time to please call 101, quoting incident 56 of 3 January 2021."
