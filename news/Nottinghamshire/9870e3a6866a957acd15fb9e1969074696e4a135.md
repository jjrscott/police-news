Homes in Church Laneham were evacuated following the discovery of a suspected unexploded pipe bomb.

Officers from Nottinghamshire Police were called shortly before 12.45pm today (Sunday 28 February 2021) after the device was spotted under a hedge in Riverview.

A 100-metre cordon was put in place and the occupants of 40 mobile homes were evacuated as a precaution while bomb disposal experts assessed the object. Residents were temporarily re-located to The Ferryboat Inn while the incident was dealt with.

They safely removed the device, which was found not to be live, by 6.30pm and residents were able to return to their homes.

Inspector Keiron Hancock, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “I appreciate the disruption that this will have caused and would like to thank the residents for their understanding.

"We don’t take decisions to evacuate homes readily but have to consider the safety of the public as the highest priority when dealing with incidents such as this.”
