Police have released CCTV footage of a man they want to speak to in connection with a burglary in Sherwood and an attempted burglary in Forest Fields.

A male suspect got into a flat in Loscoe Gardens, Sherwood, through an open window during the night before stealing the victim's wallet which contained his bank cards.

The cards were used to make two purchases at Carrington Services following the burglary which happened between 12.01am and 5.45am on 28 February 2021. The suspect was described as being white and aged between 25 and 35.

Police are also investigating a report that a male suspect was seen running through gardens and trying the doors of homes in Austen Avenue, Forest Fields, between 4am and 4.20am 28 February 2021. The suspect was wearing black and grey clothing and a distinctive baseball cap.

Detective Constable Adam Rigby, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "As part of our ongoing enquiries into these incidents we're appealing for anyone who recognises the man in the footage or who recognises him from his clothing to please come forward and talk to us.

"We treat reports of burglary very seriously and we are determined to find out who is responsible for these crimes and make them face the consequences of their actions.

"If you have any information, no matter how small or insignificant it may seem, please call Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 288 of 28 February 2021 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
