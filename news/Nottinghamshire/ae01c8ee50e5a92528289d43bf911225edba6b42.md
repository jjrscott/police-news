A man who tried to make a getaway from officers in a taxi was caught after failing to pay the fare.

The man is believed to have called the taxi to get away from police after officers spotted two high powered cars driving in Clifton, Nottingham.

Officers saw the cars in Green Lane, Clifton, just after 3am today (13 December). The drivers failed to stop and went through a red light to evade officers before getting away.

The two cars were later recovered by police in Bingley Close in the Bilborough area of Nottingham.

The trail was picked back up at around 5am, when Nottinghamshire Police received a report that a man had made off without paying his full taxi fare.

Officers went to the address where the man had reportedly been dropped off and surrounded it before detaining a man.

A 19-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of burglary and theft of a motor vehicle.

Detective Sergeant Luke Todd, who is investigating the incident, said: “This was great policing work after call handlers spotted that these two incidents could be related.

“We are constantly looking to disrupt those who seek to profit through crime and we work tirelessly to investigate these types of incidents.”
