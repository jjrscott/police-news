A driver was arrested after a high-speed pursuit in the early hours of this morning.

Officers spotted a car travelling quickly along Nottingham Road in Mansfield shortly after 3am and a began a pursuit.

After failing to stop the vehicle travelled at speeds of up to 80mph before it was abandoned in Astral Grove, Hucknall.

After fleeing on foot, the driver was chased down by officers and detained.

A 27-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving, failing to stop, driving with no insurance and failing to stop for police.

He was later arrested on suspicion of cannabis possession and remains in custody.

Inspector Nick Butler, District Commander for Mansfield, said: “Dangerous driving at any time of the day or night puts other road users at risk and will never be tolerated by Nottinghamshire Police. The officers in this case did an excellent job not only in detaining a suspect, but also in bringing this pursuit to a safe conclusion.”
