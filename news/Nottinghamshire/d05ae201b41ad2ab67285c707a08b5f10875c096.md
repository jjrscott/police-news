Officers from Nottinghamshire Police have starred in a series of adverts celebrating the Police Constable Degree Apprenticeship (PCDA) route into policing.

PCs Summer Smith, Toby Roberts and George Staton have taken centre stage in the videos, sharing their experiences and encouraging others to explore the opportunities a PCDA brings. The PCDA route allows officers to join as a constable, and follow an apprenticeship in professional policing practice.

The videos, shared as part of National Apprenticeship Week 2021 and created by the College of Policing in partnership with Nottinghamshire, were filmed in early 2020, before social distancing measures were brought into place.

This route normally takes three years with both on and off-the-job learning. Upon successfully finishing the programme, police officers complete their probation and achieve a degree.

Speaking in the videos, PC Toby Roberts said: “I was working in an office for a few years and it wasn’t my cup of tea.

“I didn’t have a degree and I wanted to get into the police, so when they rolled out that you could do it at the same time, I thought it was the perfect opportunity.”

PC George Station explains how the process of studying while working at the same time is balanced.

He said: “You have a little bit of classroom work and then you’re going out experiencing it and you can go back and reflect on it, so you have that time for reflection back in the classroom.”

PC Summer Smith shared one of her favourite moments as part of the course so far, saying: “The best part of the last year has been response.

“I was working nights on New Year’s Eve and I was buzzing. I was happy to be there.”

She has also shared how her confidence has improved as a result.

She said: “I feel so much more confident than what I did at the start. I can see the change in myself already and I’ve been on response under a year.”

This week, Nottinghamshire Police celebrated the success of apprentices by releasing a series of content for National Apprenticeship Week.
