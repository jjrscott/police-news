Four police officers were assaulted as they struggled to restrain an unruly suspect.

Officers were called to Trowell Services shortly after 3.30pm yesterday (Sunday) afternoon and arrested a man on suspicion of sexual assault and being drunk and disorderly.

As they were driving him way from the scene the man became aggressive and later kicked out as they tried to transfer him to a police van – striking a female officer in the leg.

He later breathed heavily in the faces of three of the officers, claimed to be infected with coronavirus and was further arrested on suspicion of assault.

Inspector Simon Riley, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Assaults on police officers and other emergency workers are completely unacceptable at the best of times, but it is particularly offensive to threaten staff with coronavirus in the current climate.

“Police officers go out every single day to keep the public safe from harm. They have the right to go about their work without being assaulted and abused. We also have families to go home to and this kind of thing really adds to their concerns.”
