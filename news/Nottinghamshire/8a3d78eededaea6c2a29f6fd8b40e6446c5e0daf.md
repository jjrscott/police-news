Six pallets of high quality kitchen and homeware products were stolen in an overnight theft from a lorry which was parked up at a service station.

Nottinghamshire Police were called at 4.40am on Friday (26 February 2021) to reports that a number of men had broken into a lorry. A man reportedly came out of Trowell Services, Nottinghamshire, and saw a number of people open the back doors of a lorry before running across the car park into another waiting lorry and driving off.

A tactical pursuit was conducted near Junction 34 of the M1 by officers from South Yorkshire Police and Derbyshire Constabulary. A car was brought to a stop and a number of kitchen and homeware products were recovered.

Two men and two boys were arrested and have now been charged, and officers continue to investigate this incident and establish the circumstances around the theft.

Steven Lyons, 35 of no fixed address and Elliot O'Reilly, 19, of Cross Flatts, Leeds, were charged with theft from a motor vehicle, along with two boys aged 15 and 17 who can't be named for legal reasons.

Oâ€™Reilly has been remanded in custody after appearing in court on Monday (1 March 2021) and pleading guilty to the charge. He is due to appear at Nottingham Crown Court on Monday 22 March 2021. Lyons and the two boys have been bailed and are due to appear in court on 16 March 2021.

Detective Constable Nathan Wall, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "With help from our neighbouring forces a car was brought to a halt on the M1 and a number of products were recovered.

"Vehicle crime is something we take very seriously. The driver of the lorry was simply trying to do his job and taking a required break from the road when it was broken into, causing disruption to his work and those expecting the products.

"Drivers should feel safe in parking their vehicles at a service station and should not have to be faced with items being taken from their cars or lorries. It is unacceptable and we will thoroughly investigate reports of such incidents.

"Our enquiries into this theft are ongoing we would urge anyone with information to get in touch on 101, quoting incident number 50 of 26 February 2021."
