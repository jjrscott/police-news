Detectives have now charged two men with burglary following a series of shop burglaries in the Radford and Hyson Green areas.

Graham Wilson, 38, of no fixed address, is charged in connection with a burglary at the Chicken Valley takeaway restaurant in Radford Road which happened during the early hours of Tuesday (5 January 2021).

A second man, 44-year-old Lee Chatfield, of Station Street, Nottingham, is charged in connection with a report of a burglary at a barbers in Canning Circus, Nottingham, which occurred between 24 and 29 December 2020.

Both men appeared at Nottingham Magistrates' Court today (Friday 8 January 2021) and were remanded in custody to appear at Nottingham Crown Court on 29 January 2021.

Inspector Amy English, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: â€œBurglary is such an invasive and upsetting crime and that can especially be the case for people who are targeted when they are just trying to make an honest living.

"Burglary can have a serious impact on victims which is why we treat it so seriously. We will continue to do all we can to pursue those suspected to be committing burglaries and remain committed to catching those responsible and bringing them to justice."
