Police have arrested a man after swiftly responding to a report of a group of men fighting in the street in Basford.

Officers were called to the disturbance in Isandula Road at 3.39pm today (Saturday 30 January 2021).

It was reported that six men had assaulted another man and that the attackers may have been in possession of knives, although no injuries were inflicted with a knife and the weapons were not brandished.

The victim suffered minor injuries and was taken to hospital.

Police quickly arrived in the area and arrested a 43-year-old man on suspicion of affray who remains in custody.

Officers remain in the area as they continue with their investigation to understand the full circumstances of the incident and carry out their enquiries.

Inspector Paul Hennessy, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "We take incidents of violence such as this very seriously. Fighting and carrying knives is totally unacceptable and we will always look to take robust action against those who commit such offences.

"While our officers were swiftly on scene and have already made an arrest, our enquiries remain in their early stages and we're working hard to trace the other suspects believed to have been involved in this incident.

"We are appealing for anyone who witnessed this incident or anyone who has any information to please come talk to us.

"If you can help with our investigation please call 101, quoting incident number 457 of 30 January 2021, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.‚Äù
