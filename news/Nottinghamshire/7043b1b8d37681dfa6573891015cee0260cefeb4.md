A man has appeared in court today charged with attempted murder following a serious stabbing.

Jonathan Peter Brooks, aged 57, of Landseer Road, Southwell, is charged in connection with the alleged stabbing of a 65-year-old man inside his home in Halam Hill, Halam, at 4.15am on Thursday 14 January. The victim suffered a single stab wound to the abdomen.

Brooks has been charged with attempted murder, attempted arson with intent to endanger life, and possession of a knife in a public place following an investigation by Nottinghamshire Police.

No pleas were entered at the short plea and trial preparation hearing at Nottingham Crown Court this morning.

Brooks was remanded in custody until his next hearing on 28 May. A trial lasting seven to ten days has been set to start on Monday 27 September.
