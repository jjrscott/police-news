Brave members of the public intervened to stop a man sexually assaulting an unconscious woman in broad daylight in Nottingham's Old Market Square.

Lee Hobster, 44, of no fixed address, admitted the attack and has now been jailed for 18 months.

He has also been ordered to sign the Sex Offenders’ Register for 10 years after appearing at Nottingham Crown Court on Wednesday 25 November 2020.

Members of the public intervened and retrained Hobster after he climbed on top of the half-naked woman, after she fell on the floor unconscious on 2 May, at around 5.20pm.

Hobster, a heavy drug user, then also passed out before officers arrived to detain him.

Detective Constable Jay Straw, from Nottinghamshire Police’s Public Protection department, led the investigation. She said: “Attacks of this nature that are committed in broad daylight are absolutely extraordinary and we know the level of concern that news of this incident naturally caused for anyone lives, works or visits near to the area.

“I would personally like to thank those members of the public who came to the woman’s aid and it is thanks to their help that our officers have been able to act as quickly as they have to make an arrest, protect the victim and put a man before the courts.

"Hobster is clearly a heavy drug user and he took advantage of a vulnerable woman in the middle of a busy city centre."
