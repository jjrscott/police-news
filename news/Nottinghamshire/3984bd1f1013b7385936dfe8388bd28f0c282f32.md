Detectives are appealing for witnesses and information after a delivery driver was reportedly robbed at knife-point in Basford.

The victim was delivering food to an address in Manor Croft when he was met by two men who threatened him with knives before stealing his scooter and mobile phone. He wasn't injured during the incident.

His scooter was later found abandoned in nearby woods and his phone was located down a drain.

The robbery happened just after 5.40pm on Wednesday 30 December 2020.

Detective Sergeant Lee Cattell, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "This must have been a terrifying experience for the delivery driver who thankfully wasn't hurt.

"I'd also like to reassure local residents that the force takes all reports of knife-related offences extremely seriously and we are continuing to work hard to understand the full circumstances of this incident.

"We understand that incidents like this can be concerning for communities and if you have any concerns please do not hesitate to speak to one of our local officers in the area.

"I'd urge anyone who witnessed this incident, anyone who may have CCTV footage or any drivers who may have captured dashcam footage to please get in contact with us by calling Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 495 of 30 December 2020, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
