Four teenagers were arrested after a stolen car was spotted pulling into a supermarket car park.

The car, stolen from an address in Marlborough Road, Beeston on Tuesday night, was seen by police officers outside Morrisons in Green Lane, Clifton, shortly before midday yesterday.

Four boys – two 17-year-olds and two 14-year-olds – were arrested shortly afterwards on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle and later released under investigation.

Two of the boys were also arrested on suspicion of cannabis possession.

Sergeant James Hirst, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “This vehicle had been reported stolen and its detailed circulated to officers. When it was spotted on a nearby ANPR camera we sent several response cars to look for it – eventually locating it in the supermarket car park. All in all this was a great bit of police work and I am delighted that this vehicle can now be returned to its rightful owner.”
