Police have arrested a suspect and are continuing their investigation after a man was robbed shortly after he got off a tram in Nottingham.

The victim got off at The Forest tram stop and had walked to the corner of Bentinck Road and Noel Street when he was approached by two men.

One of the men grabbed the victim's iPhone and punched him in the face before he walked off. The victim, a man aged in his 20s, suffered bruising to his face.

The robbery happened at around 6.30am on Tuesday 19 January 2021.

Following enquiries police arrested a 37-year-old man yesterday (Wednesday 24 February 2021) on suspicion of robbery.

Detective Constable Natasha Ullyatt, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "Our enquiries into this incident are ongoing and I'd urge anyone who saw what happened or who has any information which could assist us with our investigation to please come forward.

"We'd also like to hear from any drivers who were in the area around this time and who may have recorded dash-cam footage of this incident.

"Robbery is an incredibly serious offence which can have a lasting impact on its victims. I'd like to reassure people that we investigate all reports of robbery and work tirelessly to bring offenders to justice."

Anyone with any information about the robbery is urged to call Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 80 of 19 January 2021, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

The man arrested in connection with the robbery was subsequently released under investigation as officers continue with their enquiries.
