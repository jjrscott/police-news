Rainworth and Blidworth will be in the capable hands of Beat Manager PC Rachel Dowsett this New Year's Eve as Nottinghamshire prepares to bring in the New Year.

The 36-year-old, who has been with the force for nearly four years, will be taking on the night shift and along with her team will be helping to keep the area safe as we head into 2021.

Rachel said: "It's certainly going to be different this year with the current restrictions that are in place.

"Although we might not see people going out to the pubs and celebrating in the usual fashion, we are still going to be there and available for the community and will be out patrolling and making sure everyone brings in the New Year safely.

"We'll also be looking at the so-called 'fatal four' on the roads and ensuring that those who do travel do so safely. If you're planning on visiting your bubble for some bubbly, make sure you have appropriate plans to get home."

"For me, it's important to be around to help during the festive season as it's a time of year which we want everyone to enjoy as much as possible. Being around and able to offer reassurance when it's needed most for some members of the community is such a great feeling.

"A big part of neighbourhood policing is listening to the community and prioritising the issues that matter to them, and being able to do this personally is what the job is all about.

"I'm also really lucky to have an understanding family who are flexible when it comes to festive plans, so I'll be making the most of what we can do and looking forward to catching up with them around my shift.

"I hope everyone has had a fantastic Christmas and has a great New Year. Remember the restrictions and be responsible, but enjoy yourselves as much as possible.‚Äù
