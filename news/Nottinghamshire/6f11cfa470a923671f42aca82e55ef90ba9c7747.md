A large combat knife, drugs and cash were seized after police followed their noses and stopped a man in the street.

Officers were dealing with an unrelated matter in Furlong Street, Arnold, at around 3.45pm on Saturday when they were passed by somebody smelling strongly of cannabis.

After a very brief foot chase the man was searched. Two mobile phones were also found alongside a significant quantity of cannabis.

An 18-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possessing class B drugs with intent to supply and possession of a bladed article in a public place.

Detective Superintendent Andrew Gowan, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “This was a good bit of work by officers who quite literally followed their noses. We take the possession of drugs and weapons extremely seriously and will always stop and search people if we have reasonable suspicions.

"By doing so we can prevent further offending and even keep those individuals we stop safe from harm.”
