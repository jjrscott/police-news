Broxtowe’s neighbourhood policing teams and dedicated Operation Reacher team have been determined to make sure Christmas didn’t come early for shoplifters over the festive period.

The Eastwood and Beeston neighbourhood teams have been busy targeting prolific shoplifters in line with local priorities around shop theft, as well as working closely with retailers to tackle and prevent retail crime.

Their committed work has been supplemented by Operation Reacher colleagues, which has seen this team of seven full-time officers stepping up high visibility patrols in hot spot areas, while keeping a look-out for current outstanding shoplifters.

The Operation Reacher team, which launched on 5 October, cover the whole of the Broxtowe district including Beeston, Stapleford, Chilwell, Eastwood, Kimberley and Nuthall.

Its officers have already made their mark and flexed their muscles in tackling criminality.

This proactive work has included days of action in Eastwood, as part of a wider operation to disrupt drug-related crime, and being involved in arrests and searches following a shooting in Stapleford which involved high-visibility reassurance work in the area.

Since going live the team has been responsible for 20 arrests, 15 Warrants (24 house searches altogether), five vehicle seizures and two weapons seizures including the recovery of a ‘zombie-style’ knife.

Other notable successes include a couple of good drugs seizures from addresses in Eastwood and Trowell following the execution of drugs warrants.

Leading the way is Sergeant Liz Gaskin (pictured) who has nearly 20 years’ service with Nottinghamshire Police.

Sgt Gaskin said: “We are currently involved in patrols in town centres and retail parks as shop theft is a current priority for us due to the time of year.

“We will also be involved in Operation December which is focussed on the night-time economy and involves patrols during the weekends leading up Christmas and New Year’s Eve.

“We work very closely with our neighbourhood policing teams to address current priorities.

“A few of our main objectives are to be a visible presence within the borough, tackle local issues and obtaining and developing local intelligence to target local offenders.

“The Covid-19 pandemic has restricted the amount of engagement work we have been able to do to date but we are hoping that we will be able get involved in more community engagement events in the New Year once the restrictions are relaxed.”

Inspector Simon Riley added: “Our neighbourhood teams are continuing to make a real positive difference in their local communities, supported by our Op Reacher team which is now fully staffed and already making its presence felt.

“Our fantastic results to date make the community safer while sending the clear message that criminal behaviour will not be tolerated in Broxtowe.

“Sgt Gaskin and her team provide me with a flexible resource to tackle any issues that affect the district. They will endeavour to proactively target criminality and you can expect to see more warrants executed.

“Shop theft continues to be the largest volume acquisitive crime type across the borough.

“We have made a number of arrests of regular local shoplifters in the past few weeks and we will continue to target known and prolific offenders, who cause the most damage to our local economy.

“From experience these offenders will be responsible not only for shop thefts but other areas of acquisitive crime, such as motor vehicle crime, cycle theft and burglary, so by targeting these individuals we can hopefully drive reductions in other acquisitive crime types.”
