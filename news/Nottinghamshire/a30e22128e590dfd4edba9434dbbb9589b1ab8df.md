A bar in Nottingham has had £7,000 worth of alcohol stolen in a burglary.

The theft, from the bar Olivia’s Townhouse in Chapel Bar, was discovered after management were alerted to the break in.

The basement is believed to have been accessed and specialist alcohol which is not available to buy without a license was taken.

The business is currently closed due to national lockdown restrictions.

A 36-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of burglary following the break in.

Detective Sergeant Andy Hall, who is investigating the incidents, said: “We all know that hospitality businesses are some of the hardest hit by the Coronavirus pandemic, so the last thing they need is to be targeted by criminals.

“To think that someone would take advantage of a business being closed to help themselves to valuable stock is awful. People’s livelihoods are at stake and we will do everything we can to protect them.

“That is why we have worked so quickly to gather as much evidence as possible for this investigation and why we continue to work to ensure that businesses don’t lose out at the hands of a few selfish individuals.”
