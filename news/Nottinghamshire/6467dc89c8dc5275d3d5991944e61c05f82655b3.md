A robbery at a convenience store saw officers quickly arrest a man in connection with the report.

Three men were reported to have threatened shop assistants at the McColls store in Ash Crescent in Nuthall at around 10pm last night (Tuesday 29 December).

A man allegedly used a hammer to intimidate the assistants before the men stole tobacco and cash from a safe within the store.

The men are reported to have fled the scene.

Moments after a report was made to Nottinghamshire Police, a van believed to be linked to the investigation was spotted the junction of Bestwood Road and Hucknall Road.

When the car stopped in Thornbury Way in Top Valley, a 37-year-old man was quickly arrested on suspicion of robbery and possession of an offensive weapon after a hammer was recovered in a police search.

An investigation is now underway to establish the circumstances.

Detective Sergeant Luke Todd, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “This would have undoubtedly been a terrifying experience for the victims but luckily, no one was injured in the incident.

“Officers did a fantastic job to quickly locate and investigate a suspicious van believed to be linked to police enquiries and we are pleased to be questioning a man in connection with this report.

“Robbery is a serious offence and as a force we will always thoroughly investigate reports made to us.

“I would urge anyone who saw the incident last night, has any footage or any information that could aid us in our investigation to get in touch with Nottinghamshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 676 of 29 December 2020.”
