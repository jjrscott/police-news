Police are investigating after a man died in hospital after being involved in an assault.

The 39-year-old was taken to King's Mill Hospital in Sutton-in-Ashfield following the incident in Lansbury Gardens, Mansfield, at around 10.50am today (Monday 30 November) but he later died.

Police have arrested a 43-year-old man in connection with the incident and enquiries are continuing to establish the circumstances.

Detective Inspector Becky Hodgman, who is leading the investigation, said: "It is still very early in the investigation and we need to wait for the results of a post-mortem examination but we have made an arrest and we are not currently looking for anyone else in connection with the investigation.

"We are working hard to establish the full circumstances of the incident and would appeal for anyone who witnessed the assault or has any information that could help the enquiry to contact Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 194 of 30 November 2020."
