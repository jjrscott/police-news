A man has been left frightened after being approached by three teenagers who tried to take his bike off him whilst he tried to get to work.

The man was able to fight the offenders off, but was punched and suffered injuries to his face and body.

Detectives are appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident to come forward following the report of the attempt robbery on a busy Worksop road last month.

Detective Constable Emma Dalton is leading the investigation. She said: "This must have been a terrifying experience for the man who was approached by the three teenagers.

"Thankfully nothing was taken, the victim was incredibly brave.

"We are working hard to establish the full circumstances of this incident and checking CCTV footage as part of our ongoing enquiries.

"Nottinghamshire Police takes all reports of robbery offences extremely seriously and we are determined to trace the suspects responsible for this attack which we believe is an isolated incident with no wider risk to the public.

"The men have been described as all having local accents, wearing dark clothing and two of them had scarves around their faces.

"We are now appealing for anyone who may have seen the incident whilst driving past or have any information to come forward to help with our enquiries.

The incident happened around 9.30pm on 31 January on Retford Road near to the building site at the junction of High Hoe Road.

"If you can help please call 101, quoting incident number 21 of 1 February 2021."
