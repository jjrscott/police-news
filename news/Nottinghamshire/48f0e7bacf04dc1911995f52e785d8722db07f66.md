A 17-year-old boy was beaten up whilst he was on a family bike ride, with his parents having to step in and protect him from further attack.

The victim suffered a fractured jaw, but without his family coming to his assistance, his injuries could have been much work.

The victim was approached by a group of youths who without provocation pulled him to the floor, grabbed him by his throat and punched him.

Police Investigation Officer Russell Oliver is leading the investigation. He said: "This was a horrible attack which let the victim hospitalised. He has since returned home, but was in a great deal of pain and discomfort.

"We have to praise his mother's bravery who came to his aid after witnessing the assault. Without her stepping in, his injuries could have been much worse. She sadly also suffered minor injuries from protecting her son.

"We are now appealing to anyone who saw the incident at around 4.30pm on 14 February 2021 at the Forest Recreational Ground, near to the zig-zag path at the side of the Pavilion, on the opposite side to the children's play area.

"We believe the offenders were Asian boys, around 15-17 years old and they walked off towards the tram stop.

"One offender may have been slightly older, around 22 years old. He's been described as 6'2'' tall, medium build and wearing a beanie type hat and a black puffer style jacket.

"If you saw anything suspicious at around that time in the area please call 101, quoting incident number 465 of 16 February 2021."
