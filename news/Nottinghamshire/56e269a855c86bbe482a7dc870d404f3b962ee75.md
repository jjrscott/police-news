The force remembered those who died in the Holocaust, as well as those who were affected by genocides around the world, at Force Headquarters today.

This afternoon Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Barber lit a candle and gathered with officers and staff to hold a minute's silence as part of Holocaust Memorial Day (27 January 2021).

The Holocaust Memorial Day Trust has invited forces to take part in 'Light the Darkness', asking households across the UK to light a candle in their front windows at 8pm tonight to actively remember victims of Holocaust and recent genocides and to stand against hatred and division today.

The national commemoration day is dedicated to the remembrance of those who suffered as a result of the Holocaust and subsequent genocides.

The day remembers all victims of the Holocaust and other genocides and their families and friends.

DCC Barber said: "The force supports the day in respect of remembering all those who died during the Holocaust, alongside the millions of other people killed under Nazi Persecution and in genocides that followed in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and Darfur.

"Today marks the anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau, the largest Nazi death camp.

"The Holocaust and other genocides threatened the fabric of civilisation and showed the extreme outcomes of hatred and prejudice. It is important that we all honour the memory of those who died in these atrocities by ensuring we continue to challenge prejudice and hatred in all its guises."
