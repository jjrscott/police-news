Detectives investigating a burglary during which an offender smashed his way into a home with a hammer have made an arrest.

The incident took place shortly after 8.20pm on Thursday 3 December at an address in Hawthorn Close, Edwalton.

Two people were injured in a subsequent struggle before the offender fled the scene empty-handed.

A 53-year-old man was arrested this morning at an address in Nottingham by officers from the Rushcliffe Operation Reacher Team. He is being held on suspicion of aggravated burglary and remains in custody.

Detective Sergeant Luke Todd, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “This was a frightening incident not only for the victims, but also for other residents living nearby. Additional officers were deployed to the area in the aftermath of this incident, but I can understand the considerable local alarm generated.

“Clearly this was an extremely serious offence and we have been working very hard to track down suspects in the case. I am grateful to our colleagues in the Operation Reacher Team for responding so quickly and bringing this suspect into custody.”

If you have any further information on this incident please call 101 quoting incident 642 of 3 December.
