A driver who failed to stop for officers has been charged.

A van was spotted driving suspiciously by officers whilst on a proactive patrol in Mansfield Woodhouse on Thursday at around 11.20am.

The vehicle was reportedly doing loops around the area and driving dangerously.

His van stopped in Mapletoft Avenue and the man ran inside a property. He was quickly arrested and a quantity of cannabis was recovered from inside the vehicle.

Police Sergeant Ian Holmes is leading the investigation. He said: "Nottinghamshire Police takes incidents of reckless driving very seriously and will take proactive action against any drivers seen to be committing such offences.

“Not only does it put the driver and potential passengers at risk of serious harm but it also endangers the public – the costs can be fatal.

“Our officers did an excellent job to bring this incident to a safe conclusion.

“Thankfully, no one was seriously injured in the incident and we are now thoroughly investigating the circumstances.”

Jonathan Burton, 27, of Mapletoft Avenue in Mansfield Woodhouse has been charged with dangerous driving, failing to stop, driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence and driving with no insurance.

He has been remanded into custody and appeared at Nottingham Magistrates Court on 8 January 2021.
