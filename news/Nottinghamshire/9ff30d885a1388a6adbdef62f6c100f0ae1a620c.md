A man threw glasses and a chair after a large fight erupted in a Ruddington pub.

Quaid Gayle, 29, admitted his role in the violent disorder which broke out between two groups in the Red Heart in Easthorpe Street on the night of 19 September 2020.

Officers quickly attended and conducted enquiries into the incident. They found Gayle, of Broxtowe Lane, Broxtowe Estate, who had a large gash to his neck which needed hospital treatment.

CCTV footage from the pub showed Gayle throwing a glass during the incident before he was punched by another man.

The landlord managed to split up the fight and eject most of the offenders from the pub but as some of the men left they smashed a window and were still causing a problem as they left.

Gayle was arrested for his part in the incident and went on to plead guilty to a charge of affray.

He was given a 10-month prison sentence, suspended for 21 months, when he appeared at Nottingham Crown Court for sentencing on Monday (15 March 2021).

Investigator Shannon Hutchinson, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "Large scale violent disorder of this nature, which put the safety of other pub customers at risk, will not be tolerated.

"This was a shocking incident and it's very fortunate that it didn't result in more serious injuries.

"Nottinghamshire Police is committed to keeping people safe and we will always look to take robust action against those who commit such offences in our communities in order to protect the public."
