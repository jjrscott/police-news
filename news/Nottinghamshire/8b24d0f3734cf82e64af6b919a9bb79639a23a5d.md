Two men are due to appear in court charged with drug offences after police intercepted a car in the Tollerton area.

As a result of good police teamwork, Rushcliffe officers were able to stop a suspicious car in Tollerton Lane on Tuesday afternoon. The car and occupants were then searched and a significant quantity of suspected Class A drugs were recovered, resulting in two arrests.

Jonathon King, 30, of Hardy Street, Kimberley, and Luke Jeffers, 25, of Main Street, Gamston, are due to appear at Nottingham Magistrates' Court today charged with possession with intent to supply a Class A drug.

Inspector Craig Berry, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "The force is committed to tackling drug-related crime and all reports made to us are thoroughly investigated and we take positive action wherever possible.

"Rushcliffe detectives have been working hard on this particular investigation which has now led to two suspects being brought before the court.

“We work closely with local communities to tackle drug crime and I’d encourage anyone who has any concerns or sees something suspicious in their area to report it by calling Nottinghamshire Police on 101 or in an emergency, dial 999.”
