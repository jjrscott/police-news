Detectives investigating a fire at a gas valve in Trowell, which resulted in homes being evacuated, are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

Nottinghamshire Police, Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service and Cadent were called to the blaze in Pit Lane, at the junction with Stapleford Road, just after 5.50pm yesterday (Tuesday 16 March 2021).

Following advice from gas safety experts, properties were evacuated while emergency services dealt with the incident.

Affected residents, who were temporarily relocated to a nearby community centre and parish hall, were able to return to their homes by 1.25am today (Wednesday 17 March 2021).

No injuries were reported and a joint fire and police investigation is now under way to establish the full circumstances of the blaze.

Detective Constable Tony Tonks, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “We’re working closely with fire service colleagues on this investigation and I’m appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the fire, any drivers who may have captured dashcam footage of the incident or who has any information that could aid us with our enquiries to please call Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 682 of 16 March.
