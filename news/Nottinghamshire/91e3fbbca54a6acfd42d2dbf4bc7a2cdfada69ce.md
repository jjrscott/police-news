A man has been remanded in custody after appearing in court charged in connection with a distraction burglary in Kirkby-in-Ashfield.

Kevin Gamble, 61, of no fixed address, appeared at Nottingham Magistrates' Court on Thursday (25 February 2021) charged with burglary.

He was remanded in custody until his next appearance at Nottingham Crown Court on 25 March 2021.

The charge relates to a report of a man who allegedly tricked his way into a pensioner's home in Hartley Road, Kirkby-in-Ashfield, telling her that he worked for the council, before stealing her handbag on 8 February 2021.

Detective Sergeant Andrew Hall, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "I'd like to reassure people that Nottinghamshire Police will investigate reports of burglary and relentlessly pursue those suspected to be committing these type of upsetting crimes.

"Distraction burglary is a terrible crime. It’s an invasion of your privacy in the place you should feel safest and we understand the trauma it causes.

"Distraction burglars often prey on our most vulnerable residents, tricking their way into homes by making up stories, by pretending to work for an official company or asking for help to try to gain entry.

"We want to remind people to be on their guard, especially if someone you’re not expecting – a man, woman or even a child – knocks on your door.

"Don't allow anyone without valid identification access to your home and, if you're unsure, don't let them in. Keep the chain on the door while talking to them and check with the company that the person is purporting to be from.

"Our advice is always to say no to cold-callers and to report any suspicious activity. If you see somebody acting suspiciously report it to the police immediately by calling 101 or, in an emergency, call 999.

"Residents, particularly the elderly and those who live alone, should remain vigilant and ensure that their home is secure at all times.

"We’d also urge those who know people who are potentially at risk, to advise them of the signs, remind them to not let in unexpected callers and what to do if they are targeted."
