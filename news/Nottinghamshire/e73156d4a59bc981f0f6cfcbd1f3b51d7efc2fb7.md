Nottinghamshire Police is appealing for information following a robbery in Worksop.

Officers were called to Strelley Road in Strelley, Nottingham, just before 4.30pm yesterday (23 December) to a report that a 16-year-old boy had been threatened with a knife and headbutted before thieves took his scooter.

Detective Inspector Ruby Burrow, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Violence of any kind is complete inexcusable and we take any reports involving knives particularly seriously.

“We would like to hear from anyone who may have seen what happened. Please come forward and help us with our enquiries.”

Anyone with information should call Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 476 of 23 December 2020.
