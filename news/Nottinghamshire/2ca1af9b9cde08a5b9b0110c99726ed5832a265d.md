Fines were issued to four people after police broke up an illegal house party.

Officers were called to an address in Linby Road, Hucknall, shortly before 3am this morning (Saturday) when loud music was reported to be coming from inside.

When they arrived they found four adults at the property – three of whom did not live at the address. They were each handed fixed penalty notices for £200.

Another person is believed to have fled the scene when officers arrived.

Assistant Chief Constable Gerard Milano, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "The current lockdown legislation is very clear that mixing indoors with people you don’t live with, or have a support bubble with, is not allowed. This was a flagrant breach of the rules and was dealt with accordingly.

“However, it is also important to recognise that these individuals are very much in the minority. The vast majority of people are making the necessary sacrifices to adhere to the rules and we thank them for their continued support.”

Police also now have the power to issue tougher £800 fines to people found at indoor gatherings of more than 15 people. These fines will also double for each repeat offence to a maximum of £6,400.
