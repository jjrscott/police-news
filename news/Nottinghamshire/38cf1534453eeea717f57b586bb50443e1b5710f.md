If you are trying to reclaim your vehicle following its seizure for being used without insurance and/or an unlicensed driver please note the following;

Due to the current national lockdown and the impact this has had on the Nottinghamshire Police Front Counter Service we now ask that you email all your documents to Section165@nottinghamshire.pnn.police.uk where they will be validated and if in order you will be issued with a release notice allowing you to collect your vehicle.

We will require details of your driving licence along with proof of ownership (V5C registration document ideally but if not a verifiable form of receipt) and your certificate of insurance (not the schedule). All photographs must be clear and show the full document. Any that do not comply will be rejected and may result in a delay which may add extra storage charges to your release fees.

Please note as part of the release procedure, if your insurance is a new policy, we will speak with the Motor Insurers Bureau to establish if you disclosed the seizure of the vehicle and a pending prosecution – if you have not it is highly likely the insurance company will cancel the policy with immediate effect.

Please do not send chasing emails as this will tie up the process and create delays but do answer any queries our staff may have in a prompt manner.

If you are unable to email these documents then please arrange to visit Radford Rd Police Station, Mansfield Police Station or Newark Police Station for a face to face production – do not turn up unannounced as you may be turned away
