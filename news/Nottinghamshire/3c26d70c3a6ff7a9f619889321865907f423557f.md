A 43-year-old man has been released under Investigation following his arrest in connection with a man's death.

He was arrested following an incident in Mansfield where a man died in hospital after being involved in an assault.

A 39-year-old man was taken to King's Mill Hospital in Sutton-in-Ashfield following an assault in Lansbury Gardens, Mansfield, at around 10.50am on Monday (30 November),but he later died.

Police arrested a 43-year-old man on suspicion of ABH in connection with the incident.

Detective Inspector Becky Hodgman, who is leading the investigation, said: "We quickly made an arrest and the man has since been released under investigation. We are not currently looking for anyone else in connection with the investigation.

"We are now waiting for the results of a post-mortem examination.

"We continue to work hard to establish the full circumstances of the incident and would appeal for anyone who witnessed the assault or has any information that could help the enquiry to contact Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 194 of 30 November 2020."
