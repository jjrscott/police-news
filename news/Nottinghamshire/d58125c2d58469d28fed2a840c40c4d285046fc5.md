Further searches took place at houses in Annesley and a quantity of class A drugs were recovered. One of the 22-year-old men was further arrested on possession with intent to supply class A drugs.

Detective Sergeant Matt Scott, said: "This case highlights how we work collaboratively across several policing teams to ensure all trails of enquiries are followed up.

The man remains in custody while enquiries continue.
