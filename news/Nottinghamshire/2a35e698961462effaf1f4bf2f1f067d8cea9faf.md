Police are appealing for witnesses and information after a woman and her dog were bitten.

They were walking along Leybourne Drive, Bestwood, at around 11.30am on Wednesday 17 February when they were attacked by a loose dog.

The animal, described as a being a brown colour Staffordshire Bull Terrier type dog with black fecks, is said to have followed the woman before attacking her dog.

As she fought to free her animal form the dog’s jaws she was bitten on the finger. Her dog escaped without serious injury

Officers are now seeking to track down the owner of the offending dog, which was wearing a distinctive leather harness with brass oval shaped medallions on it.

PC Chris Armstrong, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “This was a frightening and distressing intendent that could have been a lot worse. This animal was wandering around with no owner in sight and launched an unprovoked attack.

“We are then keen to track down its owner and would like to speak to anyone who may have information based on the dog’s description. Its harness in particular is quite distinctive, and is said to resemble a wrestling belt. So if you have seen this dog and now the identity of its owner, please give us a call on 101 quoting incident 195 of 14 February.”
