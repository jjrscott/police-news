Eagle-eyed police officers have been praised after spotting a reported stolen vehicle driving suspiciously in the early hours this morning and making two quick arrests.

Operational Support officers saw a Citroen vehicle driving at speed in Lowmoor Road in Kirkby-in-Ashfield. Moments later they discovered that it had crashed into three stationary vehicles and had left the scene.

One man was quickly located and detained on suspicion of drink-driving.

Officers subsequently made enquiries at the registered keeper's address in Sutton-in-Ashfield and a vehicle in connection with a car key burglary overnight was located.

Over an hour later, officers in the area located a second man from a nearby garden and he was arrested.

Detective Sergeant Dave Prest of Nottinghamshire Police is leading the investigation. He said: "This was fantastic work by Operational Support officers this morning who made two quick arrests.

"Officers were called to Lowmoor Road in Kirkby at around 3.15am this morning following a report of a car key burglary.

"Two men aged 24 and 38 have been arrested on suspicion of burglary and drink-driving and remain in police custody.

"This positive result was thanks to excellent work by a number of officers to first locate the stolen vehicle and then arrest the subject.

"Their professionalism, tenacity and team work resulted in this incident being brought to a safe conclusion.

"Nottinghamshire Police takes burglary extremely seriously and we continue to work hard and thoroughly investigate all incidents reported to us."
