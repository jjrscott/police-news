A delivery van containing more than 200 parcels was stolen yesterday afternoon, whilst the delivery driver was posting packages.

Officers were called to Outram Street in Sutton-in-Ashfield at around 2pm following a report of a theft of a van with keys left in the vehicle.

The van was traced by Operational Support officers who were deployed to the area with pre-emptive tactics.

Having monitored the vehicle's tracker, the van was located parked up on Penine Close and two men aged 44 and 45 were arrested on suspicion of theft by officers.

All packages were accounted for, however a mobile phone was stolen.

Police Sergeant Ian Holmes of Nottinghamshire Police said: "We were called on Monday following a report of a delivery van being stolen as the vehicle's keys were left in the ignition.

"This was excellent and speedy police work by officers who made two quick arrests.

"One man has now been charged in connection with the incident.

"It's absolutely unacceptable for a delivery driver to be targeted in this way as they go about their job, making an honest living and the victim has been left shaken by what happened as you can imagine."

Andrew James, 44, of no fixed address has since been charged with theft from vehicle and is due to appear Nottingham Magistrates Court later this week.

The 45-year-old man will receive no further action.
