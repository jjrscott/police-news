A man who forced his way into a woman’s home before strangling, punching and slashing her with a knife has been sentenced.

Paul Green, 53, forced his way into the property on the evening of 24 August this year and launched two attacks on his victim – pinning her to the floor and slashing at her head and body with a decorator’s knife before punching her repeatedly.

The attack was eventually stopped by a heroic neighbour who’d heard the commotion at the address in Clifton and rushed to intervene – pinning Green to the floor as police rushed to the scene.

His victim suffered several slash arks to her body, arms and legs, as well as bruising and a fractured eye-socket.

Green, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm at an earlier hearing.

Appearing at Nottingham Crown Court today he was sentenced to 12 months in prison suspended for 18 months.

Detective Constable Michael Powis, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “This was as shocking and sustained attack on a female victim that was only brought to a close by the brave intervention of a member of the public. The level of violence used in this attack caused significant injuries to the victim – who must also now live with the emotional impact of what happened that day.

“I would like to place on record my thanks to the man who intervened so bravely. Without his actions his incident may have been even more serious.”
