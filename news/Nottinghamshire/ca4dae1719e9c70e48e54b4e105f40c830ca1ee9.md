A 23-year-old man has been charged with affray and criminal damage.

The charges relate to an incident on 13 November at around 5pm in St Ann's, when it was reported that a man holding a firearm was banging on a woman's door.

Officers were quickly on the scene and no one was injured in the incident.

Elijah Henry, of Moorgate Street in Radford, has been remanded in custody and will appear at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court today (28 November).

There was a further incident on 14 November when it was reported that a man brandished a firearm and fired it in a woman’s direction.

Damien McCue, 32, of Courtenay Gardens in St Ann's has previously been charged with possession of an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence, affray, criminal damage and breach of a restraining order following both incidents.

Detective Constable Naomi Spencer, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Clearly any report of a firearm is an extremely serious matter and we’ve been working around the clock to get to the bottom of what happened.

“No one should have to live in fear of violence and Nottinghamshire Police works hard to ensure that our city is as safe a place to live as possible.

"We would still like to hear from anyone with information which could help the investigation. Please contact us by calling 101 if you know anything about what happened."
