A woman will appear in court charged with breaching Covid regulations.

Officers from Nottinghamshire Police were called just after 1am on 24 December to a report of a gathering in Carlton Road, Worksop.

When officers arrived they found two people at an address who did not live there. A man and a woman were given a fine for breach of Covid regulations and instructed to go home.

Around half an hour later Nottinghamshire Police received a further report that a woman had returned to the property.Edyta Ostrowska, 47, of Carlton Road in Worksop, has been charged with breaching Covid-19 regulations.

Superintendent Kev Broadhead, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “The national legislation is in place to stop the spread of the virus and protect the NHS.

“We’ll continue to continue to engage with people and use enforcement as a last resort.”

Ostrowska has been released on bail and will next appear at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court on 9 February 2021.
