A woman was arrested after a stand-off in Carlton-in-Lindrick was safely resolved.

Nottinghamshire Police officers were called to Oxford Road shortly after 4.15pm yesterday (Monday 15 March 2021) responding to concerns for a woman’s safety.

When police quickly arrived the woman was inside the address and was refusing to unlock the door.

She was holding a knife as specially-trained officers continued to engage with her.

Following their negotiations with the woman the incident was brought to a safe conclusion by 5.05pm after she came out of the address.

A 55-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of affray, criminal damage, making threats to kill and racially-aggravated public order. She remains in custody.

Inspector Sue Wain, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “This was a contained incident with no threat to the wider public and following careful negotiations with the woman we were able to bring the incident to a safe conclusion.

“I would like to thank people in the area for their patience as we worked to resolve the incident.”
