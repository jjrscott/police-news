Officers have charged a man after an in-depth investigation has resulted in a second person being detained following a terrifying attack on residents in the Kimberley area.

A 40-year-old man has been charged with aggravated burglary and taking without owner's consent.

The charges relate to an incident in Spring Hill in Kimberley which saw two elderly victims being tied up and a car being stolen.

Detective Sergeant Luke Todd of Nottinghamshire Police led the investigation. He said: "Burglary is an incredibly upsetting crime and can be terrifying for victims, especially if it is also accompanied by violence.

"We take incidents such as this one extremely seriously and will continue to work hard to tackle burglary.

"We are really pleased with the result. I'd like to thank the officers who have dedicated so much time to ensure both of the suspects for this incident have now been charged and remanded."

Dale Adam Wright, 40, of Eastwood has been remanded into custody and will appear at Nottingham Magistrates Court today (21 of December 2020).
