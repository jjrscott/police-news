Keen-eyed police officers spotted a man acting suspiciously in The Meadows whilst on a proactive patrol and seized a quantity of class A drugs.

Plain-clothed officers from the Operation Compass team, a proactive operation which targets drug offences across the city, witnessed activity in an alleyway in the area on Thursday morning (18 March 2021).

The 39-year-old was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply crack cocaine, heroin and cannabis.

A mobile phone, an amount of cash and a tablet were also seized as part of the investigation.

City South Neighbourhood Inspector Karl Thomas praised officers following the arrest. He said: "This was fantastic work by plain clothed officers who spotted something suspiciously and followed it up and made a great arrest.

"I would like to take the opportunity to thank Police Sergeant Paul Whitehead and his team for their assistance and this is another great example of team work.

"Drug dealing causes a significant amount of harm in our community and often leads to increase in other types of crime. That’s why we focus so much catching the people involved and removing drugs from our streets.

“Tackling drug related crime is one of our three main community priorities, which are set by members of the public.

"If you are concerned about crime where you live please contact us. We will listen and we will take action.

"Officers spotted a man around 11am on Thursday and detained him in an alleyway on Houseman Garden. He has since been released under investigation."
