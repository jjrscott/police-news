A Nottinghamshire Road was closed overnight after an elderly woman suffered a medical episode before a three car collision.

Officers on patrol sighted a car on the wrong side of Mansfield Road in Arnold at around 6.45pm yesterday (Saturday 5 December), as they were turning around, it had collided with two other vehicles.

The woman remains in hospital in a critical condition. There were no other reported injuries.

The serious collision investigation unit attended and the road was closed until 6am today to allow for the investigation.

Detective Constable Sarah Stables, said: "We have conducted thorough enquiries and believe the woman in her 70s sadly suffered a stroke.

"We're grateful that no one else was injured and that officers were instantly on scene having seen the car being driven strangely.

"They were able to commence first aid until ambulance colleagues arrived and provide support to those involved."

"Our thoughts are with the woman and her family at this time."
