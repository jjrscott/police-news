A man was rushed to hospital after he was found with multiple injuries.

Officers was called to the scene to find a man injured at the bottom of a driveway.

An ambulance was called and he was immediately taken to hospital for treatment.

Response officers stopped two men nearby and arrested them in connection with the investigation.

The man receiving treatment was later arrested for affray in connection with the incident.

Detective Sergeant Nick Wood is leading the investigation. He said: "We know that incidents of this nature will be a cause of real concern for many people living nearby but I would like to reassure the community that our officers have responded quickly, which has made these arrests possible.

"â€œWe will have officers patrolling the area to offer reassurance to residents following the incident.

"Nottinghamshire Police was called at around 1.40am this morning following a report of a disturbance.

"Officers swiftly attended Mildenhall Crescent in Bestwood and arrested two men aged 22 and 21 on suspicion of affray. A third arrest was made when a 30-year-old man was detained later this morning. All three men remain in custody, as detectives continue their investigation.

"Thankfully none of the men's injuries are believed to be life threatening or altering. We believe this is an isolated incident with no danger to the rest of the community."

Detectives are appealing to anyone who witnessed the assault or who has any information about those responsible to speak to those officers or to call Nottinghamshire Police on 101 as soon as possible and quote incident number 33 of 250 of February 2021.
