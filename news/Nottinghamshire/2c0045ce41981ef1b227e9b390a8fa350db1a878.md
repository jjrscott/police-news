A man has been charged after an alleged brick attack, which saw two people suffering head injuries.

It was reported a man punched a woman in the face and hit a man over the head with a brick. A car was also damaged in the same incident, before the man allegedly ripped out fence posts out of a garden nearby.

Police was called to the address in Eastwood at around 8.45pm on Monday (1 March 2021) following a report of an assault. Response officers managed to track down a man quickly to make the arrest.

Detective Sergeant Dave Nicks is leading the investigation. He said: "Weapons offences are very serious and we will always thoroughly investigate reports of such incidents.

â€œOfficers did an excellent job to attend the scene and arrest a suspect within minutes of the call being made to Nottinghamshire Police.

"It was reported that a man confronted the pair, before assaulting them. Both victims head injuries has been described as not life threatening.

"A knife was also recovered from the scene.

"A 55-year-old man was detained nearby shortly after the report and arrested and following an investigation has been charged.

"We believe this is an isolated incident, with no danger to the rest of the community."

Mark Wilson of Franklin Road in Jacksdale has been charged with six offences. They include actual bodily harm, assault by beating, possession of a bladed article, possession of an offensive weapon and two counts of criminal damage.

He has been remanded into custody after appearing in court yesterday. He's due to appear in court next on 31 March 2021.
