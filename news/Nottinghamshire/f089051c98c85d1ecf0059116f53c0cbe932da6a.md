Detectives investigating a robbery in Eastwood have charged a man in connection with the incident.

Unthank is appeared at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court yesterday.

Detective Sergeant Frank Guddemi, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Robbery is a serious offence and we always investigated reports thoroughly.

“Thankfully the victim was not seriously injured in this incident but, as with any violent offence, there is always potential for it escalate.
