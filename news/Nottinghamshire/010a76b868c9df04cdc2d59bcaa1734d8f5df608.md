Police are investigating after a man died following a collision with a lorry on the A1M near Worksop.

Officers from Nottinghamshire Police were called out to the A1 at Blyth just before midnight last night (Tuesday 23 March), following reports of a man being hit by a lorry.

The man was pronounced dead at the scene.

The north and southbound carriageways were closed for several hours, with the southbound remaining closed until 8am this morning (Wednesday 24). This was to enable Nottinghamshire's serious collision investigation unit to carry out their work, with early morning rush-hour traffic diverted away from the area.

Collision Investigator Louise Melbourne, said: "We are continuing our enquiries into this tragic incident.

"We have informed the man's family, who are from the Doncaster area, and are supporting them through this difficult time. They are asking for their privacy to be respected.

"We're now appealing to anyone who saw what happened or for any drivers with dash cam footage from the area around the time it happened to get in touch.

"Please contact us on 101 quoting incident 890 of 23 March."

People can also call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 if they have any information that can help.
