A third man has been interviewed in connection with an aggravated burglary, which saw a woman being assaulted and threatened with a knife.

It was reported that a group of men entered a house in Vernon Road in Kirkby-in-Ashfield in the early hours of 24 March 2020 and stealing a mobile phone.

The woman was stabbed in the face and suffered minor injuries to her cheek and hand.

Officers interviewed a 21-year-old man on suspicion of aggravated burglary this morning in Burton-upon-Trent after gathering intelligence as part of their investigation.

Detective Sergeant David Prest is leading the investigation. He said: "Officers continue to work hard to ensure justice is done for the victim who suffered injuries to her face.

"This incident last year would have undoubtedly been terrifying for the victim and we have worked hard to identify who did this to her.

"Through our enquires we have interviewed another man on suspicion of aggravated burglary, he has since been released under investigation.

"The force takes reports of burglaries and weapon-related offences extremely seriously. Time may pass but we will find those responsible.

"Enquiries into the incident are ongoing and I'm pleased that as a result of a lot of hard work we have now been able to interview another person. Previously officers had detained two teenage boys aged 17 and 16 and they were released under investigation."
