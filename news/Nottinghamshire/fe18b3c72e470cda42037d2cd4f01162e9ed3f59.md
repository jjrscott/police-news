Nottinghamshire Police have issued a picture of a man with a tattoo they would like to speak to in connection with a burglary.

The incident happened at around 9pm on 7 November in Dorket Drive in Lenton where a house burglary was reported.

It was also reported that someone has entered a house and stolen bank cards were used close by at the Co-op in Middleton Boulevard in Lenton.

Detective Constable Colin Kirkup is leading the investigation. He said: "Burglary is one of the most upsetting crimes anyone can suffer and it leaves the home owner with a series of practical and emotional issues to resolve.

"It was reported that the bank cards were taken from a purse, as well as a laptop, iPad and a bag were also stolen.

"We would like to speak to the man pictured to help with our enquiries. The man has a tattoo visible on his left hand, which people might recognise.

"If anyone recognises him please call 101, quoting incident number 629 of 7 November 2020."
