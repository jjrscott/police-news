Police are appealing for witnesses and information after a distinctive orange motorbike was stolen from a garage.

Officers say the distinctive bike was taken in Colindale Gardens in Nuthall on the evening of New Year's Eve.

Police Constable Lisa Hopkin is now leading the investigation. She said: "The owner is clearly devastated to have his pride of joy taken.

"The bike was stolen from a garage in Nuthall between 6pm on 31 December and 10.30am on New Year's Day.

"We are now asking people to contact us if they have seen this distinctive bike anywhere or saw anything suspicious at the time of the burglary.

â€œNottinghamshire Police takes all reports of burglary seriously.

"We are also appealing for members of the public to check their dash cam footage and get in touch with us if you can help with our enquiries.

"If you can help with our enquiries please call 101, quoting incident number 539 of 1 January 2021.

"We are also keeping an eye on online selling sites too, as due to their colours, they will be very noticeable on any attempted sale."

**Keep your bicycle safe and secure**

Bicycles are often targeted by thieves because they are left poorly secured or not secured at all. It takes just a few seconds for the opportunist thief to steal a bike that is left unsecured.

Around 3,000 bikes are stolen in Nottinghamshire every year.
