Detective Sergeant Gary Hewson of Nottinghamshire Police is leading the investigation. He said: "This must have been a terrifying experience for the victim who reported the aggravated burglary in Hall Lane in Brinsley at around 3.15pm yesterday.

"Officers arrived and saw a vehicle leaving the scene, whilst other men were spotted to have ran from the scene.

"They were located in the immediate vicinity of the incident within minutes and detained.

"Two 20-year-old men and two 17-years-old have been arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary. They remain in police custody.

"Thankfully no one was injured."

“Nottinghamshire Police takes all reports of burglary seriously and any reports involving violence are something which we work extremely hard to tackle.

“I would urge anyone with information about this incident to come forward and help the investigation.
