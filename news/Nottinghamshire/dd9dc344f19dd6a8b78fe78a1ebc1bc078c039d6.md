Nottinghamshire Police officers were on a routine licence check in Hucknall in October 2020 when they came across a man operating without the necessary paperwork.

Following a search in the area a reported stolen car was located from an address in Radcliffe-on-Trent.

The man was arrested yesterday (5 January 2021) before further searches happened in Heanor and in Wigwam Lane in Hucknall.

Detective Sergeant Gary Hewson is leading the investigation. He said: "This was excellent work by officers, working closely with Derbyshire Constabulary counterparts to locate and arrest a man in connection with an incident last October.

"He was taken into custody and has since been bailed with conditions.

"We won’t tolerate people committing this invasive and upsetting crime and we won’t stop targeting those we believe to be responsible for such crimes, which we know causes concern in our communities."
