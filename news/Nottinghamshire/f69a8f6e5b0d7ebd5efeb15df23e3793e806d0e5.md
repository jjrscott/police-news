A driver has rammed a police car before speeding off and crashing.

Officers from Nottinghamshire Police were called just after 10.20pm yesterday (16 December) to a report than a man was throwing bricks at cars in Leighton Street in St Ann’s, Nottingham.

When officers arrived a driver rammed one of the police cars before driving off out of sight. The car was found crashed in Carlton Road in St Ann’s.

No one was injured in the incident but a car windscreen was broken and the police car sustained minor damage.

A 22-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and dangerous driving.

Neighbourhood Inspector James Walker, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “We will not tolerate our officers or vehicles being targeted and damaged.

“This sort of behaviour is completely inexcusable and could have put officers and the public at risk, which is why we take incidents of this nature so seriously.

“We will thoroughly investigate and use the full force of the law against anyone who puts our officer in danger.”

Anyone who saw what happened who has not already spoken to officers should call Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 696 of 16 December.
