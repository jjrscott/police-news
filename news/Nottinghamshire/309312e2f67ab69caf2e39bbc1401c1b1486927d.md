A man and a woman have been charged in connection with the importation of drugs following a warrant being executed on Tuesday.

Officers searched a house in Arnside Road in Bestwood following information of Class A and B drugs being imported into the country.

Detective Sergeant Lee Cattell is leading the investigation. He said: "This was a complex investigation with different departments across the force working together.

"Nottinghamshire Police is committed to tackling drugs-related offences, as we know the impact that these kinds of offences have on the communities we serve.

“The swift action taken in this case by Nottinghamshire Police detectives and officers is further evidence of that commitment, which also sends a clear message that anyone suspected of committing these kinds of offences can expect to be swiftly investigated and brought before the courts.”

The warrant resulted in Jaurdan Scarlett, 31 of Arnside Road and Orville Brown, 53 of Pine View, Radford being arrested.

The pair have since been charged with conspire to fraudulent evade a prohibition on the importation of class A and B drugs.

They have been remanded in custody and due to appear at Nottingham Crown Court on 4 February 2021.
