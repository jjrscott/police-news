Police are investigating the recovery of hundreds of cannabis plants from a house in Mapperley.

Officers from Nottinghamshire Police investigated a report of suspicious activity at the property in Mapperley Plains at around 5pm yesterday evening.

When they entered the house, they found an estimated 195 plants inside across the upstairs bedrooms along with equipment capable of growing more plants throughout the house.

The plants have now been recovered and an investigation is underway to establish the circumstances of the find.

Inspector Chris Pearson, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “As a force, Nottinghamshire Police takes drug crime very seriously and will always work to investigate reports of such incidents.

“Strong collaborations with our local community led to a report of suspicious activity in the area and that is testament to the work we do to form strong relationships with residents and businesses.

“That is why it is really important that if you spot any suspicious activity in your local area that you report it to police.”

If you spot something out of the ordinary in your area or have any concerns, please report them to Nottinghamshire Police on 101 or in an emergency, dial 999.
