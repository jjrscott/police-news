A 23-year-old was taken to hospital after being struck with a sword following an altercation with a group of men.

It was reported that the man's injuries could have been worse had a woman not intervened.

The man was stabbed with the weapon and was taken to Queen's Medical Centre with a non-life threatening injury to his ankle.

Detectives are now appealing for any information and witnesses to come forward to help with their enquiries.

Detective Constable Julian Eminson-Ferry of Nottinghamshire Police is leading the investigation.

He said: "A man was reportedly stabbed and suffered minor injuries at around 5pm on Monday (15 March 2021) on Main Street in Burton Joyce.

"Officers were swiftly on the scene following the report and searched the area, but couldn't find anyone in relation to the incident.

"This incident could have had far more serious consequences had a woman not intervened, which encouraged the group of offenders to leave the scene.

"We are appealing to anyone who saw anything or anyone suspicious in the area to contact the force immediately.

"The man has since been discharged from hospital.

"This would have been a frightening incident for people to witness and we are keen to resolve it as quickly as possible.

“Knife crime is never acceptable and is something which we are committed to tackling.

“I would like to reassure the local community that officers were quickly on the scene to ensure that there was no risk to the wider public.

"If anyone has any information please call 101 quoting incident number 703 of 15 March 2021."
