Two city pubs were left counting the cost after they were targeted by the same burglar within days.

Daniel Evans smashed the glass panel on a door to get into a city centre pub during the early hours of 3 December 2020.

Evans, 30, formerly of Larkdale Street, Radford, stole a Lenovo tablet and a quantity of spirits from the business.

Three days later Evans broke into another pub in the Lenton area. A window was smashed but nothing was taken.

Evans was arrested by officers from Nottinghamshire Police's City Centre Operation Reacher Team after being identified from CCTV footage. A sample of blood left at the scene of the second burglary was also matched to him.

Evans went on to plead guilty to two charges of burglary and he was jailed for a total of eight months when he appeared at Nottingham Crown Court for sentencing on Monday (1 March 2021).

Inspector Paul Gummer, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Evans had no regard whatsoever for the financial impact his selfish actions had on these two businesses, especially in these difficult times caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

“We are passionate about protecting our business communities and are pleased that good police work resulted in Evans being brought to justice.

“I'd like to reassure our local businesses that the force treats commercial burglary very seriously.

“We will investigate reports and continue to deal robustly with anyone believed to be involved in such crimes and work hard to secure justice for burglary victims."
