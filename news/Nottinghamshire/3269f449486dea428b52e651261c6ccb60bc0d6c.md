Officers have been praised for bringing an incident to a safe conclusion after a man locked himself inside a house armed with a knife for four hours.

Police had gone to the address to arrest the man for an alleged breach of a court order connected to antisocial behaviour but he refused to leave the house.

Negotiators were called in to speak to the man after officers became concerned for the man's safety and engaged with him for around four hours before he finally agreed to leave the property safely.

He was arrested on suspicion of breach of a court order and possession of cannabis following the incident in Chestnut Grove, Mansfield Woodhouse, which started at 9.36am yesterday (Saturday 9 January 2021).

Superintendent Paul Winter, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "It started as a routine arrest attempt but quickly escalated and at times officers were concerned for the man's wellbeing.

"Specially trained negotiators were called in to speak to the man and thankfully were able to defuse the situation and ensure he could be brought in to the police station safely and calmly to be dealt with. It was a great team effort from the attending officers and negotiators to bring this to a peaceful conclusion."
