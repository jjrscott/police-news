A woman was punched in the face and had her mobile phone stolen by a man carrying a bottle of vodka.

The suspect was reported to have demanded cash from the woman before pushing her and hitting her in Sherbrooke Road, Carrington, at 4.40pm yesterday (Saturday 26 December).

Police also received a report that a man pushed his way into a house in Ravensmore Road, Carrington, and demanded food before leaving at around 5.15pm yesterday.

Police attended and arrested a 25-year-old man on suspicion of robbery in connection with the first incident. A mobile phone was also recovered. He was also arrested on suspicion of burglary in connection with the second incident.

Detective Sergeant Chris Berryman, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "The robbery was a distressing incident for the victim who was approached in the street.

"Officers have made an arrest and have made enquiries in the area but if anyone witnessed either of the incidents I would still appeal for them to come forward and call Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 384 of 26 December 2020."
