Police are seeking the public's help after a burglar broke into a West Bridgford home while the victim was sleeping upstairs.

The victim, a man aged in his 50s, was awoken by a loud noise coming from the downstairs of his property in Parkstone Close at around 2am on Sunday (28 February 2021).

A burglar had smashed a kitchen door window and climbed through to get in. The victim saw the man and challenged him before the suspect ran out of his home and into his garden before fleeing on foot towards Compton Acres.

Due to being disturbed he was only able to steal a money box containing a small quantity of cash.

The suspect is white, between 5ft 9ins and 5ft 10ins tall and was wearing black clothing and a black balaclava. He was carrying a dark medium- size bag.

Detective Sergeant Gary Hewson, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "This would have been terrifying ordeal for the victim who woke up to find this intruder in his home.

"Officers attended and searched the area and we are continuing to working hard to trace the suspect.

"As a force we take burglary incredibly seriously and as we progress with our enquiries we're appealing for anyone who saw anything suspicious around the time of the incident to please get in contact with us.

"We're also urging anyone who may have recorded CCTV or dash-cam footage relating to this distressing incident to please come forward.

"If you have any information which could assist us with our investigation please call Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 74 of 28 February 2021, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
