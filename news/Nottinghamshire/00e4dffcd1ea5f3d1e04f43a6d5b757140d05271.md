A man has been arrested after a rooftop stand-off in Mansfield was safely resolved.

Nottinghamshire Police officers were called to Westfield Lane just before 1.45pm today (Sunday 21 March 2021).

The road was blocked off while they dealt with a man who had climbed onto the roof of the old bus station off Lindley Street and started throwing roof tiles, causing damage to a number of vehicles.

Negotiators managed to talk him down and he was arrested at around 6.30pm on suspicion of affray and criminal damage.

Inspector Hayley Crawford, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Thanks to the efforts of officers on the scene, including trained negotiators, the incident has now come to a safe conclusion and a man has been taken into police custody.

“I would like to thank people in the area for their patience as we worked to resolve the incident.”
