Detectives carrying out an investigation into the production of false number plates have arrested a 34-year-old man.

Teams from Nottinghamshire police attended two addresses in the Bestwood and Edwards Lane area of Nottingham in the early hours of yesterday morning (25 February 2021 and arrested a man at the scene.

Cloned plates are often used by criminals to disguise the true identity of a vehicle during incidents like car key burglaries.

Detective Constable, Imran Ahmed, of Nottinghamshire's Criminal Investigation Department, said: "We've been carrying out an in-depth investigation based on lots of enquiries and intelligence gathering over the past few months.

"Yesterday, we conducted a highly organised operation involving city and county burglary teams and the tactical support group which resulted in this arrest.

"We continue our robust enquiries around the clock as the man remains in custody.

"We take all crimes extremely serious but especially when there seems to be a trend emerging and we remain determined to get to the bottom of who might be behind it in order to put an end to their criminality."
