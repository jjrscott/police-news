A man has been arrested by officers investigating the discovery of what is believed to be a small hand-made explosive device.

Officers from Nottinghamshire Police were called to an address in Church Laneham shortly after 12.45pm yesterday (Sunday) after the spent device was found under a hedge on a footpath.

A 100 metre cordon was put in place and residents evacuated while the pipe-bomb like device was examined by bomb disposal experts.

Detectives are currently investigating when and where it was detonated.

A 64-year-old man was arrested this afternoon on suspicion of making an explosive substance with intent to endanger life or injure property. He remains in police custody

Detective Inspector Gayle Hart, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “We understand that incidents of this nature can cause considerable local alarm, but this was an isolated incident and we are not treating it as terror related.

“Out of an abundance of caution we have this evening requested the presence of a specialist explosives team to help us conduct a more detailed search of a local property.

“I'd also like to thank residents for their co-operation.”
