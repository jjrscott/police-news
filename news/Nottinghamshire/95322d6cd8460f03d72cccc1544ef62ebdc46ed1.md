Nottinghamshire Police is appealing for information to help trace a JCB which was stolen from a building site in Newark last weekend.

Offenders removed a fence to ensure a clear path to leave the site in Stephenson Way and even took the forks off the high value vehicle.

Now officers investigating the theft are appealing for the public to come forward if they saw anything suspicious in the area or have any information about the stolen vehicle.

Police Constable Harry Shaw is leading the investigation. He said: "We are keen to ascertain how the JCB was taken, especially as their theft has left hard-working construction workers unable to work and their employers facing an expensive bill to replace the vehicle.

"The offenders actually took time to remove the forks from the vehicle (similar to the one pictured).

â€œWe are keen to piece together what happened and I would like to speak to anyone who may have been in Newark over the weekend and saw the JCB. I would encourage anyone with any information to come forward as soon as possible."

Anyone with information about the thefts or the whereabouts of the vehicles is asked to call Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 259 of 15 February 2021 when they call.
