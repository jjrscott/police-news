A boy has been charged after a shopkeeper detained an alleged robber in Sutton-in-Ashfield.

Officers were called to a shop in Portland Square at around 7.15pm on Sunday 7 February after a boy carrying a knife was reported to have attempted to threaten a man into handing over cash.

The shopkeeper is believed to have resisted and disarmed the suspect before pinning them to floor until police arrived.

A 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was charged with robbery in connection with the incident and is due to appear at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court today.

The shopkeeper had suffered a cut to their hand in the incident but the injury is not believed to be serious.

Detective Sergeant Mark Shaw, who is leading the investigation into the incident, said: “This was an incredibly brave act by the shopkeeper who put themselves at risk in order to apprehend a suspect.

“The quick response by officers combined with his actions meant a boy was arrested and charged in connection with the report.

“While we would never encourage anyone to escalate and incident or put themselves in danger, the victim did a fantastic job and enabled police to take over, bringing the incident to as safe a conclusion as possible.”
