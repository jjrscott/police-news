Drugs with a street value of around £500,000 were recovered during police raid.

Officers forced entry to a property in New Row, Jacksdale, at 10.45am yesterday (Wednesday) morning.

During a search they seized a large quantity of cocaine, cannabis and amphetamines.

Cash and mobile phones were also taken away for examination.

Cameron Gilles, 30, and Leoni Bott, 29, both of New Row, have been charged with possession with intent to supply class A and class B drugs.

Both suspects appeared at Nottingham Magistrates Court this morning (Thursday).

Gilles was remanded into custody and Bott was released on bail.

They will appear at Nottingham Crown Court on 25 March.

This proactive, intelligence led raid was carried out by members of the Ashfield Operation Reacher and neighbourhood policing teams, supported by officers from the county knife crime team.

Inspector Mark Dickson, district commander for Ashfield, said: “This was a significant operation that has led to a large amount of drugs being taken off the streets of Nottinghamshire.

“Serious and organised crime will not be tolerated in any form here in Nottinghamshire and I hope this raid sends out a clear message to people involved in this type of activity.

“We are as committed as ever to taking drugs off our streets and my message to anyone involved in the supply of illegal drugs is clear: we’re coming for you.”
