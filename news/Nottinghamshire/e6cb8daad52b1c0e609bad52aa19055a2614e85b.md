Police are appealing for people who filmed a robbery on their mobile phones to come forward with their footage.

Officers were called to Sutton Lawn, Sutton-in-Ashfield, shortly after 3.45pm yesterday (Tuesday) after a teenage boy was robbed and assaulted.

A 15-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of robbery.

Detectives believe the victim was surrounded by a group of young males before we was punched repeatedly and his bag was stolen.

Detective Sergeant Gary Hewson, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “We are determined to get to the bottom of what happened here and believe valuable evidence may have been recorded on mobile phone by passers by. If you have any footage of this incident I urge you to share it with us at the earliest possible opportunity.

“We’d also like to hear from you if you saw the incident or if you have seen a blue Nike bag on a shoulder strap that was taken from the victim.”

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting incident 448 of 2 February.
