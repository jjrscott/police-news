A woman who threatened a supermarket employee with a knife after being caught shoplifting has been jailed.

Danielle Summers, 27, entered the store in Derby Road, Stapleford, on the afternoon of Sunday 25 October.

After filling a basket with goods she attempted to walk out of the store without paying.

When challenged by a member of shop staff she pulled out kitchen knife and left the building.

She returned around an hour-and-a-half later, filled a basket with alcohol and food and shoved another member of staff before leaving.

The offences came just three months after a similar episode on 25 July, when Summers stole items from a shop in Ulldale Court, Chilwell, before returning later and slapping an employee who tried to intervene.

Summers, of no fixed abode, appeared at Nottingham Crown Court today (Wednesday) and was sentenced to a total of 36 months in prison for offences including robbery and possession of a knife, theft and assault.

PC Luke Barrow, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Summers is a violent shoplifter who seemed to believe she had the right to take whatever she wanted from local businesses. To make matters worse she became violent and confrontational when challenged about her behaviour. This sentence the reflects the seriousness of her offending and I hope provides some comfort to her victims.”
