A Nottinghamshire man has passed away on Saturday following a house fire in Newthorpe.

The 85-year-old was pulled from the blaze at his house at Pinfold Road on Friday.

Officers from Nottinghamshire Police and Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service (NFRS) were called at around 8.46am following a report from a member of the public who had heard the smoke alarm at the property and called the emergency services.

He was taken to Queen's Medical Centre for treatment, but sadly died over the weekend.

A joint police and fire investigation was carried out to determine the cause on Friday, with a road temporarily closed.

Detective Sergeant Lauren Morgan, said: "Our thoughts are with the man's family who have been informed and we're working to support them during this difficult time.

"Following a joint fire and police investigation on Friday there's no suggestion of suspicious circumstances.

"We understand residents living nearby will have concerns about what happened and we're working with our colleagues at the fire service to reassure them as best we can."

Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service Head of Prevention, Protection and Fire Investigation Bryn Coleman said: “Our thoughts are with the gentleman’s friends and family.

"We are continuing to work with the police and will be visiting residents in the area to provide fire safety information.

"We would advise people to make sure they have a working smoke alarm on each level of their home, have an evacuation plan in the event of a fire and make sure they can easily get to a phone in case they need to dial 999.

"We would also like to encourage people to check on their elderly neighbours and help them test their smoke alarms.”
