Police officers in Mansfield have thanked local primary school children for brightening up their station with a colourful paper mural.

Early years pupils at High Oakham School created the artwork as part of Children’s Mental Health Week and delivered it to grateful officers.

The three to five-year-olds had been set a challenge to “make somebody’s day brighter” – and chose hardworking local police officers.

Teacher Kirstie Fidler said: “We asked children in every age group to think of people they were thankful for and to prepare something to say thank you.

“Some of our older children chose shop workers, but our youngest pupils chose to celebrate the work of police officers.

“It’s a difficult time for everybody at the moment, including children themselves. But we are all thankful for the work police officers are doing very day to keep us all safe.”

The artwork was put together by the children of keyworkers who are currently attending lessons in persons. Other children who are currently learning from home have also sent a range of additional artworks by email. These will also be printed and displayed at the police station.

Inspector Nick Butler, district commander for Mansfield, said: “This was a really lovely gesture by the children and one that is greatly appreciated by all of us at the police station. We’ve put this up outside our new neighbourhood policing office and it’s really brightened the place up.

“It’s really cheered us all up and even brought a tear to a few eyes. On behalf of all the police officers in Mansfield I’d like to say a big thank you for all the children who took the time to put this together.”
