An investigation carried out by Nottinghamshire Police's Paedophile Online Investigation Team (POLIT) has led to a man being locked up for making and distributing indecent images of children.

Officers from the specialist unit arrested Paul Hoggard, 46, formerly of Whinney Lane, Ollerton, after making enquiries.

Hoggard went on to plead guilty to three counts of making indecent images of children and three counts of distributing indecent images of children.

Appearing at Nottingham Crown Court today (Friday 11 December 2020) he was jailed for total of two years, ordered to sign the Sex Offenders' Register for 10 years and was made subject of a 10-year sexual harm prevention order.

Detective Superintendent Andy Gowan, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "As our work in this case demonstrates, the safeguarding of children and young people is a priority for Nottinghamshire Police.

“The force will continue to maximise technology to assist it in targeting people who are a danger to children.”
