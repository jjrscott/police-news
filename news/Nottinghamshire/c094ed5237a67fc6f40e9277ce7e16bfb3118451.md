A man has been charged with drugs and weapons offences after a police station search.

Eldante Jacobs, 19, has been charged with possession with intent to supply class A drugs, and being concerned in the supply of class A and class B drugs.

He has also been charged with possessing a blade article in a public place.

The charges relate to an incident on 6 August last year when Jacobs was arrested on suspicion of carrying a knife in Hawthowne Close, The Meadows.

During a later custody search officers discovered what is believe to be cocaine, crack cocaine and heroin. A quantity of cash was also recovered.

Jacobs, of Peache Way, Bramcote, appeared at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court on Friday and was bailed to appear at Nottingham Crown Court on 12 April.

PC Liz Johnson, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "The supply of drugs have a hugely detrimental impact to our communities and we remain committed to doing all we can to bring those involved in the supply of such drugs to justice as well as preventing harmful drugs from hitting the streets.

“I’d encourage anyone in their local area who sees something suspicious to report it to Nottinghamshire Police on 101 or in an emergency, dial 999.”
