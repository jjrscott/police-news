Detectives investigating two recent distraction burglaries of elderly women have made an arrest.

The incident took place at an address in Stapleford on 30 November when a man knocked at the door and asked for some money to pay for some electricity.

The man then entered the house uninvited and took £20 from the victim’s purse.

The second incident took place at an address in on Saturday 5 December where a man entered the home of an 83-year-old lady but left without taking anything.

A 34-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of theft and released under investigation.

Detective Inspector Kim Binns said: “These were upsetting incidents for the victim and an unfortunate reminded for older people to be on their guard against this kind of offence.

"Distraction burglars are opportunists who may pose as a trustworthy individual in order to gain access to your home – they can be very deceptive and convincing.

“With more people feeling isolated and alone, distraction burglars may see this as an opportunity to target people.”

If you saw something suspicious in the area at the time or have any information that could aid us in our investigation, please contact Nottinghamshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 151 of 12 December 2020.”
