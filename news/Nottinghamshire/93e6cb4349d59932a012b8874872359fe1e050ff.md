A man was found with nasty injuries to his hand after police were called reports of a fight.

Officers have arrested a 26-year-old man on suspicion of grievous bodily harm and public order offences after they were called to an address in David Lane, Kirkby-in-Ashfield, just before 11.30pm last night (Friday 19 February 2021). He remains in custody.

Another man was found with nasty injuries to the tendons in his hand and upon arriving at the address, officers provided immediate medical treatment. He was taken to King's Mill Hospital in Sutton-in-Ashfield and is due to have surgery on his hand. However, his injuries are not thought to be life threatening or altering.

Detective Inspector Kim Binns, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "A man was left with quite significant injuries to his hand, for which he required surgery, after reports of a fight last night.

"This kind of public disorder will always generate a swift police response and our officers are working hard to understand the circumstances around what happened.

"However, we do believe this is an isolated incident and there is no wider risk to the public.

"Our enquiries are ongoing and we would urge anyone with information, or anyone who saw the incident, to get in touch."

Anyone who saw the incident or has any information is asked to contact Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident 819 of 19 February 2021.
