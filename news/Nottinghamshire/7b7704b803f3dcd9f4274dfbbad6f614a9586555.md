Neighbourhood and Operation Reacher officers made an arrest and found a quantity of what is suspected to be Class A drugs after conducting a warrant.

A number of other items were also found and seized during the search of the address in Hawthorn Close, The Meadows, on Friday (19 February 2021). These included cannabis, weapons, cash, scales and phones.

Leon Wallace, 20, of Hawthorn Close, The Meadows, was charged with possession with intent to supply Class A and Class B drugs. He was also charged with possession of criminal property and possession of an offensive weapon. He has been remanded in custody and will appear at Nottingham Magistrate’s Court on Monday (22 February 2021)

Detective Sergeant Nigel Malik, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "A charge has now been made after we arrested a man following this warrant.

“Local teams and Operation Reacher are dedicated to acting on issues that matter to the local community. By listening to concerns and working with the community we see positive results.

"Officers seized drugs and weapons during the search, which have now been taken out of circulation. Proactive policing, such as this, is taking place across the county and provides local communities the reassurance and confidence to report any concerns to us.

"Our enquiries continue and we would ask anyone with information to get in touch on 101."
