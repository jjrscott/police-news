A delivery driver had to have stitches to his knee and hands after being thrown off his van as it was stolen.

The courier was dropping off parcels, when he returned to his vehicle to see a man in his driver’s seat.

Detectives are now appealing for information and witnesses following a delivery van being stolen.

Detective Sergeant Simon Carter is leading the investigation. He said: "We were called to Rose Ash Lane in Top Valley to a report of a delivery man being robbed at around 12.40pm on Saturday (12 December 2020).

"The delivery driver was dropping off parcels ahead of Christmas and returned to his vehicle to find a man in the driver’s seat.

"The victim tried to get back into his van, but was dragged for a short distance, had his keys snatched and thrown clear as the offender drove off.

"The delivery driver suffered cuts to his knee and hands, which required stitches at hospital.

"Detectives are continuing their enquiries and are asking for any witnesses to come forward to help with our investigation.

"If you saw anything please call 101, quoting incident number 262 of 12 December 2020.

"This must have been a terrifying incident for the victim and understandably he has been left traumatised and needing treatment in hospital.

"It's absolutely unacceptable for a delivery driver to be targeted in this way as they go about their job, making an honest living and the victim has been left shaken by what happened as you can imagine.

"Nottinghamshire Police will continue to proactively tackle theft, thoroughly investigate all reports and do everything in its power to bring offenders to justice."
