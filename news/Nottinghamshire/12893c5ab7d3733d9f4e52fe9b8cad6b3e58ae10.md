Two people have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder following what police believe was a targeted attack.

Nottinghamshire Police received a report that a 16-year-old boy had been stabbed just before 5.30am today (26 December).

Officers were quickly on the scene of the incident in Hickings Lane in Stapleford, Nottinghamshire.

The boy was taken to hospital with serious injuries.

A 20-year-old man and a 25-year-old woman have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.

Detective Inspector Ed Cook, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “I understand the concern an incident such as this one can cause in the community. Our investigation into what happened is well under way and we believe those involved were known to each other and that there was no risk to the wider public.

“Officers were quickly on the scene and we have two people in custody. We are not currently looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.

“To further reassure local people we have increased patrols in the area and I would encourage anyone who has questions to come and speak to one of our officers.”
