Motorists are being urged to lock their doors after a person was caught on camera trying to gain access to vehicles.

The suspect was caught on CCTV in Yellowhammer Drive, Worksop, in the early hours of Sunday morning.

He was caught on camera shortly after 3.40am, and was also seen in the area between 2am and 4am the previous Sunday morning (14 March).

PC Susan Basi, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Opportunist thieves need only a few seconds to steal valuables form un-locked vehicles, and may also be able to drive them away if they are able to gain access.

“So if you live in the Gateford area of town then please do take some time to double check that your car is locked before going to bed for the evening.”

“We are very keen to speak to the person caught in this image so if you recognise the outfit they are wearing please contact us as soon as possible”.

Anyone with information about these incidents is asked to call 101
