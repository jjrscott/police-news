Police arrested a burglary suspect just minutes after a man was caught stealing items from a house.

Officers were called to an address in Wilford Lane, West Bridgford, at around 4.40pm yesterday (Thursday) afternoon.

The occupants of the property had returned home to find a man inside helping himself to electrical items. The man was chased from the property and fled the scene.

Police were called and detained a suspect shortly afterwards in nearby Gresham Close.

A 36-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of burglary and remains in police custody.

Detective Sergeant Andrew Hall, of Nottinghamshire Police’s burglary team, said:

“This was a very good bit of work by officers to apprehend a suspect so soon after the initial report. We take burglary offences extremely seriously and will always respond with the utmost speed to these kinds of incidents.”
