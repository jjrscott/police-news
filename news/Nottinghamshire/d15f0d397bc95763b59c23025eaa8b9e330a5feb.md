Chief Inspector Duncan Southall is a manager in the force control room and will be working with a team of dispatchers and call handlers on New Year's Eve to make sure Nottinghamshire heads in to 2021 safely.

Chief Inspector Southall has been with the force since December 2019, having transferred from Leicestershire after 21 years, where he took on a variety of roles including operational and neighbourhood policing. He spent four months at the Bridewell Custody suite before moving into the control room, where he has been ever since.

"I'll be in the control room overseeing a team of dispatchers and call handlers and working with them to handle incidents that come through to us during the New Year's Eve night shift." said the 53-year-old.

"Although there's no doubt that celebrations will be different this year, our planning and response for this has been organised in the way it usually would be.

"We expect and hope that you'll enjoy bringing in the New Year, but we're there and ready to respond should you need our help.

"For me personally, and I'm sure I can speak for my team as well, it's important to be around during the festive season as we first and foremost want everyone to be able to enjoy the celebrations safely, but also there are some people who are perhaps at their most vulnerable around this time of year who need us to be there, whether in person or on the end of the phone.

"We're a real team in the control room and I know we'll all bring a bit of New Year spirit and work together to make sure Nottinghamshire can enjoy it also.

"Be sensible, be safe, and have a Happy New Year.‚Äù
