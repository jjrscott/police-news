Police are appealing for witnesses and information after a man sustained serious injuries when he was struck by a car.

Emergency services were called to the A620 Gainsborough Road near Beckingham shortly after 9.40pm last night (Thursday) after the man was injured.

Officers believe the victim had been involved in a single vehicle crash shortly before he was struck by another vehicle near the junction with Marsh Lane.

He is now in a serious condition in hospital.

The road was closed overnight but is now open again.

Case Investigator Louise Melbourne, of Nottinghamshire Police’s Serious Collisions Investigation Unit, said: “We are working to understand exactly what happened in this incident and would like to speak with anybody who was in the area at the time. In particular we would like information on a purple and black coloured Transit van and a grey Ford Fusion.

“If you saw either of these vehicles in the area before the incident please give us a call. We would especially like to speak with anyone who has dash cam footage of these vehicles before the incident occurred. So if you were in the area last night please think about what you saw and also check back through any footage you may have recorded.”

Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101 quoting incident 632 of 31 December.
