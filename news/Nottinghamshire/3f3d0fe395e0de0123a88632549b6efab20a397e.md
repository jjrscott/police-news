Police officers have now made an arrest after a man was followed after withdrawing a large amount of cash.

He was threatened with a knife, punched and head-butted, before he had cash and his mobile phone taken from him.

The victim was hit in the face and was left shaken and bruised in an incident on 12 March 2021 in Palin Street, Hyson Green

Shortly before the incident he had withdrawn Â£300 in cash from the Post Office in Gregory Boulevard.

Officers have today made an arrest of 28 year-old man in connection with the offence.

Detective Sergeant Nigel Malik is leading the investigation. He said: "This was a nasty and cowardly attack on a man going about his own business in the middle of the day.

"It was reported he was threatened, assaulted and had property taken from him.

"Detectives have worked hard to identify a suspect in this case and are grateful for assistance from the community who responded to our media appeal for information earlier this month.

"We continue to provide support to the victim in this case who suffered not life altering injuries.

"We are committed to protecting the public and will vigorously investigate violent crimes such as this.

"I would encourage anyone with information about this offence to call 101, quoting incident number 261 of 12 March 2021."
