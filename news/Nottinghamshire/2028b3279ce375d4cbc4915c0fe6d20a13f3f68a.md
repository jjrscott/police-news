Police swiftly responded to a report of a woman who was stamped on the head before being robbed of cash.

Officers were called to a flat in Bentinck Road, Nottingham, shortly before 1am today (Friday 25 December 2020). Minutes later they arrested a 24-year-old woman nearby on suspicion of robbery.

The victim was taken to the Queen's Medical Centre with cuts and bruises. Her injuries are not currently believed to be serious.

While the suspect was in the police van it's alleged that she bit an officer on his hand. She was subsequently arrested on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker.

After arriving at the custody suite the suspect was also arrested on suspicion of racially-aggravated public order in relation to alleged comments she made towards a detention officer. She remains in custody.

Detective Sergeant Matt Scott, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "Our enquiries are ongoing to establish the circumstances of this robbery.

â€œWe take officer assaults and racially-aggravated incidents very seriously. Assaults on officers while they are trying to do their job is totally unacceptable and reports will be thoroughly investigated."
