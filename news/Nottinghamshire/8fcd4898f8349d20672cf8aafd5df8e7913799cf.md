A man has been charged by detectives investigating a burglary during which a person broke into a home with a hammer.

The incident took place shortly after 8.20pm on Thursday 3 December at an address in Hawthorn Close, Edwalton.

Nothing was taken but two people were injured.

Carl Thomas, 53, of Gladstone Street, Nottingham, was arrested yesterday and has been charged with burglary and attempted theft with violence. He has been remanded in custody.

Detective Inspector Kim Binns, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "Burglary is an upsetting crime for victims and the thought of someone entering your home is often just as bad as the loss of items.

"The force recognises this and treats burglary seriously, with burglary teams in the city and county who are dedicated to tackling this type of crime."
