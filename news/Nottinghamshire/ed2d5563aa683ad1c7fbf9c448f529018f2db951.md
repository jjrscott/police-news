Police responding to reports of a burglary found a large cannabis grow hidden on a residential street.

Officers were called to an address on Harcourt Street, Kirkby-in-Ashfield, shortly after 4am on New Year's Day when a break-in was reported.

Inside they found dozens of cannabis plants in multiple rooms, along with an array of sophisticated growing equipment.

The plants are now being taken away by officers and the equipment will be put beyond use.Nobody was found at the address and an investigation is underway.

Chief Inspector Steven O’Neil, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Cannabis cultivation is a serious crime that can have a hugely damaging impact on individuals and the wider community. It can also be linked to organised criminal gangs and serious offences such as people trafficking and modern slavery.

“That is why it is really important that if you spot any suspicious activity in your local area that you report it to police. I am pleased that this particular grow has been taken out of action but we’d really like your help to make 2021 a particularly bad year for drug dealers across the county.”

If you spot something out of the ordinary in your area or have any concerns, please report them to Nottinghamshire Police on 101 or in an emergency, dial 999.
