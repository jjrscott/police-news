A suspect is due to appear in court charged in connection with a reported house burglary in Nuthall.

Sean Thorburn, 42, of no fixed address, is due to appear at Nottingham Magistrates' Court today (Monday 22 March 2021) charged with burglary.

It follows a report that a suspect smashed a patio door to get into an address in Middleton Close on Friday before leaving with watches, jewellery and cash.

Detective Constable Rebecca Butler, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Finding that your home has been broken into is one of the most upsetting experiences anyone can suffer which is why we take it so seriously as a force.

“People should always feel safe in their homes and that's why we're continuing to work so hard, working closely with our partners, to drive burglary down and deal robustly with anyone believed to be involved in such traumatic crimes in order to secure justice for burglary victims."
