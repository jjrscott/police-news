A burglar who broke into a city centre restaurant and stole an iPad has been sentenced to six months in prison.

Neil Dwayne Lawson was arrested by officers from Nottinghamshire Police after being caught near to the incident in Nando's, Angel Row, shortly after it happened at around 4am on 7 December 2020.

A member of the public had reported it to Nottinghamshire Police who searched the area and found the 47-year-old, of no fixed abode, walking nearby who matched the description that had been given.

He was carrying a bag that contained the stolen device and further forensic enquiries connected him to the scene.

Lawson pleaded guilty and was sentenced at Nottingham Crown Court on Friday (5 March 2021). He was also ordered to pay a victim surcharge of Â£128.

Louise Palfrey, who led the investigation, said: "Response officers were quick to the scene and arrested Lawson almost instantly. This was further bolstered by some quick investigative work which was used to prove that he was indeed responsible for the break-in.

"It's a difficult time for businesses and we are constantly patrolling key areas to ensure they are protected.

"We won't tolerate businesses being targeted in this way and will carry out robust investigations to ensure offenders are brought to justice."
