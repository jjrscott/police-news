Two men are being questioned after police intercepted a car suspected to be connected to drug supply offences in the Tollerton area.

The Ford Kuga was seen travelling at high speed and it failed to stop as the occupants attempted to evade officers, at one point ramming into a police car and causing damage.

After the Kuga collided with a tree it came to a stop in Tollerton Lane. An officer swiftly detained one occupant while a colleague chased after a second occupant on foot. He was detained after a brief pursuit.

Officers found a block of suspected Class A drugs inside the vehicle.

The incident happened at around 12.15pm yesterday (Tuesday 1 December 2020).

Two men, aged 25 and 30, were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs and remain in custody.

Detective Constable Richard Kinsey, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "Some good police teamwork enabled us to bring this car to a stop and swiftly arrest the two suspects. Enquiries will now continue into the circumstances around the incident while they remain in custody."
