Nottinghamshire Police have arrested three men in connection with a sword attack, which left a man needing hospital treatment.

Following a determined police investigation, officers arrested the men aged 23, 22 and 17 this morning in Netherfield and Lowdham on suspicion of grievous bodily harm.

A 23-year-old was taken to hospital after being struck with a sword following an altercation with a group of men on 15 March in Burton Joyce.

Officers were able to track down the men and they remain in police custody for questioning.

It was reported that the man's injuries could have been worse had a woman not intervened.

The man was stabbed with the weapon and was taken to Queen's Medical Centre with a non-life threatening injury to his ankle.

Detective Sergeant Julian Eminson-Ferry of Nottinghamshire Police is leading the investigation.

He said: "We are pleased to have now arrested three men in connection with the incident.

"A man was reportedly stabbed and suffered minor injuries at around 5pm that day on Main Street in Burton Joyce.

"Officers were swiftly on the scene following the report and searched the area, but couldn't find anyone in relation to the incident.

"This incident could have had far more serious consequences had a woman not intervened, which encouraged the group of offenders to leave the scene.

"The man has since been discharged from hospital.

“Knife crime is never acceptable and is something which we are committed to tackling.

“I would like to reassure the local community that officers were quickly on the scene to ensure that there was no risk to the wider public."
