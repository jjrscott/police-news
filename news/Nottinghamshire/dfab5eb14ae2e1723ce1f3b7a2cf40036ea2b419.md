A man has been hospitalised after being hit with an iron bar following a reported disagreement over money.

The man was struck to the head, face, back and arms and remains in hospital this morning with serious head injuries, which have been described as potentially life altering.

Officers were able to locate the suspect at a nearby address and arrested a 40-year-old man on suspicion of actual bodily harm.

Detective Inspector Stuart Temple is leading the investigation. He said: "We take incidents of violence such as this very seriously.

"Nottinghamshire Police officers were called at around 1am this morning (29 March 2021) to High Street in Stanton Hill following a report of an assault.

"We know that incidents of this nature will be a cause of real concern for many people living nearby but I would like to reassure the community that our officers have responded quickly, which has made this arrest possible.

"We believe this is an isolated incident with no danger to the rest of the community."
