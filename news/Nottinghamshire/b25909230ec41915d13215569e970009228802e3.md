Police investigating a distraction burglary at the home of an elderly lady have made an arrest.

The woman was targeted at an address in Cowper Close, Worksop, at around 8.30am on Friday 5 February by two men collecting scrap metal.

One of the men then entered her home and asked of for a fee for the work before taking money from the victim's purse. The suspects then loaded several scrap items onto a van and drove away.

Detectives investigating the case yesterday arrested a 58-year-old man on suspicion of burglary. He has since been released on bail as investigations continue.

Detective Sergeant Andrew Hall, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "Distraction burglaries like this are so often aimed at vulnerable elderly people. This crime also highlights the importance that the public, especially those living alone, are aware of this type of criminality and do not fall victim themselves.

“Please keep checking on loved ones who may be isolated and who are the most vulnerable in our communities. Do not invite strangers into your home or give out any personal details, and always ask for identification if workers you do not know knock at your door. if you are not sure about somebody who has tried to sell you anything or who is seen acting suspiciously in your area, contact police on 101 as soon as possible.”
