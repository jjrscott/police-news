A knuckle duster and a hunting knife have been seized after a group of people tried to break into a house.

Three people have been arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary following the incident.

Officers from Nottinghamshire Police were called just after 3am today (30 November) to a report that a group of people were trying to get in at the back door of a house in Goodwood Avenue in Arnold, Nottinghamshire.

The would-be intruders could not get in to the house and then reportedly stole a push bike to make their getaway.

Officers intercepted the group at the junction of Cherry Close and Redhill Road and seized a knuckle duster nearby. A hunting knife was also found in the area by a member of the public and handed in to officers.

Two 18-year-old men and a 16-year old boy have been arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary.

Detective Sergeant Jamie Moore, who is investigating the incident, said: “It is not acceptable to carry a weapon of any kind and I am glad we have been able to take two weapons off the streets following this incident.

“Anyone who saw what happened should come forward as they may be able to help the investigation.”

Anyone with information about the incident should call Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 43 of 30 November 2020.
