Two men have now been charged following a collision in Kirkby-in-Ashfield in the early hours of Tuesday morning.

The charges relate to an incident in Lowmoor Road at around 3.15am following a report of a car key burglary.

Operational Support officers made two swift arrests after spotting a vehicle in connection with the incident driving at speed in Kirkby-in-Ashfield.

Moments later officers discovered that the vehicle had crashed into three stationary cars.

One man was quickly located and detained on suspicion of drink-driving.

Meanwhile the second arrest was made shortly after.

Detective Sergeant Mark Shaw of Nottinghamshire Police is leading the investigation. He said: "This was fantastic work by Operational Support officers.

"Nottinghamshire Police takes burglary extremely seriously and we continue to work hard and thoroughly investigate all incidents reported to us."

Kieran Bonser, 24 of Malborough Road in Kirby-in-Ashfield has been charged with burglary, aggravated taking without owners consent, driving disqualified and driving with no insurance.

Steven Walker, 38 of no fixed address have been charged with burglary and aggravated taking without owners consent.

Both have been remanded into custody having appeared at Nottingham Magistrates' Court on 6 January 2021. They will appear next in court on 3 February 2021.
