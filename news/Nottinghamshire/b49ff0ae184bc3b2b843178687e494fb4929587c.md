Neighbourhood policing sergeant Ali Bryan, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "Incidents of violent disorder such as this will not be tolerated in our communities.

"I'd like to reassure people that we are unrelenting in our approach to tackling behaviour which causes concern to the local community, we will act on information we receive and take robust action against individuals suspected to be involved in criminality.
