Police have charged a 21-year-old man after a young woman woke up to find an intruder in her bedroom.

Clay Swift, of Dulwich Road in Radford, was arrested yesterday on suspicion of burglary.

Detectives had been investigating an incident where a man had entered a house, searched various rooms before opening a bedroom door which awoke the occupant as she lay in bed.

It happened in the Seely Road area of Lenton at around 5.45am last Friday (19 February).

Detective Constable Louise Turton, of Nottinghamshire's Criminal Investigation Department, said: "We were immediately extremely concerned about this incident and have been carrying out lots of enquiries around the clock.

"The intruder was said to have been covered in a face mask and hood and the victim was understandably shaken by what had happened.

"I'm glad that the investigation work has now led to a man being arrested and subsequently charged and he now awaits the court process."

Swift is due to attend a remand hearing at Nottingham Magistrates' Court today.
