An elderly man has suffered life threatening injuries following a serious house fire this morning.

Emergency services was called at 8.46am to on Pinfold Road in Newthorpe following a report of smoke being seen at the property by a neighbour.

Fire crews from Eastwood, Ilkeston and Stockhill attended and the flames were quickly extinguished.

A joint police and fire investigation is now being carried out to determine the cause.

Police Sergeant Joanna Sakkal-Appleby is leading the investigation. She said: "Sadly an elderly man had to be taken to Queen's Medical Centre following the report of a fire this morning.

"The fire was brought under control and a joint Fire and Police investigation is taking place to establish a cause.

"At this stage we believe the incident not to be suspicious.

"Officers remain at the scene whilst a thorough investigation takes place."

A section of the street was blocked for a short time to allow for a joint Fire and Police investigation to take place.

Area Manager from Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service Michael Sharman said: “This morning at 8.46am crews from Eastwood, Ilkeston and Stockhill attended a serious fire on Pinfold Road, Newthorpe.

“Our thoughts are with the elderly man who has been taken into the care of EMAS.”
