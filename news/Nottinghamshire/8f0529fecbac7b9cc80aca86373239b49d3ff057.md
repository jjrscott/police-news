Two teenagers have been charged after police swiftly responded to a report of a group of youths suspected to be carrying knives in Carlton.

Officers were called to Station Road at around 5pm on Saturday (20 March 2021) and arrived within minutes. Members of the group ran off but two of the suspects were detained after a brief foot chase. Kitchen knives were found in both of their bags and they were arrested.

Two boys aged 15 and 16, who can’t be named for legal reasons, were subsequently charged with possession of a knife in a public place. They were both released on conditional bail and are due to appear at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court on 31 March 2021.

Inspector Chris Pearson, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “As a force we take all reports involving knives extremely seriously and work really hard to take as many weapons as possible of our streets and to educate people on the dangers of carrying a knife.

"We will not tolerate people carrying knives in Nottinghamshire and we will always look to take action against those who are found to commit such offences.

"We all need to work together to combat knife crime and we’re urging anyone with information on knife crime in their local community to call Nottinghamshire Police on 101, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. In an emergency, always dial 999."
