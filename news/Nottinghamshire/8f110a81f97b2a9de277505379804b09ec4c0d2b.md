A trial date has been set for a student who was issued with a Â£10,000 fixed penalty notice after allegedly holding a party in breach of Covid-19 legislation.

Bailey Stancer, of Harlaxton Drive, Lenton, has denied a charge in relating to an allegation that he held party with about 50 people present.

It comes after police and community protection officers were called to an address in Harlaxton Drive on Friday, September 11, a court heard.

The 19-year-old University of Nottingham student is charged with holding or being involved in holding a gathering of more than 30 people in a private dwelling during an emergency period in England.

He appeared at Nottingham Magistrates' Court today (Monday 8 February), where he gave his name and address and pleaded not guilty to the charge.

A trial is now set to be heard over two days on August 4 and 5 this year. He was released on unconditional bail.
