A man has been charged after a flat was set on fire and a firefighter assaulted.

Emergency services were called to an address in Helston Drive, Strelley, at round 2am on Sunday morning.

A firefighter attempting to enter the property to extinguish the flames was then hit over the head with a metal bar and knocked to the ground.

The fire was quickly extinguished and a suspect arrested.

Reuben Wooley, 37, of Helston Drive, has been charged with arson with intent to endanger life, assault causing actual bodily harm, and two counts of assaulting an emergency worker.

He appeared at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court on Monday morning and was remanded in custody.

Detective Sergeant Andy Buxton, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Thankfully nobody was seriously injured in this incident as the firefighter’s protective headgear absorbed the blow, but it was a timely reminder of the dangers faced by emergency services every time they are on duty.”
