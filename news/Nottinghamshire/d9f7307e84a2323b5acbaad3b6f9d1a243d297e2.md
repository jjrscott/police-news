Highly-trained officers used tactical contact to stop a car that failed to stop for officers in the early hours this morning.

One man was arrested and are now being questioned in connection with multiple offence.

Response officers were called to Carsic Lane in Sutton-in-Ashfield at around 1am this morning following a call that a BMW had failed to stop.

It was reported that the car drove through red lights and well in excess of speed limits.

He was located by Armed Response Vehicles within 15-minutes and after a short pursuit around Mansfield, he was tactically stopped outside Kings Mill Hospital.

Damage was sustained to a police car in the incident.

Police Sergeant Ian Holmes of Nottinghamshire Police's Prison Handling Team said: “This incident saw fantastic quick work from our Operational Support officers who within minutes of the call had attended the scene, identified the suspect and made an arrest.

“The fact that no one was injured in the incident is an example of how highly-trained our officers are to respond to difficult situations.

“A 29-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of failing to stop, dangerous driving and drug offences. He remains in police custody.

“Detectives are now making enquiries into the circumstances of this incident and I’d appeal to anyone who may have seen something suspicious in the Carsic Lane area to get in touch.”

If you witnessed the incident or have any information or footage that could aid officers in their investigation, please do not hesitate to contact Nottinghamshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 892 of 16 October 2020.
