Thieves kicked a man in the face and stole his wallet in a robbery.

Officers were called to Beech Avenue, in Newark-on Trent, at around 2.45am yesterday (13 December) to a report that a man had been attacked.

The man, who is in his twenties, sustained a small cut to his forehead.

The attackers were reportedly two men, one who was described as white and one who was described as Asian.

Detective Sergeant Rick Ellis, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Violence of any kind is completely inexcusable and we take all reports of it seriously.

“I would appeal to anyone who may have seen anything suspicious in the area to come forward and help us with our enquiries.”

Anyone with information should call Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 61 of 13 December 2020.
