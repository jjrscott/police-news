With another sunny day ahead Nottinghamshire Police is urging people to stick to the current rules on not mixing with other people to help prevent the spread of Covid-19.

Officers will be patrolling in public areas today (Sunday 28 February 2021), including the Arboretum in the city, engaging with members of the public, explaining the rules and encouraging people to follow them.

It comes after police dispersed groups of people who had gathered at the Arboretum yesterday who were out to enjoy the sunshine. No fines were issued.

Chief Superintendent Ian Roberts, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "We are continuing to carry out our high-visibility patrols across all areas of the city and county as part of our ongoing efforts to prevent the spread of the deadly Coronavirus.

"I'd like to thank the vast majority of people who are continuing to act responsibly and who are adhering to the rules which remain in force in order to keep people safe and help save lives.

"Parts of Nottinghamshire are still in the top 25 per cent nationally for infection rates which it is why it is essential that everyone still takes the restrictions extremely seriously. The only way to bring the numbers down is to stick to the rules.

â€œWe all still need to do everything we can to reduce the spread. In cases where we find people blatantly choosing to break the rules and put themselves and others at risk, the force will take swift and robust action in order to protect the communities we serve."
