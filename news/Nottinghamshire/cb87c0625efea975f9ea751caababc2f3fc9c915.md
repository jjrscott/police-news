A 38-year-old man has been charged after officers tracked down a suspected stolen car resulting in police pursuit.

Officers received a report that two Mini Coopers had been stolen from the Middleton Boulevard area of Nottingham at 6.25am on Wednesday (3 February).

Following enquiries, they located one of the vehicles in St Annâ€™s at around 2.40pm.

The driver failed to stop for police which resulted in officers from Nottinghamshire's operational support department initiating tactical contact and the police car being rammed as a result before officers arrested a man at the scene.

Marley Blair, of Previn Gardens in St Ann's, has now been charged with driving without a license and without insurance as well as two counts of possession of a bladed weapon after officers located two lock knives.

The 38-year-old was due to appear at Nottingham Magistrates' Court yesterday (Friday 5 2020).

Detective Inspector Kayne Rukas of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "We have been carrying out enquiries since the car key burglary was initially reported to us which resulted in a dramatic arrest yesterday.

"A man has now been charged as a result of the hard work and tenacity of several of our policing teams including our operational support colleagues who carried out specialist tactics to prevent a suspect from fleeing.

"Luckily no one was injured as a result of the collision and a man remains in custody as he awaits the court process."
