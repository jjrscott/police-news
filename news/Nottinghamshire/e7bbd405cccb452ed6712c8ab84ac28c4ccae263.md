A 25-year-old man has been arrested after excellent policing work to track him down following an aggravated burglary earlier this week across the Derbyshire border.

Nottinghamshire Police were called to Pedmore Valley in Bestwood at around 10.15pm last night following information passed on by Derbyshire Constabulary.

The arrest follows a report of an aggravated burglary in Ilkeston on Monday.

A BMW car was linked to the incident and the car was sighted in Nottingham.

The car was quickly stopped and searched by Operational Support officers and a man was arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary and criminal damage.

The vehicle has been recovered and there will be further searches at the property today.

Detective Chief Inspector Nick Waldram of Nottinghamshire Police said: “We’ve been working tirelessly since the incident to get to the bottom of what happened this week.

"This was excellent policing and great partnership working with Derbyshire.

"The 25-year-old remains in police custody."
