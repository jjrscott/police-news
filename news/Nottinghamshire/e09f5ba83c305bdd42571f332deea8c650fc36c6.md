Detectives have arrested a second suspect in connection with an aggravated burglary in Sneinton, during which a 15-year-old boy was attacked and suffered stab wounds to his eye, leg and head.

Nottinghamshire Police were called at around 7.20pm on Saturday night (2 January 2021) following a report of the boy being attacked at his home address in Windmill Lane.

The boy was taken to hospital with a reported gash to the side of his head. He has since been discharged.

It was reported that the boy was attacked in a bedroom by two males who went onto steal expensive clothing and a laptop.

Following extensive enquiries a 16-year-old boy was arrested during the early hours of today (Wednesday 6 January 2021) on suspicion of aggravated burglary and remains in custody.

A 15-year-old boy who was arrested yesterday morning on suspicion of aggravated burglary was subsequently released on conditional bail.

Detective Sergeant Jon Kerry, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Nottinghamshire Police takes all reports of burglary seriously and any reports involving violence are something which we work extremely hard to tackle.

“I would urge anyone with information about this incident to come forward and help the investigation by calling Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 575 of 2 January 2021, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
