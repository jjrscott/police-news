Nottinghamshire Police is encouraging victims and communities to report hate crime as people prepare to mark the United Nations Anti-Racism Day tomorrow.

The international day commemorates the Sharpville massacre in South Africa which happened on 21 March 1960. A day of action has been called on the nearest Saturday to that date each year by organisations around the world. In Britain it is led by Stand Up To Racism and the Trades Union Congress (TUC).

The day is usually marked with public events. However, due to Covid-19, this year events will be taking place online in cities and communities around the world.

A hate crime is any incident where someone is targeted because of their identity.

Hate crime can take any shape and isn't always illegal behaviour, but it is always motivated by prejudice against protected characteristics such as:

* Race

* Religion

* Sexual orientation

* Disability

* Transgender

* Misogyny

* Alternative sub-culture (e.g. goth)

It can disguise itself under many different names (homophobia, Islamophobia or racism to name a few) but, whichever name it's taking, it's still wrong and we can take action against offenders.

All hate crime is serious: everyone has the right to live their life without fear of prejudice, discrimination and hate.

Some hate crimes are obvious, such as openly racist attacks. Others are less obvious, such as name-calling, teasing and bullying. Some are aimed at whole communities, some are targeted at individuals. Some involve attacks on people or attacks on buildings. The important thing is that, if it's happening because of who you are, then it needs reporting.

Superintendent Sukesh Verma, Nottinghamshire Police’s strategic hate crime lead, said: “Nottinghamshire Police takes a zero-tolerance approach to all hate crime which can have a devastating impact upon individuals and communities.

“Whether you are a victim of hate crime, or have witnessed a hate crime incident in Nottinghamshire, we would urge you to report it, no matter how insignificant it may seem.

“We are committed to tackling hate crime. We treat all reports seriously and they will be thoroughly investigated.

“The most important thing is to not accept this unacceptable behaviour and not let it hide within our communities – report it. By reporting it, we can stop it.”

To report a hate crime you can call 999 in an emergency, 101 for non-emergencies or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. You can also report a hate crime online at www.report-it.org.uk.
