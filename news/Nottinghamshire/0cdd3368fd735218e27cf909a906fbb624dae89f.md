A small conversation has the power to make a world of difference – which is why Nottinghamshire Police is backing a campaign to get people talking about mental health.

As part of Time To Talk Day, the force is encouraging officers, staff and the wider community to have more conversations, bust the myths and break down the barriers that people feel around talking about their mental health.

Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Barber, who leads on the force's approach to wellbeing, said: "It is so important to begin these conversations, which we understand many people may find difficult.

"By talking to someone, whether that be family, a friend, or a professional, those barriers start to be broken down and some of the stigma attached to talking about mental health begins to end too.

"Particularly in the police, we have that role of being strong and being the protectors, and sometimes this plays a part in us not speaking about something that is affecting us soon enough or allowing ourselves to seek help when we should.

"That's why we're encouraging as many people as possible, in force and in the community, to start talking about mental health and to provide a safe space for people to open up."

Jo Loughran, Director of Time to Change, the charity which runs Time To Talk Day, said: “Mental health problems are common and can affect any one of us, yet too often people are afraid to talk openly about mental health for fear of being judged. A small conversation about mental health has the power to make a big difference. The more we talk about it, the better life is for all of us and Time to Talk Day is a chance for everyone to open up – to talk, to listen, to change lives.” For information about Time to Talk Day and how you can get involved please visit: time-tochange.org.uk/timetotalkday
