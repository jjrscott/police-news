A major police operation relating to a series of car key burglaries in Nottinghamshire saw officers swooping at five addresses yesterday morning resulting in 4 arrests.

Four warrants were executed around the Oxclose Lane area of Nottingham and one in Cropwell Bishop.

As a result 3 men, aged 19, 23 and 24, one boy, aged 17 were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit burglary between 11 October and 27 November 2020.

All of those arrested were bailed while detectives continue with their enquiries.

This morning’s positive activity comes after a number of reported burglaries in recent months including at addresses in Radcliffe-on-Trent, West Bridgford, Bingham, Cotgrave and Arnold and others in Ilkeston, Derbyshire and Nuneaton, Warwickshire.

Detective Sergeant Gary Hewson, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Nottinghamshire Police takes burglary extremely seriously and will always proactively and thoroughly investigate reported incidents and work tirelessly to make arrests.

“This morning’s activity, under the banner of Operation Terrestrial, is a large step forward in this detailed and ongoing investigation and those arrested will now be questioned.

“We’re absolutely committed to driving down burglaries across our county and to keep our communities safe but we need people to help us and themselves by being extra vigilant and checking their home security to guard against opportunistic burglars.

“At this time of year people’s homes are left in darkness for longer, giving criminals more opportunity to break in by looking for the easiest way of getting into your home without being seen or disturbed.

“Following crime prevention advice can help make life as difficult as possible for them and decreases the chances of your home being targeted.

“Many burglaries happen because a door has been left unlocked or window has been left open, which is really an open invitation for burglars. We can’t stress enough how important it is to make sure your front and back doors are locked and your windows are closed and locked, even when you’re in the house.

“Improving security features like locks and alarms, and making sure your house always looks occupied can also make a big difference.”

DS Hewson added: “We will continue with our relentless approach to protecting the public, reducing burglary victims and catching offenders.

“As ever we’d urge the public to report any suspicious behaviour in their area so that we can act on that information.

“If you have information about people suspected to be involved in burglary, call Nottinghamshire Police on 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. In an emergency always call 999.”
