A van containing food parcels for the homeless was stolen at the weekend, leaving the victim devastated and the vulnerable without supplies.

Quick work by officers managed to track down the vehicle 24-hours later, but sadly the items including food, toiletries, clothing and other essentials haven't been recovered.

Officers are now appealing to anyone who can help with their enquiries to come forward.

Inspector Amy English said: "We are determined to find out who stole the van and make them face the consequences of their actions.

"Incidents like this cause considerable upset and inconvenience for charities. That’s why we work so hard to track down suspects and get justice for victims.

"The victims were trying to do some fantastic work in the local community, during a very difficult time for people and it's so sad to see people stealing food parcels for the homeless.

“Enquiries are ongoing and we are appealing for anyone who was in the area and witnessed anything that may be relevant to our investigation to come forward.

"Nottinghamshire Police received a report of a van being stolen on Saturday (20 February 2021) in Hucknall Road in Carrington.

"It was reported the vehicle, which contained the parcels, was stolen around 1pm.

"The following day the van was located by officers on Oxengate in Arnold, but sadly all the items inside had been taken.

"If anyone has any information to help with our enquiries please call 101, quoting incident number 412 of 20 February 2021."
