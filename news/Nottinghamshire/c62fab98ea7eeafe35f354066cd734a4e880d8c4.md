A 15-year-old boy was attacked and suffered stab wounds to his eye, leg and head following an aggravated burglary.

The teenage was taken to hospital with a reported gash to the side of his head. His injuries have since been described as not life altering.

Nottinghamshire Police were called at around 7.20pm on Saturday night (2 January 2021) following a report of the boy being attacked at his home address in Windmill Lane in Sneinton.

Detective Sergeant Jon Kerry of Nottinghamshire Police is leading the investigation.

He said: "This must have been a terrifying incident, which has seen a teenager being taken to hospital for treatment.

"Thankfully his injuries aren't life altering or life threatening.

"We'd like to thank his neighbours for making the call to the emergency services, so he could receive treatment as soon as possible.

"The boy was in a bedroom at the home, when he was attacked by two men wearing masks who went onto steal expensive clothing and a laptop.

"We are now appealing for anyone who may have seen something suspicious in the area to help with our enquiries.

â€œNottinghamshire Police takes all reports of burglary seriously and any reports involving violence are something which we work extremely hard to tackle.

"We are also appealing for members of the public to check their dash cam footage and get in touch with us if you can help with our enquiries."

Anyone with information should call Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 575 of 2 January 2021.
