Two men were arrested and three men taken to hospital after a report of a fight at a service station.

One of the injured men was found unconscious when police arrived after a group of men were seen fighting, including one using a metal pole.

The suspects drove off following the incident at Ladybrook Service Station in Ladybrook Lane, Mansfield, at 9.55am yesterday (Saturday) but officers later arrested two men, aged 46 and 41, on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm with intent in connection with the investigation.

The three injured men were taken to King's Mill Hospital in Sutton-in-Ashfield for treatment but their injuries were not life-threatening or life-altering and they have since been discharged.

The arrested men have been questioned by detectives and released on police bail pending further enquiries.

Detective Sergeant Jamie Moore, who is leading the investigation, said: "Disturbances of this nature in a public place in broad daylight can be concerning and officers will always move quickly to respond.

"Officers made two swift arrests and have conducted a number of enquiries in the area, including reviewing CCTV footage and interviewing witnesses.

"We are working hard to establish the full circumstances of the incident and would still like to hear from anyone who may have witnessed it or have any information that could help the enquiry, including dash-cam footage of events in the area at that time."

Anyone with information is urged to contact Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 161 of 13 March 2021.
