An 18-year-old man has been arrested after allegedly pinning a woman to a wall in the early hours of this morning and in a separate incident earlier this week, holding a knife to the throat of another.

Officers were called to Clifton Lane in Nottingham the early hours of Saturday morning following a report of the assault. They quickly located the man and he was detained. The knife allegedly used in another incident was also seized by officers.

Police Sergeant John Bridgwater of Nottinghamshire Police said: "The force takes all reports involving knives extremely seriously.

“We work really hard to take as many weapons as possible of our streets and to educate people on the dangers of carrying a knife.

“I would urge anyone who saw this incident to come forward and help us with the investigation.

"Officers attended at around 4.30am this morning following the report. An 18-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of ABH. He remains in police custody.

”One of the victim suffered minor injuries.”

If anyone can help officers with their enquiries please call 101, quoting incident number 83 of 5 December 2020.
