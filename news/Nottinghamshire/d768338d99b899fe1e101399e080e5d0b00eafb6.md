Four teenagers were arrested after a disturbance in a busy city street.

Police rushed to Milton Street in Nottingham City Centre shortly before 5.30pm yesterday when a fight was reported.

After chasing people from the scene officers detained four suspects.

Two males aged 17 and 15 were arrested on suspicion of affray. A 14-year-old male was also arrested on suspicion of possessing and imitation firearm and another 15-year-old for possessing a knife.

They remain in police custody.

Detective Constable Wendy Brown: “This disturbance was spotted by a PCSO on a busy city centre street. The officer immediately called for assistance, then what followed was an excellent bit of police work.

"The four suspects were swiftly detained after being pursued on foot and the weapons were recovered.

“Violence, public disorder and carrying knives will never be tolerated on the streets of Nottingham and anyone displaying such behaviour will be robustly dealt with”
