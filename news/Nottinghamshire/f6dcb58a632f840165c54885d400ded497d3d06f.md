Officers from Radford Road’s Neighbourhood Policing Team spotted a car driving suspiciously and arrested a man for drug driving offences.

Police on patrol saw the car in Forest Road at around 10pm last night (Wednesday 10 February) and moved to investigate.

Once the car was stopped, officers questioned the driver and identified that the car was not insured.

A small quantity of what is thought to be class A drugs were recovered following a search and a 38-year-old man was subsequently arrested on suspicion of possession of class A drugs, driving while under the influence of drugs and driving without insurance.

Neighbourhood Policing Inspector Amy English, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Drug and drink driving offences are incredibly dangerous. They not only pose a risk to the driver but to the public and we will always take these incidents very seriously.

“Our officers did a fantastic job last night to take action against a vehicle being driven suspiciously and take quick action to make an arrest in connection with the incident.

“The recovery of a small amount of drugs is also positive.

“Radford Road’s Neighbourhood Policing Team, alongside Operation Reacher and response officers, are always looking for ways to tackle criminal activity and we work closely with our partners and the community to ensure that resident’s concerns are addressed as soon as possible.

“Last night is a great example of the work that police do every day in neighbourhoods to keep the public safe.

“I would encourage residents with any concerns in the area to speak to our officers on patrol or call 101.

“I also recommend that residents sign up to the Neighbourhood Alert system. When signed up, people will receive regular updates on police activity in the area through their chosen method of contact.

“It’s a brilliant way to keep in touch with your local policing team. To find out more, head to https://www.nottinghamshirealert.co.uk/.”
