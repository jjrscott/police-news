A vulnerable woman was allegedly threatened with a kitchen knife and had money, a television and a bank card stolen.

Police officers have since arrested a 32-year-old man in connection with the incident in the early hours of this morning (20 December 2020).

It was reported that a man entered a house and threatened the woman at Chadburn Road in Mansfield on Monday (14 December 2020). The man then left the house with her possessions.

Detective Inspector Gayle Hart said: ""This must have been a terrifying experience for the victim who had her possessions taken.

"We are currently working to establish what happened. Robbery is an incredibly serious offence that we will always investigate thoroughly.

“We would like to speak to anyone who saw what happened and would ask them to call us on 101 quoting incident 331 of 19 December 2020.”
