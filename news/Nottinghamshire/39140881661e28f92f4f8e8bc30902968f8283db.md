A man wanted for connection with multiple burglaries, including an incident which resulted in a woman needing hospital treatment for a medical emergency, has been arrested.

A joint effort from officers across multiple departments led to the arrest of the 45-year-old man in Radford yesterday.

Police from the Tactical Support Group and the City Centre Operation Reacher team made the arrest following a Nottinghamshire Police investigation.

Detectives are now questioning the man as part of investigations into 28 incidents, including multiple burglaries and incidents of fraud, in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire.

One burglary, which is reported to have happened in Fox Grove Court in Basford on 9 March, resulted in a woman having a medical emergency. She has since returned home after being treated in hospital.

Detective Constable Tim Townsend, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “This combined effort across multiple departments in the force resulted in a man being arrested as part of multiple investigations into burglaries across Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire.

“Burglary is a very serious offence that can have lasting consequences on victim’s, often leaving them feeling scared in their own homes.

“We work incredibly hard to apprehend suspects and take appropriate action against offenders and officers did a fantastic job yesterday to make the arrest.

“The man is now being questioned as part of Nottinghamshire Police’s and Derbyshire Police’s investigations.”
