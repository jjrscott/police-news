Nottinghamshire Police has named two people who died in a collision.

Jane Theakstone, 49, and Lee Theakstone, 45, were both killed in the collision on the B600 near Jubilee Hill in Selston. Another woman remains in a critical but stable condition in hospital.

Officers from Nottinghamshire Police were called at around 10.18am on 19 December to a report of a collision between three cars.

Case Investigator Sarah Butler said: “My thoughts of with loved ones of those involved during what must be an unimaginably difficult time for them.

“Lee’s family wished to thank people for their help and support since the incident, and Jane’s family has asked for privacy at this difficult time.

“I want to appeal again for any witnesses or anyone who may have dashcam footage of the incident to please come forward.

"We are keen to speak to the drivers of a 2019/20 type red Ford Puma and a works vehicle, believed to be from a roofing company, who we think were travelling through Selston just after 10am and may be able to offer us some valuable information."

Anyone with information should call Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 199 of 19 December 2020.
