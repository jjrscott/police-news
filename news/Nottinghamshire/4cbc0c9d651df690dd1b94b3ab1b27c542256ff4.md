Residents in a shared flat in St Ann's had to quickly evacuate following a fire yesterday.

Nottinghamshire Police was called to Comyn Gardens at around 11am following a report of people potentially being trapped inside.

On arrival residents made themselves known to emergency services and confirmed no persons were left since.

Detective Sergeant Nick Wood is leading the investigation. He said: "This was incredibly frightening for those at the flat to discover their home alight after the alarm had gone off and it is incredibly lucky no-one was physically harmed.

"This is absolutely unacceptable and officers are working hard to gather the information we need.

"However, we would like to reassure people that we don't believe there is any wider risk to the public and we continue our enquiries and investigation into this incident.

"Officers moved quickly to track down and arrest a 28-year-old man this morning in South Yorkshire on suspicion of arson. He remains in police custody in Nottinghamshire."
