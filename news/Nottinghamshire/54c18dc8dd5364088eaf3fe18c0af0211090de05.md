Officers on patrol who spotted a car and a lorry parked in a layby have arrested two men on suspicion of possession of a bladed article article and going equipped to steal.

When response teams pulled into the layby off the A617 bypass in Averham at around 12.40am today (27 February), the vehicles sped off but were stopped a short distance later.

Three knives were recovered from the car along with several containers and hoses which are associated with obtaining fuel from vehicles.

Sergeant Ian Holmes said: "Our patrol teams are always on the look-out for anything that doesn't appear to be quite right across Nottinghamshire and will always act on anything they're suspicious about.

"Fuel theft from lorries and other vehicles is something we are always proactively investigating and we take extremely seriously.

"We continue our enquiries and encourage anyone with concerns about this type of crime to get in touch."

The men, aged 23 and 29, remain in custody while enquiries continue.

If you have any information in relation to theft of fuel from vehicles, please call Nottinghamshire Police on 101. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
