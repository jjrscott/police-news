Nottinghamshire Police’s Citizen in Policing Team has launched a competition to celebrate some of Nottinghamshire’s most talented young people.

The competition forms part of the force’s activity around Stephen Lawrence Day, which takes place on 22 April.

There are several categories people can enter work into, as listed below:

 1. Produce a poster OR song that uses the words “Live our best life” or “A legacy of Change” or “Because of Stephen”
 2. Produce a poster OR song that represents bringing the community together.
 3. Produce a poster OR song that is against knife crime
 4. Produce a poster OR song that is against hate crime or any forms of discrimination

Each winner will receive a £40 gift card as a prize for their efforts.

This competition is open for all 10 – 18 year olds and will close on the 26 March at 3pm.

Romel Davis, Force Outreach Worker at Nottinghamshire Police, said: “I see so many incredible examples of work from young people every day and this competition is a brilliant way to celebrate that.

“It is so important that we recognise the talent of young people in our communities and give them a platform to showcase their work and efforts.

“I’d encourage anyone to enter and look forward to seeing the work that people produce.”

Those wishing to enter the competition should submit their entries to positiveengagement@nottinghamshire.pnn.police.uk
