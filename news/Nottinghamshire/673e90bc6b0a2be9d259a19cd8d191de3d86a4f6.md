Detectives are hunting a masked intruder who stabbed a man with a zombie knife after bursting into his flat.

The 19-year-old suffered a significant cut to his hand and a stab wound to his thigh.

It was reported the offender attacked the man in his living room having tailgated a delivery driver to gain access to the complex in Lace Market last night.

He was taken to hospital but his injuries are not life-threatening.

Detective Sergeant Andy Buxton is leading the investigation. He said: "We are keen to speak to these people who we believe were in the area around the time the incident took place.

"Luckily the victim's injuries are not life-threatening, but it is clearly distressing for his family and friends and for people who live in this area.

"My team have been working to establish who was behind the attack and we are determined to bring them to justice.

"Officers were quickly on the scene in Beck Street in Lace Market at around 6.10pm last night to find a man with serious injuries to his hand and leg.

"It was reported that he was in his living room when a masked man burst in and attacked him.

"The offender then fled the flat on foot.

"Detectives continue to investigate local CCTV footage and are asking for anyone who saw anyone suspicious in the area to come forward to help with our enquiries.

"If you have any information please call 101, quoting incident number 484 of 5 January 2021. You can also contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.‚Äù
