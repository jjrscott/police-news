A 39-year-old man has been arrested and now charged with 20 child sexual offences.

National Crime Agency officers arrested the man in the early hours of Tuesday after locating him in Dover.

The arrest and charge follows a report of sexual communication with a child in July 2019 in Warsop, Nottinghamshire. He was originally reported by an online child abuse group.

The man has been remanded into custody and appeared at Kent Magistrates Court this week. His next court appearance will be at Canterbury Crown Court on 4 January 2021.

Mezbaha Uddin of Salisbury Road in Liverpool has been charged with a number of incidents between September 2018 and July 2020. The charges include eight counts on attempted to engage in sexual communication with a child and five counts of making indecent images of a child.

Detective Sergeant James Oakton of Nottinghamshire Police is leading the investigation. He said: "We have worked closely with colleagues from Kent Police and the National Crime Agency following the arrest earlier this week.

"This was a fantastic bit of police work and we are pleased to have now charged a 39-year-old man.

"The arrest was made in connection with a sexual offence which was reported last year.

"Uddin was dealt with by Nottinghamshire Police officers in Kent, however this was a real joint effort to get this over the line.

â€œThe safeguarding of children and young people is a priority for Nottinghamshire Police."Child sex offences of any kind are taken incredibly seriously and we have a number of tactics in place to catch offenders out.

"No child should be subjected to any sexual offence and it's our duty to protect them."
