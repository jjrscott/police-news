Police have charged a 28-year-old after a man was allegedly robbed of his mobile phone and cash that had been withdrawn from a post office.

Ricky Norman of London Road in Nottingham city centre has been remanded in custody and appeared at Nottingham Magistrates' Court this morning charged with robbery.

Nottinghamshire Police received a report that a man threatened and then assaulted, before having his belongings taken from him on Palin Street in Hyson Green on 12 March 2021.

Officers made an arrest on Tuesday (23 March 2021) in connection with the offence.

Detective Sergeant Nigel Malik is leading the investigation. He said: "Detectives have worked hard to identify a suspect in this case and are grateful for assistance from the community who responded to our media appeal for information earlier this month.

"We continue to provide support to the victim in this case who suffered not life altering injuries.

"We are committed to protecting the public and will vigorously investigate violent crimes such as this.

"Nottinghamshire Police takes these types of offences very seriously and will always strive to put suspects before the courts."
