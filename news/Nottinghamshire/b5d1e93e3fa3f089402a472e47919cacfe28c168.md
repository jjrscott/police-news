Two men are due to appear in court charged in connection with an alleged attempt to steal a catalytic converter from a car in Wollaton.

Jason Hemsell, 31, of Manton Crescent, Lenton Abbey, and Lee Hemsell, 34, of Raymede Drive, Bestwood, are due to appear at Nottingham Magistrates' Court today (Tuesday 9 February 2021) charged with attempted theft from a motor vehicle.

It comes after a report of two men allegedly trying to steal a catalytic converter from a vehicle parked in Woodhall Road during the early hours of yesterday.

Detective Sergeant Nick Wood, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "Catalytic converter theft can have a big impact on victims as repairs can be costly and time spent without a vehicle can make it difficult for victims to go about their daily business.

"We are taking positive action as a force to pursue individuals suspected to be involved in this crime type and to bring them to justice.

"We are also urging members of the public to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity by calling us on 101."
