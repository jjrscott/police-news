Nottinghamshire Police teams worked collaboratively across the county which resulted in the recovery of two suspected stolen vehicle and two arrests.

Supported by Op Reacher officers, the force's armed response unit located a suspected stolen van in Grove Street, Beeston at around 6pm yesterday (Thursday 28 February) and initiated tactical containment.

A suspected stolen motorbike was found inside the vehicle.

Two men, aged 26, were arrested on suspicion of two counts of theft in relation to the bike and van. One of the men was also arrested on suspicion of driving while disqualified, driving without a licence and without insurance.

The van is believed to have been stolen from East Lane, Edwinstowe on 28 December 2020.

Inspector Heather Sutton, District Commander for Newark and Sherwood, said: "This incident saw some great partnership working between several teams within Nottinghamshire Police and shows how we work collaboratively across a wide area to catch any suspect.

"We take vehicle thefts seriously and will go to any length to bring offenders to justice. There's no hiding from us in Nottinghamshire."

The men remain in custody as enquiries continue.
