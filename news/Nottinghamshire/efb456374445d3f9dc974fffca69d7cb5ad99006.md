Police have called for communities to remain vigilant after thousands of pounds worth of jewellery was taken from a house in Bobbers Mill, Nottingham.

Detectives have launched an investigation after a house in Chadwick Road, Bobbers Mill was broken into between 3.15pm and 5.30pm on Tuesday 2nd February 2021.

It was reported that around £70,000 worth of jewellery was taken in the incident and investigating officers are now appealing for anyone who may have seen something suspicious in the area at the time or have any CCTV to get in touch as soon as possible.

Some pictures of the items have been shared by the force as part of an appeal for information.

Police Constable Imran Ahmed, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “This is an awful incident whereby a victim, who is a carer, has had high value items stolen from her.

“While the items are expensive, they also hold incredible sentimental value and as I am sure the public can imagine, this has been an incredibly painful experience for her.

“Burglary is a violation of people’s homes, the experience of which can have lasting impact on victims.

“As a force, Nottinghamshire Police takes reports of burglary very seriously and will investigate all reports thoroughly with a view to taking appropriate action against those responsible.

"We've released some images of what was taken in the incident and I'd ask that if anyone sees the items photographed either online or in person to report it to police as soon as possible on 101 quoting incident number 523 of 2 February 2021."

Anyone with any information on the incident is asked to call Nottinghamshire Police immediately on 101 quoting incident number 523 of 2 February 2021.

DC Ahmed has also called for vigilance and issued the following advice to the public.

He said: “I’d encourage the public to remain vigilant against this kind of offence and follow the advice on our website in order to best secure your home.

“We’d also suggest that if you have someone calling to your address asking to do work or making some strange enquiry, please contact the Nottinghamshire Police force control as quickly as possible, giving as good a description as you can. Including age, sex, height, colour of skin and clothing."
