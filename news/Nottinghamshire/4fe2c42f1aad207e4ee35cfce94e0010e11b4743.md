“We are committed to working with partners to target any criminality, violence and anti-social behaviour that affects our communities in Stapleford.

"In the last few months we have increased patrols and deployed a dedicated knife crime team in the area, but importantly we have been working with partners and third sector providers to engage, prevent and divert young people from becoming involved in crime.
