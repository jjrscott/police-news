Detectives are investigating after a man fell from the window of second floor flat in Radford.

Officers were called to Radford Road at 5.02pm today (Friday 11 December) where a 29-year-old man had fallen onto a parked car.

"This appears to be an isolated incident and we believe there is no threat to the wider public.
