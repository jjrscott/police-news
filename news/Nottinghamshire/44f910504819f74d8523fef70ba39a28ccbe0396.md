Police investigating the stabbing of a teenage boy have made another arrest.

Officers were called to the Hardstaff Road area of Sneinton Dale shortly before 10pm on Thursday 17 December after reports that a 17-year-old boy had been attacked.

The victim, who suffered wounds to his stomach and forearm, spent several days in hospital following the attack.

A 19-year-old man was arrested yesterday (Tuesday) on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. He remains in police custody.

Two other men, aged 18 and 19, have also been arrested in connection with the incident and remain on police bail.

Detective Sergeant Nigel Malik said, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “This was a serious assault in which a young man suffered significant injuries. Knife crime can have a devastating impact on people’s lives and we remain determined to get to get justice for the victim in this case.”
