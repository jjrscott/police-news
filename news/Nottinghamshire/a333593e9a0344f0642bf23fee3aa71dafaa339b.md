Emergency services have been called to a report of a landslide near some homes in a former quarry.

Nottinghamshire Police, Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service, East Midlands Ambulance Service and Mansfield District Council officials have been called to Bank End Close in Mansfield to assess safety following the incident at around 11.40pm yesterday (Wednesday 23 December), following heavy rain in the area. The police helicopter has also been called out.

A small number of properties have been evacuated so far but the situation is being monitored.

It comes just over a year after a number of homes in the close had to be evacuated after a landslide on 7 November 2019 following heavy rain.
