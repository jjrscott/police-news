Detectives investigating a report of a man being shot by an air rifle have arrested two men as part of their investigation.

A man was treated for minor injuries after it was alleged a number of pellets had been fired at him from the weapon.

He was also believed to have been struck by a metal chain in the incident, which happened at around 11.30am in Cottage Lane, Warsop on Sunday 28 March 2021.

An investigation was launched to locate two suspects who were thought to have been involved.

At around 10am yesterday (29 March) morning, a car that was believed to be linked to a suspect was spotted by eagle-eyed officers in north Nottinghamshire.

Police quickly stopped the car and arrested a 30-year-old man on suspicion of wounding with intent.

A 31-year-old man was also arrested and questioned in connection with the offence.

An air rifle was also recovered from the car.

Detective Inspector Stuart Temple, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Firearms offences are incredibly dangerous and serious.

“Nottinghamshire Police will always thoroughly investigate such a offences with a view to taking appropriate action against offenders.

“Thankfully, the victim in this incident only suffered minor injuries, however, with any assault, there is always the potential for more serious consequences.

“Both men have been released on bail pending further enquiries.

“I would now appeal to anyone who may have seen something suspicious in the area at the time to report it to Nottinghamshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 228 of 28 March 2021.”
