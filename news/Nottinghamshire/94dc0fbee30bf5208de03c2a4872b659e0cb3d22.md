Police have made an arrest in connection with a report of a man tricking his way into a pensioner's home in Kirkby-in-Ashfield, telling her that he worked for the council, before stealing her handbag.

A man knocked on the victim's door at around 1.50pm on 8 February 2021. Once inside he snatched her bag and ran out of her house in Hartley Road.

Following enquiries police arrested a 61-year-old man during the early hours of today (Wednesday 24 February 2021) on suspicion of burglary and he remains in custody.

Detective Sergeant Andrew Hall, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "The victim was left very shaken by this incident and feels angry about what happened.

"Distraction burglars often prey on our most vulnerable residents, tricking their way into homes by making up stories, by pretending to work for an official company or asking for help to try to gain entry.

“Nobody should become a victim of crime in their own home, but there are things that can be done to minimise the risks.

“We need residents to be alert to the threat and want to remind them to be on their guard, especially if someone you’re not expecting – a man, woman or even a child – knocks on your door.

“Our advice is always to say no to cold-callers and to report any suspicious activity to police immediately.

"Residents, particularly the elderly and those who live alone, should remain vigilant and ensure that their home is secure at all times, keeping their doors and windows locked.

“We’d also urge those who know vulnerable people who are potentially at risk to share our message with them, to advise them of the signs, remind them to not let in unexpected callers and what to do if they are targeted.

“With more people feeling isolated and alone during the Covid-19 pandemic, distraction burglars may see this as an opportunity to target people.

“If you see somebody acting suspiciously report it to the police immediately by calling 101 or, in an emergency, call 999.”
