Detectives have arrested a teenager in connection with an aggravated burglary in Sneinton, during which a 15-year-old boy was attacked and suffered stab wounds to his eye, leg and head.

Nottinghamshire Police were called at around 7.20pm on Saturday night (2 January 2021) following a report of the boy being attacked at his home address in Windmill Lane.

The boy was taken to hospital with a reported gash to the side of his head. He has since been discharged.

It was reported that the boy was attacked in a bedroom by two males wearing masks who went onto steal expensive clothing and a laptop.

Following extensive enquiries a 15-year-old boy was arrested during the early hours of today (Tuesday 5 January 2021) on suspicion of aggravated burglary and remains in custody.

Detective Sergeant Jon Kerry, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "We're working hard to trace a second suspect in connection with this incident.

"Our enquiries are ongoing and I'm urging anyone who hasn't yet come forward, who may have seen something suspicious in the area or have any information which could help us with our investigation to please get in touch with us.
