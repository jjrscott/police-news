A dangerous driver hurtled toward oncoming traffic as he sped away from cops.

Harvey Jeffries drove up to 20 miles per hour over the speed limit after police tried to stop him in Rosemary Street, Mansfield, driving against oncoming traffic multiple times and going the wrong way on three one-way streets.

After a dangerous mid-day pursuit, avoiding other vehicles and pedestrians, the 19-year-old's time was up after colliding with a police car on Walkden Street, and being arrested on 29 May 2020.

He was also found to have no driving licence or insurance.

Jeffries, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving. He was disqualified from driving for 12 months and sentenced to nine months in prison, suspended for 18 months, at Nottingham Crown Court on Friday (12 February 2021).

He will need to take another test to drive once his disqualification is over, and he was also ordered to complete 20 days as part of a Rehabilitation Activity Requirement set by the court.

PC Shaun Healy, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "This was a very dangerous pursuit, speeding against oncoming traffic, in the middle of the day, in a town centre."The town centre is a 30mph zone for a very good reason, to keep pedestrians and road users safe, and Jeffries drove off at speeds of up to 50mph which could have very easily caused further harm.

"He also went the wrong way up a number of one-way streets, where other vehicles would not only be coming towards him, but would find it difficult to find the space to avoid him during this chase.

"It was fortunate that no one was injured, and indeed that both the police car and his own car got away with only minor damage in the process of stopping him. This is testament to the quick actions of our officers who brought this to a swift close.

"Keeping our roads safe is a priority, and we hope that having this sentence lingering over him for the next year and a half, being ordered to complete rehabilitation work, and during this time of disqualification, Jeffries will reconsider his actions and the way he drives and will cause him to become a safer driver when he does earn his licence."
