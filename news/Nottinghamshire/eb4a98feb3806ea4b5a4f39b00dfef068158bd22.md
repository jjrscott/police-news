A man is due to appear in court following a five-hour rooftop stand-off in Mansfield.

Nottinghamshire Police officers were called to Westfield Lane just before 1.45pm on Sunday (21 March 2021).

The road was blocked off while they dealt with a man who had climbed onto the roof of the old bus station off Lindley Street and started throwing roof tiles, causing damage to a number of vehicles.

Officers negotiated with the man for about five hours before he came down.

Aaron Tomkinson, 30, of George Street, Mansfield, is due to appear at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court today (Tuesday 23 March 2021) charged with affray and four counts of criminal damage.

PC Alex Taylor, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "This incident caused significant disruption to the local community and a number of vehicles were also damaged. Police responded quickly to the report and following negotiations managed to bring the incident to a safe conclusion.”
