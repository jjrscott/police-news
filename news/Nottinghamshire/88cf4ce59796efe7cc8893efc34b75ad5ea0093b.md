Police investigating a report of a man waving a baseball bat around a city centre supermarket have charged a man.

Odai Abushreehah, 20, of Pilcher Gate in Nottingham city centre, is charged with two counts of possession of an offensive weapon and two counts of threatening behaviour.

The charges relate to incidents that happened in the Tesco Express in Fletcher Gate on the 13 and 14 March 2021 where a man was seen waving a baseball bat in the store.

No one was injured in either incident.

Abushreehah was released on bail pending his court appearance on 31 March 2021.

Sergeant James Hirst, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Nottinghamshire Police takes weapons offences very seriously and will thoroughly investigate reports with a view to taking appropriate action against offenders.

“If you see something suspicious in your local area or have any concerns, please report them on 101 or in an emergency, dial 999.”
