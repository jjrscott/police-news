Nottinghamshire Police has issued CCTV images of two men they would like to speak to in connection with a robbery.

Officers were called to a report of a robbery on 25 November 2020 at around 5pm at a post office in Bramcote Lane in Wollaton.

A large amount of money and stamps were taken, with two people reported fleeing the scene on a motorbike.

Police Investigator Bethanie Foster of Nottinghamshire Police said: "We are looking for information regarding a robbery that occurred last month.

"It was reported two men arrived on a motorbike and parked at the front of the post office.

"We have now issued two images of two men we would like to speak to in connection with the incident.

"One man has been described as white, average build, wearing a black helmet. He was dressed in dark bottoms, cuffed at the bottom, with blue markings and black puffer jacket. He was also carrying a navy rucksack.

"The second man we would like to speak has been described as wearing an orange florescent hi-vis jacket and a white helmet.

"Thankfully no one was injured in the incident.

"We are appealing for any witnesses or any drivers who may have recorded dashcam footage of the motorbike to get in touch.

"If you have any information please call 101, quoting incident number 509 of 25 November 2020."
