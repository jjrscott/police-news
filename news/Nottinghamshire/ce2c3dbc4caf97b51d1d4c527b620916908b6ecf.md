Dopey cannabis growers led armed police to their own doorstep after exploding soft drinks cans on a hot coal barbecue.

A worried member of public rang the police after hearing the three Red Bull cans exploding, believing them to have been gunshots being fired inside a house.

Armed officers quickly surrounded the semi-detached in Hollydale Road, Bakersfield, and heard loud voices from the back of the house, only to find the burst cans.

They arrived on the scene and found two men inside surrounded by cannabis plants.

Following a thorough search, 180 cannabis plants were seized and officers also found a large amount of fertilizer, chemicals, three mobile phones and a large amount of cash.

The two men have now been sentenced to a combined total of 40 months in jail.

Laurynus Kasputis, 22 of Hollyroad Road, pleaded guilty to production of cannabis on 18 December 2020 and received 20 months imprisonment.

Co-accused Karolis Jancevicius, 21, of Hollydale Road appeared at Nottingham Crown Court on Friday (19 February 2021) and also pleaded guilty to production of class B drugs (cannabis).

His court appearance was delayed after he reported to the police that he was a victim of modern slavery and he had been forced to look after the plants. However, following further investigations a negative decision for the Modern Slavery referral was made in January 2021.

He was also sentenced to 20 months in prison.

The men produced the illegal drugs, watering and feeding the plants every day and regulating the room's temperature.

Police Constable Shemane Marsh led the investigation. She said: "Officers arrived expecting a firearms incident, so they were shocked to come across two men at a barbecue and to find their large cannabis grow.

"This type of industrial scale of cannabis production can be linked to violent crime and exploitation of the most vulnerable in our communities.

"The illegal production of drugs is blighting our communities and will not be tolerated. That's why we are as committed as ever to taking drugs off our streets and pursuing those involved in their production and distribution.‚Äù

If you suspect anyone in your community is involved in the production of cannabis then please Nottinghamshire Police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
