A woman fled her house after a man smashed his way in through a window after making threats.

The victim was chased out of the house by the man who then returned to cause damage inside.

Police responded quickly to reports of the incident in Lindsay Avenue, Newark, at around 8am today (Sunday 14 February) and arrested a 30-year-old man on suspicion of aggravated burglary and criminal damage. He remains in police custody.

Detective Constable Gareth Peace, who is leading the investigation, said: "This was a distressing incident for the victim, who was unhurt but shaken up by the ordeal.

"Officers quickly made an arrest in connection with the incident, which is self-contained and poses no wider threat to the public.

"We would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the disturbance. I would urge them to call Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 81 of 14 February 2021."
