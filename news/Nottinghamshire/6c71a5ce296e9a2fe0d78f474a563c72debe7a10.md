Nottinghamshire Police is appealing for information after a collision between a man and a car left the man with a fractured skull.

The incident happened at around 10.15pm on Friday 20 November when the man was crossing Nuthall Road near to Stockhill Lane in the Basford area of Nottingham.

The driver of the car did not stop after the incident.

Neighbourhood Inspector Gordon Fenwick of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “This was a serious collision which has left a man with a fractured skull and suffering a bleed on the brain.

“We would really like to hear from anyone who may have information so that we can get to the bottom of how this happened.

“Please think back to whether you were in the area at the time and check any dashcam footage if you have it.”

Anyone with information or footage which could help the investigation should contact Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 712 of 20 November 2020.
