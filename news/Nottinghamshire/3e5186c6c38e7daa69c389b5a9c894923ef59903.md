A 41-year-old man has charged with criminal damage after a shop door was smashed in Nottingham city centre.

Officers were called to the store in Long Row at around 5.15pm yesterday (Sunday 27 December) where the suspect had then locked himself in the rear office.

The response team gained entry and a man was taken into custody.

Christopher Rice, of no fixed abode, was subsequently charged and remanded in custody to appear at Nottingham Magistrates' court tomorrow.

Constable Stuart Howe, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "I'm glad that this incident was swiftly brought to a safe conclusion after officers were quick to respond and arrested a man at the scene who has now been charged and remanded in custody.

"Staff were really shaken and worried about what had happened and we'll be working with them to offer support.

"We continue to carry out all the relevant enquiries in to the circumstances surrounding this job."
