A man has been arrested on suspicion of burglary following an incident at a Beeston business.

Officers were called to a site in Thane Road at around 2.20am yesterday (28 January 2021) after a man had reportedly been detained by security staff at the scene.

Amy English, Neighbourhood Inspector for the area, said: "Security staff acted quickly and bravely in detaining a man at the scene.

"This was coupled with our response officers who arrived within minutes of receiving the report which resulted in an arrest.

"As this case goes to show, we're doing everything we can to support our local businesses at this time and sites are also encouraged to ensure they have as much security as possible."

A 19-year-old man has since been released under investigation and enquiries continue.
