An investigation has been launched after an Audi RS3 was stolen from a garage overnight.

Police were called to Thoresby Drive in Edwinstowe at around 3am this morning (Monday 15 March) after the car was spotted being stolen by a group of people.

It is believed that a group of men had broken into the house. Once inside, it is believed that the men opened the garage and took the car from inside.

Nottinghamshire Police is now appealing for anyone who may have seen something suspicious in the area at the time to get in touch as soon as possible.

Detective Sergeant Gary Hewson, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Burglary can have a devastating impact on victims both financially and psychologically and we will always look to take appropriate action against offenders.

“This incident saw a grey Audi RS3 taken from a garage and we are now working to understand the circumstances.

“I would ask that anyone who has any information about this incident or witnessed something suspicious at the time gets in touch with Nottinghamshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 61 of 15 March 2021.”
