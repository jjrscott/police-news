A police pursuit of a suspicious looking vehicle in Nottingham led to two men being arrested and the recovery of suspected Class A drugs.

Officers spotted a car which appeared to be in a poor condition in the Hucknall Road area shortly before 9pm yesterday (Thursday 24 December 2020).

They followed the car and activated their lights and sirens but it failed to stop and sped away.

During the brief pursuit the driver was allegedly seen to throw a package out of the window. The car was reportedly driven through a red light junction, causing other road users to take evasive action.

It eventually came to a stop in the Woodthorpe Drive area.

Officers arrested a 20-year-old man on suspicion of failing to stop, dangerous driving and possession with intent to supply a Class A drug and a 21-year-old man on suspicion of possession with intent to supply a Class A drug. Both men remain in custody.

Police Constable Simon Lacey, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: â€œThis was excellent work by all officers concerned in this authorised pursuit.

"Thankfully no injuries or damage were caused, the pursuit was brought to a successful and safe conclusion and two suspects are now being questioned in relation to the incident."
