Nottinghamshire Police have issued CCTV footage of a group of boys they wish to speak to in connection with an assault and attempt robbery.

A 17-year-old boy was beaten up whilst he was on a family bike ride, with his mother having to step in and protect him from further attack.

The victim suffered a fractured jaw, but without his family coming to his assistance, his injuries could have been much worse.

The teenager was approached by a group who attempted to pull his bike from his grasp, and then without provocation punched the victim in the face several times.

Police Investigation Officer Russell Oliver is leading the investigation. He said: "We have now issued a short video clip from local CCTV footage. Do you recognise any of the boys shown?

"We are keen to speak to the boys pictured to help with our enquiries.

"This was a horrible attack which let the victim hospitalised. He has since returned home, but was in a great deal of pain and discomfort.

"We have to praise his mother's bravery who came to his aid after witnessing the assault. Without her stepping in, his injuries could have been much worse. She sadly also suffered minor injuries from protecting her son.

"We are now appealing to anyone who saw the incident at around 4.30pm on 16 February 2021 at the Forest Recreational Ground, near to the zig-zag path at the side of the Pavilion, on the opposite side to the children's play area.

"If you saw anything suspicious at around that time in the area please call 101, quoting incident number 465 of 16 February 2021."
