A burglary where £7,000 worth of alcohol was stolen from a bar has led to a man being charged.

The basement of Olivia’s Townhouse, in Chapel Bar, is believed to have been accessed and specialist alcohol which is not available to buy without a license was taken.

The thefts from the venue, which is currently closed due to Coronavirus restrictions, were discovered after management were alerted to the break-in.

Bobby Lunt, 37, of no fixed address, has been charged with burglary following the incident.

Detective Sergeant Andy Hall, who is investigating the incidents, said: “Nottinghamshire Police works hard to tackle burglary, whether it is people intruding on someone’s home or targeting a business.

“I would encourage everyone to be vigilant and always report any suspicious activity around homes or venues to us so that we can do our best to protect property from potential break-ins.”

Lunt has been remanded in custody and will next appear at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday 8 December.
