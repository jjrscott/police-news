A man is due to appear in court charged in connection with an aggravated burglary in Mansfield during which the victim was stabbed.

It comes after a report that two intruders had broken into a house in Bishop Street, shortly after 6am on Thursday (3 December). The victim was stabbed before his off-road bike was stolen.

Minutes later the bike was involved in a collision with a van in Chesterfield Road South at the junction with Paulson's Drive at around 6.20am.

A motorcyclist and pillion passenger were injured and taken to hospital. One of the men, who were both arrested, currently remains in a serious but stable condition.

The victim of the stabbing was also taken to hospital and was subsequently discharged.

Tristan Fretwell, 24, of Haydn Road, Sherwood, is due to appear at Nottingham Magistrates' Court today charged with robbery, possession of a knife in a public place and criminal damage.

Detective Sergeant Dave Prest, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "We are continuing to work hard to understand the circumstances of this serious incident.

â€œWe're still urging anyone with information or any drivers who may have recorded dash-cam footage to please contact Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident 64 of 3 December, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
