Detectives investigating an incident where a man was attacked with a hammer and a metal pipe have charged two men in connection with the incident.

Police were called to High Street in Edwinstowe at around 8pm on 18 January 2021 after a man had suffered multiple skull fractures, a broken nose, broken ribs and a broken finger in the attack.

Reece O’Brien , 26, of Henton Road in Edwinstowe and Deacon Cooper, 20, of Trinity Road in Edwinstowe, are both charged with grievous bodily harm and criminal damage in connection with the incident.

The criminal damage charges relate to an incident that happened in Lansbury Road in Edwinstowe on 6 March. In that incident, it was reported that windows and a fence had been damaged at a house.

Detective Constable Greg Evans, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Violence has no place on our streets and we will always investigate reports thoroughly.

“The victim suffered multiple injuries in this attack and we have been working hard to establish the circumstances since it was reported to us.”

O’Brien and Cooper appeared at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court yesterday.
