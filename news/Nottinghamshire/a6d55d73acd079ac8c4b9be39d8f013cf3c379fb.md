An elderly woman has been left frightened and shaken after her window was smashed and her bank card was stolen.

The victim was about to go upstairs to bed when she noticed glass on the floor in her kitchen and felt a draft coming into her home.

Nottinghamshire Police were called at around 11pm last night to a house in Western Terrace in The Park following a report of a burglary.

Detective Inspector Daniel Johnstone is leading the investigation. He said: "This must have been a terrifying incident for the elderly woman.

"We are supporting the victim's welfare will be treated as a priority as we start our investigations of how this happened.

"It was reported that a bar was used to break the window and gain entry to the property. They then stole the woman's handbag which contained her house keys and bank cards.

"Officers were quickly on the scene to conduct a search, but sadly no arrests have been made yet.

"We are now appealing to anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area to come forward and help us with our enquiries.

"If you can help please call 101, quoting incident 748 of 22 December 2020.

"Burglary is a really upsetting crime for victims – it is horrible to find that someone has been into your house and rifled through your belongings.

“That’s why we work so hard to disrupt this type of crime and we will always investigate as thoroughly as we can with the evidence available to us."
