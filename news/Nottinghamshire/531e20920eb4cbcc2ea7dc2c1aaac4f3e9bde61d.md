A police officer's earring was ripped out and a colleague was punched in the face after they attended a disturbance in Gedling.

Officers were called to an incident inside an address in Lymn Avenue during the early hours of Wednesday 30 December 2020.

While in attendance one police officer was struck around her ear which caused her earing to rip out and resulted in bleeding. Another officer was punched in the face and a third officer was pushed during the incident which led to a man being arrested at the scene.

Dylan Schmidt, 40, of Lymn Avenue, appeared at Nottingham Magistrates' Court on Thursday 31 December 2020 charged with three counts of assaulting an emergency worker. He was bailed to re-appear at the same court on 25 February 2021.

Inspector Chris Pearson, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "Officer assaults are totally unacceptable. Thankfully the officers in this incident were not seriously hurt but we will not tolerate assaults on police officers and other frontline emergency workers.

"They should not have to suffer violence at any time nor as they continue to serve the public in these challenging times.

â€œThe message is loud and clear that anyone who commits offences of this nature can expect to be dealt with swiftly and robustly."
