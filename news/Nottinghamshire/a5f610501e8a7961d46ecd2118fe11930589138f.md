A man was arrested on suspicion of burglary and theft within three minutes of a break-in being reported to Nottinghamshire Police.

Officers received a call that a shop in Stodman Street, Newark had been broken into at 10:16pm Yesterday (1 December).

The response team was instantly on scene and arrested a 51-year-old man. They also recovered around Â£3,600 worth of perfume.

The man was further arrested in connection with a theft at a shop in Kings Road at around 9.15pm on 16 November.

He remains in custody while enquiries continue.

Inspector Heather Sutton, district Commander for Newark and Sherwood, said: "My team were really quick to act on this report, arresting a man within three minutes of it being reported to us.

"We have been actively working on a massive crackdown in acquisitive crime in the town centre since the beginning of October and are working very hard to bring offenders to justice.

"We continue our activity which includes plain clothed officers patrolling the streets at night, in a bid to catch offenders unawares."
