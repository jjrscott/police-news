Nottinghamshire Police detectives have asked the local community to be aware of window cleaning scams.

The fraud incidents are rare across Nottinghamshire, but a number of incidents have been reported during the past 12 months.

Offenders pretend to be window cleaners and then target the elderly and vulnerable.

They often begin to clean the victim's windows, making up a story that their usual cleaner wasn't available and then ask payment.

Detective Sergeant Ashley Xavier of the force's Economic & Cyber Crime Unit said: â€œAlthough quite rare, this type of offending can have a considerable impact on victims and is always treated with the utmost seriousness by the police.

"If people are approached by anyone wanting to carry out unwanted work on their house they should call us immediately on 101.

"Sadly the elderly have fallen for scams in the New Basford and Bulwell areas.

"Fraudsters have managed to enter properties from the front and back doors, asking for money and defrauding victims.

"We just want people to be aware that this does happen and we've had reports of incidents like this in the recent past.

"During the pandemic, there are groups and individuals preying on the vulnerable people especially the elderly. We had a series of window cleaner distractions.

"We are asking people to inform their neighbours, friends and family so they are vigilant and don't become a victim of fraud.

"If you are worried please don't hesitate to call the force on 101."
