Nottinghamshire Police officers are investigating reports of a stolen Land Rover Defender 90 which was taken from a home in West Bridgford.

The distinctive and unique vehicle (pictured) has been described as a grey customised Overfinch Land Rover Defender 4x4 .

The incident happened on Trent Boulevard/Lady Bay area overnight on the evening of 15 February and officers are now appealing to anyone who have seen anything suspicious in the area to call the police.

Police Sergeant Amy Wilson is leading the investigation. She said: "The vehicle was secure outside the victim's garage.

"It was reported it happened between 11pm on 15 February and 9.00am on 16 February 2021.

"The car has distinctive bodywork and is of high value. It also has seats which are unique with black & pale grey leather. The centre cubby box and dashboard grab handle are also in the same leather sign. All are branded with Overfinch.

"The victim is obviously distraught. Thefts have such an impact on the victims as not only are items taken, but it is an invasion of their property and indeed privacy.

"We want to reassure the community that we take reports such as these very seriously and we are doing everything possible to find those responsible."

If you have any information which could help regarding the theft please contact Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 128 of 16 February 2021.
