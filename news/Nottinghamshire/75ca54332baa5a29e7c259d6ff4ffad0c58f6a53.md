A stolen car that drove off from officers in Nottingham city centre was stopped using tactical contact, resulting in two arrests.

Nottinghamshire Police spotted an MG ZS Excite driving suspiciously in Nottingham at around 3pm yesterday when it made off from officers, driving dangerously.

The car was then seen by armed response vehicles near Queen’s Drive industrial estate where the driver is alleged to have attempted to evade arrest.

Tactical contact was made by suitably trained officers and the pursuit brought to a safe conclusion.

Two men, aged 29 and 24, were arrested on suspicion of theft of motor vehicle. One of the men was also arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving, failing to stop and driving under the influence of drugs.

Superintendent Paul Winter, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Nottinghamshire Police takes incidents of reckless driving very seriously and will take proactive action against any drivers seen to be committing such offences.

“Not only does it put the driver and potential passengers at risk of serious harm but it also endangers the public – the costs can be fatal.

“Our officers did an excellent job to bring this incident to a safe conclusion and we are now questioning two men as part of our enquiries.

“Thankfully, no one was seriously injured in the incident and we are now thoroughly investigating the circumstances.”
