A man is due in court today charged with weapons offences after a police investigation into an alleged Taser threat.

Officers seized a Taser device, throwing stars, a sword, a crossbow, a lock knife and petrol can with a fuse cord when they searched a house in connection with a report of a man being threatened with an electric stun device.

The incident happened in Beckingham Court, Mansfield, at around 10.35am on Saturday.

Thirty-seven-year-old Jamie Hutchinson, of Beckingham Court, Mansfield, is due to appear at Nottingham Magistrates' Court today charged with two offences of possession of a firearm and common assault in connection with the incident.

Detective Sergeant Matt Scott, who is leading the investigation, said: "Nottinghamshire Police treats weapon offences seriously and will aim to put people suspected of weapon-related offences before the court at the earliest opportunity."
