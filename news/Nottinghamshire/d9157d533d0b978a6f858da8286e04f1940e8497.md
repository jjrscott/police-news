A prolific shoplifter who committed 41 crimes stealing gift sets, food and makeup from a number of shops has been jailed.

Aaron Kelly committed the majority of the incidents across Clifton and Ruddington from September 2020 and he was given a deferred sentence after appearing in court in December.

However, he went on to commit further shop thefts following his sentence and was arrested again by the local beat team on 29 December 2020.

The 31-year-old, of no fixed address, was charged with a further 10 offences

He was remanded to appear at Nottingham Crown Court on 30 December 2020 and received a 26-week sentence.

The charges are in relation to incidents over a prolonged time, including 33 charges since September 2020. They include items being stolen, as well as goods being smashed inside a shop.

Police Sergeant Nigel Bradley led the investigation. He said: "This was excellent, persistent work by the off road bike team who spotted a man in Clifton where he was detained.

"A number of shops in Clifton were being continually targeted and their co-operation have been invaluable in collecting the evidence.

"The Clifton Police team support local businesses and respond immediately when incidents are reported to ensure we maintain a good working relationship.

"Local officers have worked tirelessly from the first incident in September and continue to work closely with partners and residents to help us identify any people who are suspected of handling stolen goods. I'd also like to praise Police Constable Jane Gibson who has put in a significant amount of work into the investigation.

"With your help, we will be able to ensure prolific shop lifters will be behind bars this coming year."
