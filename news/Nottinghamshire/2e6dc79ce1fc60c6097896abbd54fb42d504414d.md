A man was arrested in the early hours of this morning following a reported burglary.

The 33-year-old man was tracked down at around 4.30am following a report of the incident earlier this month.

It was reported on 16 March at around 5pm that a man entered a house in Coleridge Street in Radford through the front door and stole a bike from the hallway.

He attempted to leave through the garden and was about to pedal away, but was disturbed and he left the bike near to the scene.

The victim approached the man and he was pushed causing him to stumble.

A 33-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of burglary and common assault.

Detective Constable Dionne Love of Nottinghamshire Police is leading the investigation. He said: "A man has now been arrested in connection with the burglary and common assault. He remains in police custody.

"This was an upsetting incident for the victim and we are determined to get to the bottom of what happened here.

â€œWe believe that this incident is contained and that the people involved in this incident are all known to one another. There is no wider risk to public safety.

"Nottinghamshire Police takes burglary extremely seriously and will investigate all reports thoroughly."
