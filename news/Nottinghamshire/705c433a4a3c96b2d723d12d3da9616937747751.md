Two drivers have been arrested on suspicion of drink-driving after a number of stop checks during Nottinghamshire's road safety campaign.

The enforcement activity has been taking place at different locations throughout the county including overnight.

It resulted in a 59-year-old man being arrested in Castle Boulevard, Lenton and a 26-year-old woman arrested in Ambleside, Gamston both at around 3am today (Friday 11 December).

Neighbourhood Inspector Craig Berry, said: "The Rushcliffe response team were carrying out enforcement work as part of the county-wide Christmas drink and drug driving campaign.

"As part of this, we have access to additional resources and we are committed to carrying through the necessary activity in order to get these dangerous drivers off the road.

"Drink and drug driving is a callous and selfish act and we want to stop offenders before they cause serious havoc to an innocent personâ€™s life."

The two men were released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Nottinghamshire Police is welcoming information from the public about drink and drug drivers. If you do suspect someone is committing this act, please call us on 101.
