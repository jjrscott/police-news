A man was arrested and had to be taken to hospital after crashing his vehicle into a car in the early hours of this morning.

Nottinghamshire Police were called to Ilkeston Road in Radford at around 1.45am on Sunday (20 December 2020) following a report of a collision of a car with a parked vehicle.

A 28 year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of drug driving. He remains in police custody.

The man had to be taken to hospital for a head injury, which isn't believed to be life altering or life changing.

Police Sergeant David Sadler of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "The decision to drive while you’re under the influence of drink or drugs takes just a split second, but the consequences could last a lifetime.

"The results of drink or drug driving also have massive life-changing consequences for those who commit the crime, not only in terms of a possible prison sentence, but also the loss of their job, relationship and freedom to drive.

"Nottinghamshire Police will continue to target drink and drug drivers throughout this year.

"We can all play a part in keeping our county’s roads safe and reducing the number of people who are risking their lives and the lives of others.

"If you know or suspect that someone is driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, try to discourage them but if they won’t listen to you ring us and report them.

"Thankfully in this particular incident no one has suffered any serious injuries.

"Call us on 101 or 999 if there's an immediate threat to life or property. You can also call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
