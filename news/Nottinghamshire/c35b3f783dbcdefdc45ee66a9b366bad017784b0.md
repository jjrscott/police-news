Officers have executed firearms warrants at two properties in Langdale Road and Westwood Road in Sneinton this morning as part of an ongoing investigation.

Westwood Road was temporarily closed while the warrants were carried out and officers searched the properties. No arrests were made and our enquiries are ongoing.

Inspector Karl Thomas, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “I’d like to reassure people there is no wider risk to the community and officers remain in the area while our investigations continue.

“As today’s proactive action shows, we will swiftly act on intelligence we receive in order to protect our communities from harm.

"I would appeal to members of the public to come forward with any information about people suspected to be involved in criminality. The more information we get, the better intelligence picture we can build and the more robust action we can take.

“If you have any information regarding any criminal issues in your area, don’t hesitate to call us on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. In an emergency call 999.”
