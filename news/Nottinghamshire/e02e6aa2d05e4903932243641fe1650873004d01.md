A group of friends have been left shaken after three masked men entered their property through a window and demanded they handed over their phones.

Nottinghamshire Police were called to a house in St Ann's following a report of an aggravated burglary, which saw three phones being stolen.

It was also reported that they searched the house and threatened the friends, demanding they handed over money.

Police Constable Thomas Rawlings is leading the investigation. He said: "This must have been a terrifying experience for the residents inside.

"It was reported the group entered the house in Sherwin Walk at around 6pm on 2 February 2021.

"Officers will be providing ongoing support for the victims as a team of officers work tirelessly to trace those responsible.

"Burglary is an extremely invasive crime and has huge impacts for those involved, both homeowners and retailers who, in particular, are already facing various challenges in the current climate.

"We would reassure people that reports such as this are taken very seriously and we will thoroughly investigate where this has happened.

"We are following up a number of lines of enquiry to get these men in custody but I would appeal for anyone who has information, CCTV or dash-cam footage of anything suspicious in the area to come forward as soon as possible.

"If you can help please call 101, quoting incident 540 of 2 February 2021."
