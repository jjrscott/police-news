Police have blocked off a road in Mansfield town centre and are urging members of the public to stay away as they continue to deal with a public order incident.

Officers are in attendance after a man climbed onto the roof of the old bus station off Lindley Street and started throwing missiles, causing damage to a number of vehicles.

Police were called to the location just before 1.45pm today (Sunday 21 March 2021). Westfield Lane has been closed off while specially-trained negotiators continue to engage with the man and work hard to bring the incident to a safe conclusion.

No injuries have been reported.

Inspector Hayley Crawford, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “We’re urging people to please stay away from the area while we deal with this situation and work to resolve it.”
