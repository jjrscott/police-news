A woman was woken up in the early hours of this morning to find a man helping himself to her food and using her microwave.

The victim was shocked to find the offender, who was reportedly armed with a knife, in her kitchen. The man allegedly threw items at the woman during an altercation.

It was also reported that a number of car windows had been damaged nearby and a pole was thrown into another house's open window minutes before the woman rang police.

Detective Constable Nathan Wall is leading the investigation. He said: "This must have been a terrifying experience for the victim. Thankfully none of the occupants suffered any injuries.

"Nottinghamshire Police officers were quickly dispatched to Great Hoggett Drive in Chilwell following the report of the burglary at around 2am on Sunday (28 March 2021).

"A 29-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary and possession of a bladed article.

"The force takes reports of burglaries and weapon-related offences extremely seriously.

"Being the victim of a burglary is always a deeply traumatic experience and can leave people feeling vulnerable and frightened in their own home, a place where everyone should feel safe.

"That’s why Nottinghamshire Police treats burglary with the utmost seriousness and works tirelessly to pursue offenders and bring them to justice.

“I would like to reassure members of the community that we will investigate reports of burglary and continue to deal robustly with anyone believed to be involved in such crimes and work hard to secure justice for burglary victims."
