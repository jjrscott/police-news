Rushcliffe Op Reacher officers swiftly arrested a teenager who was spotted by an eagle-eyed member of the public reportedly in possession with a knife in West Bridgford.

A 15-year-old boy was reportedly cycling in Central Avenue with the suspected weapon in his jacket at around 2.15pm yesterday (24 March 2021).

Officers attended the scene and quickly located the boy, who was stopped and searched. A knife was recovered and the boy was arrested.

The teenager, who can’t be named for legal reasons, has since been charged with possession of bladed article in a public place and is due to appear at Notts Youth Court on 7 April 2021.

Neighbourhood Inspector Craig Berry said: "As a force we take all reports involving knives extremely seriously and work really hard to take as many weapons as possible of our streets and to educate people on the dangers of carrying a knife.

"We will not tolerate people carrying knives in Nottinghamshire and we will always look to take action against those who are found to commit such offences.

"We all need to work together to combat knife crime and we’re urging anyone with information on knife crime in their local community to call Nottinghamshire Police on 101, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. In an emergency, always dial 999."
