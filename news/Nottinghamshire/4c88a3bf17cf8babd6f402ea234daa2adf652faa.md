When a barber reopened their shop after they had returned from a break over Christmas, they found their store had been ransacked.

Hair clippers, a camera, perfume, and the store’s CCTV system had been stolen from Hair International in Canning Circus in Nottingham city centre between 24 December and 29 December 2021.

A total of more than £2000 worth of items had been stolen and a police investigation was launched to identify and apprehend the person responsible.

It was established that a person had forced entry via the back door of the shop.

Enquiries made by officers working in Nottingham city central’s neighbourhood policing team led to Lee Chatfield, 44, of no fixed address, being identified as a suspect and arrested in connection with the incident.

Chatfield was subsequently charged and pleaded guilty to burglary.

He was sentenced to eight months in prison at Nottingham Crown Court on Friday 29 January 2021.

Investigator Emily Whiteside, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Nottinghamshire Police takes burglary very seriously and will always thoroughly investigate reports.

“We are passionate about protecting our business communities and are pleased that good police work located and apprehended Chatfield in connection with this incident.

“Burglaries can have a massive impact on businesses. Not just in a financial sense, but also psychologically for those who own and work at them.

“I’d encourage anyone who is a victim of burglary to get in touch with Nottinghamshire Police on 101 or in an emergency, dial 999.”
