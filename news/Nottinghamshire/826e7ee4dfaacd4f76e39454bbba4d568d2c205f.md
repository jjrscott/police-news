Police came to the aid of a family whose car had been submerged in flood water.

The car had driven along Eakring Road, Mansfield, at around 4pm on Tuesday 22 December when the it became submerged in flood water.

Unable to open the doors the occupants had no choice but to escape through the windows and go in search of help.

Hearing about the incident on their radios, officers from the Mansfield Neighbourhood Team went to fetch the force Land Rover from Mansfield Police Station and went along to help.

After making sure the family were safe and keeping them warm the officers pulled the stranded car free from the flood so it could be safely taken away.

PC Peter Gardiner, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “This must have been a frightening ordeal for the family and we were just happy to be able to help. We heard it come in on the radio and went back to the station to get the Land Rover. By the time we got there it was pitch black down there and the family were obviously very cold.

“This was actually our last shift before Christmas so it was a great way to sign off at the end of what has been a really difficult year. Ultimately being a police officer is about is keeping the public safe, so it’s really satisfying when we’re able to help people in this way.

“Although this incident was safely resolved, flood water can be extremely dangerous. Standing water can often be a lot deeper than it appears, and can contain debris and other hazards that drivers can’t see. We urge people to turn around and seek an alternative route if confronted by this kind of standing water, and would also advise people to avoid Eakring Lane at the moment.”
