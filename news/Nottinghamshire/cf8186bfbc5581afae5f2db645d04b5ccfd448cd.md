A sneak-in burglar who targeted a takeaway restaurant has been brought to justice following an extensive Nottinghamshire Police investigation.

Graham Wilson, 38, got through a window to gain entry into the Chicken Valley takeaway restaurant in Radford Road.

Wilson, of no fixed address, stole cash, an iPad and a charity box containing a quantity of cash.

The burglary was captured on CCTV cameras and Wilson was swiftly identified as the offender.

Following extensive enquiries, involving numerous police teams, officers swooped on a property in Belper Road, Hyson Green.

They found Wilson hiding under a bed and he was swiftly arrested in connection with the burglary which happened between 10.30pm on 4 January 2021 and 10am on 5 January 2021.

Wilson was subsequently charged and he was sentenced to eight months in prison when he appeared at Nottingham Crown Court for sentencing yesterday (Friday 29 January 2021).

Detective Constable Adam Rigby, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Many local businesses which provide valuable services to the community are already struggling to survive due to the pandemic.

“During this time of economic fragility, the last thing these businesses need is to suffer even more at the hands of burglars.

“Wilson’s selfish actions have caused considerable distress to this victim and I’m pleased that he has now been removed from our streets.

“Tackling and reducing burglary is a priority for Nottinghamshire Police and I’d like to reassure residents and businesses that we will continue to pursue those committing burglaries and remain committed to catching those responsible and bringing them to justice.”
