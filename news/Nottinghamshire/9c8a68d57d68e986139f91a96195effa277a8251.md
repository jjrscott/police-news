Five families from four houses had to be evacuated in the pouring rain in the early hours of this morning following a 70-foot high brick wall collapsed into a garden.

Residents were awoken following the noise of a tonne of bricks, rubble and earth falling into their back gardens of their terraced houses.

Officers were swiftly on the scene to discover severe damage to their homes, with bathrooms and kitchens flooded, and the fallen wall.

Inspector Charlotte Allardice said: "Emergency services were called from distressed residents following a report of a landslide in Spalding Road and Windmill Lane, St Ann's at around 1am this morning.

"They needed assistance with somewhere to stay overnight. They returned to their homes at around 6am having spent time with their neighbours.

"Roads close to the incident had to be closed until the area was deemed to be safe.

"The force is working closely with the local council and we are using our established contingency and emergency plans to respond to the situation.

"There have been no reported injuries.‚Äù
