Police have closed a Nottinghamshire road after a wall collapsed completely blocking the pathway.

Officers were called to Town Street in Bramcote at 1.15pm today (Sunday 7 February).

The road has been closed between Cow Lane and Common Lane as a safety precaution with access allowed only to those who live between these junctions.

Sergeant Iain Blackstock said: "It appears the wall has completely given way on to the highway probably as a result of all the adverse weather we have had lately - extreme rainfall followed by freezing temperatures.

"No one was injured and there haven't been any further incidents as a result but it's good that we were quickly informed and able to put safety measures in place.

"Officials from the local council have attended the scene and are arranging for a structural engineer to assess the damage in order to get it fixed.

"The road's likely to remain closed for the rest of the day at least so motorists will need to avoid the area. We're sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."
