A man was reportedly threatened with a baton following a local disturbance last night.

Police were called to Carnarvon Close in Bingham at around 7pm following a report of a man threatening another and allegedly banging on the door of the victim's house.

Officers attended and arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of affray.

Police Sergeant James Hirst is leading the investigation. He said: "Officers were quickly on the scene to start their investigation and a man was located and arrested following a report of the threats.

"The caller reported that a man banged on the door with the baton.

"This must have been a terrifying experience for all the victims and those in the area at the time.

"We believe this is an isolated incident, with no danger to the rest of the community.

"The man remains in police custody."
