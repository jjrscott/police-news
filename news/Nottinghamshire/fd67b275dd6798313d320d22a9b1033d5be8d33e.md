Detectives investigating a series of distraction burglaries against mostly elderly victims have charged a suspect.

Liam Schneider, 45, has been charged with seven offences including robbery, fraud by false representation and breach of a criminal behaviour order.

The charges relate to six separate incidents over the last three-and-a-half months:

 * The robbery of an 86-year-old woman on 9 March at an address in Fox Grove, Basford
 * Five counts of Fraud by false representation in the Radford and Basford areas of Nottingham between 29 December 2020 and 9 March 2021
 * And the breach of a criminal behaviour order between December 29 2020 and 9 March 2021.

Schneider, previously of Wilton Place, Ilkeston, was remanded into custody by magistrates last week and will appear at Nottingham Crown Court on April 12.

Detective Constable Tim Townsend, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Distraction burglaries can have a lasting impact on victims and even leave them scared to be in their own homes.

“That’s why we work so hard to investigate every report we receive. I am pleased we have now been able to bring charges in this case and our investigation will continue.”
