Crime won’t take a holiday over the festive period – which is why officers including Sergeant Asif Mohammed have been busy keeping communities safe.

Asif is part of the Bulwell Neighbourhood Policing Team and is out on New Year's Eve and New Year’s Day.He has spent 16 years policing and has been with the neighbourhood team for a year now. Over the festive season, he will be out with his team responding to incidents and patrolling the area.

"Over the New Year, we'll be out and about making sure everyone is enjoying the festivities safely and will be ready to respond to any incidents" said the 53-year-old.

"On the New Year's Eve, shift bars and clubs weren't able to open as they usually would due to Tier 3 Coronavirus restrictions, but it's a case of adapting and being ready for anything that might come our way.

"We hope everyone enjoys the New Year and doesn't find themselves in a situation where they need us, but if you do we're here.

"For me, personally, it's important to be available at this time of year as the issues we're called to help with don't take a holiday. People may still need help, and some more so than ever at this time, so we want to make sure this can be done.

"I'm sure we'll see a few of you on our patrols from a distance, so do wave and say hello if you see us. Be responsible, and keep in mind the current restrictions we're under."From all of us here at Bulwell, we hope you have a safe and happy New Year."
