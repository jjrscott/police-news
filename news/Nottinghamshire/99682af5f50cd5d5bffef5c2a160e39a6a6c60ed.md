Police deployed a Taser to arrest a suspect after responding to reports of a man threatening people with a knife in Nottingham.

Officers were called to the incident in Castle Boulevard shortly before 11pm on Sunday (29 November 2020).

They swiftly located a violent suspect within a property and tried to engage with him but he ignored their requests to come out of a room.

He continued to aggressively resist officers as they attempted to detain him before the Taser was deployed.

A 19-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of threats to kill and a knife was recovered from the scene.

The suspect who was not hurt, was taken to hospital as a precaution. He remains in custody.

Sergeant Ria Mobley, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "Our enquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances of this incident.

"I'd like to reassure people that Nottinghamshire Police takes all reports of incidents involving knives extremely seriously and will investigate all reports thoroughly."
