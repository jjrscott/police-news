Police negotiators helped bring about a safe arrest following an incident where man had barricaded himself in a home.

Officers had become concerned for the man's safety after being called to a house in Sutton-in-Ashfield to investigate a report of a domestic incident at around 10am this morning.

A large police presence arrived swiftly following reports of a woman had been assaulted inside the property in Jephson Road.

She left the scene and her injuries, which were not life-threatening or life-altering, were treated but a man refused to leave the house.

Negotiators were called in and after several hours of careful discussion a man left the house and was taken into police custody at around 5.20pm. He has been arrested on suspicion of causing actual bodily harm.

Chief Inspector Andy Rooke, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "We were called earlier this morning following reports of a domestic incident, which later developed into concerns for a man's safety.

"Thanks to the efforts of officers on the scene, including trained negotiators, the incident has now come to a safe conclusion and a man has been taken into police custody."
