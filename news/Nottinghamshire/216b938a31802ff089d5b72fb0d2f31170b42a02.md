A female shop worker has been left shaken after a man threatened her with a knife, grabbed the till and ran off.

The worker activated an alarm after a man entered a post office and demanded money to be put in his bag.

The man jumped over the counter, stole money from the store and made his escape.

Detectives are now appealing to anyone who may have seen the incident to contact them, including two people who were in the store when the incident took place.

Detective Sergeant Nick Wood of Nottinghamshire Police is leading the investigation.

He said: "This must have been a terrifying experience for the woman and we are supporting her throughout our investigation.

"We were called at around 8.30pm last night to a post office on Montpelier Road in Dunkirk following the report of the knife point robbery.

"We are now asking for anyone who saw anything suspicious to come forward and help us with our enquiries.

"Thankfully no one was hurt.

"If you can help us please call 101, quoting incident number 626 of 2 January 2021."
