Police are appealing for information to help trace a Hyundai M255 digger which was stolen from a building site in Hucknall.

The vehicle, which is thought to be worth as much as £20,000, was taken from the site on Daniels Way overnight on Wednesday (17 March 2021).

It is believed that thieves forced their way onto the site by unclipping a fence before taking the three-tonne track digger.

Now police investigating the theft are appealing for the public to come forward if they saw anything suspicious in the area or have any information about the stolen vehicle.

Detective Chief Inspector Hayley Williams, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “We are keen to ascertain how the digger was taken, especially as this theft has left hard-working construction workers unable to work and their employers facing an expensive bill.

“We are keen to piece together what happened and I would like to speak to anyone who may have been in Hucknall between Wednesday evening and the early hours of Thursday morning and who saw the machine. I would encourage anyone with any information to come forward as soon as possible.”

Anyone with information about the thefts or the whereabouts of the vehicle is asked to call Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 120 of 18 March 2021.
