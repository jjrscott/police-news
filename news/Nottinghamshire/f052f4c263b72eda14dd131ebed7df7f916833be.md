Two brothers caught on CCTV as they tried to break into a home in West Bridgford have been jailed for a combined two-and-a-half years.

John Sisson, 44, of Sneinton Boulevard, Sneinton, and Roy Sisson, 42, of Graylands Road, Bilborough, pleaded guilty to charges of attempted burglary and theft.

Clothing seized from the pair, after their arrests on 25 August 2020, matched that seen in CCTV footage captured at the home they tried to burgle in Henry Road two days earlier.

The victim returned home to find the glass window pane to his kitchen door had been damaged. No entry had been gained.

Damage was also caused to his garden boundary as a result of the brothers going through people’s gardens.

The brothers appeared at Nottingham Crown Court on Monday (8 February 2021) and were each sentenced to 14 months for the attempted burglary. Roy Sisson received a further one month relating to a separate theft offence.

Detective Sergeant Gary Hewson, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “I welcome the custodial sentences imposed by the court which have ensured these prolific brothers are off our streets.

“They showed no regard whatsoever for their victims and I’m pleased they are now behind bars where they will have time to consider the consequences of their selfish crimes.

“I also hope it reassures our communities that the force takes burglary extremely seriously and that we will work hard to bring offenders to justice.”
