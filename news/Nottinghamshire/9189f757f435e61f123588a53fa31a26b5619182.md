Detectives investigating a report of a man being assaulted on New Year’s Eve have made an arrest as part of their enquiries into the incident.

Nottinghamshire Police was called to a report that a man had been kicked in the head and was left unconscious in Havenwood Rise in Clifton at around 3.50pm on 31 December.

Police quickly attended the scene and the man was taken to hospital for treatment.

Following enquiries made by detectives, a 35-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm yesterday (1 January 2020).

He remains in custody for questioning.

Detective Sergeant Nick Wood, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “This was a serious assault that left the man needing hospital treatment.

“As a force, Nottinghamshire Police takes reports of assault very seriously and will always investigate them thoroughly.

“There is always the possibility that the consequences of an assault could be far more serious and we will always look to take action against those who are found to have committed such offences.

“Anyone with any information about this assault is urged to contact Nottinghamshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 365 of 31 December 2020.”
