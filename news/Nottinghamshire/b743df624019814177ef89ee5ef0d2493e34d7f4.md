More than 60 cannabis seedlings were recovered from a house in Forest Fields following a tip off from a concerned member of the community.

The city centre Operation Reacher team investigated a house in Gawthorne Street on Wednesday 17 February and swiftly spotted the seedlings in the basement alongside hydroponic equipment.

Electricity in the property had been bypassed and other materials consistent with cultivating cannabis were found in the living room and one of the bedrooms.

Sergeant Alice Bartle, who leads the city centre Operation Reacher team, said: “While the plants are seedlings, the seizure of them has meant that there will be no further issues as a result of this grow.

“Growing cannabis can directly and indirectly cause a variety of further offences including burglaries, fire hazards and other potential dangers.

“We work closely with local communities to gather intelligence and I would encourage anyone who sees something suspicious in their area to report it to Nottinghamshire Police on 101 or in an emergency, dial 999.

“Your local Operation Reacher teams are here for you and we want to hear from you if there’s something you want our help with.”
