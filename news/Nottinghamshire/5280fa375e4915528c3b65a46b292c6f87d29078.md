A burglar broke into a funeral directors before stealing two charity boxes and cash from another charity bucket.

A member of staff arrived at the Co-op Funeral Services in Gateford Road, Worksop, to find a large hole in the glass to the front door and saw a charity bucket lying on the floor. Police were contacted and arrived soon after.

Two charity boxes - one for Rotherham Hospice and the other for mental health charity Mind - had been taken. Both were believed to contain small quantities of cash. A charity bucket for Mind was also on the floor.

The bucket was forensically examined and a fingerprint belonging to 33-year-old Graham Gallon, formerly of Carrington Terrace, Rotherham, was found.

Following enquiries Gallon was arrested and charged in connection with the burglary, which happened overnight on 18 February 2021.

On Monday (8 March 2021) Gallon was jailed for 26 weeks and ordered to pay Â£350 compensation after he pleaded guilty to burglary and was sentenced at Nottingham Magistrates' Court.

Inspector Neil Bellamy, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "The fact that Gallon carried out this burglary while there were people awaiting their burial is appalling.

"Gallon was arrested thanks to an excellent spot and good swift work by officers from the Worksop Operation Reacher Team and I am pleased that he's now safely behind bars where he has time to reflect on his despicable actions.

"I'd also like to reassure people that Nottinghamshire Police treats burglary very seriously and will investigate reports and work tirelessly to bring offenders to justice."
