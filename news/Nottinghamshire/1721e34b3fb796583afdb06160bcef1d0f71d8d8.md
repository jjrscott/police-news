Rushcliffe police officers arrested two people for drug relates offences following early morning warrants.

Officers executed three warrants this morning following local intelligence in Edwalton and arrested a 17-year-old boy and a 21-year-old man on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of controlled drugs after a quantity of Class A and B drugs was found.

Two other suspects has been interviewed under caution and a further 23-year old man was issued with a cannabis warning.

Inspector for Rushcliffe Craig Berry said: "The warrants are a great example of our work to tackle drug dealing and related offences.

“Drugs have a devastating impact on communities and can cause all manner of subsequent offending such as violent crime and we are committed to disrupting and dismantling offender’s operations with a view to taking appropriate action against those responsible.

"This was excellent policing work to arrest two people in connection with drug offences in Lupin Close this morning.

"Officers searched the addresses and manage to locate the people quickly to detain them.

"We will remain in the area, reassuring the local community and speaking to them directly about the work we have carried out.

“We work closely with local communities to gather intelligence and I would encourage anyone who sees something suspicious in their area to report it to Nottinghamshire Police on 101 or in an emergency, dial 999.

“Your local Neighbourhood and Operation Reacher teams are here for you and we want to hear from you if there’s something you want our help with.”
