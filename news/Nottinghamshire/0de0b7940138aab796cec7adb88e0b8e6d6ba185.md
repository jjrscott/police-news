Police have arrested a suspect in connection with a report of a man being stabbed in the thigh during an incident in Clifton.

The 20-year-old victim was in his car in Gabor Close when he was approached by two men who opened his driver and passenger doors.

One of the men reportedly punched the victim in his eye and stabbed him in the leg during the incident which happened at around 1am on 30 January 2021.

The victim was taken to hospital to be treated for non-life-threatening injuries and was later discharged.

Following enquiries a 32-year-old man was arrested last night (Saturday 27 February 2021) on suspicion of grievous bodily harm with intent and breach of a restraining order. He remains in custody.

A 25-year-old man previously arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm with intent was released on conditional bail.

Detective Sergeant Louise Bradford, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "Violence, particularly involving weapons, will not be tolerated in Nottinghamshire.

"We treat incidents like this extremely seriously and work hard to investigate reports to ensure that our communities remain safe and that those individuals responsible for violence are brought to justice."
