Officers stop-checked a van in Retford and arrested a man on suspicion of drug-driving.

The force has been operating increased enforcement as part of the Christmas drink and drug-driving campaign which includes random stop-checks.

It led to a driver testing positive for cannabis and cocaine at the road side in the West Close area at around 7.45pm on Tuesday (15 December).

Neighbourhood constable Matt Storor has been conducting training in the use of drugs wipes for response teams throughout the force.

He said: "We're dedicated to taking drink and drug-drivers off the road. It's an abhorrent crime and there's absolutely no excuse for it.

"To get behind the wheel when intoxicated is entirely selfish and puts the lives of others at risk.

"This year we have more officers than ever before trained in the use of drugs wipes and we are committed to taking these dangerous drivers off the road before they've got the opportunity to cause serious harm."

The man has been released under investigation while forensic enquiries continue.
