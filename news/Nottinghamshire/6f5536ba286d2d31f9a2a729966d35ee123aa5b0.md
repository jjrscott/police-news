A man has been charged with a series of burglaries in Lenton, which saw a laptop, mobile phone, PlayStation and a bank card being stolen.

The charges relate to burglaries in Sandfield Street in Lenton (12 December), Balfour Road in Lenton (13 December) and Elmsthorpe Avenue in Lenton (14 December).

He has also been charged with fraud after a bank card was used at a Tesco Express in Ilkeston Road (14 December) and possession of cannabis (16 December).

A number of items has since been recovered following the arrest earlier this week.

Detective Inspector Kayne Rukas from the force's Burglary Team said: "This was excellent detective work to track down to arrest a man in connection with the incidents.

"Burglary is a really upsetting crime for victims – it is horrible to find that someone has been into your house and rifled through your belongings.

“That’s why we work so hard to disrupt this type of crime and we will always investigate as thoroughly as we can with the evidence available to us.

"Student addresses in particular are being targeted and laptops often containing crucial coursework are being stolen.

"We would urge students to make sure that their houses are secure. Students living in multi occupancy homes should work together to ensure that they all take responsibility to keeping their home secure."

Jahaya Williams, 33 of Radford Boulevard in Radford has been remanded into custody and appeared at Nottingham Magistrates' Court today (17 December 2020).

He is due to appear at Nottingham Crown Court on 14 January 2021.
