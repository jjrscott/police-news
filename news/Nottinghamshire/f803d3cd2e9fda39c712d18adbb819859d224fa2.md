A man has admitted causing a high speed collision which left two people injured.

Officers pursued a car which was being driven erratically before it went through a suspected red light and collided with another car.

The incident took place shortly after 12.30am yesterday (13 December) at the junction of Radford Boulevard and Hartley Road, Nottingham.

The lone occupant of one of the cars was cut free from the wreckage and taken to hospital with injuries which are not life-threatening.

The passenger of the other vehicle was also taken to hospital for treatment of injuries which are not life-threatening.

Roads were closed throughout the morning including Radford Boulevard at its junctions with Hartley Road. The collision put a set of traffic lights out of action and affected bus routes.

Kieran Hannan, 26, pleaded guilty to causing serious injury by dangerous driving, driving while disqualified and driving with no insurance at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court today (14 December).

Louise Melbourne, from Nottinghamshire Police’s Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: “This was a serious incident which has left two people with significant injuries.

“Nottinghamshire Police works hard to keep people safe on the roads, both through enforcement and by educating people on the dangers of not driving carefully and within the law.

“We will thoroughly investigate any incident where someone has come to harm on the roads.”

Hannan, of Lennox Road in Doncaster, will be sentenced at Nottingham Crown Court on Monday 5 January 2021.
