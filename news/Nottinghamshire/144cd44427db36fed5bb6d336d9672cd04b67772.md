A murder investigation has been launched after the death of a 16-year-old boy who was stabbed on Boxing Day.

The boy was being treated at Queen’s Medical Centre following the incident in Hickings Lane, Stapleford, just before 5.30am on Saturday 26 December.

Despite the best efforts of medical staff he died from his injuries this afternoon.

Jake Rollinson, 20, of Hickings Lane, Stapleford, was charged with attempted murder on Sunday and remanded in custody.

Detective Inspector Steven Wragg, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “This was a tragic incident in which a young man has lost his life.

“Detectives have been working around the clock to establish what happened and I would like to thank the public for their support and understanding as our investigation continues.

“The victim’s family are being supported by specially trained officers at what I know must be an unimaginably difficult time.”
