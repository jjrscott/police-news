Nottinghamshire Police is appealing for information after reports of two burglaries in Retford.

Officers from Nottinghamshire Police were called yesterday (12 December) after intruders were spotted at around 4.25pm in a house in Albert Road in Retford.

A window at the house had been smashed and clothing and other belongings had been strewn across the floor inside. Cash and jewellery were stolen in the incident.

Another burglary is believed to have happened between 3pm and 8pm yesterday in Snowden Drive in Retford.

A kitchen window is believed to have been smashed to gain entry to the house and clothing was stolen.

Detective Sergeant Rick Ellis, who is investigating the incidents, said: “Burglary is a really upsetting crime for victims – it is horrible to find that someone has been into your house and rifled through your belongings.

“That’s why we work so hard to disrupt this type of crime and we will always investigate as thoroughly as we can with the evidence available to us.

“I would like to speak to anyone who might have seen something around the time of either of these incidents, or who may have dashcam footage or CCTV which could help the investigation. If you live in either area, please check and get in touch with us if you can help.”

Anyone with information or footage relating to either incident should call Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 467 of 12 December.
