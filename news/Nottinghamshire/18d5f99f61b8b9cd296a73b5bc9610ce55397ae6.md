A 28-year-old man is due in court today in connection with a fire which left scared residents fleeing for safety.

Thomas Bailey, of Comyn Gardens in St Ann's, is due to appear at Nottingham Magistratesâ€™ Court today charged with arson with intent to endanger life.

Residents in a shared flat had to quickly evacuate following the fire in Comyn Gardens on Friday morning.

Nottinghamshire Police was called to the incident around 11am following a report of people potentially being trapped inside.

On arrival, residents made themselves known to emergency services.

Detective Sergeant Nick Wood is leading the investigation. He said: "Following a full investigation a man has now been charged following the incident.

"This must have been incredibly frightening for those at the flat to discover their home alight after the alarm had gone off. It is incredibly lucky no one was physically harmed.

"We would like to reassure people that there is no wider risk to the public.

"Officers moved quickly to track down and arrest a 28-year-old man in connection with the incident on Saturday morning."
