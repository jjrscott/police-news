A dramatic police pursuit took place in Nottinghamshire this morning after officers tracked down a suspected stolen car.

Officers located a suspected stolen vehicle in St Annâ€™s at around 2.40pm yesterday (Wednesday 3rd February) following an investigation into a car key burglary where two Mini Coopers were stolen.

The driver failed to stop for police which resulted in officers from Nottinghamshire's operational support department initiating tactical contact and the police car being rammed as a result.

A 38-year-old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of burglary and driving offences and remains in custody. He was also arrested on suspicion of possession of a bladed article after officers located two lock knives.

Detective Inspector Kayne Rukas of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "We have been carrying out enquiries since the car key burglary was initially reported to us in the Middleton Boulevard area at 6.25am yesterday.

"This arrest was the result of a real collaborative effort between several of our policing teams and our operational support colleagues carried out specialist tactics to prevent a suspect from fleeing.

"Luckily no one was injured as a result of the collision. We continue our robust investigation as the suspect remains in custody."
