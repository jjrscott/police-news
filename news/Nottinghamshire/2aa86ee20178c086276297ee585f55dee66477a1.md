Police investigating a stabbing in Nottingham city-centre have charged a suspect in the case.

Officers were called to Milton Street at around 5pm on 8 October 2020 after a man suffered a serious stab wound to his torso.

The 21-year-old victim was rushed to hospital and needed urgent medical attention in order to save his life.

Detectives investigating the case charged a 17-year-old-boy on Thursday. The boy, who can’t be named, is accused of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

He appeared at Nottingham Magistrates’ court on Friday and released on conditional bail. He will appear at Nottingham Crown Court on 16 April.

Detective Inspector Danny Johnstone, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Although this incident happened some time ago our investigation is still very active. This kind of violence has no place on our communities and I am pleased that we have been able to bring another charge in the case.”
