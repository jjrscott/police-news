Nottinghamshire Police is reminding victims of domestic abuse that they are not alone and how they can seek help and report incidents after a man was locked up for attacking his now ex-partner in three assaults during the course of their relationship.

The first assault was in January 2013 when 38-year-old Aaron Harper hit and kicked the woman and stamped on her ribs.

On a second occasion, in August, 2015, Harper, of Town End Road, Draycott, Derbyshire, grabbed her around the neck, causing reddening, and pushed her out of the front door.

During the third assault, in November 2019, Harper grabbed and squeezed her head with both hands.

The woman asked a friend to contact the police which led to Harper’s arrest.

Appearing at Nottingham Crown Court on Wednesday 23 December 2020, Harper was jailed for 18 months after pleading guilty to three counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

He was also made subject of a restraining order, banning contact with the woman or going to an address in Hucknall.

Chief Inspector Peter Quinn, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “The Covid-19 restrictions have meant that some people have felt unable to access support in the same way.

“I cannot stress enough that we are there for everyone in their time of need and I want people who are in a difficult position to be aware of the ways in which they can still report abuse to us and access support.

“We understand how difficult it can be to seek help and what a very big step this can be to come forward, however I’d like to make it clear that if you do come to us for help we will listen to you, we will take you seriously and we will take action to help you.

“If you are in danger, please call 999 and we will come to your aid.

“If you feel more comfortable seeking support from another organisation such as a charity then that is fine, but I want you to know that the police are here to help you.”

Nottinghamshire Police has recently announced that it is part of the Make Yourself Heard Campaign, which aims to show people how they can report an emergency when it is not safe to speak.

Dialling 55 after calling 999 takes you through to a silent call service, whereby call handlers will give you specific directions on how to report your emergency.
