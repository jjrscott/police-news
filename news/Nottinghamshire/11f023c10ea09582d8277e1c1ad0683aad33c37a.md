A man and a woman are in custody after three officers were assaulted in two separate incidents in the county.

Police initially responded to a report of a single vehicle collision in Nottingham Road, Bulcote at around 8.30pm.

A man was arrested on suspicion of driving while under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident and was taken to King’s Mill Hospital as a precaution.

While at the hospital, it is alleged that the 22-year-old kicked two officers in the arm. He was then arrested on suspicion of assaulting emergency workers.

In a separate incident, police arrested a 39-year-old a woman on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly in Valley Road, Carlton at around 1.30am this morning.

The woman is alleged to have attempted to bite an officer on both arms and kick the officer’s shins while in custody. She was then arrested on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker.

Superintendent Kevin Broadhead, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “We take officer assaults very seriously and will always thoroughly investigate any incidents where our officers or staff have been injured.

“Police work incredibly hard to protect the public and acknowledge that there is a risk when delivering that service.

“That being said, assaulting an officer while they are trying to do their job is totally unacceptable.

“The officers involved in last night’s incidents will be supported throughout the investigations into these incidents.”
