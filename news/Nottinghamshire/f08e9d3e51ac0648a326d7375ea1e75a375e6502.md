A 21-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of drink-driving after a car collided with the back of a police car.

It happened in the Beckingham Road area of Coddington just after midnight this morning (20 March 2021).

There were no injuries or damage to the vehicle. The woman was arrested at the scene following a breath test.

Inspector Simon Allen, said: "This incident took place whilst officers were patrolling the streets of Coddington.

"We are always on the lookout for dangerous drivers and drink-driving is something that we absolutely won't tolerate in Nottinghamshire.

"Thankfully no one was injured but being behind the wheel when over the limit is so dangerous and has caused some of the most serious incidents on our roads."

Nottinghamshire Police continues its operations to tackle drink and drug driving. If you suspect someone may be driving whilst over the limit, please call 101.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
