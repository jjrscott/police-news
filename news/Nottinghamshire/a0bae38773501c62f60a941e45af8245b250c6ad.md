A 32-year-old man has been remanded in custody to appear in court tomorrow after being charged with possession of a bladed article.

It comes after police intervened in a confrontation between two men in Radford.

Officers had been called to a report of a person carrying a knife in Sullivan Street at 2.19pm yesterday (Saturday 30 January) and recovered a knife and a small amount of cannabis. No one was hurt during the incident.

Jelaine Scott, of no fixed address, was taken into custody and will appear at Nottingham Magistrates' Court in the morning. He has also been charged with possession of cannabis.

Chief Inspector Kathryn Craner, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "The force takes reports of knife crime extremely seriously and we acted quickly to make an arrest in connection with this incident.

"We would urge anyone with information about people suspected of carrying knives to contact us on 101, or 999 in an emergency, and people can be assured we will take action."

Anyone who witnessed the incident is urged to contact Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 393 of 30 January 2021.
