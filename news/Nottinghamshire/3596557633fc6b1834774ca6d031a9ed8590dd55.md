A female shop assistant was assaulted as she tackled a suspected shoplifter.

Police would like to speak with the man pictured in this photo in connection with the incident, which took place at Boots, in High Road, Beeston, at around 3pm on Friday 5 February.

A suspect took around £300 worth of fragrances and then assaulted the staff member when she attempted to intervene, causing an injury to her hand.

Sergeant Keith Parkes, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “This was a serious offence and I am determined to find the person responsible. Essential shop workers should be receiving our thanks in this difficult time – not physical attacks and threats. We believe the man in this photograph may be able to help us with our enquiries, so if you recognised him please call 101 quoting incident 465 of 5 February.”
