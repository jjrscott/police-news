Police discovered a significant cannabis grow with a potential yield of up to £98,000 in a house in Radford.

Enquiries relating to the production of cannabis led officers to the two-bedroomed home in Lonsdale Road.

Their knock on the door was answered by 38-year-old Dionis Brecani.

The officers could smell cannabis emanating from the address and also heard noises coming from fans.

After gaining entry they found a total of 117 cannabis plants within two bedrooms and the loft area, along with growing equipment, and arrested Brecani.

Police drugs experts estimated the potential yield from the plants, which were found on 22 April, as being between £32,760 and £98,280.

Brecani went on to plead guilty to the production of cannabis and he was jailed for 16 months when he appeared at Nottingham Crown Court today (Tuesday 15 December 2020).

Detective Sergeant Dean O’Sullivan, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “This type of industrial scale of cannabis production, found under Brecani’s control, can be linked to violent crime and exploitation of the most vulnerable in our communities.

"The illegal production of drugs is blighting our communities and will not be tolerated. That's why we are as committed as ever to taking drugs off our streets and pursuing those involved in their production and distribution.”

If you suspect anyone in your community is involved in the production of cannabis then please Nottinghamshire Police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
