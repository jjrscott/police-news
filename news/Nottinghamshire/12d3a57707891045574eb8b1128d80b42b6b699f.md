Three people are due in court after officers were alleged to have been assaulted at a house party in Mapperley.

Police were called to Woodborough Road at around 12am on Wednesday 3 March to disperse gathering of around 40 people.

When officers attended, it is alleged that they were met with violence, with a total of seven officers suffering minor injuries in the incident.

Today, Nottinghamshire Police has revealed that three people have been charged as part of the ongoing investigation into the illegal gathering.

Lemar Barnes, 26, of Waterford Street in Basford and Damien Williamson, 21, of Birkin Avenue in Arboretum, are both charged with assaulting an emergency worker.

A 17-year-old woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons is also charged with two counts of assaulting an emergency worker in connection with the incident.

Barnes and Williamson appeared in court today (Thursday 4 March) and the 17-year-old has been released on bail pending their court appearance on 24 March 2021.

Detective Sergeant Lee Cattell, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “Emergency worker assaults are totally unacceptable and we will always look to take appropriate action against those who are found to have committed such offences.

“Thankfully, the officers involved in this incident were not seriously injured but regardless of that, we treat assaults against emergency workers very seriously.”

Officers also issued ten £800 fines to people for breaching Covid-19 regulations relating to the illegal gathering.

Anyone with any information about the incident is encouraged to contact Nottinghamshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 2 of 3 March 2021.
