Police arrested four suspects after swiftly responding to a report of a group of people fighting with weapons in Netherfield.

Officers were called to the disturbance in Meadow Road just after 8.40pm yesterday (Tuesday 9 March 2021).

It was reported that numerous weapons were used during the incident.

A man suffered a suspected broken arm and a woman suffered a cut to her head. Both were taken to hospital.

Police quickly carried out enquiries in the area resulting in the arrests of a 38-year-old man, 18-year-old woman, and two boys, aged 17 and 15, on suspicion of affray and grievous bodily harm with intent. They remain in custody.

Reassurance patrols will be taking place in the area as police continue with their investigation to understand the full circumstances of the incident and carry out their enquiries.

Detective Inspector Nick Hall, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "We take incidents of disorder such as this very seriously. The use of weapons and violence is totally unacceptable and we will always look to take robust action against those who commit such offences.

"While we have already made arrests, our enquiries remain in their early stages and we're appealing for anyone who witnessed this incident, anyone who may have captured CCTV or dashcam footage or anyone who has any information to please come talk to us.

"If you can help with our investigation please call 101, quoting incident number 769 of 9 March 2021, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.‚Äù
