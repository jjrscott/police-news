A man has been arrested after a driver followed a woman home in her car following a road-rage incident.

Officers were called to Betts Avenue in Hucknall at around 5.43pm yesterday (17 December) to reports that a man was shouting and threatening people with a metal pole.

They arrested a 33-year-old man at the scene on suspicion of affray.

Neighbourhood Inspector Mark Dickson, said: "Enquiries are ongoing but we believe a road-rage incident occurred between two drivers in the Betts Avenue area.

"A man then followed the female driver home where he continued his dispute.

"My response team attended the incident with minutes of it being reported to us.

"Clearly this has been a terrifying ordeal for the victim and highlights to us that road-rage should never get this far out of hand."

The man remains in custody pending further enquiries. If people in the area saw anything suspicious or have any information that could help, please call Nottinghamshire Police on 101 quoting incident 532 of 17 December.
