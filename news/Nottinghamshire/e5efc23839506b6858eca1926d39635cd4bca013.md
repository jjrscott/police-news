Nottinghamshire Police Response officers swarmed a street to arrest a man following a report he had a knife on him.

The man was seen walking along the road with an alleged kitchen knife by passing motorists, who quickly rang the police.

Officers were swiftly on the scene and located the man who matched the description to make the arrest.

Police seized a knife which had reportedly been thrown onto a road.

Police Sergeant Lee Mulligan said: "Officers were called to Ellis Street in Kirkby-in-Ashfield at around 7.30pm last night following a report of a man with a knife.

"This was an excellent and quick arrest by officers.

“A 44-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon. He remains in police custody. A knife was also recovered close to the scene.

“Nottinghamshire Police takes all reports involving knives extremely seriously.

“We work really hard to take as many weapons as possible of our streets and to educate people on the dangers of carrying a knife.

“I would urge anyone who saw this incident to come forward and help us with the investigation.”

Anyone who has information should call Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 637 of 15 December 2020.
