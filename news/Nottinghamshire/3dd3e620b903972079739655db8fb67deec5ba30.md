More good work by Nottinghamshire Police's proactive Knife Crime Team, assisted by CID colleagues, has resulted in a man being brought before the courts charged with drugs offences.

The Knife Crime Team carried out a stop and search on a man in Holden Street, Radford, on Tuesday morning and recovered a quantity of cash and quantities of what were thought to be crack cocaine and heroin.

Renett Morrison, 42, of no fixed address, is due to appear at Nottingham Magistrates' Court today charged with two offences of possession with intent to supply a Class A drug and acquiring, using or possessing criminal property. He is also charged with possession with intent to supply a Class B drug, namely Cannabis.

Detective Constable Laura McCullough, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "Drug crime can have a devastating impact on people’s lives and drug supply offences are incredibly serious.

"Nottinghamshire Police will always investigate reports of suspected drug crime and take appropriate actions against those who commit such offences.

“Our officers also work closely with local communities to gather intelligence and it is therefore vital that if you see something suspicious in your area, that you report it to Nottinghamshire Police on 101 or to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. In an emergency, dial 999."
