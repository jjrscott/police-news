A man who punched his ex-partner in city centre car park, inflicting a head injury resulting in her death, has been sentenced to six years and nine months.

Gary Parnell assaulted 48-year-old Deborah Jones, also known as Deborah Hendrick, after they’d had an argument in the Metro Car Park in Union Road on the night of 1 August 2020.

Paramedics arrived at the car park just before 11pm and found a group of people with Deborah on the second floor of the car park.

Deborah was given CPR by friends at the scene and also by the paramedics but she was pronounced dead a short time later.

Following information from witnesses, Parnell, 59, of Lytham Gardens, Top Valley, was arrested in connection with her death.

He previously pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter and was sentenced today at Nottingham Crown Court.

Parnell had punched Deborah in the face following an argument during which she had poured a can of beer over his head.

Detective Inspector Richard Monk said: “Parnell’s mindless act of violence resulted in Deborah’s tragic death and our thoughts remain with her family and friends during this traumatic time.

“I would like to thank everyone who helped during this investigation including those who bravely tried to help Deborah at the scene of the incident, those who came forward to us with information and the many officers who worked tirelessly on this investigation to ensure Parnell was brought to justice.”
