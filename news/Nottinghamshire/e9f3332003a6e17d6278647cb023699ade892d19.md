Police are questioning a man after a Selston home was ransacked and a television was stolen.

Numerous rooms in the Annesley Lane home were searched after it was believed an intruder had broken in through a window.

Police carried out enquiries following the burglary, which happened between 20 and 26 February 2021, and yesterday (Thursday 11 March 2021) officers arrested a 24-year-old man in connection with the break-in. The suspect, who was detained on suspicion of burglary, remains in custody.

Detective Inspector Nick Hall, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "Being the victim of a burglary is always a deeply traumatic experience and can leave people feeling vulnerable and frightened in their own home, a place where everyone should feel safe.

"That’s why Nottinghamshire Police treats burglary with the utmost seriousness and works tirelessly to pursue offenders and bring them to justice.

“I would like to reassure members of the community that we will investigate reports of burglary and continue to deal robustly with anyone believed to be involved in such crimes and work hard to secure justice for burglary victims."
