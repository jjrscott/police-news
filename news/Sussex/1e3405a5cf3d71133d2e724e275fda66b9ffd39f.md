Two men have been arrested after police witnessed suspicious activity in an Eastbourne park.

Officers in uniform and plain clothes were patrolling Princes Park on Wednesday morning (March 3) in response to reports of drug dealing in the area.

Around 11.45am, police saw two men behaving suspiciously and began to approach them. One was detained immediately but the other headed into a bushed area before returning and also being detained.

An initial search of the bushes found a number of wraps of suspected Class A drug and a lock knife. Both men were subsequently arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of heroin.

A more detailed search was carried out with the assistance of a police dog, and further wraps of suspected Class A drugs were found on the ground and hidden in bushes.

The two 20-year-old men were interviewed and one was released on conditional bail while enquiries continue. The other was released under investigation in relation to the drugs arrest, but was recalled to prison for an unrelated matter.

Police will continue to respond to concerns around drug dealing in our communities. Anyone who has any information or who witnesses any suspicious activity is asked to report it to police either online or by calling 101. Always dial 999 in an emergency.
