Police are appealing for witnesses following an incident at Kitty's Field in Dominion Road, Worthing.

Around 2.45pm on Friday 18 December, a group of children were playing in the park when they reportedly spotted a man taking photographs of them.

The group asked if they had done something wrong, to which the man reportedly replied with obscene and lewd comments.

The incident was reported to police, who carried out an area search for the suspect, but there was no trace of him.

He is described as a white man in his 50s or 60s, about 5'9", of large build, with a large nose, a wrinkled 'square' face, wearing a mustard coloured coat. He was walking a dog of unknown breed, described as being similar size to a Highland Terrier.

Anyone with any information to assist our investigation is asked to report it online or call 101, quoting crime reference number 47200216025.
