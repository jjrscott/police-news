Police are investigating after a car was damaged while parked in Bexhill.

The black Citroen C1 was parked facing up the hill on Clinch Green Avenue on Wednesday (July 15), when its owner discovered substantial damage to its front windscreen and bonnet.

The damage was noticed around 9.35pm, but it is thought it may have happened around 8pm that evening.

Investigating officers believe the damage may have been caused when a cyclist travelling down the hill collided with the front of the vehicle.

They are keen to trace anyone involved in the incident to make sure they have not suffered any serious injuries, and to establish the full circumstances of the matter.

Anyone who witnessed the incident, or who may have any other information, is asked to contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 1402 of 15/07.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
