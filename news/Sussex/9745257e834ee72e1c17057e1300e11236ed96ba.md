Police are issuing an identification appeal after Black Lives Matter and LGBTQ+ flags were taken from a property in Swanfield Drive, Chichester.

On 8 November, the victim noticed that the flags had gone from his fence and reviewed CCTV.

The CCTV showed a man enter the property shortly before 1am by climbing across a bridge, removing the flags fixed to the fence and taking them with him.

The suspect is described as a white male, about 6ft, in his mid to late 20s and was wearing a baseball cap backwards on his head. He was also wearing a jacket and dark trousers or jeans with rips at the knees.

Officers are keen to identify the man in the CCTV images and find out his motivation for taking the flags.

Anyone with information is asked to report online or call 101, quoting 47200192657.
