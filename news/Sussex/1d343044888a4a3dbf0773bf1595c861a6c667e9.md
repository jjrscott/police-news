Sussex Police is appealing for witnesses following an attempted assault in Hastings.

Officers received a report of a man being approached by three men and one woman in Linley Drive, around 2.45pm on Wednesday, 6 May.

One of the men in the group brandished a knife at the victim and attempted to assault him. The victim ran away from the group unharmed.

Police believe this is an isolated incident and there is no wider threat to the public.

A 22-year-old man from Hastings was arrested on suspicion of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent to do grievous bodily harm. He was released on police bail until 5 June.

Anyone who has information to assist the police investigation should report it online or call 101 quoting reference 867 of 06/05.
