A prolific offender who burgled a house in Shoreham - but left empty-handed - was caught by a fingerprint he left at the scene.

A woman in her 60s woke at her home in The Cygnets, Shoreham, on the morning of 18 June 2019 to discover an intruder had been in. It is believed access was gained via an insecure rear door.

An untidy search of the downstairs of her property had been made, with various items scattered on the floor and sofa, including a blue metal CD case. Nothing was reported stolen.

Forensics enquiries were carried out, which led to a fingerprint being obtained from the CD case. It matched that of convicted burglar Paul Lacey, 49, unemployed, of Surry Street, Shoreham.

He was subsequently arrested and charged with burglary, and initially denied being involved.

But prior to going to trial, he changed his plea to guilty and was convicted at Lewes Crown Court on Tuesday 23 February.

He was sentenced to 876 days' imprisonment and required to pay a Â£140 victim surcharge.

His history of 49 previous convictions for 95 offences was taken into consideration on sentencing.

Investigating officer, Detective Constable Chris Merryfield-Day, said: "This sentence reflects the serious nature of this incident, together with Lacey's extensive history of burglary and theft offences.

"I'd like to take this opportunity to remind residents to be vigilant, and to read our advice on how to keep your property safe and secure. You can find out more on our crime prevention page here."
