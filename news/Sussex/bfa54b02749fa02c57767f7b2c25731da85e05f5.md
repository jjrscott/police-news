With temperatures expected to rise at the weekend, Sussex Police continues to urge people to protect the resources of the NHS by staying at home and not leaving their homes for anything other than essential travel.

Brighton and Hove Divisional Commander Nick May said: "We understand people will want to make the most of the nice weather, but we ask them to use common sense and continue to follow the government guidance, which has been put in place to protect the NHS and ultimately save lives.

"We ask people not to travel to neighbouring towns or cities, or areas that may be populated with lots of other people - for example, beaches and parks - as this will only serve to put yourself, your family and other people at risk. Exercise may be taken once a day but should be done so from your home and while observing the social distancing guidance.

"We will continue our day-to-day policing, which includes patrolling public areas. We will engage, explain and encourage people to do the right thing in following the government's guidance but, if necessary, we will take enforcement action against those who do not comply.

"I know the current situation is frustrating, and many people are making difficult sacrifices, but pulling together and following the government's guidance will help save lives.

"For now, the priority remains staying at home, avoiding contact with others and stopping the spread of Covid-19. We thank everyone for their continued patience at this challenging time."

The public are being reminded that the Government have advised that people should only leave their home for very limited purposes, which include:

• shopping for basic necessities, for example food and medicine

• one form of exercise a day, for example a run, walk, or cycle - alone or with members of your household

• any medical need, including to donate blood, avoid or escape risk of injury or harm, or to provide care or to help a vulnerable person

• travelling for work purposes, but only where you cannot work from home
