Eagle eyed police officers from the West Sussex Tactical Enforcement Unit (TEU) discovered a large cannabis factory at a premises in East Grinstead on Sunday (3 January).

The team were on patrol when they saw a van being driven into an open unit and spotted what appeared to be cannabis factory inside an industrial in Imberhorne Way. The officers carried out a search and found 564 cannabis plants inside and arrested a 26-year-old man from Horley, Surrey, at the scene on suspicion of being concerned in the production of cannabis.

They then became suspicious about a neighbouring unit where cannabis could also be smelt. Another vehicle then arrived at the site and a man aged 31 and a 22-year-old woman both from East Grinstead were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the production of cannabis. The man was also detained on suspicion of being in possession of an offensive weapon. A search of this unit found another 252 cannabis plants.

The 26-year-old man who was arrested has been released on bail until 1 February and the other man and woman who were detained have been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Sergeant Chris Bryant from the West Sussex TEU said:"We were able to disrupt a significant large scale cannabis factory and seize hundreds of plants and drugs which would have ended up being sold on the streets of Sussex.

"Our priority is to help keep communities safe and feeling safe and preventing crime."

We take reports of drugs dealing and criminality seriously. Please report online or ring 101 with any information.
