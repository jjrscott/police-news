Following the tragic incident on 21 November in which the fishing boat Joanna C capsized south of Newhaven, the body of one of the two missing fishermen was recovered by divers from the wreck last night, Monday 23 November.

He has been identified as Adam Harper, 26, from Brixham, Devon, and his next of kin have been notified.

Robert Morley, 38, from Pembrokeshire, is still missing.

Our thoughts are with their families at this time.
