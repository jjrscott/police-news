Police are appealing for witnesses following an assault in Billingshurst.

A man and a teenager were walking southbound on Station Road around 9.30pm on Thursday (1 April) when they were approached by a group of young adults.

The group followed the pair to a nearby cashpoint and back up Station Road, before two of the members of the group assaulted the man. The victim, a man in his late 20s, suffered stab wounds to his stomach and facial injuries. He was taken to the Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton, and is in a stable condition.

Officers conducted an area search and arrested:

 * A 17-year-old boy from Billingshurst on suspicion of grievous bodily harm with intent.
 * A 16-year-old boy from Pulborough on suspicion of wounding with intent.

The pair remain in custody while enquiries are ongoing.

Investigating Officer Detective Sergeant Katie Clack added: "We are appealing for anyone who witnessed the assault or has information to assist our investigation to make contact with us.

"Fortunately the victim is not believed to have suffered life-threatening or changing injuries but this incident has, understandably, left him shaken. Support is being provided to him.

"Please get in contact with us, no matter how small the piece of information is."

You can report information online or call 101 quoting reference 1448 of 01/04. Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously.
