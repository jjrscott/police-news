Police are urgently searching for Hana Davies, 44, who has been reported missing from Ticehurst.

She was last seen about 9.20am on Saturday (2 January) and police are concerned for her welfare.

Hana is vulnerable and it is believed she remains in the local Ticehurst area.

She is described as 5'3'', petite, white Asian mixed ethnicity, very long black hair, grey streaks in a ponytail. She was wearing a grey coat, a beige jumper, a black top, black jeans, black boots with thick black framed glasses, and was possibly carrying a handbag.

She walks with a distinctive shuffle and knees bent which makes mobility difficult.

Anyone with information is asked to report online or call 101, quoting 329 of 02/01.
