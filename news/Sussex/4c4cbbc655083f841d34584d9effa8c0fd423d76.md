A mother has pleaded guilty to causing the death of her baby daughter in Brighton.

Verphy Kudi, 19, currently of no fixed address, appeared on remand in custody at Lewes Crown Court on Friday 26 March, having been charged in October with the manslaughter of her daughter Asiah, aged 20 months, at an address where they were living in Islingword Road, Brighton, in December 2019.

Her guilty plea was accepted by the prosecution and by Judge Christine Laing, who adjourned the case for reports prior to sentencing on 28 May. Kudi remains in custody.

Asiah was taken by ambulance to the Royal Alexandra Children's Hospital in Brighton from the address on Wednesday 11 December 2019 and was tragically confirmed dead soon after arrival at hospital. Following a postmortem and subsequent further forensic tests, Asiah's death was found to have resulted from neglect.

The prosecution, authorised by the CPS, followed an investigation by detectives from the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team. The Senior Investigating officer, Detective Chief Inspector Andy Wolstenholme, said; "This was a particularly distressing case for my team and me to investigate, and has caused great sorrow amongst Verphy's family and the many agencies that have supported Verphy and Asiah.

"We note the guilty plea entered in this case, and continue to prepare for Verphy's sentencing in May."
