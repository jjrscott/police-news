The bike is a Kestrel with a black and yellow frame. Anyone who sees it, or who has any other information about the theft, is asked to contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 976 of 17/10.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
