A Brighton man is to face trial on charges alleging sexual activity with a teenage girl, making indecent images of children, being concerned in the supply of cannabis, assaulting an emergency worker, a police officer, and racially aggravated threatening behaviour against another police officer.

Lloyd Collins, 29, unemployed, of Montpelier Road, appeared at Brighton Magistrates Court on 29 January and was remanded in custody to make an initial appearance at Lewes Crown Court on 26 February.

The prosecution, authorised by the CPS, follows an investigation, Operation Oakgrove, by detectives from the Brighton Safeguarding Investigations Unit.
