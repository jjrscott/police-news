Two boys were arrested after a collision in Brighton in the early hours of Tuesday morning (June 30).

At around 2.50am, officers saw a silver BMW being driven poorly in Bear Road and signalled for the vehicle to stop, but it did not.

Officers lost sight of the vehicle, but it was found again a short while later in The Avenue, where it had collided with a number of parked cars. The driver of the car had decamped and left the scene.

Police enquiries identified two suspects, who were both arrested.

A 14-year-old boy from Brighton was arrested on suspicion of aggravated vehicle taking and vehicle damage under £5,000.

Both were released on conditional bail while enquiries continue.
