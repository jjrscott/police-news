Police are appealing for witnesses after a child suffered a stomach injury in Crawley.

The seven-year-old boy returned from a bike ride on Friday 10 July with a wound to his lower abdomen.

The circumstances surrounding the injury are unclear, and police are appealing for witnesses to try and establish what happened.

It is thought the boy was injured while on a cycle path near to the K2 Crawley, in Tilgate Park, some time between 12pm and 2pm.

Officers investigating the matter are keen to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time, and who may have seen any suspicious behaviour in the vicinity.

They would like to speak to anyone who saw the boy riding his bike, and in particular a man who was walking two dogs.

Anyone who saw what happened or who may have any other information is asked to contact police online quoting serial 143 of 12/07.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
