Police are appealing for witnesses after a man was seriously injured during an attempted robbery at a shop in Hove.

Around 10.30pm on Saturday 19 September, a man is reported to have entered The Drive Store, in Church Road, and demanded cash.

After being refused, he allegedly produced a machete and attack one of the occupants in the shop, who was taken to hospital with a serious hand injury.

The suspect left the scene emptied handed, and is believed to have made off north up The Drive.

He is described as a Middle Eastern man aged between 21 and 27, dressed all in black, and wore a hooded top with the hood up.

There was a lot of foot traffic in the area at the time, and police are urging anyone who witnessed the incident or saw anything suspicious in the area around that time - or anyone with any relevant dash cam or CCTV - to come forward.

You can report it online or call 101, quoting serial 1747 of 19/09.

You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or report it online.

This is believed to be an isolated incident, and the public can expect a heightened police presence in the area in the meantime as enquiries continue.
