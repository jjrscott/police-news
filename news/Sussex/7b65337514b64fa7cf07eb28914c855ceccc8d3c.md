A property in Hailsham associated with anti-social behaviour and drug activity has been shut down under a closure order.

The address in Archery Walk has been closed to all persons for three months from Friday (December 4) after the order, under the Anti-Social Behaviour Crime and Policing Act 2014, was granted at Brighton Magistrates' Court.

Police applied for the full closure due to persistent anti-social behaviour associated with the property, as well as concerns around drugs having executed a positive warrant at the premises.

PC Craig Roberts, of the Wealden Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "The closure of this property in Archery Walk follows a number of incidents of anti-social behaviour and drug-related issues.

"When such activity is continuous at a property, it has a serious impact on the quality of life of others living in the area. We have listened to the concerns of residents and have acted to address these.

"The full closure order will stop anybody from entering the premises for three months, which will help prevent the anti-social behaviour from continuing in this area.

"We will continue to robustly tackle issues which affect our communities the most, and urge people to report matters of concern to us so we can respond effectively and take any necessary action."

People can report incidents to police either online or by calling 101. Always dial 999 in an emergency.
