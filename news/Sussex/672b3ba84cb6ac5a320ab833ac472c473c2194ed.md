Police are appealing for witnesses after a man was seriously injured in a collision in Hastings.

Officers were called to White Rock, near the entrance of Hastings Pier, around 7.20pm on Wednesday (August 12) to reports of a red Ford Focus colliding with a number of parked vehicles.

The driver suffered a serious injury and was taken to hospital for treatment.

It is thought the occupants of the red Ford Focus were involved in an altercation with the occupants of another car - a red Ford Fiesta - before the collision. The red Ford Fiesta and its occupants had left the scene before police arrived.

Anyone who saw what happened, or who has any video footage of the incident, is asked to contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 1429 of 12/08.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
