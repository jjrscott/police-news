More than 60 tickets were issued to motorists during a crackdown on speeding and antisocial driving in East Sussex.

Roads policing officers worked in conjunction with divisional officers and Sussex Safer Roads Partnership - which provided camera safety vans - for the day of action in Rye on Sunday 19 July.

PC Stuart Ball said: "We have listened to the community and acted upon their concerns regarding speeding and antisocial driving in the Rye area. The operation was all about providing education and enforcement, and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received.

"While the vast majority of motorists are safe and competent drivers, there will always be a minority who put the lives of themselves and others at risk through their actions.

"It is our duty to keep everyone safe on our roads, and to deal robustly with those who compromise this."

The Sussex Roads Policing Unit will continue to provide proactive patrols to combat speeding and antisocial driving across the county. In recent weeks, this has included static checks on parts of the A259, the A29 and the A272, among other routes.

PC Ball added: "A large number of the tickets issued on Sunday were for vehicles with modified number plates. We cannot stress enough that you could be fined up to Â£1,000 and your vehicle will fail its MOT if you drive with incorrectly displayed plates."

You can report incidents of dangerous of antisocial driving on the Operation Crackdown website.
