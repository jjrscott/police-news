Hundreds of people evacuated following a significant gas leak at a block of flats in Crawley are now able to return home.

A major incident was declared after emergency services were called to the building in Milton Mount Avenue, Crawley, around 12.21am on Wednesday 6 January.

As part of a multi-agency response, Sussex Police worked collaboratively with partners including West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service, South East Coast Ambulance Service, West Sussex County Council, Crawley Borough Council and Southern Gas Networks to resolve the incident as quickly and safely as possible.

Approximately 700 residents were safely evacuated and placed in temporary accommodation until the scene was made safe.

The gas leak has since been repaired and residents are now able to return home.

Detective Superintendent Alex Geldart said: "I'd like to thank everyone for their patience and understanding as we worked with our partners through the night to keep people safe and to minimise disruption.

"The residents were taken to alternative accommodation including local hotels by various transport providers, and we're pleased to say they are now in the process of returning home."

Southern Gas Networks identified and fixed the leak, and there is no further police involvement.

Anyone with concerns about any residents in Milton Mount flats can call Crawley Borough Council on 01293 438000.
