A man has been charged with six offences after a car was stolen from an address in Westham.

Police were called to South Terrace, Hastings, shortly after 1.30am on Wednesday (September 30) after concerns were raised for a man in a car.

Officers attended and their enquiries found the car - and some bank cards also present - had been stolen from a house in Montague Way, Westham, earlier in the night.

Further enquiries also identified a number of other addresses in the area where attempted burglaries had taken place.

Lee Compton, 35, unemployed, of Roundhill Road, Brighton, was arrested and charged with burglary and theft; theft of a motor vehicle; attempted burglary with intent to steal; driving a motor vehicle otherwise than in accordance with a licence; driving a motor vehicle without third party insurance; and fraud by false representation.

He appeared before Brighton Magistrates' Court on Thursday (October 1), where he was remanded in custody.
