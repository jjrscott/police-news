Louis Harry Navarre, 57, a cleaner, of Blackwater Lane, Crawley, has been found not guilty of the murder of Marie Denise Toulsee.

A jury returned its verdict at Guildford Crown Court on Wednesday 4 November following a five-week trial.

Ms Toulsee was sadly pronounced dead at a flat in Warren Drive on Wednesday 11 July, 2018.

Her family have expressed they do not wish to provide a statement, nor be contacted by the media.

Detective Inspector Chris Rambour, of the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team, said: "I'd like to thank the jury and all witnesses who provided evidence during this five-week trial. We respect the decision of the court, and our thoughts remain with the victim's family."
