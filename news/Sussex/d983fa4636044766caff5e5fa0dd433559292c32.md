Police are appealing for witnesses after a man was assaulted in Midhurst.

Around 11pm on Saturday (December 19), a man was found with serious facial injuries in North Street. It was reported he had been assaulted by a group of people.

Sergeant Daniel West of the Chichester Neighbourhood Policing Team said: "Our officers quickly attended the scene and arrested four boys - two aged 15 and two aged 16 - on suspicion of grievous bodily harm with intent. They have been released on conditional bail while enquiries continue.

"Our investigation is ongoing and we are keen to hear from anyone who saw what happened, or who may have any relevant CCTV or dash cam footage from the area."

Anyone with any information is asked to contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 1573 0f 19/12. Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
