Updated News Post

Police are appealing for witnesses to a fatal collision involving a lorry and a van on the A26 at the junction of Horsted Lane, Uckfield, on Wednesday (29 July).

The articulated lorry was travelling towards Lewes when it was in collision with a van at 10.48am. Despite the efforts of the emergency services, the driver of the van sadly died at the scene. The lorry driver was not hurt.

The road is closed in both directions while emergency services deal with the collision and is likely to remain shut for several hours. Motorists are asked to avoid the area.

PC David Upjohn said: "We are appealing for witnesses to this fatal collision. If anyone saw it happen or has any dash-cam footage, please contact us."

You can report online or call 101 quoting Operation Redwood.
