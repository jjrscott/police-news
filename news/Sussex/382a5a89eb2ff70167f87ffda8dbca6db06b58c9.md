A man has been arrested following an incident in Brighton city centre this afternoon (Monday 13 July).

Around 2.10pm, police received a report of a man in possession of a smashed bottle threatening to harm himself inside a retail store in Western Road.

Police attended and located the suspect, who also directed threats at officers.

Due to concerns for the safety of themselves, the suspect and the wider community, a Taser was deployed and the man was safely detained.

He has been arrested on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker and public order offences and has been taken to hospital, under supervision, as a precaution.

In the meantime, a high visibility police presence will remain in the city centre for community reassurance.

This was an isolated incident, during which one officer sustained minor injuries.
