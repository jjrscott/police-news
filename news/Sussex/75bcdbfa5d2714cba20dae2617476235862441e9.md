Police are appealing for witnesses after a man reportedly exposed himself in an Eastbourne park.

Officers were called to Shinewater Park around 15.30pm on Saturday, (23 January) following a report that a young man was seen exposing himself.

Police attended the scene but no suspect was located.

He is described as white, in his early 20s and dressed all in dark clothing with his hood up.

It is thought that there were a lot of people in park at the time, and officers are keen to hear from anyone who saw the man, or who witnessed any suspicious behaviour in the area.

Anyone with information should contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 826 of 23/01.
