A third woman has been sentenced after police officers were attacked while trying to break up an illegal house party during the coronavirus lockdown.

Police were called to Edgeland Terrace, Eastbourne, around 9.45pm on Wednesday 8 April to reports of a gathering in breach of the government's Covid-19 restrictions.

At the address, officers were faced with verbal abuse and threatened with being deliberately exposed to Covid-19.

Officers were also physically assaulted, with one police sergeant requiring hospital treatment after being hit around the head with a metal toilet roll holder.

Two women - Bayleigh Meadows and Millie Robinson - were jailed for 12 months and six months respectively when they appeared at Lewes Crown Court on June 12 _._

Nicole Stonestreet, 21, unemployed, of Seaside, Eastbourne, had repeatedly pushed and pulled at one of the police officers as he was trying to restrain Robinson. She also punched the officer to his side.

She pleaded guilty to assaulting an emergency worker and was handed a four-month suspended sentence when she appeared at Lewes Crown Court on Tuesday (July 28).

Investigating officer PC Carl Smith said: "All three of these women behaved in a way that is completely unacceptable.

"Our officers were simply doing their job in already challenging circumstances, and they were met at this address with serious violence and threats.

"We are pleased the three women are being held accountable for their actions, and we hope it sends a message out that assaults against emergency workers will not be tolerated."
