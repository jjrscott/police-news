Police are urging people to stay alert after a man fell victim to a distraction burglary in Crawley.

The vulnerable victim, who lives in the Langley Green area of the town, was visited by two men around 2pm on Wednesday (November 4).

The suspects presented themselves as working for the water board and entered the address in Dove Close under the pretence of looking for damp. While inside, they took the victim's wallet containing bank cards and a quantity of cash.

Both men were white. One was approximately 50 years of age, of large build, around 5' 9" to 5' 10" and with thin hair which was slightly ginger. He was wearing white decorating overalls.

The second man was around 45 years of age and of muscular build. He was wearing dark clothes with paint on the clothing.

Anyone who saw any suspicious behaviour in the area at the time, or who may have any relevant CCTV, doorbell or dash cam footage, is asked to contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 745 of 04/11.

People are urged to always ask for ID if someone knocks on your door claiming to be visiting on behalf of a company. If there is any doubt, phone a friend or relative for advice.
