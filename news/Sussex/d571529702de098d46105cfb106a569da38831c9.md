Police are appealing for witnesses to a serious two-vehicle collision on the A272 between Rogate and Petersfield.

Officers were called to Durleighmarsh around midday on Tuesday (July 14) to reports of a collision involving a white MAN Tipper truck, travelling east towards Midhurst, and a westbound black Volvo XC90 towing a laden horse trailer.

The driver of the Tipper truck, a 51-year-old man from Waterlooville, was taken to the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton with potentially life-changing injuries.

The two women in the Volvo suffered minor injuries. Unfortunately the horse in the trailer died at scene.

Police are keen to hear from anyone who witnessed the collision, or who saw either vehicle being driven beforehand.

Officers would particularly like to hear from the occupants of a Volkswagen car who may have seen what happened but left the scene before any details could be taken.

Anyone with any information or any relevant dash cam footage is asked to email collision.appeal@sussex.pnn.police.uk or call 101 quoting Operation Mulberry.
