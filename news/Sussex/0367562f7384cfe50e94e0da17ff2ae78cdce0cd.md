Charity group Blue Van, providing a drop-in facility for armed forces veterans in Eastbourne, has gained a Â£500 boost from Sussex Police.

A cheque for that amount was recently presented by Police Community Support Officer Julian Williams.

The donation came from the Police Property Act Fund, PPAF, which is made up of monies received by the police from property confiscated by order of the courts and then sold.

The group gathers at the Seaside Community Hub, 125 Seaside, Eastbourne, between 10am and noon on the second Tuesday of every month, and not only provides a social hub, but also advises on housing, health, pension and legal issues.

PCSO Williams said: "I'm very pleased to be able to make this donation, for as a former military man myself I can appreciate the enormous help this facility offers.

"Any veterans or their relatives are welcome to pop in, have a brew and share their experiences with like-minded people, even if they haven't worn exactly the same cap badges or uniforms. They all speak the same language, albeit the accents may vary."
