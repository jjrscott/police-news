Officers investigating a robbery in Brighton have charged a man.

Police were called after a man had his electric scooter stolen in Edburton Avenue around 10pm on Sunday, March 21.

The victim had first been approached by two men travelling in a car on Grantham Road. The suspects demanded the victim hand over his electric scooter, but he refused.

The victim was able to run to nearby Edburton Avenue, where he was punched to the head and the scooter was taken. The suspects then left the scene.

Cameron Boxall, 18, unemployed, of no fixed address, was arrested and two Stanley knives were recovered from a vehicle. He has since been charged with robbery and possession of a knife blade / sharp pointed article in a public place. He was also charged with handling stolen goods in relation to another matter.

He appeared before Brighton Magistrates' Court on Wednesday (March 24) and was remanded in custody to appear at crown court on April 21.

Anyone who witnessed the robbery, or who may have any other information, is asked to contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 180 of 22/03.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
