A man has been jailed for three years following an investigation into an armed robbery in East Grinstead.

On Sunday (26 April), around 12.30am, the victim was walking along Lewes Road when suspects on a motorbike threatened him with a long-barrelled weapon - thought to be an air rifle - and demanded that he hand over his belongings.

Jack Chambers, 19, of Holtye Avenue, was arrested on suspicion of robbery and possession of an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear or violence.

Chambers claimed he had not been to Lewes Road since 2013, however during a search of his home officers found items belonging to the victim and an imitation firearm. He was charged and remanded in custody.

He subsequently pleaded guilty to the offences and appeared at Lewes Crown Court on Tuesday (29 September) where he was sentenced to three years imprisonment.

Investigator Lauren Chapman said: "This was a terrifying ordeal for the victim who was walking home from work when they were attacked and threatened with a weapon that resembled a gun.

"Thankfully Chambers was apprehended soon after the incident and put on remand. We're hugely grateful to the local community who came together to provide information that assisted with our investigation."
