Police in Eastbourne are increasing patrols to tackle street drinking and associated anti-social behaviour in the town centre.

Police officers and police community support officers (PCSOs) have been conducting dedicated patrol activity in hot-spot areas at 9.30am and 2.30pm every day.

The patrols are an opportunity to engage with the community, respond to any concerns and address any inappropriate behaviour.

The activity has been focused on Terminus Road and the surrounding area, and has included multiple stops and around 15 alcohol seizures so far this month.

Chief Inspector Di Lewis, district commander for Eastbourne and Lewes, joined the patrols on Monday (December 7). She said: "When we speak to members of the public, the issue of street drinking and anti-social behaviour in the town centre is one that often comes up.

"We understand many people find the behaviour intimidating and unpleasant, and we are committed to addressing their concerns.

"Our patrols are already having a positive effect and we've received a lot of great feedback from the community.

"We work hard to make our towns enjoyable and safe places to live, work and visit, and we encourage people to come and speak to us when they see us out and about."
