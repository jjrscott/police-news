A man has been arrested following a police pursuit near Uckfield.

Officers on patrol became aware of a van travelling at excess speed on the A272 at Hadlow Down around 1.49am on Friday (20 November).

A pursuit ensued, before the suspect decamped in Uckfield. Police carried out a search of the area, assisted by the National Police Air Service helicopter, but there was no trace.

However, enquiries led to the arrest of a 34-year-old local man at an address in the town shortly afterwards.

He has been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and remains in police custody at this time.

During the pursuit, damage was sustained to the subject vehicle and two police vehicles. Two police officers suffered injuries - both remain in hospital at this time and are likely to be released later today.

No other vehicles or people were involved.
