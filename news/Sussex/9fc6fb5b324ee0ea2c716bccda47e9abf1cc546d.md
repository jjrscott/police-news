Police have re-arrested and charged two men on 20 August in connection with the death of a man in Bognor.

Daniel Weyman, 32, of Belmont Street, Bognor, sustained serious injuries in Belmont Street just before 1.50am on Sunday 22 September 2019. He was taken by air ambulance to hospital in Southampton where he tragically died that afternoon.

Christopher Sheehan, 40, a removals worker, of Pound Road, Walberton, has been charged with the murder of Daniel Weyman. Curtis Sheehan, 18, unemployed, of Barnham Lane, Walberton, has been charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice in relation to the death of Daniel.

They are both remanded in custody and are due to appear by videolink at Brighton Magistrates' Court on Friday 21 August.

The charges, authorised by the CPS, follow an investigation by detectives from the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team. Detective Chief Inspector Gordon Denslow said: "This has been a complex investigation and Daniel's family have been kept informed of developments throughout."

No further action will be taken against a 35-year-old woman who was also arrested on suspicion of murder in connection with this matter.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation can contact Sussex Police online or by calling 101, quoting Operation Fairford.
