Sussex Police has issued the following statement in response to media reports in relation to compensation paid to a couple arrested during its investigation of malicious drone attacks at Gatwick airport in December 2018:

"Sussex Police has paid Â£55,000 in a joint settlement to a couple arrested during a drone incident at Gatwick in 2018. The settlement was made on a no liability basis, avoiding lengthy court proceedings. We remain in discussion in relation to their request for legal costs.

"All parties agreed that the allegations of unlawful arrest and detention were matters that could only be settled through the courts.

"However, we recognise that things could have been done differently and have apologised to them for the impact of their experience."
