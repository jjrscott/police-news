A man who robbed an Eastbourne convenience store has been jailed.

Zack Staniford entered the Co-op store in Meads Street around 9.20pm on Tuesday 26 May armed with a hammer.

He smashed the plastic screens put in place due to the Covid-19 pandemic, before going behind the till and demanding cash. He got away with Â£385.

On Friday 29 May, Staniford was spotted on Eastbourne seafront by an eagle-eyed police officer who identified him as the suspect due to two distinctive tattoos on the top of his hands.

He was arrested, and was found to be in possession of a knife. He was charged with robbery and possession of a bladed article in a public place.

Staniford, 19, a labourer, of Cavendish Place, Eastbourne, pleaded guilty when he appeared at Hove Crown Court on Monday (June 29).

At the same court on Tuesday (June 30), he was sentenced to 36 months in a Young Offender Institution for the robbery and four months for possession of a bladed article, to run consecutively.

Investigating officer Detective Constable Elliott Lander said: "This was a terrifying ordeal for the staff members working in the shop at the time, who were unhurt but understandably very shaken by what happened.

"Thanks to clear CCTV footage, witness reports and the vigilance of an officer on patrol, we were able to apprehend Staniford and secure a guilty plea in court."
