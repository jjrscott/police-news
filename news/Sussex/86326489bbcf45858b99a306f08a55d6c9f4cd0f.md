Updated News Post

Police are appealing for information after a man was seen indecently exposing himself in Eastbourne.

Around 7.45pm on Friday (September 4), police received a report of a man who had been seen on two occasions that evening with his genitals exposed and performing a sex act.

The first instance was in Shinewater Lane, near its junction with Milfoil Drive, and the second was shortly afterwards in Foxglove Road near the dentist's car park

On the second occasion, he also whistled at a woman and a girl. When the woman shouted at him to stop what he was doing, he ran off down Foxglove Road and out of view.

The man is described as white, late 20s or early 30s, around 5' 11" and of medium build. He had brown hair and beard/stubble, and was wearing dark clothing, including a dark hooded top with the hood up.

Police investigating the matter are keen to hear from anyone who saw the man, or any suspicious behaviour in the area at the time.

They would particularly like to speak to the man pictured, as they believe he could have information that would help the investigation.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 1281 of 04/09. Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
