Police have charged a man with supplying Class A drugs in St Leonards.

On Thursday (August 13), officers in plain clothes were patrolling Gensing Gardens when they witnessed a suspected drugs deal take place.

Enquiries led police to an address in Tower Road West and on Friday morning (August 14), officers attended and found and seized approximately 150 wraps of suspected crack cocaine.

Alexander Ramonn, 21, a construction worker, of Cherry Orchard Road, Birmingham, was arrested and charged with possession with intent to supply a Class A drug.

He appeared before Brighton Magistrates' Court on Saturday (August 15) where he was remanded in custody to appear before the court on September 11.
