A grazing sheep on Ashdown Forest was savaged by a dog whose owner hurried away from the scene after being told what her animal had done.

The attack happened around 8.20am on Monday, July 20, off Crowborough Road, Duddleswell. The dog, thought to a Giant Schnauzer or similar breed and wearing a wide red collar, was witnessed biting a sheep, which sustained open wounds to a front leg and its neck and had a quantity of wool ripped out.

The dog's owner, a woman described as middle-aged with mid-length blonde hair, was confronted by a witness, but made off without leaving her details or showing any concern.

PC Steve Knowles from Sussex Police's rural crime team said: "This was a complete act of negligence on behalf of the dog owner who clearly knew what had happened and took no responsibility for it. We are keen to identify her so that this matter can be appropriately dealt with and we ask anyone with knowledge of her or anyone who witnessed the incident to contact us.

"Time and time again we warn dog owners not to let their animals off the lead anywhere in the vicinity of livestock. Your docile family pet can turn vicious killer in the blink of an eye.

"By all means, enjoy the countryside with your dog, but please do not allow them off the lead anywhere near livestock and make sure that there aren't sheep or other farm animals nearby, but just out of your view. Your dog will almost certainly know they're there."

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to contact us online or call 101 quoting serial 1201 of 01/08.
