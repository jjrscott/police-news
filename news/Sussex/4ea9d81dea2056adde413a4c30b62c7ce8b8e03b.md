A man has been arrested following an incident in Crawley this morning.

Police were called to West Green Drive following concerns for a man in possession of a knife around 9.35am.

The suspect was detained, during which time an officer sustained a minor laceration to the hand. He has been taken to hospital for treatment.

A local man was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and remains in police custody at this time.

The knife was recovered and the scene has been secured as enquiries continue.

This is believed to be an isolated incident and we'd like to offer reassurance that there is no threat to the wider community.

Anyone who saw what happened is asked to report it online or call 101, quoting Operation Stockley.
