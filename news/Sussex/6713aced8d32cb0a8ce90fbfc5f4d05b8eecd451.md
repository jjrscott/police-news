A prolific offender has been jailed for burglaries in Woodingdean where he stole a car and used the victim's card to buy himself alcohol and cigarettes.

Daniel Meehan, 28, of Albion Hill in Brighton, appeared at Lewes Crown Court on Tuesday (12 January) charged with burgling properties in Burnham Close and Batemans Road between 27 and 28 June 2020.

Meehan stole items from the houses including a wallet, sunglasses and a changing bag. He then took keys to a car which he used to drive himself to local petrol stations and shops. Enquiries revealed that he used one of the victim's cards to buy himself a bottle of vodka, two bottles of Prosecco and several packets of cigarettes.

On 30 June, police searched a property in Rosedean Close where the defendant was believed to have been previously staying and recovered several stolen items. They also found an empty bottle of vodka and two bottles of Prosecco matching those he had bought.

Proactive attempts were made to locate and arrest him including several wanted appeals and Meehan was arrested on 12 August after he was found hiding from police officers on a roof.

Meehan pleaded guilty to two counts of burglary, taking a vehicle without the owner's consent, fraud by false representation, and escaping lawful custody.

He was sentenced to three years and two months imprisonment.

Detective Superintendent Mike Ashcroft said: "Meehan is a prolific offender who has 31 previous convictions for offences including burglary, vehicle offences and anti-social behaviour.

"He has caused significant distress to his victims and we sincerely hope he uses this custodial sentence to reflect on the impact of his actions and reforms his behaviour when he is released.

"Tackling burglary and those who cause harm in our local communities is an absolute priority for Brighton and Hove. Anyone committing burglaries in the City will be targeted and dealt with robustly."
