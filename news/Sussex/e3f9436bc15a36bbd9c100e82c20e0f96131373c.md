A shoplifter has been jailed for 30 weeks after pleading guilty to two counts of theft and for breaching his Community Protection Notice (CPN) in Worthing.

At Worthing Magistrates' Court on 24 November, Fardin Farji, 27, of Christchurch Road, Worthing, admitted stealing chocolate and sweets from local shops on 17 and 20 November.

He was also found to be in breach of a CPN banning him from South Street.

Farji was jailed for 30 weeks and ordered to pay Â£156 victim surcharge costs.

Sergeant Craig Burgess said: "Farji was served two suspended prison sentences in September for a total of 12 thefts, yet he has continued to break the law by stealing from local shops.

"We are pleased the court has taken this matter seriously and hope Farji takes this time to reevaluate his behaviour and how it impacts the community.

"Shoplifting is completely unacceptable and we work tirelessly to protect our local businesses and members of the public."
