The family of a woman who tragically died in a collision have made a heartfelt tribute to her.

Claudia-Rose Moor, 23, from St Leonards was involved in a two-car collision on the A21 at Mountfield, Robertsbridge, on Saturday, 26 April. She was airlifted to the Royal Sussex County Hospital where sadly, she died from the injuries sustained.

Her family said: "Claudia was a beautiful and bright individual who gave so much more to others.

"She was always so generous and selfless and would always put others before herself. Claudia was in fact an organ donor. She was able to donate some of her organs to help others, which is amazing and we are so incredibly proud.

"Her sense of humour was hilariously funny and she had such an infectious laugh.

"She had a gentle, compassionate nature and was fanatical about music and watching live bands."

Claudia, a team leader at the Co-operative, was a former pupil at William Parker Sixth Form where she studied art.

Her family added: "She loved all of the arts - theatre and film - but in particular, drama. She was always the performer and more than comfortable to take centre stage.

"Outside of performing she had a job at the local Co-op where she was a favourite with customers and a valued branch member.

 "We would like to express our sincere thanks to everyone for the comforting words we have received in remembrance of Claudia. We have truly been overwhelmed by the love shown from friends and colleagues who knew her."

Claudia leaves behind her mum, step-dad, an older and younger sister and a younger brother.

The family concluded: "We would like to thank all of the emergency service and the air ambulance, in particular the specialist nurses and doctors at the Royal Sussex County Hospital, for their efforts to save Claudia.

"We have so many treasured memories of our lives together, we were simply all best friends, and we cannot imaging our lives without her."
