Police have released a new CCTV image of a man sought in connection with the theft of Â£60,000 of stock from a Crawley toy store.

The items are reported to have been stolen from Smyths, at Acorn Retail Park, in Betts Way, on several occasions between March and June.

One suspect - a 27-year-old man from Crawley - voluntarily attended police interview in connection with the investigation. A further two suspects - a 31-year-old man from Crawley and a 25-year-old man of no fixed address - have been arrested on suspicion of burglary.

All three suspects have been released under investigation, pending further enquiries.

Police are urging anyone who recognises the man in the attached image, or with any information about the incident, to report it online or call 101, quoting serial 860 of 23/06.

You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or report it online.
