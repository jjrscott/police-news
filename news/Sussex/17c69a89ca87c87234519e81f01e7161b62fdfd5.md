Three suspects were arrested by officers assisted by a police dog and a drone following an incident in The Strand, Goring.

Police received a report of an aggravated burglary, whereby three men had entered a garden room in possession of a knife, around 11.50pm on Friday 19 June.

Demands for property were made, but no items were reported stolen.

The trio had made off from the scene prior to officers' arrival, however a search of the area led to one suspect being identified. He ran away but he didn't get far.

PD Sparky, a German Shepherd general purpose dog, was deployed and tracked him to a nearby street, where he was detained by response officers.

Following this, a drone was launched and a heat source was detected in neighbouring gardens, where the two outstanding suspects were found hiding.

All three suspects were arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary.

A 16-year-old boy from Worthing was released on conditional bail until 13 July, and a 24-year-old man and a 21-year-old man, both of no fixed address, were released on conditional bail until 11 July, pending further enquiries.

Investigating officer, Detective Constable Steve Smethurst, said: "Our officers swiftly responded to this incident and located all three suspects in the immediate area. This was made possible with the help of a specially trained police dog, a police drone using thermal imaging technology and the intelligence of response officers on foot, demonstrating excellent teamwork."

The incident remains under investigation and anyone with any information is asked to report it online or call 101, quoting serial 1660 of 19/06.
