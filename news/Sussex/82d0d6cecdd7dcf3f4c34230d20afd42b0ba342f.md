Police are appealing for witnesses after a motorcyclist sadly died in a collision on the A29.

The incident occurred on the A29 at Fairmile Bottom, near Slindon, around 2.57pm on Wednesday 14 October.

A black Aprilia motorcycle and a silver Vauxhall Vectra were both travelling northeast towards Whiteways Roundabout when they collided, causing the Aprilia to crash into a dark coloured Ford Transit which was parked in a lay-by on the opposite carriageway.

Sadly, the motorcyclist - a 50-year-old man from Hampshire - was declared dead at the scene.

The driver of the Vauxhall - a 30-year-old man from Storrington - was uninjured. He was arrested at the scene on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving, and has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Police would like to speak to anyone who may have witnessed this incident or who may have recorded either vehicle on dash cam prior to the collision.

Any witnesses are requested to email collision.appeal@sussex.pnn.police.uk quoting Operation Redman.
