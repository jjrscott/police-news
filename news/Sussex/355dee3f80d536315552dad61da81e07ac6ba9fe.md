A man has been charged in connection with the sexual assault of a woman in St Leonards in 2019.

Police received a report of a woman being approached by a man in Strood Road, near to Alexandra Park, around 7pm on July 11 last year.

The man briefly engaged in conversation before sexually assaulting the woman. He fled the scene after the victim sought help from members of the public.

Officers conducted extensive enquiries following the incident and on Thursday 6 August, 2020, arrested a man in connection with the investigation.

On Friday (August 7), Edhuard Gheorghe Olteanu, 34, a car valeter, of Pelham Crescent, Hastings, was charged with attempted rape, two counts of sexual assault and false imprisonment.

He has been remanded in custody to appear before Brighton Magistrates' Court on Saturday (August 8).
