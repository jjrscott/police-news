Police are appealing for witnesses after an elderly man was robbed in St Leonards.

The 88-year-old victim had just withdrawn Â£300 from the Post Office in London Road when he was approached by an unknown man around 2.20pm on Monday (March 15).

The suspect grabbed the victim's arm and reached into the pocket of his coat, taking his wallet containing the cash. He then fled in the direction of Norman Road. The victim was left shaken and with a serious arm injury.

The suspect is described as white, in his mid-30s, 6' tall, of lean build and with dark hair. He was wearing a black jacket and a white hooded jumper.

Inspector Aidan Cornwall said: "This was a truly despicable incident where an 88-year-old man has been left with a horrific injury as a result.

"We are committed to identifying and bringing this suspect to justice and I would strongly urge any members of our community who may have information about this incident to make contact with us."

Anyone who witnessed the robbery, or who may have any other information, is asked to contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 729 of 15/03.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
