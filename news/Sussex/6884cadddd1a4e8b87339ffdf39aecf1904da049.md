Sussex Police is warning Brighton and Hove residents to remain vigilant to scams.

The warning comes after people were contacted from someone pretending to be from the local council to say emergency work needed to be completed on their properties.

Police received three reports of this offence between the 25-27 January. The first instance saw an elderly man contacted via telephone from someone requesting money for work required on his basement. The man recognised it was a scam and hung up the phone.

The following day a man attended an elderly woman's address and stated urgent repair works were required. The woman paid a total of Â£2,000 to the man.

Finally on Wednesday (27 January) a man was approached outside his property and was asked for money. No money was handed over.

Police would like to hear from anyone else who may have fallen victim to this crime or anyone who can assist the ongoing investigation. You can report information online.

_Key things to remember_

Never send or give money to anyone you don't know or trust.

Check people are who they say they are.

Don't share your personal information.

Make decisions in your own time.

If in doubt phone a relative or a friend.

Trust no-one who cold calls you about your bank account or a problem with your computer.
