A man has been summonsed to court in relation to a serious collision in Bexhill.

Police were called to Woodsgate Park around 7.40pm on Friday 22 May to reports of a crash between a red Mini and a moped.

The moped rider - a 16-year-old boy from Bexhill - received medical treatment for serious facial injuries.

The driver of the Mini left the scene, and an appeal for information was issued to try and identify those involved.

Sam Hannah, 33, a horticulturalist, of Newlands Avenue, Bexhill, has now been summonsed to court to face charges of causing serious injury by dangerous driving, driving with no insurance, failing to stop at the scene of a road traffic collision, and failing to report a road traffic collision.

He is due to appear before Hastings Magistrates' Court on December 9.

Investigating officer PC Chris Storey said: "I'd like to thank the members of the public who responded to our appeal for information and came forward to assist with our ongoing investigation."
