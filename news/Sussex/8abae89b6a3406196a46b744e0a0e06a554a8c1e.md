The winners of a photo competition held by Brighton Police asking local residents to submit pictures capturing their communities have been announced.

Six winning photographers have been chosen to display their photographs in the front office at John Street Police Station to showcase the diversity and community of Brighton and Hove.

The competition was based on the theme of 'Community Brighton' and what community means to members of the public.

Chief Superintendent Nick May said: "The competition was an excellent way to get local residents involved in making the front office for the public, by the public. These photos reflect the communities of Brighton and will remind officers every day of the people they are proud to serve."

"I am delighted with the fantastic photos submitted to the competition and it's very important that we display how talented the people of Brighton and Hove are and why this city is a great place to live and work."

The photos include images of Brighton Pier, the seafront and landscapes in Brighton.

The winning photographers are: Rachel Fainchie, Bradley Moon and Sarah Randall. The runners up are Lewis Steele, Tejal Patel and Laura Young.

The winners took their photographs on professional cameras or mobile phones and the images have been displayed in John Street Police Station for everyone to see.
