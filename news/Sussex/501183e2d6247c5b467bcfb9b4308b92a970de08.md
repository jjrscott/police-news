Sussex Police is issuing a warning after receiving report of a series of similar fraud attempts in the Rother area.

A male claiming to be from Sussex Police calls victims and says they have someone in custody who has cloned their bank card. The male then requests the victim to terminate the call and ring their bank immediately and may ask them to move the money to a different account.

PC Daryl Holter said: "We are asking people to please be wary if you receive an unsolicited call like this, there are fraudsters out there who will try to capitalise on your trust to financially profit.

"Fraudsters make these phone calls to try to steal from you, treat all unsolicited phone calls with scepticism and don't give out any personal information. If you feel pressured, hang up and talk it through with a friend or family member".

If you receive an unsolicited call:

 * don't be rushed or pressured into making a decision - a genuine bank or another trusted organisation won't force you to make a financial transaction on the spot; they would never ask you to transfer money into another account for fraud reasons
 * remember to stop and take time to carefully consider your actions
 * don't make a payment
 * make sure you know who you are talking to - if in doubt, hang up immediately
 * listen to your instincts - if something feels wrong then it is usually right to question it
 * remember that criminals may lull you into a false sense of security when you are out and about or rely on your defences being down when you're in the comfort of your own home - they may appear trustworthy, but they may not be who they claim to be
 * don't allow remote access to your computer

If you have been a victim of this crime or have any information that could help with our enquiries, please report online or call 101.
