Sussex Police is encouraging residents to review their home security as we approach the clock change weekend.

With longer nights drawing in, we want residents to think about how they can protect their homes, in order to deter burglaries.

Sussex remains a safe place to live and work. Our burglary solved rate has increased over the last few months and we continue to work extremely hard to catch criminals and bring them to court.

During two dedicated days of action in recently across Sussex, officers and staff working with partners have been prioritising burglary investigations and this has led to the arrests of nine people. Work carried out included a focus on distraction burglary and vulnerable victims.

Chief Inspector Alasdair Henry, said: "Having your property burgled can be one of the most upsetting and destructive crimes to occur and we are committed to do all we can to reduce this crime and catch those responsible.

"Recently, we have been required to pull out all the stops to improve our solved rate for burglary and are beginning to see some really positive results.

"Sussex is a safe county and suffers from relatively low levels of burglary and we intend to work to continue to make our county a hostile place for burglars to operate."

Our crime prevention advice on burglary ranges from leaving a light on in order to deter thieves, to installing CCTV and video doorbells. From an evidential perspective, video footage is invaluable and can greatly assist investigations and also deter criminals. To find out more about how to protect yourself against burglary, read here
