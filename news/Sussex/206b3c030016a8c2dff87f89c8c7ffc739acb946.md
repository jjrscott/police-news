A man who violently assaulted another man in an unprovoked attack has been jailed.

Police issued a witness appeal on social media following the incident, which occurred in Whitehawk Road, Brighton, around 11pm on 1 June, 2018.

A couple - a man and a woman - had been withdrawing money from a cash point when they were approached by a man now known as Dominic Killen.

Without warning, Killen punched the 44-year-old victim, causing him to fall to the floor and hit his head. He was taken to Royal Sussex County Hospital, before being transferred to Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead, where he received specialist treatment for head and facial injuries.

After seeing his facial image circulated on social media, Killen, a 39-year-old chef, of Whitehawk Way, Brighton, handed himself in.

He was subsequently arrested and charged with causing grievous bodily harm.

He denied the offence and the case was due to go to trial. However, he later changed his plea to guilty, and at Lewes Crown Court on Monday 29 June, he was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment.
