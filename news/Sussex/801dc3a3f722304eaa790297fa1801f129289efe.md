The centre of Chichester was closed off on Thursday evening (April 23) as police dealt with a man who was threatening to harm himself.

Officers were called to North Street at 9.42pm due to concern for the man who was in possession of a knife. They were quickly joined by armed colleagues and specialist negotiators who engaged with the man.

The incident was contained and there was no danger to the general public, but police have thanked people for heeding requests to stay away from the area and apologised to the local community for the disruption caused as they dealt with the man.

At 1.20am, the incident was brought to a safe conclusion.

A 45-year-old man from Chichester was arrested on suspicion of affray and possession of a knife in a public place. He was checked by health professionals before being taken into custody where he remained at 8.50am on Friday.
