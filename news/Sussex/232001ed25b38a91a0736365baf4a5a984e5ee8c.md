Police are appealing for witnesses after a large section of York stone pavement was stolen from a public area in Storrington.

Up to six people using two vehicles may have been involved in the theft, which occurred in Ryecroft Lane overnight on 2 March.

Inspector Ben Starns, of the Adur, Worthing and Horsham Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "This was a protracted effort that must have attracted some attention and will have been stolen for a specific purpose. We are still investigating and have visited a number of locations in an attempt to locate the stone.

"We're urging anyone with any information about the theft to come forward."

You can report it online or call 101, quoting serial 390 of 02/03.

You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or report it online.
