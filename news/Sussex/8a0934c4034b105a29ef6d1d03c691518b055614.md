A drug dealer in Worthing who operated a phone line to contact drugs users is now starting a prison sentence after he was tracked down by local police officers working with colleagues in London.

Nyashadzashe Hove, 34, unemployed, of South Farm Road, Broadwater, pleaded guilty on Monday 10 August at Lewes Crown Court to being concerned in the supply of crack cocaine and heroin, and was sentenced to two years imprisonment.

Hove had been offering the drugs during November and December 2019 but was detected by officers who analysed intelligence including phone traffic and proved that he was the source.

Sergeant Jason Stanley said; "This conviction and sentence is the result of months of hard work with our partners including the Metropolitan Police. We are continuing every day to combat drug dealing in the town and information from local people is welcomed.

"You can contact us at any time either online or by calling 101."
