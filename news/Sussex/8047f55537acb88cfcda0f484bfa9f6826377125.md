The High Sheriff of West Sussex has thanked Sussex Police's new cohort of Specials in a visit to HQ on 10 October.

Dr Tim Fooks, High Sheriff of West Sussex visited the new cohort of Special Constables at headquarters where he thanked them for their work to support their local communities.

He said: "It was a pleasure to meet the new cohort at Headquarters, I am extremely proud of them all giving up their own time to not only take on the long training plan but to then go out into their local community, not knowing what they might face or encounter."

"This is the first cohort of Special Constabulary Sussex have recruited in a number of years, the new recruits follow an extensive training programme which lasts twenty weeks over alternate weekends and allows them to make a direct contribution to their local community."

Alan Rankin-Thorn, Head of Special Constabulary said, "This was a fantastic opportunity for the High Sheriff to meet our new cohort at the start of their Sussex Police journey. We look forward to welcoming him back at the end of the year when they attest."

The High Sheriff will be joining the cohort again on the 20 December at the Specials Attestation.

A new cohort of Specials start in January 2021 and applications are currently open for expressions of interest in becoming a special constable on our vacancy page. https://www.lumesse-engage.com/policejobssurreyandsussex/internal/jobs/expressions-of-interest-special-constable-sysx-exp00017-1
