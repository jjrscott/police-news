Police in Brighton are seeking 28-year-old local man Lenny Heath, who they want to arrest and interview about allegations of smashing windows at a house in the city.

Officers are investigating an incident in which the front windows of a house occupied by a woman known to Heath were smashed on 8 January.

Heath, who is described as white and 5'8", with blue/green eyes, brown hair and a muscular build, frequents the Brighton and Hove area.

Detective Constable Kevin Enright of the Brighton Safeguarding Investigations Unit said; "If you see Heath or know where he is, do not approach him but just call us on 999 or 101, quoting serial 43 of 08/01."
