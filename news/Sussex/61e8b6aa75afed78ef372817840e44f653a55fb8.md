A man has admitted causing more than Â£5,000 worth of damage to the front office of Brighton's John Street Police Station after pulling down roof tiles and cabling and assaulting a police officer.

Aaron Barrett, 29, of North Road, Brighton, appeared at Brighton Magistrates' Court on Monday (12 October) after being arrested following the incident on Sunday afternoon (11 October).

Barrett refused to leave the front office of the police station after becoming aggressive with staff. He then climbed onto the atrium roof and threw tiles and plasterboard at police officers who were trying to persuade him to come down. The front office was closed to the public while the incident was ongoing and after three hours he subsequently surrendered to police and was arrested.

Barrett pleaded guilty to three charges of causing criminal damage, assaulting a police officer and causing a nuisance to the public by causing the closure of the police station front office through violent behaviour.

He was released by the court on conditional bail to appear at Lewes Crown Court for sentencing on 9 November.
