Do you recognise these two cycles?

The black and red Carrera Virtuoso road cycle (above) and the red and yellow Voodoo Hoodoo Mountain bike (below) were left near the scene when would-be thieves ran off having failed to steal a quad bike and a lawn tractor from a barn off Old Malling Way outside Lewes on 4 March.

Police believe they used the cycles to get to the isolated location and suspect they will have been stolen although there is no record of them being reported stolen.

PC Tom Bowen said: "We haven't identified the suspects but it would still be good to re-unite the owners with their cycles. If you think you recognise them please contact us either online or by calling 101, quoting serial 715 of 04/03. We will need some proof of ownership."
