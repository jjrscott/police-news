Officers investigating a report of a seven-year-old boy being bitten by a dog in Eastbourne are appealing to identify this man.

Around 12.30pm on Friday, 21 February, police received report that the victim was shopping with his mother on Langney Road when a greyhound dog nipped his ear, causing a puncture wound.

It is thought the man pictured may be able to assist with enquiries and officers are keen to speak with him.

Anyone with information is asked to report online or call 101, quoting 47200032565.
