A man has been charged in connection with a sexual assault near Horsham.

A woman was running along the Downs Link, Southwater, at the junction of Marlpost and Two Mile Ash Road, around 7.20am on Tuesday (October 27) when she was pushed to the ground and sexually assaulted by a man.

The man cycled off when a member of the public approached. The victim was taken to hospital and has since been discharged. She is being supported by specialist officers.

Christopher Cooper, 29, a tree surgeon of no fixed address, was arrested and charged with attempted rape and assault by penetration. He has been remanded in custody to appear before Crawley Magistrates' Court on Monday, November 2.

Police are still keen to hear from anyone who witnessed the assault, or who may have any relevant CCTV or dash cam footage from the area at that time.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact police online or by calling 101 quoting Operation Morning. Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
