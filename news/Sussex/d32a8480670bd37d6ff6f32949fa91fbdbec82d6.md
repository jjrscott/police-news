Officers from Chichester Police Station have successfully obtained a Partial Closure Order relating to a property in Orchard Street, Chichester.

The address had been highlighted during the last year following concerns raised by local residents in relation to drug use, high volumes of antisocial behaviour and breach of Covid-19 guidelines.

The partial closure order will initially last for three months and stipulates that the male occupant is the only permitted resident and there are to be no visitors to the property. This does not include medical staff, carers or persons from recognised agencies.

Sergeant Daniel West, from Chichester Neighbourhood Policing Team, said "Closure orders are the final option when dealing with antisocial behaviour at a particular address.

"Unfortunately our efforts to engage with the resident did not prove successful and we hope that the order will bring some relief to neighbouring residents.

"We take all reports of antisocial behaviour seriously and work with partner agencies to find solutions which improve the situation for all parties involved."
