A persistent bike thief has been given a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) which bans him from sitting on, riding or handling any bicycles in Brighton and Hove.

Christopher Hussey, 38, of New Steine Mews, Brighton, was given the two-year order when he appeared at Brighton Magistrates' Court on Wednesday (5 August) after the magistrates were told his was a prolific thief targeting pedal cycles in the city.

Since May 2019, Hussey had been convicted of 12 offences, the majority of which were theft-related. Four of those, including the one which led to the CBO being granted, were for stealing bikes.

The CBO prohibits Hussey from sitting astride, handling or being in any other way in possession of a pedal cycle, both manual and electric within the city of Brighton and Hove. The order also requires him to undertake voluntary work and training.

PC Kevin Michnowicz said: "The order is the result of hard work from the local prevention team to try and tackle Hussey's stealing and criminal behaviour, which impacts on the local community and businesses and is completely unacceptable.

"If Hussey breaches the order than he is liable to be sent to prison."
