Police arrested three suspects after three people were attacked, two of them were then robbed and an attempt was made to steal a car in Horsham in the early hours of Sunday (15 December).

Two youths and a man jumped in front of a woman's car in Brighton Road and asked her for a lift just before 1am. When she refused and attempted to drive around then, one of them smashed her passenger window with a bottle. They then approached a man in Brighton Road and demanded money before hitting him over the back of the head with a bottle. They then approached another man, threatening and hitting him to the ground and proceeded to kick him whilst on the ground. They then went onto punch another man in East Street.

Nothing was stolen and none of the victims needed hospital treatment.

Following police enquiries, two 17-year-old boys and a 22-year-old man were detained on suspicion of robbery and one of the 17-year-olds was also arrested on suspicion of assaulting a PC when he was detained. The 22-year-old was also arrested on suspicion of resisting arrest and possession of an offensive weapon.

All three have been questioned and released under investigation.

Detective Sergeant Joel Brooks said: "We are investigating a series of events which all happened in a short space of time close to each other. We have made three arrests but would like to hear from anyone who saw these or has any information about them to come forward."

If you can help the investigation report online or ring 101 quoting serial 78 of 15/12.
