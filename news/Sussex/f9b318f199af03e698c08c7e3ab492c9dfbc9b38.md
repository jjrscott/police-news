A man has been arrested in connection with multiple offences following a crash near Goodwood.

About 7.11am on Tuesday 18 February, police received a report of a burglary at Farol Ltd, on Holmbush Industrial Estate, Midhurst.

A man is reported to have forced entry into the premises and stolen five chainsaws, before making off from the scene in a silver Ford Mondeo.

A short time later, around 7.48am, police were called after a vehicle described as a grey Ford Mondeo crashed into a tree in Kennel Hill, Goodwood. The driver is reported to have decamped and run from the scene.

Officers carried out a search of the area, assisted by the National Police Air Service helicopter, and the suspect was located and detained nearby. He was taken to St Richard's Hospital in Chichester as a precaution, and was arrested upon his release.

Four chainsaws were recovered; the fifth remains outstanding.

A 26-year-old man of no fixed address, arrested on suspicion of burglary with intent to steal, dangerous driving, failing to stop after a road traffic collision, attempting to drive whilst unfit through drink, failing to provide a specimen for analysis, driving without insurance and driving while disqualified, has been released on conditional bail until 18 March, pending further enquiries.
