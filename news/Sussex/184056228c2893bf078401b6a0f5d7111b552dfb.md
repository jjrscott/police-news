Two motorcyclists were injured when they were in collision with a car on the B2141 at Chilgrove on Saturday (July 11).

They were part of a group of three riders, all off-duty police officers, who were travelling south towards Chichester at 1.20pm. A 53-year old man, based at Gatwick, suffered a broken wrist and suspected fractured jaw and a 30-year-old man, based at Lewes, suffered cuts and bruising to his leg and impact injuries. They were taken to St Richard's Hospital in Chichester for treatment and have since been discharged.

The driver of the red Ford Fiesta involved,â€‹ an 80-year-old man and his female passenger, from Chichester, sustained minor injuries. The third motorcyclist in the group was not involved in the collision.

Police are appealing for witnesses to the collision or anyone who may have seen the group of motorcyclists or the Ford Fiesta in the area in the time leading up to it to report online or call 101 quoting Operation Hollybank.
