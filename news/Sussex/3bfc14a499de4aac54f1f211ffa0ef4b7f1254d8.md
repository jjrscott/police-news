Police are appealing for witnesses after a vulnerable woman was burgled at a hotel in Hastings.

The 49-year-old victim was staying at the Chatsworth Hotel in Carlisle Parade, and noticed a quantity of cash had been stolen from her room.

The incident is reported to have occurred between 9.15am and 10.30am on Saturday 11 July, and it is believed someone may have accessed her room via an open window from the balcony which overlooks the seafront.
