Police were called to reports of a fight involving a large number of teenagers just before 8.45pm on Wednesday (24 June) on Hove Lawns.

CI Dee Wells said: "Officers swiftly responded to reports of disorder involving a large group of young people on Hove Lawns. On arrival no violence was witnessed but we want to encourage anyone who has anything to report to come forward to us to ensure the relevant action is taken.

"We understand that teenagers will be wanting to get out and about but for people to gather in such numbers was irresponsible. This coupled with reports of anti-social behaviour led to us issuing a dispersal order.

"The order will be in place for 48hours and will allow officers and PCSOs to direct a person who has committed, or is likely to commit, anti-social behaviour, crime or disorder to leave an area and not return for a specified period.

"This order should be a warning. We will use police powers to tackle such irresponsible behaviour.

"We understand the impact this behaviour can have on the community and in particular during this health emergency, and people need to take personal responsibility for their actions.

"We must stress the importance of adhering to current Government guidance and this responsibility falls on everyone.

"Our officers will be out patrolling this area and will utilise all policing powers available to reduce antisocial behaviour."

To report matters of anti-social behaviour please report online or call 101.
