Police want to trace the owner of four dogs who reportedly chased a horse rider in Hartfield.

The woman was riding her horse along a bridleway running between Parrock Lane and The Royal Ashdown Forest Golf Club off Shepherds Hill, Hartfield, on 1 December at about 11.15am. Four dogs who were off their leads ran up to her horse causing it to panic and bolt. She managed to stay on her horse and gain control but the dogs gave chase as she rode away from them.

Two of the dogs involved were believed to be a Dalmation and a black Labrador type dog. The owner of the dogs were said to have made no attempt to call them off when they chased the horse. He is white, aged in his 40s and was wearing a blue top.

PC Steve Knowles from the Rural Crime Team said: "Thankfully the rider was able to get the horse under control and no injuries were caused to the rider or horse.

This incident however could have been much worse and posed a danger not only to the horse and rider but also anyone who may have been on the bridleway at the time.

We are want to hear from any witnesses and from anyone who can identify the dog owner as we are keen to speak to him."

If you can help the investigation, report online or ring 101 quoting serial 255 of 04/12.
