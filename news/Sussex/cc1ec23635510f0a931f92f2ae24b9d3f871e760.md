Police who arrested a man after a reported assault on a woman and on a police officer on West Wittering beach are seeking witnesses.

Between 5pm and 5.30pm on Friday (26 June) the 41-year-old woman was punched to the head several times whilst with others in a group on the beach at West Wittering near the surfing school, and a police constable was then also assaulted.

A man aged 40 from West London was arrested on suspicion of causing actual bodily harm and also of assaulting an emergency worker, the police officer. After being interviewed the man was released on police bail until 25 July while enquiries continue.

The man and woman are known to each other.

PC Shaun Moreland said; "If you were on the beach at around that time and saw anything of what happened, and especially if you have any video of the incident, please contact us either online or by calling 101, quoting serial 1304 of 26/06."
