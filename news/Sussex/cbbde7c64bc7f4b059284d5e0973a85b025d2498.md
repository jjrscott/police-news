Police are seeking witnesses after a man was robbed of his mobile phone in a Littlehampton park.

At about 11pm on Thursday (13 August) the 29-year-old man was walking along a footpath in Rosemead Park, Littlehampton, off Dorset Close, when he was attacked by a man who took his mobile phone and then struck him about the face several times.

The victim was treated for facial injuries at St Richards Hospital, Chichester, and was discharged early the following morning.

The suspect is described as dark skinned, about 5'11"-6' and slim, wearing dark clothing with a black hooded top. He made off on foot along a footpath towards Cornwall Road.

Detective Constable Matt Ward said; "This was an isolated incident and does not appear to be linked to anything similar locally. If you were in or around Rosemead Park late on Thursday night and saw anything suspicious, or if you have any other information, please contact us online or call 101, quoting serial 1699 of 13/08.

"You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
