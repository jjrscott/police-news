Adur and Worthing Police have taken proactive action to deter bike thefts.

The local Prevention teams conducted a day of action in the Worthing area on Thursday (3 September) in a bid to tackle the theft of pedal cycles.

During the day, which included an increase in high visibility patrols and monitoring CCTV in the town, officers spotted a man acting suspiciously in Chapel Road. He was pursued by officers to Rowlands Road and arrested.

Alexander Nash, 27, of no fixed address was later charged with the theft of a pedal cycle and will appear at Worthing Magistrates' Court on 1 December.

PC Chris Corker of the Op Override team said: "The day of action from the team is part of ongoing work aimed at tackling bike thefts across the Worthing area.

"We are utilising a number of overt and covert tactics to deter this behaviour from continuing in our communities.

"Anyone with any information regarding bike thefts is encouraged to contact police on 101, online or via Crimestoppers."
