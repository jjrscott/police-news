Police are appealing for information following an arson attack at an alpaca farm off the A272 in Rogate, near Petersfield.

The incident started in a storage area to the rear of one of the animal shelters, which was destroyed, between 7.45pm and 8.15pm on Monday 7 December.

Thankfully all of the alpacas were able to escape unharmed.

A suspect was seen to leave the scene as the flames took hold and police are appealing for anyone who may have seen what happened - or witnessed anything suspicious in the area around that time - to come forward.

You can report it online or call 101, quoting serial 1201 of 07/12.

You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or report it online.
