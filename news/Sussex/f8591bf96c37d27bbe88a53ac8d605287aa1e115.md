A 17-year-old boy has pleaded guilty to nine offences in the Brighton area.

The boy, who can not be named for legal reasons, appeared at Hove Crown Court on 20 February to stand trial for a series of robberies and attempted robberies committed in November.

He pleaded guilty at court to three robberies, four attempted robberies, one count of theft and possession of cannabis.

Several of the offences took place in the space of a few hours on Dyke Road between 5 and 6 November. The suspect approached three of the victims in the street and threatened them with a knife, demanding cash from them and taking two of them to ATMs to withdraw funds.

A further four offences took place between 14 and 15 November.

The suspect approached a couple at a bus stop on Eastern Road and made demands for cash and assaulted them, he went on to do the same to another two people later that evening.

He was subsequently located and arrested by officers.

Detective Constable Georgina Lake said: "These were terrifying attacks on members of the public who should have been able to go about their business without being threatened for their money.

"We hope the defendant takes this moment to reflect on his unacceptable behaviour".

The defendant has been remanded in youth detention and is due to be sentenced on 19 March.
