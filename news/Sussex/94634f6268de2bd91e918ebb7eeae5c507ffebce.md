Police are appealing for witnesses after an elderly woman was violently assaulted in her own home.

Around 10pm on Tuesday 30 June, the 85-year-old victim heard a loud noise at her property in St Helens Road, Hastings, and went downstairs to see what had happened.

After noticing the front porch windows had been smashed, she heard a voice call out to check she was ok. She opened the door, at which point she was grabbed by an unknown man, who placed his hand over her mouth and forced her to the floor.

The suspect demanded money but fled the scene empty handed. The victim sustained hand and facial injuries.

The suspect is described as white, about 6', of very slim build. He wore a balaclava covering his face, a black gilet over a black long sleeved top and black trousers. He spoke with an English accent.

Investigating officer, Detective Constable Shaun Ryan, said: "This was an extremely frightening incident for the vulnerable victim, who was left shaken but thankfully not seriously injured. She has been seen by paramedics to ensure her medical welfare is looked after.

"The incident is being investigated as an aggravated burglary, and we're urging anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious in the area around that time to report it. Or, if you have CCTV, door bell or dash cam footage which you think could be relevant to our investigation, please come forward."

You can report it online or call 101, quoting serial 1416 of 30/06.
