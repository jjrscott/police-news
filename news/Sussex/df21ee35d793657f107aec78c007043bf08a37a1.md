Police are appealing for witnesses to a serious collision on the A284 London Road at Arundel.

Around 11.15am on Thursday (March 18), officers received a report of a collision involving a red Triumph motorcycle and a food delivery van.

The motorcycle rider, a man in his 70s, has been taken to the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton with potentially life-changing leg injuries.

Anyone who witnessed the collision, or who may have any relevant dash cam footage, is asked to email collision.appeal@sussex.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101 quoting Operation Crossbow.
