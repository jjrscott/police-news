A Sussex Police CCTV operator has been praised by colleagues for his fast work in identifying robbery suspects in Brighton.

Shortly after midnight on Sunday (20 December), the staff member was investigating an area near to The Level following a report of an attempted robbery where the victim was assaulted by a group of males.

While searching for the suspects, the CCTV operator noticed another robbery taking place on London Road where the victim had a rucksack stolen by three suspects.

Officers were swiftly dispatched and located three suspects and the victim.

A 17-year-old boy and two 15-year-old boys were arrested on suspicion of attempted robbery and robbery. They have been bailed while enquiries are ongoing.

Detective Superintendent Mike Ashcroft said: "This was fantastic work by our colleague for his quick work in identifying three suspects and spotting another robbery taking place.

"Keeping Brighton and Hove safe is our number one priority and we work around the clock to detect and prevent crime."
