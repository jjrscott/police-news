Police investigating a burglary at a village shop in Burwash, East Sussex, in the early hours of Tuesday 19 January are appealing for information.

Officers attended the scene following reports of a break-in at Burwash Village Stores at approximately 4.10am. A witness reported seeing three males leaving the scene. Officers have reviewed CCTV footage indicating the suspects drove away in a metallic blue Audi Q3.

DC Andrew Smithson of Hastings CID said: "More than Â£810 worth of alcohol was stolen in the burglary and considerable damage was done to the store.

"Anyone who witnessed the burglary or saw the Audi Q3 on the roads around that time are urged to get in touch. We would also like to hear from anyone with relevant CCTV or dash-cam footage.

"Officers are working hard to locate the perpetrators and bring them to justice.

"We would urge businesses to check their premises are sufficiently protected. Advice about how to ensure your security features are sufficient and robust is available on our website."
