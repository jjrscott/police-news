Is this your dog?

The tan and black male Lurcher was found in a field in Funtington, West Sussex, on Saturday 2 January, having pursued several sheep, one of which had to be put down as a result of its injuries.

The dog has been temporarily housed but if no owner is located within seven days of the incident a new home will be sought for the dog via a rescue centre.

PC Ian Buckman said; "If you have any information that can assist us in identifying the owner, or wish to claim the dog as belonging to you, please contact the Rural Crime Team at Midhurst police station via ruralcrime.team@sussex.pnn.police.uk, or call 101, quoting serial 191 of 02/01.

"Please note we are not taking enquiries regarding re-homing the dog. Arrangements for that to be done if necessary are already in place via an established rescue centre."
