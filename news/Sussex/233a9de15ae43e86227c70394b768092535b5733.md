Police are appealing for witnesses after a house was burgled in Crawley.

Officers were called around 2.40pm on Tuesday (July 21) to reports of a break-in at a residential property on St Catherines Road.

A quantity of jewellery was stolen from inside the address, and damage was caused to the property.

Anyone who saw any suspicious behaviour in the area at the time, or who may have any CCTV or dash cam footage from the vicinity, is asked to contact police.

This can be done online or by calling 101 quoting serial 888 of 21/07. Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
