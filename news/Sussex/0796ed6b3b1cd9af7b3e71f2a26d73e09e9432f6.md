Police are appealing for witnesses after a man was assaulted in Rye.

The assault happened around 4.25pm on Wednesday (December 2) on the public footpath leading from Tillingham Avenue to Love Lane, near to the allotments by Rye Community Primary School.

The 63-year-old victim was walking when he was approached from behind by two women who started making offensive remarks. One of the women punched the man several times to the face and the other woman kicked him to the torso.

The women left the scene, walking in the direction of Ferry Road. The man suffered a fractured cheekbone, injuries to his abdomen and lost a tooth in the assault.

One of the women is described as white, approximately 28 years old, around 5' 5" and of stocky build. She had straight, copper coloured hair slicked back and was wearing a white top with dark leggings.

The second woman is described as white, approximately 25 years old, around 5' 5" and of slim build. She had long, wavy black hair and was wearing dark clothing.

The women had two young girls with them, believed to be aged nine or 10, who were both wearing school uniform.

Anyone who saw what happened, or who may have any other information, is asked to contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 875 of 02/12.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
