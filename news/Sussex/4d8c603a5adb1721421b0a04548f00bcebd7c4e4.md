Police are seeking information from residents and drivers in Peacehaven after a woman was found seriously injured at the base of seafront cliffs.

At 4am on Saturday 20 March emergency services were called to the seafront at the bottom of Cornwall Avenue, Peacehaven, after a 21-year-old local woman had been found lying there with serious injuries.

The woman was conscious and had phoned the ambulance service herself telling them she was there and had fallen.

She was taken to the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton.

The incident is currently being treated as unexplained though not suspicious, and an investigation is under way.

Detective Inspector Claire Gill said; "From our enquiries so far it appears that the young woman had walked along nearby Arundel Road, then across the main A259 South Coast Road and into Cornwall Avenue, then falling from the top of the cliff, some 60 feet.

"At this time there is no evidence of any third party involvement, but we are making enquiries in the area and would like to hear from anyone with information.

"We would particularly like residents in that area to check any dashcam or door bell footage for the period between 2.30am and 4am so that we can see if it contains anything that might help the investigation.

"The woman, who is white, has blonde hair, and was wearing a black coat, blue jeans, and was carrying a torch.

"If you can help please contact us either by calling 101 or online, quoting Operation Middle."
