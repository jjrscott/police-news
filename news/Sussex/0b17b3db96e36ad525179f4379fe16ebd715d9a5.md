Police are investigating a burglary which occurred at a house in Elm Grove, Horsham, between 9am and 10am on Thursday 15 October.

An unknown person is reported to have forced entry into the property and stolen an unknown quantity of US Dollars, a watch and a BMW. The BMW was subsequently located and seized by officers in Surrey later the same day.

Police are keen to hear from anyone who saw a dark coloured Audi saloon in the road around that time. The vehicle had chrome window fittings and a loud exhaust.

Specifically, officers would like to establish the identity of a man wearing a face mask, who was also in the area at the time knocking on doors.

Anyone with any information is asked to report it online or call 101, quoting serial 593 of 15/10.

You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or report it online.
