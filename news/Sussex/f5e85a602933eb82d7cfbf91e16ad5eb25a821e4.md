Police investigating a report of a theft from a car in Emsworth have released CCTV images of two individuals they would like to identify.

A purse containing bank cards was stolen from the car, which was parked in Lawleys View, Emsworth. The theft is believed to have taken place between 1am and 4.15am on Wednesday (17 February)

The bank cards were subsequently used at approximately 4.32am that day at the Esso Petrol Station, on the A27 Chichester bypass (westbound), near the Stockridge Roundabout.

Police would like to identify two males captured in CCTV images at the Esso station at that time. Footage also shows the men travelling on bicycles (below).

If you recognise the males or have any information relating to the thefts, please contact police by _reporting online_ or by calling 101 quoting serial 968 of 17/02.
