Police are appealing for information after a man was found injured in Worthing town centre.

At 4.13am on Sunday 16 August, officers were called to Chapel Road by South East Coast Ambulance Service after a man had been found alone outside Barclays bank with facial injuries.

The man, in his 20s, was taken to hospital for treatment and has since been discharged.

Enquiries have led police to think the victim was assaulted around 4am, shortly after making a purchase in the Subway store in Chapel Road.

Officers are keen to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time and who saw what happened.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 317 of 16/08.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
