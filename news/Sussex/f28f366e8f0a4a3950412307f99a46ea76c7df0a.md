Police in Hastings are seeking witnesses to a late night attack on a man in the town centre.

Sometime around 1am Friday 14 August, the 29-year-old man was attacked by a group of between 10 and 12 young men and women while he was walking in the Priory Meadow, Kings Square area of central Hastings.

He was punched and kicked and left with facial and body injuries including cracked ribs.

Investigator Bernadette Peters said; "The exact location is not currently clear as the victim was visiting the town and does not know the area, and the motive may have been robbery but nothing was stolen.

"If you were in the area that night and saw anything of what happened, or saw such a group nearby, please contact us either online or by calling 101, quoting serial 166 of 14/08.
