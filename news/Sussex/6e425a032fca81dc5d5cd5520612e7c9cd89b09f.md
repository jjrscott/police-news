Do you recognise this man suspected of callously taking cash from a trusting elderly resident in Brighton?

On 18 February the 79-year-old disabled resident answered the door at his home off Manor Road in Brighton, to the man who said he was a Council official of some kind and engaged the resident in friendly and supposedly helpful chat for a while before leaving.

The man offered to do some shopping and the resident gave him a banknote towards this.

But some time after the man had left the resident discovered that Â£100 cash had been stolen from his property.

The man police want to talk to is described as white, slim and in his thirties or forties.

Detective Constable James Botting of Brighton CID said; "This was a really nasty theft from a trusting resident and we need to find this man.

"If you think you recognise him, please contact us either online or by calling 101, quoting serial 297 of 20/02."

Advice on how to prevent cold callers from entering your home is available on the Sussex Police website here.
