Worthing Police are continuing their proactive policing to tackle anti-social behaviour and disorder.

Officers and staff conducted four days of action around the town centre designed to address anti-social, disruptive and criminal behaviour in the area.

Over the four days officers conducted high visibility patrols, engaged with members of the public, seized alcohol from those in breach of the public space protection order and issued three section 35 dispersal orders.

Adur and Worthing Chief Inspector Sarah Leadbeatter added: "Our officers and staff have been patrolling the town centre to address any issues of ASB or disorder.

"We are aware a small minority of people who are causing concern within the communities and this is simply unacceptable.

"I am pleased to say that, on the whole, the public are acting in a respectable manner and the fact that no arrests were made on our four-days of action shows this.

"We will continue to engage and work with partner agencies to ensure the relevant action is taken against those who are being disruptive. Just last week we issued two community protection notices to individuals who have persistently been causing ASB.

"We would continue to ask members of the public to report ASB and disorder within the town to us either online or by calling 101."
