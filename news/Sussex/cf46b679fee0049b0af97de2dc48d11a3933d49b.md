Police investigating a report of fraud in the Langney area of Eastbourne have charged a suspect.

At 11am on Tuesday (26 January), officers were alerted to a man who reportedly sought money for fence repairs.

The victim - an 87-year-old woman - handed over around Â£50 for the work which was not completed.

Richard Chapman, 55, of Horsa Close in Eastbourne, has been charged with fraud by false representation.

He has been bailed to appear at Hastings Magistrates' Court on 10 March.

DC Elliott Lander said: "We work hard to protect vulnerable members of our community and will deal robustly with reports of fraud.

"Anyone with information or concerns is urged to report online or call 101."
