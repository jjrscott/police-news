Police are appealing for witnesses after a car crashed into a brick wall in Crawley, resulting in serious injuries for the two occupants.

The incident involving a black Renault Megane occurred in Breezehurst Drive around 9.35pm on Saturday on Saturday 29 August.

Anyone who witnessed the collision, or saw a black Renault Megane being driven in the area of the A264 or A23 beforehand - particularly anyone with dash cam footage - is asked to email collision.appeal@sussex.pnn.police.uk quoting Operation Chilcote.
