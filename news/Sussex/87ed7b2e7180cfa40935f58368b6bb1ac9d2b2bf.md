A man has been jailed for breaching his Community Behaviour Order (CBO) in its first two weeks.

Lee Cummings, 18, unemployed, of Selby Road in Uckfield, was given a CBO when he appeared at Brighton Magistrates' Court on July 15.

The order banned him from entering parts of Uckfield town centre following persistent criminal and anti-social behaviour in the area.

He was also prohibited from associating in a public place with six named people. However, on Tuesday 28 July, he was seen in the company of one of those six in Mill Lane, Uckfield.

He was charged with breaching a Criminal Behaviour Order, and also charged with theft from a shop after being seen on CCTV stealing alcohol from Applegreen Filling Service Station in Uckfield on July 6.

He appeared at Brighton Magistrates' Court on Thursday 30 July where he was sentenced to 20 weeks' imprisonment for activating a suspended sentence, four weeks for breaching a CBO to run concurrently, and four weeks for theft to run concurrently.

Inspector Jon Gross of the Wealden prevention team said: "CBOs are only granted by a court where it is felt absolutely necessary. They are an order specifically granted to protect communities from the persistent anti-social and criminal acts of individuals who have frequently come to notice for such behaviour.

"Mr Cummings showed complete disregard for his CBO, breaching it within a fortnight of it being issued. It is therefore no surprise that the court has felt it necessary to reflect the breach of the CBO as part of the sentencing in this case."
