Police investigating a report of a man being threatened with a knife in Littlehampton are appealing for witnesses.

On Tuesday (20 October) about 4.45pm the victim was approached by a man in an alleyway near Helyers Green and Clun Road.

The suspect asked the victim if they want drugs. When they declined, they were threatened with a kitchen knife and told not to return to the alleyway.

The victim was unharmed but returned home shaken by the incident before reporting to police.

Later that evening, a 23-year-old man was arrested by officers on suspicion of affray and possession of a Class B drug. He has been bailed subject to conditions while enquiries are ongoing.

Police are keen to speak with anyone who was in the area at the time and may have seen something that could assist with the investigation.

Anyone with information is asked to report online or call 101, quoting 47200181267.
