Have you seen Kesley Searle?

26-year-old Searle is wanted by police in East Sussex, for recall to prison having broken the terms of his release licence.

He had been released from prison on licence in November, part way through a sentence for robbery, but the probation service now require his arrest and return to prison as he has broken the terms of that licence.

Searle is described as white, 5'6", of medium build, with blond hair and blue eyes.

He is originally from Hastings, is likely to frequent both the Hastings and Eastbourne areas and may well be moving between both areas in different vehicles.

Detective Constable Richard Drury said; "If you see Searle, do not approach him, just dial 999. If you have any information which could help us find him, contact us online or ring 101 quoting Sussex serial 508 of 22/11."
