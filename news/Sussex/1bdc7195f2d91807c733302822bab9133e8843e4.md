He was assaulted and sustained a broken jaw and had to undergo surgery the following day at St Richards Hospital.

Police have spoken to a number of witnesses and would like to hear from anyone who saw what happened or who has any information that could assist with the investigation.

Anyone with information can report online or call 101 and quote serial 71 of 15/03.
