Police investigating an incident where a vehicle failed to stop for officers on the A259 south of Hooe want to trace the driver of a blue BMW car which was nearly hit by the vehicle.

The Suzuki Vitara made off from police on the A259 into Green Lane in the direction of Hooe. Officers pursued the vehicle which proceed to be driven at high speed. It then narrowly missed a head on collision with a BMW being driven in the opposite direction at 1.10pm on Saturday (28 November).

It eventually stopped in Wartling and officers arrested a 27-year-old man on suspicion of driving while disqualified, taking a vehicle without the owner's consent, failing to stop and possession with intent to supply cannabis. A 24-year-old man was detained on suspicion of being carried in a vehicle without the owner's consent and possession with intent to supply cannabis. They remain in custody.

PC Scott Franklin-Lester said: "We would like to speak to the driver of a blue BMW which was nearly involved in a head on collision with the vehicle towards Hooe and would like any drivers who have dash cam footage of the incident to come forward."

If you are the driver of the blue BMW or you can help our investigation, report online or ring 101 quoting serial 576 of 28/11.
