Rural Crime Team PCSO Julie Pearce-Martin has joined forces with local farmers and Battle Town Council to highlight the problem of walkers damaging stock fencing.

Farmer John Wheatland says his fences behind the Battle Abbey area have been deliberately cut. He said: "It is a constant worry for me. My cows and calves get out onto public land and I have to get there as quickly as possible to get them back onto my land."

Battle Town clerk Carol Harris is well aware of the problem, receiving reports to her office of escaping sheep and cows.

She said: "This is not only an inconvenience but also potentially hazardous. Our grounds team have seen the damage for themselves. Farmers work very hard to maintain their boundaries to ensure their animals remain enclosed and safe."

PCSO Pearce-Martin said: "Cutting fencing is criminal damage and we would really like to know who the offenders are. Dog walkers must also keep their dogs on leads and everyone needs to take note of the signage, not deface or remove the signs."

There are a number of published footpaths in the Rother area which can be found using websites such as footpathmap.co.uk. These footpaths include the appropriate access routes using either gates or styles.

Members of the public are encouraged to continue reporting crime and suspicious behaviour to police, so officers can build a picture of crime in the area and respond effectively.

Report online or ring 101.
