Police are appealing for information after a pedestrian was injured in a road traffic collision in Rustington on Thursday night (August 27).

Emergency services were called to the A259 New Road shortly after 9pm to reports of a collision involving a vehicle and a pedestrian.

The pedestrian, a man in his 40s, had been crossing the westbound carriageway at the traffic lights near the entrance to Rustington Retail Park. He was taken to hospital where he continues to receive treatment for his injuries.

Police are working to establish the full circumstances of the collision and are urging the driver of the vehicle to come forward.

Officers are also keen to hear from anyone who witnessed the collision, or who may have captured any relevant dash cam footage.

Anyone with information is asked to email collision.appeal@sussex.pnn.police.uk or call 101, quoting Operation Oxford.
