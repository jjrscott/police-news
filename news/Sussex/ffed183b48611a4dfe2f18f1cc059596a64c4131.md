A man has been charged with two counts of burglary in Brighton and Hove.

Police were called after the Royal Mail delivery office in Denmark Villas, Hove, was broken into in the early hours of Monday (July 20).

A laptop and an official Royal Mail jacket were taken from the premises, among other items.

Officers were then alerted to a break-in at St John the Baptist School in Whitehawk Hill Road, Brighton, around 10am on Sunday (July 26). Officers attended and arrested a man at the scene.

Kamil Nawrot, 35, unemployed, of no fixed address, was charged with two counts of burglary other than dwelling with intent to steal.

He appeared at Brighton Magistrates' Court on Monday (July 27) and was remanded in custody to appear before Lewes Crown Court on August 24.
