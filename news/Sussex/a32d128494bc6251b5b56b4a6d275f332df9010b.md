Police are appealing for information following the burglary of a construction site in Ditchling.

The incident happened in Lewes Road overnight between Sunday (15 November) evening and Monday (16 November) morning. A vehicle was seen to approach the site between 8pm and 10pm on Sunday.

Items such as construction tools including screw guns, nail guns, a petrol grinder and a laser box were taken.

An unknown man was seen to approach the property about 9am on Friday (13 November) before it was burgled. His presence was queried by a neighbour before he returned to a van.

Police are keen to identify and speak to the man pictured to ascertain whether he had any involvement.

PC James Goff: "This incident has had serious financial implications for the victim who has lost valuable equipment worth in the region of Â£5,000.

"It has also resulted in a delay to the construction schedule.

"We are appealing to anyone who can identify this man, or witnessed anything suspicious, or has noticed anyone with new equipment that they can't account for, to come forward.

"If you have information please report it to us online or by calling 101, quoting 47200197054."
