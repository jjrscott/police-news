A woman has been sent to prison for robbing a local man who tried to help by allowing her to ride to locations in Hastings town centre on his mobility scooter.

Tara Perry, 33, of Priory Road, Hastings, was given a six year, three month prison sentence when she appeared at Lewes Crown Court on Friday 15 January, having pleaded guilty to robbing the 57-year-old man of Â£380 in cash after forcing him off his scooter in Waldegrave Street, Hastings, on 10 August last year.

Two years of the sentence will be served on licence.

Perry had first approached the man in Church Road, and he agreed to give her a lift to what he thought was an appointment at Warrior Square railway station. But this then turned into an appointment at the police station, then back to Warrior Square and then to Probation offices, before ending up in Waldegrave Street where she suddenly demanded money, threw him off his scooter and stole the cash from him before making off.

Detective Constable Natalie Brill of Hastings CID said; "This was a despicable crime. Perry took advantage of a friendly helpful man who, although with his own issues, was always trusting and keen to help others.

"On the way home his battery died and he had to be pushed home by two young lads, a journey of some hour and a half, arriving home after midnight.

"He had bruising to his leg and body and the money he had taken out to pay some bills and to help his family."
