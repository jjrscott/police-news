Police investigating the assault of a doctor and police officer in Brighton have charged a man.

About 10.30pm on Wednesday (20 January), police were called to the Royal Sussex County hospital to a report that a man had punched an A & E doctor to the floor.

While being arrested, the suspect spat directly in the face of a police officer and was further arrested for assaulting an emergency worker.

Harry Bedford, 20, of Pelham Street, Brighton, was charged with three counts of assaulting an emergency worker and possession of a Class B drug.

He has been remanded to appear at Brighton Magistrates' Court on Friday (22 January).
