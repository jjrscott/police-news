Police are investigating a serious assault on an elderly man in a park in East Grinstead.

The 81-year-old man was walking his dog in Brooklands Park around 5.10pm on Thursday 6 August when he was struck to the back of the head, causing him to fall into a stream.

Thankfully, he was able to get to his feet and was taken to hospital for treatment.

Anyone with any information about the incident is urged to report it online or call 101, quoting Operation Coach.

Police are particularly keen to identify another man who was in the park at the time, who may hold vital information about the attack. He is described as being in his 20s or 30s, about 5'10", with olive skin, dark hair and a small beard. He wore all dark clothing and was carrying a blue rucksack.

Detective Inspector Cheryl Lewendon said: "This was a violent and seemingly unprovoked attack on an elderly man, who remains in hospital at this time. Thankfully he is ok, however he has been left understandably shaken by this incident.

"The motive for the attack remains unclear at this stage, and our enquiries are ongoing to establish exactly what happened and why.

"I am aware another elderly man was attacked and robbed in East Court on 23 July, and while there is no information to suggest they are linked, I'd like to reassure the community we are doing all we can to investigate these two incidents."
