Can you identify this woman?

Police want to interview her about at least two incidents in East Sussex in which mobile phones have been stolen from shop staff.

And officers believe she may also have been involved in similar recent thefts elsewhere in the county and in Kent.

On 6 October two phones were stolen, from staff at the Dapper M shop in Battle High Street, and at the Bridal Shop in Queens Road, Hastings, while a woman distracted staff with enquiries.

This woman was seen on both occasions.

She is described as of Indian appearance, 5'4", slim, with long black hair, and had a bag or similar object round her waist causing her to appear pregnant.

Investigators think this image and description, even with facial covering, together with the circumstances, will enable someone to recognise her.

If you can help, please contact the police either online or by calling 101, quoting serial 789 of 06/10.
