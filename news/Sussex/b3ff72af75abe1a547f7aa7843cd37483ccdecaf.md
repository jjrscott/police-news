Police are appealing for witnesses after a young man reportedly exposed himself in an Eastbourne park.

Officers were called to Shinewater Park around 2pm on Sunday (July 12) after a young man was seen exposing his genitals.

When confronted by a woman in the park, the man covered up and moved back into some bushes. Police attended the scene but were unable to find the suspect.

He is described as white, in his teens and dressed all in dark clothing with his hood up.

There were a lot of people in park at the time, and officers are keen to hear from anyone who saw the man, or who witnessed any suspicious behaviour in the area.

Anyone with information should contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 811 of 12/07.
