Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was robbed in St Leonards.

The victim was walking a dog in St Leonards Gardens around 7.30am on Tuesday (January 12) when she stopped on a bench and was approached by an unknown man.

He asked her for a lighter for a cigarette before commenting on her handbag. Moments later, he grabbed hold of the bag and attempted to pull it from the victim's grasp.

As the victim struggled to keep hold of her bag, she felt a searing pain on her left ear. She turned around and saw a second man standing behind her holding what looked like a pair of pliers.

The victim was punched to the face before both men fled the scene with her bag. She was left with a substantial injury to her ear requiring 13 stitches, as well as a cut to her upper lip.

The suspects are both described as white men, around 19 years old and around 5' 8". One had a blue face mask on and was wearing a hooded dark blue plastic sports jacket with the hood up, and black jeans. The second suspect was wearing a dark coloured sports jacket and blue jeans.

Anyone who saw what happened, or who may have any other information, is asked to contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 264 of 12/01. Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
