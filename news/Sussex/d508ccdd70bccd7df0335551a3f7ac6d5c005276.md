The family of a young man who sadly died after being involved in a collision at Broad Oak near Heathfield on Sunday (20 September) have paid tribute to him.

Jonathan Gore, 22, known as Jay, from Broad Oak, was walking along the A265 road between Broad Oak and Burwash in the early hours when he was in collision with a car. He tragically died at the scene.

His family have described Jay as a gentle and kind young man with a generous heart. He had a pure love for life. He was supportive and loyal to all his family and friends. His smile, personality and humour filled the lives of everyone he knew with love and happiness.

Officers are continuing an investigation into the collision and anyone with information including dash cam or CCTV footage in the area are asked to come forward. Email ‪collision.appeal@sussex.pnn.police.uk‬ quoting Operation Dawn.
