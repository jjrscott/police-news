Police have released this E-fit image of a suspect sought in connection with an aggravated burglary in Newton Avenue, East Grinstead.

About 9.30pm on Saturday 6 March, a man answered his door to an unknown man who then brandished a knife. He demanded valuables from the victim, who handed over a small quantity of cash and tobacco.

Following this, the suspect left the premises and turned right towards Lister Avenue.

He is described as white with a slightly tanned complexion, aged 17-20, about 6'1" and of skinny build. He had brown hair with a wavy fringe and spoke with a local accent.

If you recognise the man in this image, or if you saw what happened - or captured anything on dash cam, CCTV or doorbell footage - please report it online or call 101, quoting serial 64 of 07/03.
