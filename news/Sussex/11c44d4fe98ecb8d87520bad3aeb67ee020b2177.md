A man charged with the attempted murder of a police officer in Crawley has been further remanded in custody.

Police were called to West Green Drive around 9.35am on Thursday December 17 following concerns for a man in possession of a knife.

When challenged by police, the suspect allegedly attempted to stab an officer - who was wearing a protective vest - in the chest, before he was safely detained. During this time, the same officer suffered a minor laceration to his hand and was treated at the scene.

Jack Chao, 37, a solicitor, of West Green Drive, Crawley, was subsequently charged with attempted murder and remanded in custody.

He appeared before Brighton Magistrates' Court on Saturday December 19, where he was further remanded ahead of a plea and trial preparation hearing on 18 January 2021.

Chief Inspector Shane Baker, district commander for Crawley and Mid Sussex, said: "Our police officers demonstrate great courage by putting themselves in harm's way to protect the public each and every day.

"Thankfully the officer in this case is recovering well, and has received plenty of messages of support from his colleagues."
