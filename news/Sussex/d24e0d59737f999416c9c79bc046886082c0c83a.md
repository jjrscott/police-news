A man and a woman have appeared in court after being charged by Sussex Police with drugs supply in West Sussex, following an investigation by police in West Sussex and London.

Humberto Neves and Annabel Dalus, both 25, unemployed, and of Leyton, East London, appeared in custody at Crawley Magistrates Court on Tuesday 20 October, charged with being concerned in the supply of heroin and crack cocaine in the Chichester area.

They were remanded in custody to appear at Portsmouth Crown Court on 17 November.

After working with Sussex Police for some months Metropolitan Police officers had executed a warrant on the previous day at their address and arrested the pair. Items including drugs and cash were seized.

The investigation is part of ongoing combined work between Sussex Police and the Metropolitan Police under Operation Orochi, which targets suspected drugs dealers based in London, with the aim of systematically dismantling their drugs 'lines' they operate running into Sussex.
