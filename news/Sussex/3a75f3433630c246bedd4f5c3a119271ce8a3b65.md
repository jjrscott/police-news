Police are appealing for witnesses who may have seen a domestic incident between a man and woman near the Golden Sands Caravan Park in Brighton Road, Lancing to come forward.

Officers were called on Monday 25 January at about 6.30pm to a report of a domestic incident near the site. There were concerns about the threatening behaviour of the man towards the woman after they were seen getting out of their vehicle.

The couple were driving a large white car which had significant dents across the back and nearside as well as possible dents on the bonnet. The woman is white, about five-months pregnant with dark hair. The man is described as olive skinned, with brown hair, stubble and wearing a nose ring.

PC David Hedgecock said: "There were concerns about the behaviour of the man towards the woman after they were seen getting out of their vehicle. We are asking for anyone who witnessed this incident or who recognises the descriptions of those involved to get in touch with us."

If you can help our investigation, report online or ring 101 quoting serial 1065 of 25/01.
