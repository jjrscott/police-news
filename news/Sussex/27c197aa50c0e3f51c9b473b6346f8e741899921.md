Police are appealing for witnesses after an elderly man was robbed in the East Court area of East Grinstead just before 5pm on Thursday 23 July.

The victim, an 80-year-old local man, had been walking on a path close to the ambulance station when he was approached by two men.

He was hit by a piece of wood and had his wallet stolen, which contained bank cards.

The victim has been taken to East Surrey Hospital in Redhill.

At this time there is no further information and no description of the suspects involved, however police are urging anyone with any information about the incident to report it online or call 101, quoting serial 1078 of 23/07.
