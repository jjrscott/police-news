A man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder in Burgess Hill.

A verbal altercation between two men occurred in Wyvern Way around 12.15pm on Monday (24 August).

One of the men then got into his vehicle and drove his car at the other man, colliding with him before colliding into a road sign. The suspect got out of his vehicle and punched the man in the face before fleeing from the scene.

The victim, a man in his 40s, suffered multiple serious injuries and has been taken to hospital for treatment.

Shortly afterwards, officers located the suspected nearby and he was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. He remains in custody at this time.

Investigating officer Detective Inspector Colin Garman said: "The victim has sustained multiple and has been left, understandably, shaken by the incident.

"We are aware of the video circulating on social media and we would ask you not to share this on your own pages or profiles as this may jeopardise any future court proceedings. It could also cause further distress to the victim and his family, at what is already stressful and emotional time.

"Anyone who witnessed the incident or has information to assist our investigation is asked to report it to us either online or call 101 quoting Operation Burwell."
