Sussex Police have renewed their appeal to identify a suspect of an armed robbery.

At 6.27am on Friday, 15 May, a man walked into the Tesco Express store in Upper Shoreham Road, Shoreham. He threatened staff with a silver handgun and stole a quantity of cash before running out of the store and down Eastern Avenue.

Police have released an image of the suspect after he left the store and are seeking his identity.

If you recognise this man or have information to assist the police investigation please report it either online or call 101 quoting Operation Stafford.

Two men, aged 30 and 38, from Shoreham, were both arrested on suspicion of robbery and have been released under investigation while enquiries are ongoing.
