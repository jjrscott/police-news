Sussex Police Chief Constable Jo Shiner is looking for new postcard designs to use when writing to children and young people, and is inviting Sussex's under 18s to come up with the designs.

As well as having their design printed on a postcard, the three winners will be invited to join Sussex Police teams for a range of experiences including meeting a police dog, seeing an equipment demonstration and even tea and cakes with the Chief.

Across three age categories - up to 10, 11-14 and 15-18 - entrants have until Monday 30 November are invited to use their creative skills, from painting to photography, drawing to collage, to come up with a winning design, which can be inspired by the Sussex Police priorities:

 1. Protecting our Communities (keeping you safe)
 2. Catching Criminals
 3. Delivering an outstanding service.

Jo Shiner said: "It gives me great pleasure to launch this competition for children and young people across Sussex. It has been a challenging year for everyone and this is a chance to have some fun and be creative. I am really excited to see your ideas and designs. I hope it will be a welcome activity that you can safely do at home and I look forward to meeting the winners. "

Winners will be chosen by a panel of young people and independent judges. Their prize will be organised in line with timescales permitted under Covid-19 restrictions for safety reasons. Runners up will also have their work displayed in police stations across Sussex in early 2021.
