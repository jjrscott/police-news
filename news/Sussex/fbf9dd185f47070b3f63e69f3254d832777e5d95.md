We would like to clarify our stance in relation to a statement issued yesterday about vigils being planned this weekend in memory of Sarah Everard.

What happened to Sarah is shocking and heart breaking and we understand the strength of emotion around this. While the circumstances surrounding her death are incredibly rare, we acknowledge many women have experienced violence, abuse or harassment and this is not acceptable. Everyone should feel safe to walk our streets and we hear that many of you do not _._

Protecting our communities is a top priority for Sussex Police, and we will do what it takes to ensure you feel safe in the county where you live _._

We also recognise the desire to come together at this time, to mourn, show respect and make a statement on the issue of women's safety. We absolutely recognise the importance of this message and while we would normally facilitate such events, we remain firmly in a public health emergency and the Covid-19 regulations continue to disallow large gatherings because of the continued, and very real, risks of the spread of the virus. There can be no exceptions to this and we will continue to police as we have done throughout the pandemic - engaging, explaining and encouraging compliance with the regulations; enforcing where it is proportionate and necessary to do so.

For those considering organising or attending a public vigil this weekend, we ask and encourage you to seek alternative ways to remember Sarah in accordance with these regulations.
