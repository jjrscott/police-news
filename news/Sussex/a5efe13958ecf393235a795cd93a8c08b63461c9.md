Police teams tackling knife crime and serious violence executed a warrant at an address in Crowborough on Wednesday (30 September) and seized a large quantity of weapons after receiving information from the UK Border Force.

The items included knives, crowbars, crossbows, tasers, knuckle dusters, perfume sprays thought to contain incapacitating substances, catapults and daggers. Officers also seized a small quantity of Class A drugs and the suspect's electronic devices for analysis.

The suspect - a 65-year-old man - was arrested on suspicion of importing prohibited weapons, possession of a Class A drug and possession of a weapon for the discharge of a noxious substance. He has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Inspector Howard Nevill said: "Our priority is removing harmful items from our communities and keeping people safe.

"Possessing offensive weapons is incredibly dangerous and puts you and those around you at an increased risk of harm. We continue to remind members of the public that we have amnesty bins at police stations across the region where knives and other items can be safely disposed of."

"Rest assured that a full investigation is underway following this warrant and we are working to establish the full circumstances.

"Let me be clear that we will work tirelessly to keep our communities safe and will relentlessly pursue those we suspect to be involved in criminality.

"Anyone with information is asked to make the right call and get in touch by reporting online or calling 101."
