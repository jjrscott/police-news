Two men have been charged with burglary offences in Hastings.

Police received a report of an attempted burglary at a house in Priory Road, Hastings, some time between the morning of Tuesday 7 July and the afternoon of Wednesday 8 July.

Fortunately, entry was not gained and nothing was taken, but some damage was caused to the property.

Two men were arrested on suspicion of attempted burglary with intent to steal. Lee Woods, 26, unemployed, of Priory Road, Hastings, was later charged with the offence.

A 32-year-old man from Hastings was released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Woods has also been charged in relation to a burglary at a residential property in Sinnock Square, Hastings, on Thursday 9 July.

The break-in happened between 10.30am and 2pm that day, and saw two laptop computers and a quantity of cash stolen from the address.

Woods was arrested and charged with burglary with intent to steal.

A second man - Joseph Nelson, 21, unemployed, of Tonbridge Road, Maidstone - has also been charged with burglary with intent to steal in relation to the incident.

Both men have been remanded in custody to appear in court on Monday (July 20).
