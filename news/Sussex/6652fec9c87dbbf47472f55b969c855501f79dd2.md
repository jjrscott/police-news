Police are appealing for witnesses following a serious injury collision in Mayfield.

Around 4.50pm on Thursday 23 July, a red Ducati motorcycle travelling south on the A267 collided with an elderly pedestrian who was pushing a pedal cycle.

The pedestrian - an 81-year-old man from Alfriston - suffered life threatening injuries and was flown to Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton by air ambulance.

The motorcyclist - a 53-year-old local man - sustained a serious foot injury and was taken to Tunbridge Wells Hospital in Pembury for treatment.

Anyone who witnessed the collision, or saw the motorcyclist or pedestrian in the area beforehand - particularly anyone with dash cam footage - is asked to email collision.appeal@sussex.pnn.police.uk quoting Operation Denstone.
