Two men have been arrested and charged with burglary after a break in at the Curry's PC World store in Hove on Monday (3 August).

Police were called to the store at 4am in Old Shoreham Road after staff discovered intruders had broken into the building at the rear and had forced open a safe. Nothing had been stolen.

Officers later stopped two men in a vehicle on the A23 at Brighton and arrested them on suspicion of burglary.

Aurelian Gheorghe, 41, of no fixed address and Andrei Metea, 22, of Winchester Avenue, London, appeared at Brighton Magistrates' Court on Tuesday (4 August) charged with burglary with intent to steal.

They pleaded not guilty and were remanded in custody to appear at Lewes Crown Court for trial on 1 September.
