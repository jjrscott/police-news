Neighbourhood Policing Teams (NPT) carried out a day of action in Brighton and Hove on Tuesday (2 March) to engage with members of the public and encourage people to report any ongoing issues or concerns.

Officers completed letter drops in the Kemptown and Queens Park area, engaged with residents and requested they make contact with their NPT if there are any ongoing issues they wish to report. Address checks for individuals were carried out and officers conducted high visibility patrols in areas such as Stoneham Park and Preston Park, where anti-social behaviour has recently been reported.

Chief Inspector Nick Dias said: "This was some great work by our NPT. Ensuring the public know we are here to respond to their concerns is an essential part of policing.

"This was a fantastic day for our officers to get out and engage with the public and we had an incredibly positive response from local communities.

"Every day our officers are out in uniform and plain clothes carrying out patrols to prevent crime and anti-social behaviour.

"We are here to listen and respond to issues in your area - if you have information or concerns then we want to know about it. Please make the right call and report it to us online or by calling 101."
