Sussex Police has thanked members of the local community for their patience and support leading to peaceful protests involving more than 10,000 in Brighton on Saturday (13 June).

Assistant Chief Constable Dave Miller was the most senior police officer, known as the Gold Commander, for the planned Black Lives Matter event in Brighton and elsewhere across Surrey and Sussex, including smaller protest events in Eastbourne and Chichester.

He said: "We estimate the protest in Brighton was attended by more than 10,000 people and it was largely peaceful. While the volume of people and traffic did cause some disruption to routes into the city, and in the centre itself, this allowed the event to take place safely, which meant we could then open the roads up as soon as possible.

"We would like to say thank you to the participants and organisers, and also those who weren't involved in the protest, but who may have been held up for a while, for their patience and support.

"The right to lawful protest is a key part of any democracy, which UK police uphold and facilitate, and our over-riding aim is to protect and keep people safe, especially in light of current restrictions in place to minimise the spread of coronavirus."
