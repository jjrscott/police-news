A man convicted of nine offences, including criminal damage, assault and stalking, has been jailed for 42 weeks, following an investigation by Sussex Police.

Glenn Waters, 34, of no fixed address, failed to appear in court on 12 November, and was wanted by police. He was located and arrested on the A27 near Emsworth on Tuesday, 24 November.

At Brighton Magistrates' Court on Monday 30 November, Waters pleaded guilty to five counts of criminal damage in Shoreham by Sea between 15 and 16 October, two counts of stalking involving fear of violence on 27 September and 16 October, and one count of theft from a motorcycle on 16 October. He was also convicted of one count of assault in Hove on 24 January 2019 for which he had failed to appear at court on 12 November this year.

Detective Sergeant Stuart McAdams of West Sussex Safeguarding Investigations Unit said: "Glenn Waters is no stranger to us, having been convicted of a number of other offences in the past few years.

"This outcome was the result of a big team effort across the force in West Sussex, including CID, response officers and our intel team as well as the Safeguarding Investigations Unit. The collaborative working resulted in the arrest of the offender and ensured he was brought to justice."
