Do you recognise this bike?

At 5.10 pm on Tuesday 16 March a motor cycle and a pedal cycle collided on the Roundstone-By-Pass (A259) roundabout at junction with Old Worthing Road, Angmering,

The motorcycle made off along Worthing Road, with both the rider and a pillion passenger.

The 56-year old man riding the cycle sustained deep cuts, bruising, and a broken bone in his hand.

Collision Investigator Connor Smith said; "We want to identify the motorcycle and the two people on it, and ask them both to come forward.

"We would also like to hear from anyone who saw what happened or can help us trace the bike and those two people.

"Please contact us online or by calling us on 101, quoting serial 1041 of 16/03."
