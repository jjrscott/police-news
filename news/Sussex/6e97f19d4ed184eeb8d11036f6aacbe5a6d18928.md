Police investigating an assault in Horsham have arrested a suspect.

Officers were called to a report of an altercation in Horsham Park, near to the Pavilions car park at 8.45pm on Tuesday (30 March).

The victim - an 19-year-old man - suffered a stab injury and was taken to hospital for treatment. His injury is serious, but not life-threatening.

A 21-year-old man from Crawley was swiftly arrested on suspicion of wounding with intent and remains in custody for questioning.

Chief Inspector Sarah Leadbeatter said: "This is being treated as an isolated incident and we work closely with partners including Horsham District Council to tackle and prevent youth-related violence.

"We understand the impact events such as these have on local communities. Officers regularly carry out proactive patrols in Horsham Park and the surrounding area, and residents can expect to see an increased high-visibility police presence in the coming days.

"The park was still relatively busy at this time of the evening. Our officers have already spoken to a number of witnesses and are appealing to anyone who saw what happened to make the right call and come forwards."

Anyone with information - including relevant mobile phone, CCTV or dash-cam footage - that may assist with enquiries is urged to report it to us online or by calling 101, quoting Operation Patio.

Alternatively, you can report information anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
