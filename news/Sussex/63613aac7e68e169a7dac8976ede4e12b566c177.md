Police are searching for a man who robbed an Arundel shop.

At 9.55pm on Monday 23 November the man entered the Co-operative in Queen Street, Arundel, threatened staff with what appeared to be a handgun, and stole about Â£4000 in cash. There were no shots or injuries reported.

The suspect was described as in his 30s, wearing a black mask, a hat, coat and purple or black trainers.

Police would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident or noticed a man matching this description in the area at this time. It is believed a woman may have entered the shop during the incident and police are urging this person to make contact with them.

Officers will be conducting high visibility patrols in the area and the search for the suspect continues.
