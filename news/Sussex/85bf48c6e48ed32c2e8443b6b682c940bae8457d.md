Police are appealing for witnesses after a teenager was tragically killed in a single vehicle collision in Southwater this afternoon (Saturday 30 January).

The incident involving a white Fiat 500 occurred on the B2237 Worthing Road about 12.30pm.

The sole occupant - an 18-year-old local woman - was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

Police are urging anyone who saw the Fiat being driven in the area immediately before the collision - or anyone who may have captured what happened on dash cam - to email collision.appeal@sussex.pnn.police.uk quoting Operation Sunningdale.

The B2237 Worthing Road is likely to remain closed between the junctions of the A24 and Salisbury Road for some time, and motorists are advised to seek alternatives routes.
