Police would like to speak to this man in the CCTV image in connection with the theft of thousands of pounds worth of beauty products from a store in Burgess Hill.

A man went into Boots store in The Martlets on Sunday (26 July) at about 2.10pm and stole Â£2,334 worth of Olay beauty products from the shelf and put them in a white and red bag. He then left the shopping centre walking through the WH Smith store and into Church Road.

The suspect is white, aged in his late 20s to early 30s with black hair. He was wearing a navy shirt with a grey body warmer, light blue jeans and black trainers with a white line around them.

Inspector Darren Taylor said: "We are keen to identify this individual in connection with bulk thefts of make-up and skin products from stores around Mid Sussex. If you recognise this person please let us know."

If you can help with the investigation, report online or ring 101 quoting serial 955 of 27/07.
