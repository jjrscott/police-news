A man who burgled the homes of elderly residents in East Grinstead has been jailed.

Jack Heslip, 20, of Woodlands Road, East Grinstead, was sentenced to 40 months custody after he pleaded guilty to six counts of burglary, one charge of attempted burglary and two counts of possession of cannabis when he appeared at Lewes Crown Court on Wednesday (6 January).

The court heard that Heslip burgled homes in the areas of Sandy Lane, Holtye Road, Quarry Rise, Copse Close, Lewes Road in the town last August and September. On most occasions, the residents were at either at home or in their gardens when he broke in. Sometime he was disturbed by the occupants. He stole cash and food and drink.

Detective Inspector Cheryl Lewendon said: "Heslip carried out a spree of opportunist burglaries at the homes of elderly vulnerable residents and stole from them. He has breached court orders in the past and we are pleased that the courts have recognised his criminal behaviour and given him a custodial sentence."
