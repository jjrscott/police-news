Jack Jones, 25, of no fixed abode, has been sentenced to 18 weeks imprisonment after being convicted of burglary.

Jones was arrested after he stole a staff members' purse from a staff area at The Travelodge, Chichester, on Tuesday, 9 March 2021. Jones had been staying there at the time of the burglary.

He pled guilty at court on Thursday, 11 March 2021 and was sentenced to 18 weeks imprisonment, ordered to pay £10 compensation and £85 costs.

This offence meant that a suspended sentence order of 15 weeks relating to another burglary in February 2020 was triggered. Jones will serve both sentences concurrently.
