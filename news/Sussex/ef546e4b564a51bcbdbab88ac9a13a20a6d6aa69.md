Police are seeking the identity of the man in the CCTV footage in relation to an armed robbery in Arundel.

At 9.55pm on Monday, 23 November the man entered the Co-op in Queen Street, Arundel, and threatened staff with what appeared to be a handgun, and left with a large quantity of cash. There were no shots fired and nobody was injured.

Investigating officer Detective Inspector Pauline Lane said: "We would like to speak to anyone who recognises the man in the footage or witnessed a man matching the description acting suspiciously at the time of the incident.

"Those working in the shop were, understandably, shocked and we are determined to bring the suspect to justice.

"We would like to speak to a woman seen entering the shop at the time of the incident. Was this you? If so, we urge you to make contact with us to assist us in our investigation.

"We understand matters like this will cause alarm in our communities and this is why we will be continuing with our high visibility presence in the area. We are working hard to locate the perpetrator for this incident and to bring him to justice.

"Please get in contact with us with any information you believe could help our investigation."

The suspect is described as a white man, around 5' 8", of medium build and aged between 20 and 40-years-old and he walks with a limp.

Anyone who saw what happened or who has any other information can contact Sussex Police online or by calling 101, quoting Operation Launch.
