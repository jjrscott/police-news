Following a Sussex Police investigation, a man has been charged with a series of sexual offences against a woman in Hove after images were found on an electronic device.

The offences are suspected to have taken place over a two year period from around June 2019.

The victim, aged 18, is receiving support from specially trained officers.

Daniel Curtis, 38, of Goldstone Way, Hove has been charged with three counts of rape, seven counts of sexual assault by touching and one count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without their consent.

He appeared before Brighton Magistrates' Court on Saturday (16 January) and has been remanded to appear at Lewes Crown Court on 15 February.
