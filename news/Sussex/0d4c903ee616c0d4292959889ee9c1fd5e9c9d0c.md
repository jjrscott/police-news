Police in Lewes are appealing for information and CCTV footage following reports of vehicle break-ins in the town.

Witnesses reported seeing two or three people, aged between 15-20 years old, trying car door handles and entering unattended cars on the Nevill and Ousedale estates on 13 January 2021.

Anyone who saw any suspicious activity in Caburn Crescent, Ousedale Close or Mildmay Road between midnight and 8am on 13 January is urged to get in touch with police.

Neighbourhood officers would also like to hear from anyone who believes their vehicle has been interfered with or who has witnessed similar activity on or around that date.

The suspects are described as two, or sometimes three, white males, wearing light coloured puffer jackets, tracksuit bottoms and trainers.

PC Marcus Knight from Lewes Neighbourhood Policing Team said: "If you have CCTV, Ring doorbell or any other similar system, please check for any suspicious activity during that time period on 13 January.

"We'd also like to hear from anyone who believes their vehicle has recently been interfered with or entered.

"No information given is ignored; we will use it to develop the bigger picture and, when the time is right, we will take action.

"We are also taking this opportunity to remind residents to keep all vehicles secure and to remove any valuables."

To get in contact, please report online or call 101, quoting serial 471 of 18/01.

If a crime is happening at the time, please call 999.

You can also report crime anonymously to Crimestoppers on freephone 0800 555 111 or online at www.crimestoppers-uk.org
