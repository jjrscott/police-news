Police investigating two separate reports of a man carrying a knife in East Grinstead have released an e-fit image of the suspect.

Around 6pm on Saturday 26 December, two boys - who are unknown to each other - were approached by a man while on opposite sides of Blackwell Farm Road.

The suspect reportedly showed the boys a knife, which was hidden under his clothing, and implied that he was looking to commit a robbery.

They were both able to run off to a place of safety and while shaken, were both unharmed and neither had anything taken from them.

The suspect is described as white, 18 to 20 years old, 5' 7" - 5' 9", slightly overweight and with short, light brown hair. He spoke with a local accent and was wearing a dark grey tracksuit top and bottoms with a black puffer style body warmer on top.

Anyone who recognises the man in the e-fit image or who may have any other information which could assist the investigation, including CCTV or doorbell camera footage, is asked to report it online or by calling 101 quoting serial 917 of 26/12.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
