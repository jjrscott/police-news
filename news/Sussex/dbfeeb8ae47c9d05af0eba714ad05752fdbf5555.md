Police are urgently seeking the driver of a blue car who may have valuable information about a serious injury collision in Runcton near Chichester.

Emergency services went to the B2166 Lagness Road at Runcton near Chichester at 6.40am on Friday 19 March after a northbound motorcyclist and a southbound Fiesta saloon had collided. The 29-year-old man on the motorcycle sustained serious injuries and was taken by road ambulance to the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton.

Sergeant Richard Hobbs of the Surrey and Sussex Road Policing Unit said; "We are urgently seeking the driver of a small blue car who we understand was driving north, in the same direction as the motorcyclist, and who may be a vital witness.

"If that was you, or if you know who it is, or if you have any other information about what happened, please contact us by calling 101 or on collision.appeal@sussex.pnn.police.uk, quoting Operation Season.

"The B2166 was closed for the incident to be safely responded to and fully investigated, with diversions in place, but it is hoped to re-open it by the afternoon rush hour. Drivers are thanked for their patience and understanding."
