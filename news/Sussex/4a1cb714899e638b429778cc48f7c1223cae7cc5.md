A Police Constable has been praised for her response to a violent incident which led to the arrest of a man in Uckfield.

PC Claire Harrison, of the Surrey and Sussex Police Dog Unit, was called to a report of a disturbance within a flat in Grange Road, Uckfield, about 6.35pm on 23 October.

A woman ran out of the address in a distressed state, followed moments later by a man who was displaying aggressive behaviour.

Concerned for the safety of herself and all other parties, PC Harrison drew her Taser and red-dotted the man, warning him to stop.

But his aggressive demeanour continued and he was subsequently Tasered due to the threat level posed, and to prevent injury.

Robert McPhee, 35, unemployed, of Grange Road, Uckfield, was arrested and charged with assault by beating.

He is scheduled to stand trial at Brighton Magistrates' Court on 8 December.

Sergeant Matt Songhurst, of the Surrey and Sussex Police Dog Unit, said: "PC Harrison acted with courage and professionalism throughout this incident. She protected a vulnerable victim and supported divisional officers in their response, which led to the swift arrest of the suspect.

"She remained calm despite the threat of violence, and her actions are an excellent reflection on the Dog Unit and Sussex Police as a whole.

"This demonstrates how our frontline officers are multi-skilled and trained to respond to a variety of incidents according to the circumstances."
