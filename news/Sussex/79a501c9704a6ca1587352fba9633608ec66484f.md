A man has sadly died following a collision on the A24 near Southwater.

Police were called at 1.25pm on Sunday (6 December) to reports of a Lexus crashing into a tree.

Officers, ambulance and fire crews attended and a 24-year-old man - the passenger from the Lexus - was sadly pronounced dead at the scene. The driver was taken to hospital with serious injuries which are not thought to be life-threatening.

The road was closed in both directions between Southwater and Hop Oast roundabout.

Two men \- aged 19 and 28 - were arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and have been taken to custody for questioning.

Police are appealing to anyone who witnessed the Lexus or a white Toyota being driven prior to the collision, or who has any dash-cam footage that could assist with enquiries.

Anyone with information is asked to report online or call 101, quoting Operation Hampstead.
