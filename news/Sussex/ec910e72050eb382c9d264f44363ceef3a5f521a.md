Police in Crawley are investigating two house burglaries which happened within about an hour of each other.

At about midday on Thursday (24 September) the houses in Arden Road and nearby Sylvan Road were broken into and jewellery was stolen.

Investigator Natasha Smith said; "The houses are about eight minutes walk from each other and the burglaries happened barely an hour apart.

"We are asking anyone who was in the area at the time and who may have seen or heard some suspicious or unusual activity to contact us either online or by calling 101, quoting serial 688 of 24/09."
