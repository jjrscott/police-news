Local police, working with partners, have secured the partial closure of an address in Sompting for three months to help reduce anti-social behaviour in the area.

The Order, under the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014, was granted at Brighton Magistrates Court for the flat in Millfield, Sompting, on Tuesday 22 September, on the basis of clear evidence that regular local anti-social behaviour and drug taking was due to individuals taking advantage of the vulnerable resident.

The Order restricts access to the flat to the resident and agencies involved with his care and support. Breach of the Order can result on conviction in up to six months imprisonment or a fine.

A large number of reports had been made by local residents over the past several months about drug use at the property, and about anti-social behaviour coming from the address which spilled into the communal hallway and elsewhere. On several occasions individuals who were wanted by the police were found at the address.

PCSO Katie Trevis said; "A lot of partner agency working has made this possible, with Adur Homes and Adur & Worthing Council who have worked tirelessly to help get the Order in place. We hope this will result in problems being reduced at the address and in the surrounding area, and that the resident will be able to regain control of his property and his life."
