Two men have been arrested after police executed a warrant at a business in Eastbourne.

Officers attended a gym in the Hampden Park area on Thursday (February 4) after receiving reports it was continuing to operate during the third national lockdown in breach of the government's Covid-19 regulations.

Police enquiries found the gym had applied for a government grant for businesses who had faced hardship caused by Covid-19, stating the business had been closed to customers from December 26, 2020.

A 30-year-old man and a 31-year-old man were both arrested by police on February 4 on suspicion of fraud by false representation. They remain in custody for questioning at this time.

Three other people present inside the gym at the time were also each issued with a Fixed Penalty Notice for being in breach of the government's Covid-19 regulations.

The warrant came after the gym had already been issued with a £1,000 fine and a £2,000 fine for breaches of the restrictions in November 2020 and January 2021 respectively.

Chief Inspector Di Lewis, district commander for Eastbourne, said: "This gym has continued to operate in two national lockdowns, showing a clear disregard for the government's Covid-19 restrictions.

"On the occasions police have attended to try and engage with the gym owner, officers have found people present inside the venue not social distancing and not wearing face coverings.

"The government's rules are there to help stop the spread of the virus, protect the NHS and save lives. Those who continue to ignore these regulations are risking bringing harm to our communities, and we will take enforcement action where necessary."
