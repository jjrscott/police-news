A man has been charged with kidnapping and sexually assaulting a teenage girl in East Sussex.

Police received a report from a member of the public of a teenage girl being followed by a man in a white vehicle in Gorselands, Bexhill around 12 midnight on Saturday (27 June). The girl was seen to get into the vehicle which drove away.

In the early hours of Sunday (28 June), officers tracked down the suspect vehicle at a property in Withyham Road, Bexhill and arrested a man.

The victim - a 14-year-old girl - was not at the property but later located safe at an address known to her.

It was reported that the victim was initially picked up in Hastings town centre and taken to a property in Bexhill where she was allegedly sexually assaulted before being driven close to an address she is familiar with.

Steve Perry, 64, retired, of Rothwell Drive, Solihull, West Midlands, was charged with false imprisonment, kidnapping with intent to commit a sexual offence and sexual assault.

He appeared in custody by videolink at Brighton Magistrates' Court on Monday (29 June) where he was further remanded in custody and sent for trial at Lewes Crown Court with an initial appearance on 27 July.
