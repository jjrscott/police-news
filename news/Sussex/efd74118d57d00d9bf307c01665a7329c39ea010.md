Sussex Police have arrested a man in connection with a robbery in Newhaven.

A woman was walking down the steps between Brighton Road and Hawthorn Rise, Newhaven, around 8.30pm on Sunday (10 May) when she was assaulted. Her mobile phone, purse, cash, bracelet and handbag were reported as stolen.

The woman, in her mid-30s, suffered multiple facial injuries before running away from the area. She has since been taken to the Royal Sussex County Hospital, in Brighton for treatment.

Detective Inspector Sophie McGarel said: "This is a fast paced investigation and an arrest of a man was made shortly after the robbery occurred.

"The victim has suffered serious facial injuries, including a potential broken jaw.

"Did you see what happened? We would like to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the robbery.

"We will be conducting high visibility patrols while the full circumstances are being investigated, but we believe this to be an isolated incident with no threat to the wider public."

A 19-year-old man has been arrested at a nearby property on suspicion of robbery. He remains in police custody while the investigation is ongoing.

Anyone who witnessed the robbery or believes they have information to assist our investigation should report it online or call 101 quoting reference 1335 of 10/05.
