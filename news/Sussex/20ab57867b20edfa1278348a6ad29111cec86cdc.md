Police are appealing for witnesses after a boy was robbed in Hastings.

Around 7pm on Friday (September 4), officers received a third party report of a 15-year-old boy being robbed near the fishing lake in Alexandra Park.

The boy was walking with a friend when he was approached by a man who presented a knife and demanded the boy hand over his possessions.

A small quantity of cash was taken. The victim was uninjured but very shaken by what happened.

The suspect is described as around 6' and wearing a black puffer jacket with the hood up, black jogging bottoms and a black balaclava covering his face.

Police are appealing for any witnesses, or anyone who saw any suspicious behaviour in the area at the time, to get in touch.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 1264 of 04/09.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
