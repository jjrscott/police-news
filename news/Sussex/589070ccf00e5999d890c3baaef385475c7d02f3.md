A boy has been arrested after police entered a property suspected of being involved in drugs supply.

Officers received a number of calls relating to suspicious behaviour at an address in Hedge Parsley Crescent, Stone Cross.

Enquiries led police to believe the property, which has a vulnerable occupant, was being taken over and used as a base for drug dealing.

Police attended the address on Wednesday morning (October 21) and entered due to concerns for the welfare of the property's occupant.

Officers found and seized a quantity of cash and suspected heroin from inside the address.

A 16-year-old boy who is not the property's tenant was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of a Class A drug. He has been released on conditional bail until November 18.

The investigation is ongoing, alongside steps to safeguard the property's vulnerable tenant.
