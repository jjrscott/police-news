Police are appealing for witnesses to reports of an altercation involving a group of youths, some of whom were seen to in possession of weapons in Crawley.

The incident happened in Gales Drive shortly before 5pm on Monday (13 July).
Officers quickly attended and arrested five teenagers aged 15, 16 and 17 and a 25-year-old man for offences including affray and possession of a bladed article in a public place. A knife and a bat were also found by police nearby. No injuries were reported.

Those arrested have all been questioned and released under investigation while enquiries are continuing.

A section 34 dispersal order has been extended in the Three Bridges area of Crawley for a further 48 hours until 3pm on 18 July in response to the incident. The order provides the police with power to disperse individuals behaving in an anti-social manner.

PC Sam Bate said: "We are keen to hear from anyone who witnessed the altercation or have any information about those involved.

"We appreciate the concern this behaviour from a minority of group of people is causing within the community and additional resources will be deployed to areas where groups are known to gather to deter such behaviour in the future."

Anyone who saw the altercation, or may have any other relevant information about the incident, is asked to report online or by calling 101 quoting serial 1044 of 13/07.
