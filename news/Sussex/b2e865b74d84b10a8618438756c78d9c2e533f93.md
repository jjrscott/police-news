Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward after two teenagers suffered serious injuries in an assault on a group in Arundel.

Around 1am on Wednesday (29 July) a group of 17 and 18-year-olds were in the woods near Swanbourne Lake, Arundel, when they were approached by three or four people wearing balaclavas. The group were assaulted with one teenage boy suffering a broken jaw and back injuries and a second teenage boy suffering a cheek injury and a burn injury on his leg. Four others suffered injuries which are not deemed to be serious.

West Sussex Superintendent Miles Ockwell said: "The level of injuries involved in this assault are abhorrent and the behaviour from the suspect group is completely unacceptable.

"The two boys who have suffered the most serious injuries were taken to hospital for medical treatment and have since been discharged. Support is being provided to them both and the other members of the group at this time.

"We believe there may be some young people who know who the suspects are and we are encouraging you to come forward.

"We are urging anyone who may have been in the area or witnessed the assault to make contact with us immediately. You can help our investigation and ensure the relevant action is taken against those involved."

Anyone with information about the incident is asked to report online or call 101 quoting serial 55 of 29/07.
