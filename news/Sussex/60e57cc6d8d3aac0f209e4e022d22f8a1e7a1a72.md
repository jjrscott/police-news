A man has been arrested following a violent incident at a house in Eastbourne in which a woman and her son were assaulted.

At 8.30pm on Thursday 4 March, the woman in her forties answered a call at the door at her address in Foxglove Road, Eastbourne, and three men, one in possession of a knife, forced their way past her and began to search the property. Suddenly they abandoned their search and ran off, taking the boy's mobile phone.

A 29-year-old man was arrested in a nearby street shortly afterwards, on suspicion of robbery, and is currently in custody for interview and further enquiries. An investigation is continuing to trace the other men reported to have been involved.

The woman and her son sustained minor injuries and did not require hospital treatment.

Detective Sergeant Amanda Hover said; "This is an isolated incident for the area. Anyone who saw what happened or who has any other information is asked to contact us either online or by calling 101, quoting serial 1324 of 04/03."
