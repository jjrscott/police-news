Police investigating a number of calls that have made to a public telephone kiosk in Littlehampton High Street want to hear from anyone who may have spoken to the caller.

They are particularly keen to identify any teenagers that have answered the calls and maybe able to help with the investigation.

A man aged 51 has been arrested in connection with the investigation and remains in custody at this time.

Detective Sergeant Amanda Zinyama said: "We would really like to hear from any young people who know anything about this calls or have answered the phone to the caller. I want to emphasise that they haven't done anything wrong and they can speak to us in confidence."

If you can help or have any information which could assist with the investigation, report online or ring 101 quoting Operation Entire.
