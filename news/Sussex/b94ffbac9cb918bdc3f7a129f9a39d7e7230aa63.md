Police are investigating after a boy fell seriously ill in Crawley in the early hours of Friday morning (October 9).

Officers attended Byrd Road shortly before 00.30am after concerns were raised for the welfare of a 12-year-old boy who had collapsed.

The boy was taken to hospital in a serious condition. He remains in hospital in a stable condition.
