Sussex Police has arrested a man in Crawley following a police pursuit.

Officers responded to a call from a member of the public around 8,40am on Thursday (November 21) concerned for the driver of a vehicle near Copthorne Common, Crawley.

On arrival, the driver made off from the officers shortly after he collided with a stationary police car and he was pursued towards Church Road. The driver then decamped from a dark blue Audi convertible in Scallows Road, Crawley.

Shortly after this, officers received another phone call from a member of the public reporting a man acting suspiciously nearby.

Officers, assisted by the police helicopter, conducted an area search and a suspect was detained.

A 24-year-old man of no fixed address was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving, failing to stop and driving under the influence of drugs. He remains in custody and enquiries are ongoing.

If anyone believes they may have seen this car, witnessed the matter or has any dash cam footage you can report information online or call 101 quoting 262 of 21/11.
