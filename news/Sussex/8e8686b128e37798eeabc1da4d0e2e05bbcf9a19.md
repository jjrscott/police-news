Emergency services were called just after 2.30pm on Thursday (4 February) to reports of an overturned lorry on the slip road coming off of the A27 westbound carriageway on the Shoreham bypass.

The slip road has been closed, but the main A27 remains open at this time. We are asking drivers to avoid the area where possible as delays are likely.

 Members of the public assisted the driver of the lorry until emergency services arrived on scene. He was taken to hospital for treatment to his injuries.
