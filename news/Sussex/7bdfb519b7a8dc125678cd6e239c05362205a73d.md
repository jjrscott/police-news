Police are appealing for witnesses and urging residents to stay vigilant after a number of burglaries in and around Wadhurst.

Officers have received reports of three recent burglaries which they are treating as a linked series.

Two of the burglaries happened on Wednesday, November 25. In one incident, a property in Lower Platts, Ticehurst, was broken in to during the day and a silver Hyundai Tucson was taken from the driveway.

In the second incident, a property in Oxenbridge Lane, Etchingham, was broken into and a blue laptop was taken from inside.

Police received a third report of a burglary at a property in Broom Hill, Flimwell, on Monday (December 14). It happened between 12.30pm and 5.30pm, and saw electronic equipment and World War II memorabilia stolen from the address.

Officers investigating the burglaries are asking anyone with any information, particularly any relevant CCTV, doorbell or dash cam footage, to get in touch.

People can contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 1100 of 14/12. Alternatively, they can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Residents in the area are being urged to keep their properties secure, with all valuables hidden from view. Find more information on how to protect your property on the Sussex Police website.
