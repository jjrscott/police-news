A man has been convicted of burgling a business in St Leonards after his DNA was found at the scene.

Jack Tyler, 27, unemployed of Michelson Close, St Leonards, pleaded guilty to a charge of burglary other than dwelling when he appeared at Brighton Magistrates' Court on Thursday, December 10.

He had been arrested by police investigating a break-in at a shop on London Road around 00.30am on November 16, 2020.

Officers had attended the scene after being flagged down by a member of the public, and found the window to the store smashed and a number of watches missing.

Blood was found on the window ledge and on the floor inside the shop. Through DNA testing, this was found to belong to Jack Tyler.

He was arrested and charged, and admitted the offence in court. He is due to be sentenced on January 7, 2021.

Inspector Aidan Cornwall, of the Hastings Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "Following a detailed examination by our specialist Crime Scene Investigators, the blood of Jack Tyler was found at the scene of this burglary.

"We will relentlessly pursue those who commit burglaries in our community and our forensic teams are able to recover even the smallest traces of DNA or fingerprints which are left at the scene."
