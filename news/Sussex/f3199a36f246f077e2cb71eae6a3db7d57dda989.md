Police are appealing for witnesses after an elderly pedestrian was seriously injured in a collision with a van in Bognor Regis.

The incident involving a white Ford Transit Connect occurred in Chichester Road, at the junction with Central Avenue, about 10.05am on Saturday 4 July.

The pedestrian, a 72-year-old local man, was taken to St Richard's Hospital in Chichester where he underwent surgery for life-changing - but not life-threatening - injuries.

A section of the road was temporarily closed while police were in attendance, and the public are thanked for their patience and understanding.

Anyone who saw what happened or witnessed a white Ford Transit connect being driven in the area prior to the collision - or anyone with relevant dash cam or CCTV footage - is asked to email collision.appeal@sussex.pnn.police.uk quoting serial 400 of 04/07.
