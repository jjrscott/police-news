A woman alleged to have struck a cyclist in a hit-and-run while more than four times the drink-drive limit has been charged to appear in court.

Police responded to the incident on the A2037 at Small Dole around 2pm on Friday 13 November, whereby a cyclist was reported to have been involved in a collision with a Land Rover Freelander which failed to stop at the scene.

The victim - a 44-year-old woman from Shoreham - sustained leg injuries and was taken to hospital for treatment, and is now recovering at home.

A number of officers swiftly responded to the scene, while others made their way to the address of the registered keeper, where they discovered fresh damage to the vehicle suspected to be involved.

Sonal Shah, 42, of Penlands Vale, Steyning, was arrested and charged with 152mcg of alcohol per 100ml breath in her system, and failing to stop following a road traffic collision.

She has been released on conditional bail to appear before Worthing Magistrates' Court on 26 January.
