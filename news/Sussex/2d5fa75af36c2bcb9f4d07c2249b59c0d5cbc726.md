The family of a man who died in a collision on the A259 in Hastings have paid tribute to him.

Oli Paxton, 40, had gone out for a short walk after finishing work on Tuesday (March 9) when he was involved in a collision just outside his home.

In a statement released through Sussex Police, his family said: "A beloved husband to his wife, a wonderful father to his three sons, a caring son and brother, and a cherished friend, what is idle praise of others was true of him: that he won the love of many, and the affection of all.

"He has a quiet and gentle nature with a very witty and dry sense of humour. His generosity and love for others knew no bound: he would move mountains for anyone who asked.

"His loss is immeasurable and he will be more than missed by all who knew him."

Police continue to investigate the circumstances of the collision. One man arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving remains released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Officers would like to thank all the witnesses that have already come forward to support the investigation, and continue to appeal for any further witnesses to get in touch.

They are particularly keen to speak to anyone who saw any vehicles being driven erratically along the A259 between Rye and Hastings around 5pm that day.

Anyone with information, or any relevant dash cam footage, is asked to contact police by emailing collision.appeal@sussex.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101 quoting Operation Starboard.
