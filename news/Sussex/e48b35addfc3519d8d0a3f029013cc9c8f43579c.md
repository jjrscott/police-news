Sussex Police has donated Â£500 to East Sussex Wildlife Rescue to support them during the Covid-19 lockdown.

The money has come from the Police Property Act Fund (PPAF) - a pot of money made up from the sale of found property and from property confiscated by order of the court and then sold.

The main aim of the fund is to support local projects undertaken by voluntary and charitable organisations that solely benefit the communities of Sussex.

East Sussex Wildlife Rescue will use the funding to purchase PPE; primarily gloves to keep their volunteers and staff safe whilst helping in the community.

Trevor Weeks MBE, Operations Director at East Sussex Wildlife Rescue said: "Our Volunteers and Staff will benefit from this funding, providing routine protection whilst handling casualties and during feeding, cleaning and treatment. We can deal with over 4000 calls on an annual basis, helping Sick, injured or orphaned wildlife."

PCSO Daryl Holter, Heritage and Wildlife Crime Officer at Sussex Police said: "I am delighted to have been able to help the East Sussex Wildlife Rescue charity, working in partnership with Trevor Weeks, the charity and volunteers who look after wildlife. I can't thank them enough for all they do.
