Police investigating the reported attempted abduction of a 12-year-old boy in Brighton on Thursday (October 22) have closed their investigation after establishing that while the report was made in good faith, there are no suspicious circumstances.

Chief Inspector Roy Hodder said: "We always take reports of this nature very seriously and a number of officers were dedicated to investigating it.

"The boy has worked closely with us, enabling us to establish that there are no suspicious circumstances and the matter has been closed."
