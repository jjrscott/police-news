Police have carried out two days of action in Horsham to take action on youth anti-social behaviour.

On 22 and 23 February, officers carried out high visibility patrols, 31 stop checks and 16 searches. Cannabis was recovered from two individuals and community resolutions issued.

Four youths were stop checked in relation to a report of criminal damage at the Forum, in Lower Tanbridge Way on 22 February. A 15-year-old local boy attended for a voluntary interview and has been referred to the Youth Offending Team.

Two youths riding scooters through Swan Walk were also stopped and given words of advice.

Several youths found to be gathering in breach of Covid regulations were returned home to their parents.

Inspector Ben Starns said: "Horsham is generally a very safe place to live, however to tackle anti-social behaviour two days of action were planned for the town centre.

"We received an incredibly positive response from the local community as we worked to address issues using intelligence and proactive policing.

"Members of the public can expect to see us out and about increasingly in Horsham as we are committed to keeping it a safe and enjoyable place to live by reducing anti-social behaviour.

"We urge anyone with information or concerns about anti-social behaviour to report it online or by speaking in person to our officers and PCSOs when they are out and about. The more we know, the better we are."
