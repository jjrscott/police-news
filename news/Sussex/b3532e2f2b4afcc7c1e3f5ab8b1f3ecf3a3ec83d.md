A man has been arrested and charged after police responded to concerns for a woman in a car in Chesham Street, Brighton, on Saturday afternoon (25 July).

Using Automatic Number Plate Recognition technology, officers were able to trace the vehicle to a car park at Brighton Marina, where the woman - the only occupant of the car - was found safe.

A man was arrested in connection with the incident the following day (Sunday 26 July).

Benjamin Samuels, 39, of Paulet Road, Lambeth, London, was arrested and charged with assault.

He was remanded in custody to appear before Brighton Magistrates' Court on Monday 27 July, and the case was sent for trial at Lewes Crown Court on 24 August. The defendant was released on conditional bail until that date.
