Sussex Police has donated Â£500 to the Pett Level Preservation Trust.

The money has come from the Police Property Act Fund (PPAF) - a pot of money made up from the sale of found property and from property confiscated by order of the court, and then sold.

Zana Duthie, Chair of Pett Level Preservation Trust, said: "The Pett Level Preservation Trust protects 24 acres of coastal land for public enjoyment and as a haven for wildlife. A donation like this is hugely important to a small volunteer-run organisation like ours.

"We have now been able to securely gate an area of the derelict WW2 buildings on Toot Rock, which is the first step in our plan to convert it into a winter bat roost. This is one of a number of projects we are hoping to undertake to further improve the wildlife habitats and heritage on our land in the next few years."

PCSO Daryl Holter, Heritage and Wildlife Crime Officer at Sussex Police, said: "I am delighted to have been able to help the Zana, Lois and the trust, this funding will help both the local heritage and wildlife."
