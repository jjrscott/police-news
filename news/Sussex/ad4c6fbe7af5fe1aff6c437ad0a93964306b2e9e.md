Police investigating damage to parked cars in the Portslade area are appealing to speak to witnesses.

Officers have examined CCTV, undertaken door-to-door enquiries and increased proactive patrols and are keen to hear from anyone with information, dash-cam or doorbell footage from 23 August to 9 September in the South Portslade area to come forwards.

A 33-year-old man has been charged with one count of causing criminal damage and has been remanded in custody as enquiries continue.

A second suspect - a 77-year-old local man - was arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage and has been bailed.

Inspector Dan Hiles said: "We are determined to establish the full circumstances of these incidents and put a stop to them.

"We understand these crimes have a significant financial and emotional impact on the victims and we are devoting significant resources to this investigation.

"Our teams are grateful to the members of the local community who are assisting with this investigation by being vigilant and reporting information to us.

"This is our appeal to anyone who has seen anything suspicious or who knows anything about these incidents and hasn't spoken to us yet to please come forwards as you may be able to help."

Report information online or by calling 101, quoting Operation Sterling.
