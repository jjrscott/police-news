Police are appealing for witnesses after a report of fly-tipping and damage to crops in Southbourne.

Officers were called by a farmer who discovered waste dumped in a field at the northern end of Stein Road around 1pm on Thursday (July 16).

As well as potentially contaminating the crop by fly-tipping waste into the field, damage was also caused as the vehicle used to transport the waste flattened the crop in the process.

The waste is thought to be from a possible shop refit or refurbishment.

Anyone who has any information about the incident, or who saw any suspicious behaviour in the area, is asked to contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 47200119163.
