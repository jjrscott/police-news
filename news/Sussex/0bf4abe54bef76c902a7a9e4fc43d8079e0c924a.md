Three people have been arrested on suspicion of theft after a van was stopped by police in Uckfield.

Police were called on Monday morning (February 1) to a report of property being taken from the front garden of a house in Heathfield by three people travelling in a silver van.

This followed a number of other reports from the public over the past couple of weeks, of a group of people travelling in a silver van and acting suspiciously in and around front gardens in areas of Wealden.

Acting on community intelligence, police responded to sightings of a silver van in Uckfield on Monday morning and using officers' local knowledge, was able to bring the vehicle to a safe stop in Calvert Road. Suspected stolen property was recovered from inside the van.

Three people - a man aged 45 and two 17-year-old boys, all from Greenwich - were arrested on suspicion of theft. They all remain in custody at this time.

Members of the public are encouraged to report any suspicious behaviour to police, so officers can respond effectively. Reports can be made online or by calling 101 - always dial 999 in an emergency.
