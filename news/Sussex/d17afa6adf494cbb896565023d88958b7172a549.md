Police are appealing for witnesses after a man was reported to have indecently exposed himself to a 13-year-old girl in Littlehampton.

The incident took place at around 8.15am on Tuesday (9 March) in the High Street near Littlehampton Railway Station.

The suspect is described as white, male and aged between 50 and 60 years. He is approximately 5'9" and of chubby build, with greying hair.

PC Gordon Muir of Chichester CID said: "We would like to hear from anyone who has relevant information that could help us in our investigations. In particular we would like to speak with a woman who was walking only a short distance behind the victim and may also have seen the suspect."

A Littlehampton man was arrested on suspicion of indecent exposure, and has been released under investigation.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has information is urged to contact police by reporting online or by calling 101, quoting 250 of 09/03.

Alternatively they can contact Crimestoppers anonymously via their website or on 0800 555111.
