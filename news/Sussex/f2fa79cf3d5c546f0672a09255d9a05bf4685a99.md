A motorcyclist who tragically died following a crash in Crawley Down has been described as "one in a million".

Nicholas Bailey was riding a red Kawasaki in Turners Hill Road about 8.50pm on Thursday 25 June, when he was in collision with a blue Vauxhall Astra.

The 74-year-old, who lived in the village, suffered serious injuries and was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

His daughter Nicola Bailey issued the following tribute to him:

"My Dad was an amazing person, truly one in a million. He was well known locally and had many friends. He was well thought of due to his honesty, hard work and high standards. Always willing to lend a hand to any of his friends and family.

"He was a brilliant Dad and fantastic Grandpa, we are truly blessed to have had him. His loss will leave a huge hole, our lives will never be the same.

"Without doubt, the strongest man I have ever known, in every respect of the word."

The Astra driver - a 72-year-old man from Crawley - sustained minor injuries in the collision. He was arrested on suspicion of drink-driving and causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving, and has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Anyone who saw what happened, or anyone with dash cam footage which captured the incident or the events leading up to it, is urged to email collision.appeal@sussex.pnn.police.uk quoting Operation Bavian.
