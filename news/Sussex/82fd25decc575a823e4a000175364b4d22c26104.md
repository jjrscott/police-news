A man has died after a fire broke out at a house in Horsham.

Police officers were on patrol on Monday (January 11) when they saw flames coming from a property in Bishopric around 7.30pm.

Crews from West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service attended and extinguished the fire. Sadly, the body of a man in his 90s was found inside the house.

The incident is being treated as unexplained but not suspicious at this stage, and the coroner's office has been informed.

Another elderly man found at the address was treated at hospital for smoke inhalation and some burn injuries to his hand. He has since been discharged.
