Police are urging the public to be vigilant, after a large number of tacks or nails were discovered in the vicinity of Rye Harbour.

No damage or injury has been reported to date, but anyone with any information is urged to contact police online, on 101, or 999 in an emergency.

We're aware this is a common meeting place for motorists, and we'd like to remind everyone that we are still in a national lockdown. Please continue to following Government guidance as outlined here.
