Police are appealing for witnesses after a collision between a double-decker bus and a car in Bexhill.

The incident occurred at approximately 6.45pm on Wednesday (18 November) at the Wrestwood Road junction with Pebsham Lane, Bexhill.

A blue people carrier-style car was in a collision with the bus as it was turning right into Pebsham Lane, leaving the bus drivers with injuries requiring ambulance treatment. Two women were believed to have got out of the car and shouted at the injured driver, before driving off without leaving any details.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or who may be able to help with identifying the vehicle or the driver should email collision.appeal@sussex.pnn.police.uk quoting serial 1254 of 18/11.
