Police are investigating reports of an attempted robbery in Brighton.

Around 5.40pm on Saturday (March 6), police received third-party reports of an attempted robbery in the car park opposite Malthouse Court off Edward Street.

Officers attended and arrested a 35-year-old man on suspicion of attempted robbery. He has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

The victim left the scene prior to police arriving. Officers are appealing for him to come forward so his welfare can be checked and the full circumstances of the matter can be established.

Anyone with any information, or who saw what happened, can contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 1014 of 06/03.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
