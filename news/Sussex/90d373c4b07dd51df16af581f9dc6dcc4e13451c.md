A care worker is to be prosecuted for the alleged ill-treatment and wilful neglect of two residents at a West Sussex care centre, following an investigation by Sussex Police safeguarding detectives.

Officers from the Sussex Police Complex Abuse Unit investigated allegations received in 2019 of physical mistreatment and lack of safeguarding of 12 residents at the Horncastle Care Centre in Plawhatch Lane, Sharpthorne, which was owned and operated by Sussex Health Care. A file of evidence was submitted to the CPS this year, who have now authorised the prosecution of the care worker.

Wayne Dennis Watkins, 68, of Lakeside Holiday Park, Vinnetrow Road, Runcton, Chichester, has now been served with a court summons to appear at Crawley Magistrates' Court on 4 November, to answer allegations that during 2017 and 2018, as a care worker, he ill-treated and wilfully neglected two male residents at the centre, contrary to Section 20(1) of the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015.

Three other people who were care workers at the centre, two women both aged 56, and a man aged 50, were also interviewed under caution during the police investigation, on suspicion of ill-treatment of 10 other residents, but the CPS have advised that there is insufficient evidence to justify their prosecution.

Police have kept families of residents informed and have liaised with both West Sussex County Council and the Care Quality Commission throughout the investigation.
