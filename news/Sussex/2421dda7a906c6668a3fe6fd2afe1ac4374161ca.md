Police are appealing for witnesses to an incident of public order in St Leonards.

Around 8.15pm on Saturday (October 31), a man and a woman were walking along London Road with their two young children, including one in a pushchair, when a man approached them and shouted an offensive comment.

The man was challenged by the children's father and walked off north along London Road. The family recognised the man as someone who had previously displayed threatening behaviour towards them, and quickly contacted police.

The man is described as white, late 30s to early 40s, of skinny build and 5' 7" to 5' 8" in height. He had short, dark hair and was wearing a blue jumper.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or who may have any other information is asked to contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 1369 of 31/10.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
