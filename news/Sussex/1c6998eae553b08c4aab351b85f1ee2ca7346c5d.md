Police investigating an incident in Haywards Heath have arrested a suspect.

Officers received report of a man who followed two teenage girls into a fast food restaurant in South Road, Haywards Heath about 7pm on Friday (4 December).

The suspect allegedly asked the girls to get into his car and go for drinks with him.

He later reportedly approached a third victim at the same location and would not leave her alone when asked.

A 25-year-old local man was arrested on suspicion of stalking involving fear or violence and remains in custody for questioning.

Inspector Darren Taylor said: "This must have been a frightening ordeal for the victims and we thank them for their bravery in coming forwards.

"An investigation is underway as we work to establish the full circumstances around these incidents.

"We are aware of commentary on social media and would ask people not to speculate as this could harm the investigation."

Anyone with information can report online or call 101, quoting 47200208876.
