Police investigating a robbery in Worthing are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

The 18-year-old woman was walking in Broadwater Green around 4.30pm on Monday (March 15) when she was approached by a man who asked if she had any money.

When the victim said no, the suspect punched her and took her bank card and ID.

An 18-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of robbery and has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.
