Police are seeking assistance from the public in helping to identify a man who reportedly assaulted a teenage girl in Polegate.

Between 6pm and 7pm on Friday 19 March, the 15-year-old victim was approached by an unknown man who grabbed her arm and back close to the skate park in Black Path.

The suspect, described as white, about 5'7" and of stocky build, was spooked by a passing vehicle and when confronted, ran away. He wore a dark coloured hoody, only one trainer, and was intoxicated and smelt distinctly of port.

Police are appealing for anyone who saw a man matching this description acting suspiciously in the area around that time, or anyone who may have captured footage on CCTV, doorbell camera or dash cam, to come forward.

It is being investigated as an isolated incident.

Investigating officer, PC Peter Clarke, said: "This was an extremely traumatic incident for the 15-year-old victim to experience, and we are determined to catch the person responsible and get justice for not only the victim but also the local community.

"Despite an emergency response by local Polegate officers, unfortunately the suspect was not located on the evening and all police lines of enquiry are being fully exhausted. I am now requesting the help of local residents to check any footage they may have and if you were in the area and saw anything suspicious, please call 101 or report it online, quoting serial 1299 of 19/03."
