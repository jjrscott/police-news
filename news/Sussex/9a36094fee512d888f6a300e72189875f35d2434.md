Two people have been arrested after an attempted robbery in St Leonards.

Shortly before 3.25pm on Friday (January 8), a number of people approached a car in Warrior Square and smashed windows as they tried to rob the driver. He reported that one of them had a large knife.

Officers attended the scene and carried out initial fast-time enquiries. They arrested a 19-year-old woman in Bexhill on suspicion of attempted robbery, and a 20-year-old man in St Leonards on suspicion of robbery.

They have both been released on conditional bail until February 5 while enquiries continue.
