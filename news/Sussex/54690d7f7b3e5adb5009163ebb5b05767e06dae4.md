Police have solved the mystery of a young girl seen to get into a car in Lancing.

At about 10.10pm on Thursday (31 October) three teenage girls were reported by a witness to be in Upper Boundstone Lane, Lancing, when an argument allegedly developed between one of them and a man in his 40's driving a silver/grey hatchback car.

A public appeal for information was issued and police enquiries were carried out.

Officers have now traced the car and confirmed that the man and girl were in fact father and daughter, and that she is safe and well.

Detective Constable Francesca Safiruddin said; "This was a false alarm but it was raised with good intent, and it was important for us to make sure the girl was safe."
