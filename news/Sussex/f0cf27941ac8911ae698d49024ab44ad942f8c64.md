A man has died following a collision on the A29 Fairmile Bottom near Arundel.

Police were called at 7.14am on Tuesday (August 11) to reports of a collision involving a Suzuki motorcycle and a Ford Tipper van, both travelling north.

The motorcyclist - a 60-year-old man from Chichester - was sadly pronounced dead at the scene. His next of kin have been informed.

The three occupants of the van were uninjured.

Officers investigating the collision are keen to speak to anyone who saw what happened, or who witnessed either vehicle travelling beforehand.

They would also like to hear from anyone who may have captured any relevant dash cam footage from the area.

Anyone with any information is asked to email collision.appeal@sussex.pnn.police.uk quoting Operation Oakhaven.
