Police are appealing for witnesses after they were called to reports of a dispute between neighbours at a block of flats in Priory Avenue, Hastings, at 3.40am on Saturday (15 August).

Two occupants in one of the flat had been playing music loudly and had refused to turn it down. When police arrived at the scene, a man in the property threatened to shoot them.

He and a woman in the flat then refused to leave to speak to police officers.

Firearms officers and other emergency services were called to the scene and Priory Road and the junction of Priory Avenue and Stanley Road were closed off while the incident was ongoing.

At about 12.30pm a 40-year-old man eventually came out of the property and he was arrested on suspicion of making threats to kill. A woman also aged 40 who was in the flat was arrested on suspicion of affray. They remain in custody.

No one was harmed and the road was re-opened at 12.40pm.

Detective Sergeant Shelley Campbell said: "This incident started off as noise complaint and quickly escalated to a neighbour dispute and then the occupant threatening to harm police officers who had attended the scene.

"It was eventually resolved peacefully after several hours and a man and a woman were arrested. We would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident especially those who live in the block of flats who may have information which could help our investigation."

Report online or ring 101 quoting Operation Dunsmore.
