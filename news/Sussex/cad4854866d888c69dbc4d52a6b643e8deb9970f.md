Police are appealing for witnesses after a man was sprayed with an unknown substance in Hastings.

The victim was walking at the junction of Chapel Park Road and Bohemia Road around 9.30pm on Sunday (January 10) when he was approached from behind by someone who put him in a headlock.

The suspect then reached round and sprayed the victim in the face with an unknown substance from a container similar to a deodorant can.

The victim was punched to the side of the face and as he turned around to look at his attacker, he was sprayed in the face again. He was unable to see the attacker as they ran off down Chapel Park Road.

The victim was treated in hospital for reddening and a burning sensation to his face and neck, but was discharged with no ongoing medical concerns.

Police investigating the incident are keen to hear from anyone who saw what happened, or who may have any relevant CCTV, doorbell or dash cam footage from the area.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 1105 of 10/01. Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
