Police investigating a burglary in Seaford are appealing for witnesses to come forwards.

Around 7.30am on Saturday (30 January), police received report of an intruder in a property on Cricketfield Road.

The victim - an elderly woman - was awoken and saw a man wearing dark clothing run from the property.

A blue HP Laptop, a black iPad in a white case, a mobile phone and a red purse containing Â£20, some small change and a bank card were taken.

PC Anna Batchelor said: "This was a distressing incident which has understandably left the victim feeling shaken.

"We are appealing to anyone who witnessed anyone behaving suspiciously or who may have dash-cam or doorbell footage that could assist with enquiries.

Anyone with information is asked to report online or call 101, quoting 264 of 30/01.
