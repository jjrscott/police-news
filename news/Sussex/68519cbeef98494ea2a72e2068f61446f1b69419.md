Police have released these images of suspects sought in connection with a series of robberies against young people in Chichester.

Detectives are linking about seven incidents which have occurred in the Chichester area since October, with the latest offence taking place on 3 December.

About 3.20pm that day, a 16-year-old boy was approached in Avenue De Chartres by four youths and threatened with what has been described as a machete. They took his Apple AirPods and ran off from the scene.

Investigating officer, Detective Constable Sam Treagust, said: "There have been a number of robberies recently in Chichester whereby young people have been targeted. Items stolen during these offences include phones, AirPods and expensive clothing. We believe the suspects for these offences are using the rail network to travel, and we appeal to the public for help in identifying those responsible."

Chief Inspector Jon Carter, the district commander, added: "I know that these offences will be causing alarm for people who reside in the area, or travel through it. Officers from all teams are working with other forces and partners to prevent further offences, and bring those responsible to Justice.

"Officers will be operating both overtly and covertly in the locality. Other tactics that are part of Operation Safety - our ongoing campaign to prevent and detect knife crime - are also being utilised.

"If you have suspicions about a person or group of people, please phone Sussex Police on 101, or dial 999 in an emergency or if a crime is happening."
