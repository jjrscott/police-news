Police are appealing for witnesses to a collision between a car and a horse in Guestling.

Officers were called at 9.42am on Friday (February 26) to reports of a collision between a Fiat 500 and a horse on the A259 Winchelsea Road.

The horse was sadly injured and had to be put down at the scene by a vet in attendance. No injuries were reported to the horse's rider or the driver of the car.

The road was closed in both directions while emergency services dealt with the matter. It was reopened shortly after 11.30am.

Anyone who witnessed the collision, or who may have any relevant dash cam footage, is asked to contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 313 of 26/02.
