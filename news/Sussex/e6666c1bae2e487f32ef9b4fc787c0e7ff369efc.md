Police arrested two intruders at Amberley Castle with the use of a thermal imaging device.

Officers were called to the castle in the early hours of Friday (8 May) after two people were spotted breaking into the castle.

Due to the lack of lighting, officers conducted an area search with a thermal imagery camera and were able to detect the two suspects on the roof.

Assisted by West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service, the pair were safely brought down from the Grade 1 listed building.

A 16-year-old boy and a 28-year-old man from Amberley were both arrested on suspicion of burglary dwelling with intent to steal and criminal damage. The pair have been released under investigation while enquiries are ongoing.
