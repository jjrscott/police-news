Police are appealing for witnesses after a car that had been reported stolen collided with a tree in Eastbourne

At 4.27am on Sunday 22 November a white Mercedes E350 saloon car which had been reported stolen in Eastbourne earlier during the night, left the road and collided with a tree and a telegraph pole in Kings Drive, Eastbourne. The three men in the car were arrested on suspicion of being involved in the theft of the vehicle, and were all taken to hospital for treatment. Two have minor injuries and one has serious face and arm injuries which are not assessed as life threatening.

No other person or vehicle was involved in the collision.

The IOPC have been informed as a matter of standard policy as a police unit had seen the car just beforehand and was in the immediate vicinity at the time of the crash.

Anyone who saw the crash or the Mercedes, which had come from Eastbourne town centre, beforehand, is asked to contact Sussex Police via collision.appeal@sussex.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting Operation Interval.
