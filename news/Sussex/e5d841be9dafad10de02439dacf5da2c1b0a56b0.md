Police are urging Eastbourne residents to be vigilant after a spate of burglaries in which door locks have been drilled out.

Officers have been alerted to three recent break-ins in the Willingdon and Ratton area where similar methods of entry have been found.

A quantity of jewellery was taken during two of the burglaries, in Friston Avenue and Broad Road. Nothing appears to have been taken during the third burglary.

Officers are investigating the three incidents and additional patrols are being carried out in the area to identify and deter any further criminal behaviour.

Members of the public are asked to remain alert to any suspicious activity in their area, and to report any concerns to police online or by calling 101. Always dial 999 in an emergency.

There are a number of steps residents can take to property their property, including alarm systems and CCTV cameras. For more information, visit our website here.
