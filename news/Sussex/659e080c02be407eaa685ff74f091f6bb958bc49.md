Do you recognise this man?

Police would like to speak to him about an assault at the Aldi store in London Road, East Grinstead, around 5.35pm on Saturday, December 5.

A 53-year-old man suffered facial injuries and was taken to hospital for treatment.

Police attended but the suspect had left the scene. Officers investigating the matter believe the man pictured could help with their enquiries.

He is described as white, in his mid-20s, around 5' 9" and of medium build. He was wearing a grey baseball cap with a sticker on the peak, a white Covid face mask, black coat, light grey jogging bottoms and black mid-top trainers with a white logo on the side.

He was also carrying a dark grey rucksack and riding a white Boardman pushbike.

Anyone who recognises him, or who has any other information about the assault, it asked to contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 971 of 05/12.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
