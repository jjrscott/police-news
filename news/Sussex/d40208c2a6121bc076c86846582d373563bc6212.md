Police are seeking witnesses to an incident in Burgess Hill in which a man sustained serious facial and leg injuries.

At about 8pm on Sunday (12 July) the 48-year-old local man was in Station Road, Burgess Hill, near the Top House pub, when he was kicked and punched by another man, and fell to the ground, sustaining cuts and bruising to his face and legs before the assailant ran off.

PC John Miles said; "We know there were a number of other people in the immediate area at the time, as well as vehicles driving by, and anyone who saw what happened is asked to contact us either online or by calling 101, quoting serial 1328 of 12/07."
