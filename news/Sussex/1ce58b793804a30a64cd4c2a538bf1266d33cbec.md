Police are appealing for witnesses to an attempted robbery in Storrington shortly after midday on Tuesday (February 23).

The victim, a man in his 80s, had been outside a property in Manleys Hill when he was approached by a woman with a clipboard who appeared to be asking for donations.

The victim gave her a small quantity of cash, after which she tried to take a watch from his wrist. A struggle ensued but the woman left the scene empty-handed after members of the public intervened. The victim suffered minor injuries.

The woman was described as white, aged between 20s and 35, with shoulder length brown hair. She was wearing glasses and an olive green coat, and left in the direction of High Street and School Hill.

An extensive area search was carried out but with no trace. Officers will be conducting high-visibility patrols in the area to deter and identify any further criminal behaviour.

Anyone who witnessed the incident, or who may have any other information about what happened, is asked to contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 491 of 23/02. Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
