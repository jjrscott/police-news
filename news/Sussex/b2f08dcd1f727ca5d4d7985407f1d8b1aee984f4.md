Police are appealing to a man to come forward as a potentially important witness, after a woman was found with injuries on the beach at Bognor Regis.

At 2am on Monday (14 September) police were called to the beach opposite Victoria Road South, near the Bognor Regis yacht club, after the 32-year-old local woman had been found with minor facial injuries, for which she was treated at St Richard's Hospital in Chichester.

Detective Sergeant Eva Barwis of the West Sussex Safeguarding Investigations Unit said: "The full circumstances have not yet been established. It is very important that we find out what happened and our investigation is continuing.

"We are particularly keen to trace a man described as white, speaking with an Eastern European accent, and wearing a white T-shirt, black trousers and white trainers.

"He is understood to have spoken to the woman and asked if she was alright, before walking off. At this time we regard him purely as an important witness and would be very grateful if he would get in touch with us.

"That man, and anyone else who was in the area late on Sunday night into Monday morning, and who saw anything unusual or suspicious, can contact us online or by calling 101, quoting serial 85 of 14/09.
