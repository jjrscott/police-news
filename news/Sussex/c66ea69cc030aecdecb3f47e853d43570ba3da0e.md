This happened around 12.30pm on Mount Pleasant Road in Hastings, and did not result in serious injury.

A 26-year-old man from St Leonards was arrested on July 12 on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm with intent; attempting to cause grievous bodily harm; possession of a Class A drug; possession of a Class B drug; possession of an imitation firearm in a public place; and possession of a weapon for the discharge of a noxious liquid / gas / electrical incapacitation device. He was released on conditional bail until August 8 while enquiries continue.
