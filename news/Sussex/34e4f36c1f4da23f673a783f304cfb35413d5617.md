Detectives are appealing for witnesses to an aggravated burglary at a house on Saturday night (28 November) in Hurst Green.

Police were called at about 8.30pm by the occupants of a premises set back from London Road reporting that their home was being broken into by a group of men, all wearing dark clothing and balaclavas. The home owner fought the assailants off and suffered minor injuries as a result.

The suspects are described as a group of four to six men, between 5' 8" to 5' 11" and wearing balaclavas. It is believed that they arrived in a dark coloured 4 x 4 vehicle.

Detective Inspector Gavin Patch said: "This was a terrifying ordeal for the homeowner and his family. We are continuing to investigate the circumstances but believe this was an isolated incident."

"We would like to hear from anyone who may have seen a 4 x 4 vehicle in the area or anyone acting suspiciously."

If anyone has any information which can help our investigation report online or ring 101 Operation Parkgate.
