Do you recognise this man and woman?

Police would like to speak to them about the theft of stock worth around Â£100 from Runcton Farm Shop, Lagness Road, Chichester, on Thursday, December 10.

Items were taken from the pet food warehouse and the site's main shop. Police investigating the theft believe the man and woman pictured could help with their enquiries.

The couple are thought to be in their 50s and had a terrier dog with them. The man had short brown/grey hair and was wearing a brown fleece. The woman had shoulder length hair, was wearing glasses and carrying a shoulder bag.

Anyone who recognises them, or who has any other information relating to the theft, is asked to contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 1081 of 10/12.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
