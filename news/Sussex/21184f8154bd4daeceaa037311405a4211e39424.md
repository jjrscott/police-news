A prolific Worthing shoplifter who stole nearly £500 of hair products has been handed a prison sentence.

Arron Jones, 27, of The Steyne, Worthing, appeared at Brighton Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 12, August, following an earlier guilty plea to all charges to offences between January and July.

Jones was charged with 11 counts of theft from a shop, which included the theft of nearly £500 worth of hair products from Boots in Worthing and £200 worth of items from the Co-operative in Lancing, and one count of attempted theft.

Unemployed Jones was also convicted of eight breaches of a Community Protection Notice and common assault which occurred on 19 July.

Jones was handed a prison sentence of 42 weeks in total and a number of suspended sentences were imposed to run concurrently. A £50 victim compensation was also ordered.

Adur and Worthing Prevention Sergeant Craig Burgess said: "Jones has committed a number of thefts from a variety of shops in the Adur and Worthing area during the lockdown period when businesses were staying open to provide a much needed service to the community.

"Such prolific offenders will always be targeted by the police and we welcome the sentence from the courts."
