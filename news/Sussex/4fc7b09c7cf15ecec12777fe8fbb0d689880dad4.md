Officers investigating reports of a man outraging public decency are looking to identify two possible witnesses.

Police were called around 4pm on Monday 4 January to reports of a man masturbating in a blue car, which was parked on Hoads Wood Road, St Leonards.

While enquiries were ongoing, police received a further report of a man masturbating in a vehicle around 1pm on Wednesday 17 February in Southwater Road, St Leonards.

Police believe two young females witnessed the incident in Southwater Road and shouted at the man before leaving the area. Officers are appealing for the two females to come forward to assist with the investigation.

A 30-year-old man from St Leonards has been arrested on suspicion of committing an act of outraging public decency. He was interviewed and has been released on conditional bail while enquiries continue.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 527 of 17/02. Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
