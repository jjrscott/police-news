This is a joint statement from Sussex Police and West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service:

Sussex Police and West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service are continuing to investigate a significant residential fire which tragically claimed the lives of two people.

Emergency services responded to the incident in Harbolets Road, West Chiltington, at 9.10am on Saturday 26 December.

Fire engines from the local area arrived quickly at the scene and a section of the road was closed, and the fire was extinguished.

Two people were sadly confirmed deceased at the scene. Their bodies have since been recovered.

They are believed to be married couple Francis Dougharty, 90, and Madeleine Dougharty, 86, however they are yet to be formally identified.

Enquiries are ongoing, and a joint investigation will take place to determine the cause of the fire.

We have no further information at this stage.
