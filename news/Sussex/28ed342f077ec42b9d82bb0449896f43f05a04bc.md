A 15-year-old boy was airlifted to hospital with serious head injuries following a collision on the B2141 Harting Hill on Saturday morning (October 24).

He was a passenger in an orange Caterham 7 that left the road around 9.30am, collided with a tree and went down an embankment just south of the junction with the B2146.

Police are appealing for any witnesses to the collision - on the road between Chichester and Petersfield - and in particular, walkers in the area who assisted the occupants before the arrival of the emergency services. They would also like to hear from anyone who may have captured dash cam footage of the car, which was travelling southbound followed by a green Lamborghini that also stopped at the scene.

Please email collision.appeal@sussex.pnn.police.uk or call 101 quoting Operation Milltown.
