Police are appealing for witnesses after a teenage cyclist was robbed at knife point in Crawley.

The 13-year-old victim was riding his friend's black Norco Storm 3 mountain bike on a footpath off the A23 London Road around 5.30pm on Saturday 27 June, when an unknown man emerged from the bushes and threatened him with a large knife.

The suspect took the bike, which has yellow signage and yellow pedals, and rode off in the direction of County Oak.

He is described as mixed race, about 5'7", around 18-years-old and had a lazy right eye. He wore a black durag on his head, a dark grey Nike Air Max tracksuit and black trainers.

Anyone who knows anything about the incident, who recognises the suspect from the description provided, or has any knowledge of the stolen bike being offered for sale, is asked to report it online or call 101, quoting serial 1272 of 27/06.
