A man has been banned from begging for money in West Sussex for five years.

Ashley Martin, 39, of no fixed address, was handed a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) by Crawley Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 6, September, after multiple breaches of a criminal protection notice.

Martin is prohibited from:

 * Not to beg or ask for money, food or other items anywhere within West Sussex
 * Not to enter the stairwells of the Fitzleet multi-storey car park in Bedford Street, Bognor Regis
 * Not to sit or remain of be within 2metres of any shop doorway in West Sussex
 * Not to be aggressive and or abusive to employees or customers of any trading premises in West Sussex

PC Steve Self of the Bognor Regis of the local Prevention Team said: "I am pleased the court approved the application for a Criminal Behaviour Order against Martin.

"Martin was issued with a Criminal Protection Notice earlier this year, however he continued to breach the regulations and therefore a CBO was sought.

"I want to assure the public that we will continue to use anti-social behaviour legislation, as well as criminal powers, to ensure that offenders not only answer for their criminal behaviour, but that they are subject to ongoing restrictions, in order to provide a respite to individuals, businesses or communities."

If anyone sees Martin breaching the terms of the CBO please contact police either online or by calling 101.
