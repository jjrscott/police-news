A quick response by police resulted in the safe arrest of a man in possession of a gun in Hastings.

At 10.52am on Monday (6 July) officers responded to a report of a man with handgun in his pocket, walking along the seafront near Hastings Pier. Following an intensive search of the area officers spotted a man in nearby White Rock Road and he was arrested without incident by 11.25am. A BB-gun was seized together with a gas ammunition canister for the weapon.

After being interviewed on suspicion of unlawful possession of the weapon, the 45-year-old man was released under investigation.

Superintendent Howard Hodges said; "This was prompt and efficient work by our local officers and firearms officers working as a team to ensure the incident was safely and quickly resolved without any risk to the public."
