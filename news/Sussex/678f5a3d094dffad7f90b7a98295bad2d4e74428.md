Five men have been arrested after police executed a drugs warrant in Crowborough.

Officers entered an industrial unit on Crowborough Hill on Monday (November 9) and discovered a large cannabis cultivation site inside.

The building contained approximately 75 mature cannabis plants, as well as a significant quantity of dried cannabis.

Five men aged 22, 23, 25, 26 and 35 were arrested at the scene on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of a Class B drug. They have been released on conditional bail while enquiries continue.

Sergeant Derrick Wood of the Prevention Enforcement Team, said: "We work hard to reduce drug harm and drug-related crime in our community. This warrant is a significant disruption to the supply of drugs in the area, and has taken a large quantity of drugs off the streets.

"We encourage people to continue reporting drug-related incidents to us, so we can respond effectively. Information from the public helps us gather intelligence and build a picture of what is happening in the area."

Members of the public can report to police online or by calling 101. Always dial 999 in an emergency. Reports can also be made anonymously via the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
