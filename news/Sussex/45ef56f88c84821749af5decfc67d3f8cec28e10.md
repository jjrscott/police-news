Police and Explosive Ordnance Disposal personnel have stood down from an area of Brighton following the discovery of an unexploded munition.

The rusted item, thought to be a small shell, was found in the garden of a house in Chatham Place, Brighton and reported to police at 3.36pm on Monday (11 May).

An Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) team carried out an assessment and safely removed the object.

Police removed the road closures around 6.30pm.

Earlier in the day, another device, thought to be an unexploded mortar, was found in an enclosed area off Grand Parade. It was dealt with in a controlled explosion by EOD and police were stood down from the scene shortly before 3pm. The two incidents are not connected.
