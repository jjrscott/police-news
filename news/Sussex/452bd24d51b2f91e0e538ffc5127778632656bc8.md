An arrest has been made after police witnessed a suspected drug deal in Hove about 4.15pm on Monday, 30 November.

Plain clothes officers from the Neighbourhood Policing Team were on patrol when they spotted a man behaving suspiciously in Lansdowne Place.

A 21-year-old man arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of a Class A drug. Officers conducted a nearby address search where scales, three phones, a SIM card and wraps of substances believed to be heroin and crack cocaine were recovered.

The suspect has been released on police bail while enquiries are ongoing.

Inspector Benjamin Hearth said: "Tackling drug dealing in Brighton and Hove remains a key priority for the Force and our officers are out daily, both in uniform and plain clothes, working to prevent drug-related harm in our communities.

"We urge anyone with information about drug dealing in their area to report it to us online or by calling 101."
