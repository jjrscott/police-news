The remains of a body found in Ashdown Forest have been confirmed as those of a missing woman from Forest Row.

On Sunday afternoon 14 February, some human skeletal remains and clothing were found by walkers on Ashdown Forest, at a location between Priory Road and the A22 near Forest Row. The scene was searched and examined and police investigated.

The remains have now sadly been established as those of Gerda Uelfer-Woods, 75, from Forest Row, who had been reported missing from her home nearby in July 2020.

Gerda had not been heard from since late June when she said that she was going away, and an appeal for her whereabouts was issued in July.

Her daughter, Heather Woods, said; "We are understandably heartbroken but also relieved that after 8 long months we can finally place our loving mother to rest. She was an inspiration in so, so many ways, worldly wise and full of adventurous spirit.

"Enigmatic, strong and kind she was the sort of person who does not grace this earth often and her departure has left a gaping hole in our lives. A wonderful mother, sorely missed, deeply loved, never forgotten."

The death is being treated as unascertained but not suspicious and the Coroners officer is continuing enquiries.
