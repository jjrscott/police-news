Officers from Worthing Neighbourhood Policing Team have successfully obtained two Partial Closure Orders in Lancing and Sompting.

Concerns had been raised by local residents and other agencies in relation to antisocial behaviour and drug use at the addresses in Hurstfield and Busticle Lane - both of which are home to vulnerable tenants.

The Partial Closure Orders will initially last for three months and stipulates that only specified visitors are permitted from entering the addresses. Those who are not permitted can be arrested if they are found inside.

The orders will help to protect the vulnerable tenants, provide relief to the neighbours and assist local officers in targeting the perpetrators of the antisocial behaviour.

Sergeant Craig Burgess, from Worthing Neighbourhood Policing Team, said "Partial Closure Orders are the final option when dealing with antisocial behaviour at a particular address. We have worked with the vulnerable residents and other agencies to take this action to protect the residents and wider community from the antisocial behaviour, which unfortunately was associated with these addresses."
