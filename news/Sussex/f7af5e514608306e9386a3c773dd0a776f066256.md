A man was arrested after police seized drugs and weapons during a warrant in Buxted.

Officers attended an address in the Pound Green area around 8.40am on Friday (August 28) to execute a warrant under the Misuse of Drugs Act.

They searched the address and seized a large quantity of cannabis and cash, as well as items associated with the distribution of drugs. Two knives were also seized from the address.

A 22-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply a Class B drug. He was released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Kelly Levers, who lead the warrant on her first shift as acting sergeant of the Prevention Enforcement Team (PET), said: "The warrant was a great example of different policing teams working together, with Wealden prevention officers and the tutor unit based at Polegate supporting PET.

"The result was a large amount of drugs and two dangerous weapons taken off the streets, and our investigation around these matters is ongoing."
