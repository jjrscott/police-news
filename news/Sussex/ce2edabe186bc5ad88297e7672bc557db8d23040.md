Police in Hastings are seeking witnesses and information after a man was stabbed.

Emergency services were called to a report of the 50-year-old local man found with a stab wound to his leg at Admiral Steps, Nelson Road, Hastings, at 11.10pm on Friday (9 October).

The man was taken to the Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton, for treatment.

Detective Constable Nick Arthur said; "This was a serious injury and the man was not discharged from hospital until four days later. His injury still requires further attention.
