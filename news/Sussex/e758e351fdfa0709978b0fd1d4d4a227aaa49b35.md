Five men have been arrested in connection with an incident in Deepdene Gardens, Hastings.

It follows a report of threats made and an attempted arson at an address in the street, which was reported to police around 4.22am on Saturday 25 July.

A number of specialist officers were deployed to the scene and the road has been closed to ensure public safety.

Chief Inspector Sarah Godley said: "I would like to reassure the public that this was an isolated incident and there is no threat to the wider community. I'd also like to thank local residents for their patience and understanding.

"Officers currently remain at the scene as our investigation continues."

A 39-year-old man from London has been arrested on suspicion of attempted arson with intent to endanger life.

A 23-year-old man from Hastings has been arrested on suspicion of threatening to destroy property and endanger life.

A 28-year-old man from Hastings has been arrested on suspicion of attempted arson with intent to endanger life.
