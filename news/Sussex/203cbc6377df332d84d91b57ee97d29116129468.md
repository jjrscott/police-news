A woman has been jailed and disqualified from driving after a pursuit in Chichester on Christmas Eve.

Police were on mobile patrol on the night of December 24, 2019, when they saw a vehicle with a very muddy number plate in Cheesemans Lane.

Officers approached the vehicle - a Toyota Rav4 - to speak with the driver but she gave no response, instead speeding off.

Officers began a pursuit, during which they observed the woman driving dangerously, including reaching speeds of 60mph in a 30mph limit and not adapting her driving to take into consideration standing water on the roads.

Police safely brought the vehicle to a stop with tactical contact in Priors Leaze Lane, and the driver was arrested.

Shania Witt-Mann, 34, unemployed, of Priors Leaze Lane, Hambrook, was charged with dangerous driving, failing to provide a specimen of blood for analysis, and driving with no insurance.

She pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six months' imprisonment when she appeared at Portsmouth Crown Court on Tuesday (July 28).

She has also been disqualified from driving for 27 months, and until she passes an extended re-test.

If you witness an incident of dangerous or antisocial driving, you can report it online at Operation Crackdown.
