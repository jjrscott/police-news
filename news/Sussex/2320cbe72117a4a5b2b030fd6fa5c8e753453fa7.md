Police have arrested a man in connection with a recent series of damage to parked cars in the Portslade area.

The 33-year-old man was detained in the early hours of Sunday (6 September) on suspicion of causing criminal damage. He has now been released on conditional bail until 4 October.

Officers have stepped up patrols in the area, and have been making enquiries with local residents and businesses to seek any CCTV or dashcam footage.
​
Sergeant Jan Szaranek said: "This arrest was the result of working closely with the local community and we encourage anyone with further information, CCTV, or dash cam footage to come forward. We would also like to hear from any victims who have had their cars damaged in the area recently to report it if they haven't already done so.
​
"We are still undertaking proactive patrols and our communities can be assured that we are taking their concerns seriously."

Report online or ring 101 quoting Operation Sterling.
