Police are appealing for witnesses to come forwards following a robbery in Worthing.

Officers were called to Reigate Road about 12.30pm on Friday (22 January) after a 76-year-old woman was attacked by a man. She suffered a broken jaw and had her bag stolen which contained her phone, passport and purse containing Â£1,200 cash.

The suspect is described as a young white male in his 20s wearing a white hoodie and he made off towards Goring High Street.

Detective Sergeant Andrew Ricks said: "This was a truly despicable incident where an elderly woman was targeted and had a significant amount of money stolen.

"We want to hear from anyone who saw what happened or may have footage capturing the incident. This happened in broad daylight in a relatively busy area and we are sure someone will have information that can help.

"The stolen bag is described as a brown Michael Kors bag and we are keen to speak to anyone who may have found it if it was discarded following this offence.

"Incidents such as this are awful but thankfully rare and we will take action against those who cause harm in our communities in this way."

Anyone with information can report it online or by calling 101, quoting 502 of 22/01.
