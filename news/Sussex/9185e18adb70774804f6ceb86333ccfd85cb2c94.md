Sussex Police has donated Â£500 to Crawley Open House to help provide a lifeline to vulnerable people.

The money will be used by the charity's community outreach team, who work daily with people suffering from homelessness or addiction.

It was obtained by officers at the Gatwick Police Prevention Team, who work closely with the community to keep people safe and feeling safe.

The money will be used to purchase items such as food and drink, bus and train tickets, clothing, and cheap mobile phones - all of which can avert the crisis faced by these vulnerable people, and help them with the relationship building process.

The grant was secured through the Police Property Act Fund (PPAF), made up of monies received by the police from the sale of unclaimed lost property and property confiscated by order of the courts and then sold.
