A woman has been jailed after being convicted of multiple burglaries in the Brighton area.

Toni Deerans, 37, of Preston Road in Brighton was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment at Lewes Crown Court for for eight counts of burglary and four counts of fraud on Friday (7 August).

Deerans was wanted by police in connection with several burglaries in Brighton and Hove and for failing to appear in court - charged with burglary - on March 20. She was arrested in the Brighton area on 7 May.

Items such as electronic devices and credit cards were stolen during the string of burglaries occurring since August 2019.

Detective Inspector Glenn Taylor: "Deerans is a prolific burglar and who avoided facing up to what she had done by failing to appear in court.

"We are pleased that she is off the streets and has the chance to consider how her unacceptable actions have affected her victims.

"This sort of behaviour won't be tolerated and we will work tirelessly to catch criminals and bring them to justice."
