A woman who was sadly found deceased after emergency services were called to her home in Bexhill has been identified as Carol Smith aged 75 (pictured).

Ambulance paramedics and Police attended the address in Watermill Lane at 1.45am on Saturday (6 February) and discovered her body. A post-mortem has been carried out and a provisional cause of death was an injury consistent with gunshot wounds. The inquest will be formally opened on Thursday (11 February) and then adjourned for further enquiries.

A man, known to her aged 78, was found with a serious injury in the house. He was arrested in connection with the incident and taken to hospital where he remains in a stable condition.

Detective Inspector Duncan Elliott from the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Unit said: "This is being treated as a tragic isolated incident and we are not looking for anyone else in connection to it.

"Carol's family have released a photo of her and our thoughts are with them at this incredibly difficult time and we would ask the public to respect their privacy."
