Police in East Sussex arrested two men suspected of drugs supply offences after stopping a car near Hastings.

On the evening of Wednesday 13 January, acting on information, officers located and stopped a Volvo S60 saloon being driven south towards Hastings on the A21 at Sedlescombe.

The car was safely 'boxed in' by police units and brought to a halt with the aid of a 'stop stick' across the road. Nobody was hurt.

A quantity of what is believed to be heroin was seized from the car.

Two men in the car, one aged 39 from Liverpool and one aged 20 from Hastings, were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of heroin.

The 39-year-old was also arrested on suspicion of drug driving and money laundering.

After being interviewed that were released on police bail until 10 February while enquiries continue.

Detective Inspector Mark Rosser said; "This was another example of our constant intelligence-led activity aimed at making East Sussex a hostile environment for suspected drugs dealers.

"If you have information about drug dealing in your area, contact us at any time online or by calling 101."
