Police are continuing to appeal for witnesses to a fatal collision which occurred on the A27 about 11.40pm on Wednesday 10 February.

A black Volkswagen Golf was travelling east towards Chichester, on the Sussex /Hampshire border, when it crashed into the central reservation.

The driver - a 25-year-old man from Havant - was sadly pronounced dead at scene.

The passenger - a 19-year-old man from Havant - suffered life-threatening injuries and remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition.

A 20-year-old woman and a 23-year-old man, both from Havant, were arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. They have since been released on conditional bail until 10 March, pending further enquiries.

The road was closed in both directions for several hours while investigations were carried out, and we'd like to thank the public for their patience and understanding.

Police are appealing for witnesses and are particularly interested to hear from anyone with dash cam footage of the collision, or the Golf or a red Audi A3 being driven in the area prior to the collision.

Please call 101 or email collision.appeal@sussex.pnn.police.uk quoting Operation Westdown.
