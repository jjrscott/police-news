Police are appealing for witnesses after a report of St Andrew and St Nicolas church being broken into and vandalised in South Street, Portslade.

The incident is believed to have taken place between 5pm on 13th October and 10am on 17 October.

Brass candle sticks and other church items were found thrown onto the vestry floor and a small amount of money was taken from the premises.

The main front door of the church appeared to have been tampered with and the back door was broken into.

The church has recently reached its 850th anniversary.

Officers are appealing to anyone who witnessed anything suspicious to report online or call 101, quoting 431 of 17/10.
