A 15-year-old boy sustained a broken ankle and needed surgery to stabilise the injury after he was assaulted by another youth in an incident in St Leonards-on-Sea on Wednesday 23 October.

It happened at about 4.20pm at the junction of the A2102 London Road with Springfield Road and police want to talk to anyone who saw what happened.

In particular, officers would like to speak to the driver of a white van believed to have stopped in Springfield Road while waiting to turn left onto London Road.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or who may have dash-cam footage that captured it is asked to contact Sussex Police online or by phoning 101, quoting serial 879 of 23/10.
