Sussex Police are investigating after a woman was followed by a man in Chichester.

A woman in her 30s was walking along the A259 between Southbourne and Bosham around 2.30pm on Thursday (11 June) when she was approached by a man in a blue BMW.

From his car, the man asked the women if she would like a lift but the woman declined. The driver then pulled his car over, got out of the car, approached the woman and asked the same question.

The woman declined once more and walked off unharmed.

Police would urge anyone who has experienced a similar matter to report it to them. They would also like to speak to anyone who has any dash cam footage or witnessed the incident and would ask them to make contact either online or by 101 quoting reference 444 of 11/06.

A 34-year-old man of no fixed address was arrested by officers in Hampshire on Thursday morning (18 June). He was arrested on suspicion of harassment and remains in police custody while enquiries are ongoing.
