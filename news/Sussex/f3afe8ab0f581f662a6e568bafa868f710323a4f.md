Police investigating a robbery in Brighton have arrested a suspect.

Officers were called to Western Road at 4pm on Thursday (22 October) following a report that a man had his phone, shoes and jacket stolen by a suspect after being driven from London Road station to the Waitrose car park in Hove where he was assaulted.

The victim - a 19-year-old man - sought help from members of the public and called police.

The suspect and victim are believed to be known to each other.

A 25-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of robbery and kidnap and remains in custody for questioning.

Detective Inspector Glenn Taylor said: "We will not tolerate violence in our city and are working quickly to establish the circumstances of this event.

"Anyone who witnessed what happened or who has any information which may assist with enquiries can report online or call 101 quoting 877 of 22/10."
