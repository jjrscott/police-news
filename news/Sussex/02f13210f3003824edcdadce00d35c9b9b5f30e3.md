Police are advising the public to remain vigilant following a spate in outhouse break-ins in Chichester.

Officers have recently received an increase in reports of sheds, garages and outbuildings being broken into and property being stolen. Primarily the items taken have been garden power tools, hand tools, pedal cycles, quad bikes and sit-on lawn mowers.

Designated patrols are being conducted in the areas and all viable lines of enquiry for each case are being investigated.

District Commander for Chichester Chief Inspector Jon Carter said: "We have recently seen a spate of outbuildings being broken into normally between 11pm and 7am. These have taken place in the rural areas of Chichester.

"We have set up overt and covert responses to this series of incidents, some of which may well be linked, and we are working closely with partners and other force level teams in a bid to identify those responsible.

"We would urge anyone with information about any of the incidents to come forward to assist the prevention team in gathering evidence. Have you notice anyone acting suspiciously lately?

"We must stress the importance of ensuring your sheds, garages and outhouses are locked when not in use and ensure any valuable items being stored in these premises are security marked and the serial numbers noted.

"If you believe you can assist our investigation please report information online or call 101 quoting Operation Alert."
