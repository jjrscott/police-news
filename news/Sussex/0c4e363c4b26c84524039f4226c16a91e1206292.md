Police are appealing for witnesses to continued anti-social behaviour and criminal damage at an allotment in Lewes.

The allotment, to the rear of Wheatsheaf Gardens, has been repeatedly used as a place to gather by a group of young people.

Damage has been caused to the area including a broken fence and gate, and damage to numerous items including children's toys, gardening equipment and decorative pieces.

In the most recent incident, sheds have been broken into with one of the windows being smashed. Large amounts of rubbish have also been left at the allotments on numerous occasions.

Police investigating the matter are keen to hear from anyone who has seen any anti-social behaviour in the area or who has any information regarding the group of people.

Information can be passed to police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 823 of 19/12. Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
