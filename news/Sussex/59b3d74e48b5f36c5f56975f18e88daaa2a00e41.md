Rother Police have invested in new tracker technology to help identify those causing harm to their communities.

Through financial support from the Joint Action Group, police have been able to purchase equipment for people in the district to use on their farm machinery and quad bikes.

Inspector Jonathan Hartley of the Rother Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "We understand the impact theft can have on our rural communities, especially when the items stolen are expensive to replace and essential to the running of their business and livelihood.

"We have listened to the community's concerns around this and have invested in equipment to help us track and recover stolen vehicles and equipment.

"Combining this with our regular patrols of rural areas, proactive stopping of vehicles and closer working relationships with the rural community, we will help to both reduce and prevent rural crime."
