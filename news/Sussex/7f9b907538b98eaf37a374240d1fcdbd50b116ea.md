Police are investigating a series of deliberate fires at a pub in Eastbourne.

At around 1am on Saturday (July 11), East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service and Sussex Police officers attended a fire at the Alexandra Arms pub on Seaside.

This was the third fire at the pub in the space of two weeks, with two other fires being reported in the early hours of Thursday 2 July and the evening of Wednesday 8 July.

No one has been injured during the fires, which are now being treated as a linked series.

Detectives are keen to hear from any members of the public who may have seen any suspicious behaviour in the area at the time, including any persons seen to take particular interest in the Alexandra Arms.

One suspect is described as a white man, of slim build, wearing a grey and white hooded top, and grey and white tracksuit bottoms. Two other suspects are described as wearing dark clothing.

Anyone who witnessed any of the fires, or who may have any other relevant information, is asked to contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 130 of 07/11.

Alternatively, you can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
