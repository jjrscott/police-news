The woman whose body was found in a house in Eastbourne on Sunday afternoon (July 5) has been named as 58-year-old Jacqueline Hoadley.

Detective Chief Inspector Andy Wolstenholme from the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team said: "Mrs Hoadley, who lived at the address in Broad Oak Close, was found after a visitor to the house raised the alarm at 1.59pm. She had suffered serious injuries and sadly was declared deceased at the scene. A post mortem will take place to determine the cause of her death on Tuesday (July 7).

"A 62-year-old man, from Eastbourne, was arrested in Chailey on suspicion of her murder around 3pm on Sunday. He remained in custody at 7pm on Monday (July 6)."

Superintendent Katy Woolford said: "This has obviously been a tremendous shock for those living in and around this close community and I would like to thank them for their patience and forbearance while our investigation team continue their work. They are likely to remain in the area for a while longer. If anyone has any concerns, please feel free to talk to one of my officers or PCSOs who are there."
