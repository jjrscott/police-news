Police are keen to identify this man who they suspect of robbing a Bognor betting shop.

Just after 7pm on Wednesday 30 September, a man entered William Hill in Hawthorn Road, Bognor, threatened a member of staff and stole a quantity of cash.

He said he had a gun but no weapon was seen.

He was described as white, about 6'3" and of slim build, wearing what appeared to be a woman's coat too small for him, black shorts and dark trainers white soles.

Immediately before he threatened the staff member, the robber said he had just been stabbed and fell to the floor, but was not seen to have any injuries and officers believe this may have been an attempt to distract the staff.

Detective Constable Elaine Keating said; "If you recognise this man or have any other information, please contact us, either online or by calling 101, quoting serial 1254 of 30/09.

"You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or report it to them online.
