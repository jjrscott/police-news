Sussex Police has donated Â£2000 to a new food bank being set up in central Hollingdean, Brighton.

The food bank will be based at St Richards church and supported by St Matthias church.

The money came from the Police Property Act Fund (PPAF) - a pot of money made up from the sale of found property and from property confiscated by order of the court and then sold. The Police Property Act Fund aims to support charities and voluntary and community organisations via donations towards local projects in Sussex.

Doug Curties, Project Manager at Hollingdean food bank said: "We are thrilled to have received this funding from Sussex Police to help us set up a food bank in Hollingdean so we can be there for residents in crisis when they need us most.

"We are aware of Hollingdean residents going to food banks in other areas of the city and believe a food bank in the centre of Hollingdean is long overdue".

PCSO Isobel Tugwell said: "Our priority is supporting our local communities and we believe Hollingdean's new food bank is a very worthy cause.

"Nobody should have to go hungry and we hope our donation will help look after residents when they need additional support."

The organisers of the food bank aim to have the service set up by the end of January 2021.
