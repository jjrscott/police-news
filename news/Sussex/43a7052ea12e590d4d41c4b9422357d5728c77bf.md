Police seized a large quantity of cannabis and arrested one man after executing a drugs warrant in Crowborough.

Officers attended an address in Sandridge at 8.30am on Tuesday (September 8) to execute a warrant under the Misuse of Drugs Act.

A large quantity of cannabis was seized, as well as a small number of cannabis plants and associated growing and processing equipment.

Police also found and seized a number of weapons, including a hunting knife and a crossbow.

A 52-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the production of a Class B drug. He has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

The warrant was part of a proactive and positive start for Police Sergeant Gez Neilan in his new role as neighbourhood sergeant for Wealden district.

PS Neilan's arrival is part of a recent uplift in the number of prevention sergeants across Sussex following public investment. He is now one of three dedicated neighbourhood prevention sergeants for Wealden.

He said: "We take concerns around drug dealing very seriously and will continue to target people suspected of dealing drugs within our communities.

"This behaviour causes harm and distress to others who live in the area, and we were pleased to be able to take a significant quantity of drugs off the streets by executing this most recent warrant.

"We ask the public to continue supporting our activity by reporting any suspicious behaviour to us. This can be done online or by calling 101, or people can report information anonymously via the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
