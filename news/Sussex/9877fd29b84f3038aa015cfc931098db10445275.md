Police in Brighton are trying to contact two men who came to the aid of a woman being attacked in a city centre street.

The incident took place at about 11.45pm on an evening between 11 and 14 June when the 30-year-old woman was standing outside Subway in St James Street, Brighton.

A man approached her, grabbed her in a head lock, took her money and phone and then dragged her into Steine Street where he tried to remove her clothing.
â€‹
She was screaming but two men walking by came to her rescue. The offender ran off and the two men then kindly walked her home.

PC Kirstina Neal said; "We are asking these two men and anyone else who saw what happened, to please come forward and talk to us as they may have vital information. Contact us online or by calling 101, quoting serial 539 of 15/06.

"You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."

A 47-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of robbery and sexual assault, and has been released on police bail until 28 July while enquiries continue.

The man and the woman are known to each other.
