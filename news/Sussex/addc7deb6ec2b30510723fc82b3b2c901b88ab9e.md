A man who repeatedly stole from shops in Bexhill town centre and seafront has been banned from entering the premises for the next three years.

On Wednesday (2 December), Hastings and Eastbourne Magistrates' Courts imposed a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) on Daniel Ramsey, 39, of no fixed address, following his conviction for four offences of shoplifting.

He could face a prison sentence for failing to comply with the three-year court order, which also stipulates that he must fully engage with drug and alcohol rehabilitation services and attend all rehabilitation appointments.

Officers from Hastings and Rother Neighbourhood Policing Team gathered evidence for the CBO to address the serious impact of Ramsey's offences on Bexhill businesses.

Inspector Jayantha Mendis-Gunasekera, Hastings and Rother Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "We are committed to protecting retailers from shoplifting, which costs businesses millions of pounds each year. Daniel Ramsey's prolific offending was having a huge impact on many Bexhill shops, and this court result sends a strong message that shoplifting is not acceptable."

The order is in place until December 2023, and bans Ramsay from Bexhill town centre, other than to travel through the area on public transport, and the following specific Bexhill stores where he is previously known to have committed offences:
Sainsburys, Buckhurst Place
Co-Op (Western Road and Devonshire Road)
Tesco Express, Collington Avenue
B&M, Ravenside Retail Park
One Stop, Sea Road
Aldi, London Road
Iceland, Devonshire Road
Lidl, Ninfield

Ramsey is currently in prison for other offences until June 2021.
