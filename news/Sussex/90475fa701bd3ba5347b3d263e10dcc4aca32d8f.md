Police have increased patrols in Littlehampton after receiving several reports of a man driving a black van and approaching young people.

The young people spoken to were able to quickly inform an adult and the matter is being investigated. Nobody has been harmed.

Inspector Jason Parry said: "We are working to establish the full circumstances of these reports.

"We are aware of speculation and commentary on social media and would like to assure the public that incidents such as these are rare and we have upped patrols in the area.

"We would ask members of the public to remain vigilant but not alarmed and that parents speak to their children about not engaging with strangers. Report any incidents to us immediately."

Anyone with information can report online or call 101, quoting 153 of 10/11. In the case of a crime or suspicious incident in action then dial 999.
