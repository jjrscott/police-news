Police are appealing for witnesses after a girl was bitten by a dog in Hastings.

The incident is reported to have happened between 7.30pm and 7.40pm on Saturday 18 July on the grassed area behind Summerfields Leisure Centre on Bohemia Road.

A seven-year-old girl suffered scratches and a puncture wound to her legs after a spaniel jumped up at her back.

The owners of the dog are thought to have left the scene in a vehicle parked in the leisure centre car park.

Officers investigating the incident are keen to hear from anyone who saw what happened, or from anyone who may have any other information relating to the matter.

Anyone wishing to get in touch can do so online or by calling 101 quoting serial 1154 of 19/07.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
