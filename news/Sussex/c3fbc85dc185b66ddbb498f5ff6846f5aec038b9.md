Police in Durrington are appealing for witnesses following reports that a nine-year-old boy was approached by a woman during his walk home from school at approximately 3.45pm on Wednesday (25 November).

The incident occurred close to traffic lights on Columbia Drive, Durrington Worthing. The woman was reported to have put her arms on the boy's shoulders and looked at him, before he pushed her arms off and ran away.

The woman is described as black, approximately 40-years-old and with black wavy hair with a bow.

Sergeant Peter Allan said: "Officers have been patrolling the area following this report and we encourage anyone who may have seen the incident happen, or has any further information, to report online or call 101 quoting serial 0873 of 25/11.

"Our teams have visited the boy and his family and we are working closely with the school to provide advice and reassurance."
