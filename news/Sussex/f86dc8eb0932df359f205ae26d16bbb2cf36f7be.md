Police are appealing to locate the owner of a medal that was reported stolen from a property in East Sussex in 2000.

A member of the public who collects and researches military items reported it to Sussex Police on Friday, 14 August after noticing the stolen medal was for sale at an auction in Newcastle.

The medal is described as a Distinguished Flying medal King George IV and was awarded to 529248 Sergeant Arthur Moy, RAF.

Officers are appealing to anyone who knows who the item may belong to to come forwards.

PC Michelle Holdstock said: "We're enormously grateful to this member of the public for reporting this stolen item to us and we are keen to reunite it with its rightful owner.

"We do not know where this medal has been over the last 20 years and hope that by releasing these images we may help jog someone's memory.

"If you recognise this medal or have any information that may assist with our enquiries please report online or call 101, quoting 185 of 14/08."
