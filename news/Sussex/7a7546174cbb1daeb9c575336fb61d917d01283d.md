Detectives investigating an attempted murder in Shoreham have made three further arrests in connection with the incident.

A 55-year-old local man sustained serious injuries after he was stabbed at an outbuilding in Nicholson Drive at about 10pm on Tuesday 11 February.

Jordan Bell, 19, unemployed, of Grafton Gardens, Sompting, has been remanded in custody charged with attempted murder and is awaiting a court trial in August.

Earlier this month, police carried out three warrants at addresses in Lancing and arrested two men aged 18 and a man aged 19 on suspicion of aggravated burglary in connection with the incident on 11 February. One of the 18-year-old suspects was also arrested on suspicion of handling stolen goods. They have all been released under investigation while further enquiries are carried out.

Police are continuing to appeal for witnesses to the incident and anyone with information is asked to report online or call 101, quoting Operation Waterway.
