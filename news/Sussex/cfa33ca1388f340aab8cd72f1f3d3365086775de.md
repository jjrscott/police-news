A 55-year-old man from Crawley was sadly pronounced dead.

It is thought that the man may have been hit by a vehicle which did not stop at the scene.

Enquiries are underway to establish the cause of death and the full circumstances of the incident.

Anyone with information that could assist with the investigation is asked to report online or call 101, quoting Operation Origin.
