A man has been charged with shoplifting offences and burglary of a residential address following a number of crimes committed in East Sussex earlier this year.

On 12 December, Stephen Wood, 30, unemployed of no fixed address, was charged with stealing over Â£200 of stock from Jempsons in Crown Fields, Rye, in September 2020. He was also charged with burglary after stealing a bicycle from a garage in Icklesham, Winchelsea, on September 22.

He has been bailed with conditions and is due to attend Hastings Magistrates' Court on January 13.

Chris Neilson, Force lead for business crime, said: "Sussex Police will continue to investigate crimes committed against local businesses.

"Regardless of the size of the business, theft and other crimes have a detrimental effect on those businesses and their staff, and ultimately on the local economy, especially with current restrictions placed on the retail sector with the pandemic."
