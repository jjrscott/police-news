A man has been arrested following a fire at a Woodingdean premises.

At 3.55am on Saturday (25 January) Sussex Police were alerted by East Sussex Fire and Rescue to a fire at property in Warren Road, Woodingdean in Brighton.

Residents in neighbouring properties were evacuated while fire crews put out the blaze, which also affected the office space above the premise. No injuries were reported.

Rachel Swinney Chief Inspector for Brighton and Hove said: "Both premises are used as a business and it was fortunate that no one was inside at the time of the fire.

"We are treating the fire as deliberate and targeted and would like to hear from anyone who may have information to assist our investigation.

"Did you notice anyone acting suspiciously in the area before the fire broke out?

"You can report information to us either online or call 101 quoting reference 194 of 25/01."

A 27-year-old man from Brighton has been arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life and making threats to cause or destroy property. He remains in custody at this time and the investigation is ongoing.
