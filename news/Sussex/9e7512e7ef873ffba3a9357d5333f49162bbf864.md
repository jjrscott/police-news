A driver was seriously injured in a road collision near Crowborough.

Police were called at 12.39pm on Thursday (January 7) to reports of a serious collision involving a van and a car on the A26 Eridge Road, just north of Crowborough.

The 35-year-old Kent man driving the car, a silver Seat Toledo, has been flown by air ambulance to Kings College Hospital, London, with serious injuries.

The 51-year-old Kent man driving the van, a yellow Iveco Daily towing a trailer, was unhurt.

The road was closed in both directions for recovery and investigation work. Drivers are thanked for their patience and for following the diversions.

Anyone who saw what happened or who saw either vehicle just beforehand, or who has any dashcam which might assist, is asked to contact police online, by emailing collision.appeal@sussex.pnn.police.uk, or by calling 101, quoting Operation Smallfield.
