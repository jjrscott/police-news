Police are appealing for witnesses following a robbery at Select Convenience in High Street, Hastings.

About 8.53pm on Sunday 28 February, a man entered the store and initially asked for a packet of cigarettes. As the staff worker turned, the suspect walked around the counter and demanded cash from the till. He was in possession of a pair of scissors.

The man left the premises having taken an unknown quantity of cash in notes and coins, which he placed into a white carrier bag along with the cigarettes. He also took a few bottles of whiskey and snatched a RNLI collection tin from the counter, which had been secured with a chain.

Upon leaving, he turned right in the general direction of Ore village. No injuries were reported.

The suspect is described as a man wearing a black hoodie with his hood up and a surgical mask covering his face. He was wearing blue jeans and white trainers, and black gloves on his hands. He was about 5'10" and of medium build.

Police are appealing for anyone with any information about the incident to report it online or call 101, quoting serial 1280 of 28/02.

You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or report it online.
