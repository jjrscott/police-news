Police would like to speak to these five men in relation to the theft of two watches from a jewellers in Eastbourne.

Officers were called to W. Bruford in The Beacon shopping centre around 4.30pm on Tuesday 21 July after two Rolex watches with a combined worth of around Â£70,000 were stolen from the store.

Two women aged 25 and 27 were arrested that same day on suspicion of being concerned in the theft. They have both been released on conditional bail until August 18 while enquires continue.

Police investigating the theft are keen to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident, or who saw any suspicious behaviour in the area at the time.

Officers would particularly like to speak to these five men, as it is believed they may have information that could help police with their enquiries.

Anyone who recognises them, or who has any other information about the matter, is asked to contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 1079 of 21/07.
