Detectives in Brighton are searching for a man who tried to rob a convenience store at knifepoint.

At about 9pm on Tuesday 19 January the man entered the Premier store in Carden Avenue, Brighton, threatened the shop assistant with a large kitchen knife, and demanded money but this was refused and he left empty handed.

The suspect is described as white, about 6', of broad build, wearing a black mask, a black hoody with distinctive white lines on the hood, a black jacket over the hoody and speaking with a local southern accent.

Detective Sergeant Jenny Pietersen said; "If you recognize this man please contact us either online or by calling 101, quoting serial 1193 of 19/01.

"You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
