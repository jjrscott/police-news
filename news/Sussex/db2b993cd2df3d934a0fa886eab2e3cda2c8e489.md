Police are continuing to investigate the circumstances of a fatal collision in Hastings.

Officers were called to the A259 Rye Road around 5.10pm on Tuesday (March 9) to reports of a collision between a car and a pedestrian.

The pedestrian - a 40-year-old local man - was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

Three men were arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. Two of the men have since been released without charge and are assisting police with their enquiries. One man has been released under investigation.

Officers would like to thank all the witnesses that have already come forward to support the investigation. Police continue to appeal for any further witnesses to come forward, particularly anyone who saw any vehicles being driven erratically along the A259 between Rye and Hastings around 5pm on Tuesday.

Anyone with any information, or any relevant dash cam footage, is asked to contact police by emailing collision.appeal@sussex.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101 quoting Operation Starboard.
