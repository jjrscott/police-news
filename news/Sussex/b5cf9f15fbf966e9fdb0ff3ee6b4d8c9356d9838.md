Sussex Police is taking proactive action in Bognor Regis in response to a number of reports of youths behaving in an anti-social way in the area.

Police have received recent reports of youths behaving in an anti-social manner including in Hotham Park and the town centre in addition to a report of a windows smashed at Felpham Sailing Club on Monday (23 November).

Officers will be stepping up proactive patrolling in key areas, with overt and covert activity, identifying key lines of enquiry and working closely with the local authority.

District commander, Chief Inspector Jon Carter said "We are aware of a number of instances of property being damaged in the Bognor Regis area. We are deploying officers both overtly, and where appropriate covertly, to try and prevent offences, and identify those responsible.

"Where there are lines of enquiry that can be pursued, officers we are doing so, and through this work have identified some suspects already. We are working closely with Arun District Council, and where there is sufficient evidence to identify those responsible, we will rigorously pursue them, and will use the full extent of legal powers available to do so.

"As well as prosecutions for offences, this may also include use of preventative community protection powers available under the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act. As the district commander, I will also make proportionate use of dispersal powers, and have already done so for specific areas."

People with information which may assist police in identifying those responsible are asked to report it online or by calling 101.
