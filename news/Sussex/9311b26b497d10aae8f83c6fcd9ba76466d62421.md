Two men have been charged after a vehicle was stolen in Chichester.

Sussex Police were made aware of a burglary at a property in St Pancras, Chichester, in the early hours of Saturday (7 March).

The occupier had gone to bed around 8pm the night before (6 March) and had woken up around 4.10am to find his patio doors were ajar. The victim looked around his flat and discovered his wallet, Â£100 in cash, bank cards, membership cards, his driver's licence, watch, car keys and car were missing.

Shortly after this, at 4.21am on Saturday (7 March), police received a phone call from an off duty police officer to report a car colliding with a street sign near Tangmere roundabout, Chichester, and two men fled from the scene.

Officers, including a dog unit, attended the scene of the collision of the stolen vehicle, conducted an area search and detained two men nearby. Items reported as being stolen from the property were also recovered.

Nathan Moore, 27, of Oving Road, Chichester, and Lee Moore, 42, of no fixed address have both been charged with burglary dwelling and theft, fraud by false representation and aggravated vehicle taking. The pair were remanded in custody and will appear at Crawley Magistrates' Court on Monday (9 March).
