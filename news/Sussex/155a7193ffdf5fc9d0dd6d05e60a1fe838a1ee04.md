Police have made two arrests after a boy was assaulted in Worthing.

Shortly before 5.30pm on Monday (March 15), police received a third-party report of a 15-year-old boy being assaulted by two other young people on The Strand.

Officers attended the scene and identified the victim, who had a minor hand injury as a result of the assault.

An extensive search of the area was carried out but with no trace of the suspects.

Officers then began a number of fast-time enquiries, which led them to arrest two boys aged 14 and 16 on suspicion of grievous bodily harm with intent. They both remain in custody at this time.

Enquiries are ongoing and anyone who saw what happened, or who has any other information, is asked to contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 1101 of 15/03.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
