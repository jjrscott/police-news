Police officers carried out a drugs warrant in Shoreham and uncovered a large scale cannabis factory.

Acting on information from the community, the West Sussex Tactical Enforcement Unit and the Adur and Worthing Neighbourhood Policing Team raided a house in Mill Hill on Sunday (11 October). They found seven separate rooms in the property containing about 700 cannabis plants estimated to be worth around several hundred thousand pounds.

A 24-year-old man was arrested at the premises on suspicion of permitting the production of cannabis, questioned and released on police bail until 7 November.

Adur and Worthing district commander Chief Inspector Sarah Leadbeatter said: "This enforcement activity shows the importance of making the right call and to report anything suspicious to us so that we can respond effectively.

"We were able to disrupt a significant large scale cannabis factory and seize hundreds of plants and drugs which would have ended up being sold on the streets of Sussex.

"Our priority is keeping communities safe and feeling safe and preventing crime."

We take reports of drugs dealing and criminality seriously. Please report online or ring 101 with any information.
