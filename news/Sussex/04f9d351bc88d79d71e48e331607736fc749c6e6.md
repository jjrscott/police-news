Police are urging motorists to be vigilant following a spate of vehicle crime in Crawley.

Over the past four weeks, a total of 34 incidents of thefts from vehicles have been reported in the town.

Typically, the offender - or offenders - will force entry to the vehicle by smashing a side window, and steal items including small change and anything of value.

Police are investigating this as a linked series, and have made three arrests so far.

Inspector Darren Taylor, of the Crawley and Mid Sussex Prevention Team, said: "While the value of items stolen may be small in the majority of cases, it goes without saying that the cost to repair the damage caused by a vehicle break-in can be expensive and inconvenient.

"Make sure you don't leave anything of any value in your vehicle, and specifically not on display.

"Our enquiries are ongoing, and we're urging anyone with any information - or anyone who is the victim of crime - to report it online or call 101."

A 39-year-old woman from Crawley, arrested on suspicion of theft from a vehicle and fraud by false representation, has been released on conditional bail until 22 October.

A 25-year-old man from Crawley, arrested on suspicion of theft from a vehicle, has been released on conditional bail until 22 October.

A 35-year-old woman from Crawley, arrested on suspicion of theft from a vehicle, has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.
