Police are appealing for witnesses in connection with an attempted robbery in broad daylight in Bexhill.

A 17-year-old local boy was walking along Endwell Road around 1.30pm on Sunday 15 November, when a white Transit-style van pulled alongside him.

The passenger demanded the boy handed over his bag, and threatened to use violence if he did not do so.

The boy refused and the suspect subsequently exited the van and tried to snatch the bag from him. He also hit him around the face with an unknown metal object he had in his hand.

Following this, the suspect got back into the van, which headed off in the direction of the railway station.

The victim sustained a minor cut to his eye, but nothing was stolen.

Following enquiries, a 16-year-old boy from Bexhill was arrested on suspicion of robbery. He has been released on conditional bail until 13 December, pending further enquiries.

Police are urging any witnesses or anyone who is able to identify the vehicle involved to report it online or call 101, quoting serial 638 of 15/11.

You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or report it online.
