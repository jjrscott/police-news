Despite having access to the latest technology, our greatest search tool often comes in the form of four legs, a fluffy tail and a wet nose.

Meet Police Dog Finn, who took just three minutes to find a vulnerable man missing in dense woodland in Faygate, near Horsham.

Police were alerted after the subject was reported to be intoxicated and wearing only a dressing gown in the early hours of Tuesday 17 November.

A number of officers searched the woods for around an hour, but without success, and called in the Dog Unit.

Dog handler PC West attended with her canine counterpart to assist. PD Finn put his nose to work and they managed to locate the man lying on the floor just minutes later. He was taken to a place of safety.

PC West, of the Surrey and Sussex Police Dog Unit, said: "PD Finn is a five-and-a-half-year-old German Shepherd general purpose police dog, who is trained to search for people and property. He is a cheeky chappie and loves being at work supporting officers in the best way he can.

"Our role is not always about catching criminals; in this case, PD Finn has potentially saved the life of a vulnerable man and I'm very proud of him."
