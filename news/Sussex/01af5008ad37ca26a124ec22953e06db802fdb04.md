Police are appealing for witnesses after a boy was robbed in Burgess Hill.

The 15-year-old victim was riding his bicycle along London Road around 11.30pm on Friday 11 September when he was approached by a group of boys, one of whom forcibly took his bicycle from him.

A member of the public intervened and returned the bike to the victim.

Police investigating the robbery are keen to hear from anyone who saw what happened, and in particular the woman who stepped in to help the victim.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 1594 of 11/09.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
