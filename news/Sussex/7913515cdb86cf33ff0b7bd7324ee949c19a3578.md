Police are investigating what is suspected to have been deliberate arson at a farm in Slinfold, in which livestock died.

A large barn was reported on fire in off the A264 at Ranfold Oak Farm, Five Oaks Road, Slinfold, shortly after 9.30pm on the evening of Thursday, 10 December. One person was taken to hospital after suffering from smoke inhalation.

The barn was destroyed and two calves which were being reared, as well as a large number of turkeys, were lost in the fire.

Farm machinery was also destroyed or badly damaged and another outbuilding was damaged.

Investigator Sarah Tolley said; "This was a large fire and it would have been visible for some distance. Anyone who was in the area at the time and who may have seen someone acting suspiciously is asked to contact us online or ring 101 quoting serial 1397 of 10/12."
