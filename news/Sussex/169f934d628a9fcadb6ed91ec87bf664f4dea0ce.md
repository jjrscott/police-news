A man who burgled three homes in one night just three weeks after being let out of prison has been sent back to jail.

Daniel Passmore, 26, unemployed, of no fixed address, was convicted of three counts of burglary and theft when he appeared at Brighton Magistrates' Court on April 22.

Passmore was arrested by officers investigating burglaries at three homes in the Langney area of Eastbourne overnight on Saturday, April 18 - one in Sevenoaks Road and two in Cornish Close.

He was captured on CCTV from a house next door to one of the victims, trying door handles at that address before moving on to the victim's property.

All three burglaries happened while the occupants were present and sleeping upstairs. Some of the items stolen included handbags and purses containing bank cards and cash, cigarettes and trainers.

A few days previously, on Thursday 16 April, Passmore had also been found driving a stolen car around the Langney area. He admitted taking the vehicle without the owner's consent, and to driving without insurance or a licence.

On Tuesday 7 July, Passmore was sentenced to four years for each burglary, to run concurrently. He was also sentenced to four months for taking a motor vehicle without consent, to run consecutively.

Detective Constable Jonathan Moore said: "Daniel Passmore is a prolific criminal and we're pleased to see he has been taken off the streets for a good length of time."
