Police are seeking to identify two women after a car collided with a wall, causing a significant amount of damage.

The incident involving a grey Vauxhall Zafira occurred in Park Road, Burgess Hill, about 1.55pm on 13 June.

It crashed through a surrounding fence and into the main structure wall of a children's nursery, which was closed at the time. No injuries were reported.

The two occupants of the car - both women wearing white dresses with bold flowers on them - made off from the scene.

Anyone with dash cam, CCTV or video footage which could assist in identifying the two women involved, is asked to email collision.appeal@sussex.pnn.police.uk quoting serial 734 of 13/06.
