A Hastings man has been sentenced for thefts from an East Sussex post office where he worked.

Ian Doe, 50, of Woodlands Way, Hastings, was sentenced to 14 months imprisonment suspended for two years at Hove Crown Court on Wednesday 6 January, having previously pleaded guilty to the theft of £976 cash and food from the post office at Burwash in 2019.

He was also ordered to pay £2000 compensation to the owner of the Post Office, plus £400 costs, to carry out 200 hours unpaid work, 20 hours rehabilitation work, and to make a donation to Witness Care.

Doe was working as a part-time assistant at the combined post office and village shop in the village, for the Post Office Sub-Postmaster who also runs the shop.

The prosecution, authorised by the CPS, followed an investigation by detectives from the East Sussex Community Investigations Team. Detective Constable Nick Arthur said; "Ian Doe used his good standing within the community to blind people to his criminal activities, but today justice has been served with this conviction."
