Police in Arun are conducting targeted work to deter drug dealers from settling in the area.

Officer conducted a warrant and welfare check on a property in New Road, Littlehampton, on Wednesday morning (13 May).

Prevention Sergeant Christine Holyoake said: "Despite there being no drugs or suspects in this property, drug issues have a huge impact on the community and we want to send out a strong message that we will not tolerate this type of behaviour.

"The proactive policing we have been conducting to stamp out this behaviour will continue to ensure we are creating a hostile environment for drug dealers.

"Our aim is for these people to realise that we are here, we are tackling this issue and people involved in this criminality will be dealt with accordingly.

The warrant was conducted after intelligence was received to believe drug dealing was occurring at the property and people may be being cuckooed.

PS Christine added: "More often than not, drug dealers will target the homes of vulnerable people, a term we call cuckooing.

"Cuckooing means the criminals can operate from a property rather than on the street, making them less easy to identify, and often they move between different properties to cover their activity.

"When we believe cuckooing is taking place, we will work closely with partner agencies to ensure the relevant support is provided to those involved.

"If you would like to report drug issues in your area please report it to us online or call 101."
