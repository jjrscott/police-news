Road closures will be in place in Ditchling on Friday (July 10) for the funeral of Dame Vera Lynn.

The closures will affect B2112 Common Lane; B2112 North End; B2112 High Street; B2112 South Street; Beacon Road; Upper Beacon Road; and Ditchling Road, between the hours of 9am and 12.30pm. This is to allow the funeral procession to pass through the village safely.

Inspector James Scott of the Roads Policing Unit said: "Public safety is our priority and these road closures, alongside a small police presence in the village on the day, are in place to protect the community and help ensure the safe and smooth running of Dame Vera Lynn's funeral.

"We thank everyone in advance for their patience and cooperation during these closures."
