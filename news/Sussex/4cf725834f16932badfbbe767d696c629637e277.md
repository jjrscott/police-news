James Hutton, who was wanted for absconding from prison, has been arrested and recalled to prison.

The 30-year-old was reported missing from HMP Ford on Tuesday 14 July, where he was serving a sentence for burglary, assault on an emergency worker and dangerous driving.

He was arrested in Eastbourne on Sunday 26 July on suspicion of escaping from lawful custody, and was remanded to appear before Brighton Magistrates' Court the following day (Monday 27 July).

The case has been sent for trial at Lewes Crown Court on 24 August.
