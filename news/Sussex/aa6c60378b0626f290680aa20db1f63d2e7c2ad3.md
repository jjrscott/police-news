A man has been jailed for three years for burgling a house in Hastings after fingerprint evidence linked him to the crime.

Billy Kent, 20, of Wishing Tree Road in St Leonards, was sentenced at Lewes Crown Court on Tuesday (8 September).

Officers attended a property in Bexhill Road on 29 June following a report of a burglary overnight. The victim had gone to bed about 10.30pm on 28 June and awoken at 06.45am the following morning to find an I-pad, Â£30 cash and some tobacco had been stolen.

The victim discovered the kitchen window and all kitchen drawers had been opened, the bins in front of the property had been moved and the key to the side gate was found discarded outside after being left on the kitchen counter before bed.

Forensic teams attended the property and found a fingerprint on the ridge of the kitchen window matching that of Billy Kent.

He was arrested by officers on 7 August and interviewed. The Crown Prosecution Service authorised the charge of burglary and Kent was remanded in custody until his appearance in Crown Court.

PC Ciaran Gaymer said: "Burglary can be a devastating crime. It is not just about the items that were taken, it can leave victims feeling uneasy after knowing someone broke into their home - which should be a place of safety.

"We are pleased the courts acknowledged the impact this crime has had by serving Kent with a three year sentence."
