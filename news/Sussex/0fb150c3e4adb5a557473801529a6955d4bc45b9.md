Can you identify these two men?

Police are seeking witnesses to an incident outside a Crawley superstore in which a 23-year-old local man was racially abused and assaulted.

At about 4.50 pm on Wednesday 1 July as he walked through the car park at Tesco in Hazlewick Avenue, the victim was involved in an unprovoked altercation with two men who were passengers in white Transit van. The men got out and came up to the victim near the ATM, shouting and swearing at him. One of them then punched him, knocking his glasses off. The two suspects then left the scene in the van which was being driven by a third man.

The victim had gone to Tesco on foot to purchase gifts for a family birthday party later that evening. He was not physically injured but was left shaken and upset by the incident.

Investigator Jools Whittaker-Jones said; "There were a lot of shoppers around at the time of this incident who would have been aware of the shouting.

"Anyone who saw or heard what happened or videoed this incident, or who recognises these two men, is asked to contact us either online or by calling 101, quoting serial 1028 of 01/07."
