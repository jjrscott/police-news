Police are appealing for witnesses to a fatal collision involving a single vehicle on the A27 at Hammerpot Hill near Arundel.

A blue Vauxhall Astra was travelling Eastbound when it left the road, flipped over and caught fire at about 5.15pm on Thursday (30 July). Despite the efforts of the emergency services, the driver of the vehicle - a man in his 20s - sadly died at the scene. Next of kin have been informed.

Police would like to hear from anyone who saw what happened and in particular anyone who has any dash cam footage.

You can report information to assist our investigation either by calling 101 or emailing collision.appeal@sussex.pnn.police.uk quoting Operation Custom.
