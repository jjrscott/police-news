Police are appealing for witnesses to come forwards following a disturbance in Chichester.

Officers were called to Bishop Luffa Close about 7.30pm on Thursday (7 January) to report of three men in possession of bats making threats to a man.

The victim - a 21-year-old man - was unharmed.

Three men - aged 18, 19, and 20 - were arrested on suspicion of violent disorder and have been bailed while enquiries are ongoing.

The victim and suspects are understood to be known to each other.

PS West from Chichester Neighbourhood Policing Team said: "Although this is an isolated incident officers and PCSOs from the Neighbourhood Policing Team will be increasing patrols of the area to provide reassurance to local residents over the coming days."

Anyone with information or who witnessed what happened is asked to report online or call 101 and quote 1163 of 07/01.
