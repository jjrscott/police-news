A cannabis factory with around 180 plants was found and dismantled by police in Eastbourne.

Officers were called to reports of a disturbance at a property in Dursley Road around 2am on Wednesday (December 16).

Upon attendance, they discovered large quantities of cannabis inside the address, alongside around 180 cannabis plants. The estimated street value of the cannabis seized is around Â£81,000.

A 42-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of producing a controlled Class B drug, and entering the United Kingdom without a passport. He remains in custody at this time.

Three men - two aged 23 and one aged 20 - were also arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary with intent and grievous bodily harm with intent in relation to the initial disturbance. They've been released on conditional bail while enquiries continue.

Chief Inspector Di Lewis, district commander for Eastbourne, said: "This was a significant disruption, with a large quantity of cannabis plants being seized and a factory set-up being dismantled.

"Even though the initial call in this instance was related to another offence, our officers were diligent and thorough with their enquiries and this resulted in further offences being identified.

"We will continue to take action against those bringing harmful drugs into our communities. Anyone who sees any suspicious activity in their area is urged to report it to us so we can respond effectively."

Reports can be made to police online, by calling 101 or anonymously via the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
