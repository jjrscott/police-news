A man has been charged after new evidence emerged in the investigation into a double fatal house fire in Eastbourne.

Andrew Milne has been charged with the murder of 34-year-old Gina Ingles and her four-year-old son Milo Ingles-Bailey, and the attempted murder of 28-year-old Toby Jarrett.

It follows the tragic incident at a house in Croxden Way, which occurred just before 1am on Tuesday 10 July, 2018.

Detective Inspector Gordon Denslow, of the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team, said: "Following a review of evidence presented to them by the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team, the Crown Prosecution Service has authorised charges for two counts of murder, and one of attempted murder.

"We are unable to disclose any further details at this time, to ensure any defendants have the right to a fair trial."

Milne, 42, from, Hastings, was arrested in the early hours of Tuesday 28 July and was remanded in custody, to appear before Brighton Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 29 July.

The case was sent to Lewes Crown Court, where the defendant will appear via video link, on Thursday 30 July. He remains in custody.

A 28-year-old woman from Hastings, who was arrested on the same morning, on suspicion of committing an act or series of acts with intent to pervert the course of justice, has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

In January, a 30-year-old man from St Leonards was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder. He has been released on conditional bail until 7 August.

Det Insp Denslow added: "This has been a long and complex investigation, and we remain committed to bringing those responsible for this tragic incident to justice on behalf of the loved ones of Gina, Milo and Toby."

Anyone with any information about the investigation is urged to report it online or call 101, quoting Operation Druffield.
