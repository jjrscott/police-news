Police are searching for a young man who attempted to rob two men in a Horsham street.

At about 10pm on Monday 5 October in Station Road, Horsham, near the junction with Depot Road, the suspect approached the pair, both in their twenties, as they were walking to their homes. He threatened them, said he had a knife though one was not seen, demanded contents of their pockets and tried to grab a bag belonging to one of the men, punching them both as he did so.

However both men broke free of him and ran off.

The suspect is described as white, about 6'3", very skinny, in his late teens or early 20's, with a dark blue or black jacket described as a navy Harrington style, and a beige or black cap with red writing on it. He was smoking a roll-up as he approached the victims.

PC Katrina Brown Douglas said; "If you saw what happened if if you have any information about the suspect please contact us online or by calling 101, quoting serial 1403 of 05/10."
