A man arrested in connection with an incident outside a Brighton school has been released from custody with strict bail conditions, as police enquiries continue.

It follows a report of a man with a machete outside Brighton Aldridge Community Academy on Thursday 17 September, just before 3pm.

Officers responded to the scene and remained at the school to ensure students were able to leave safely.

A 24-year-old man from Brighton was arrested the following day (Friday 18 September) on suspicion of affray. He has since been released on bail with strict conditions until 14 October, as enquiries continue.
