Police in Brighton want to talk to these two women over the theft of a bank card and a mobile phone in a city centre pub.

On Saturday evening, 16 November, a couple who had been in a pub in Ship Street left at about 9.15pm but when they got home realised that one of them had left their coat and contents at the pub.

They called the pub and the coat was put to one side for collection the following day.

However by Sunday it was discovered that a bank card and a mobile pone had been taken from the coat and that the card had been fraudulently used during the very early hours of Sunday morning at locations in the city.

These two women were seen during transactions at one of the shops, a nearby convenience store.

If you recognise them, please contact the police online or by calling 101, quoting serial 792 of 17/11.

For advice on how to help keep your belongings safe when out and about, see the Sussex Police website.
