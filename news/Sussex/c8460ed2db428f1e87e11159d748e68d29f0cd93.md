Police are appealing for witnesses to a burglary at a house in Hailsham.

Officers were called on Tuesday (November 24) to reports of a break-in at a property on The Grove.

The burglary is known to have happened sometime between Friday evening (November 20) and Tuesday morning, with initial enquiries leading police to believe it took place on the Monday night (November 23).

Nobody was present in the house at the time, but tools worth more than Â£2,000 were taken from inside the premises. This includes a number of Hitachi products - a drill, impact driver, circular saw, grinder, jigsaw, SDS drill, batteries and a charger - as well as a Makita mitre saw, site radio, track saw and pneumatic brad gun. A Paslode nail gun was also stolen.

Police investigating the matter are keen to hear from anyone who saw what happened, saw any suspicious behaviour in the area at the time or who may come across any of the products mentioned.

Officers would also like to speak to anyone who may have any relevant CCTV, doorbell or dash cam footage from the area, particular from The Avenue.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 1376 of 24/11. Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
