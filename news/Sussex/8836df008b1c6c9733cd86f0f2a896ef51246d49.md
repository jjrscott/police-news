A man has appeared in court after police uncovered an alleged large scale cannabis factory at a house in Bexhill.

Officers responded to information from the public about the distinctive aroma of cannabis coming from the house in London Road, Bexhill on the morning of Monday 18 January, and immediately called at the address. They discovered two rooms containing cannabis in various stages of cultivation, with a total estimated potential street value of more than Â£60,000.

Donard Llubani, 29, unemployed of no fixed address, was charged with production of cannabis and abstracting electricity. He appeared in custody at Brighton Magistrates Court on Wednesday 20 January and was remanded in custody to appear at Crown Court on 16 February.
