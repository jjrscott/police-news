A Bognor Regis man who breached his Criminal Behaviour Order has been jailed for eight months.

Michael Jones, 26 of High Street, Bognor, appeared at Brighton Magistrates' Court on Monday, 15 June, to face two charges of breaching a criminal behaviour order.

Jones was issued with a three-year CBO by Worthing Magistrate Court on 18 March which prevents him from entering Bognor Regis town centre.

Despite this, Jones was spotted by a PCSO on patrol in Lennox Street on Thursday, 4 June, a street which he is not permitted to be in.

He was then seen for a second time in a non-permitted area on Monday, 8 June, leaving a property. When Jones saw the police officers he ran off and jumped over a fence but he was quickly caught by officers and arrested.

Jones was remanded on bail and given a 32-week custodial sentence by the courts.

Prevention Inspector for Arun, Jason Parry said: "Jones showed complete disregard for the CBO issued to him from the courts and we welcome the sentence he has been given.

"The team worked incredibly hard to put together the case file for a CBO application and I am please the courts have acknowledge this poor behaviour by breaching it so soon after it was issued.

"CBOs are available for persistent and repeat offenders whose criminal, nuisance and/or anti-social behaviour continually impacts on the community. This behaviour is unacceptable and we will continue to utilise the powers available to use to ensure this behaviour is prevented."
