Police investigating the murder of Jacqueline Hoadley at her home in Eastbourne have appealed to local householders and car drivers to check CCTV and dashcams to assist their enquiries.

Detective Chief Inspector Andy Wolstenholme from the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team said: "We are particularly interested to establish the movements of a distinctive silver grey Renault Master wheelchair accessible vehicle with a nearside opening side door and blacked out windows on the sides and rear.

"If you have any CCTV or dashcam footage from Eastbourne during the period from 11pm on Saturday to 2am on Sunday (July 4-5) we would like to hear from you and request a copy. The areas that we are interested in are particularly around Shinewater and the seafront, so anyone who was out and about in the area at the time and saw such a vehicle is encouraged to call in and let us know."

You can upload any relevant videos or if you have any other information about the incident or the circumstances surrounding it, you can report online or call 101 quoting Operation Maytree.

The body of 58-year-old Mrs Hoadley was discovered in her home in Broad Oak Close just before 2pm on Sunday (July 5).

A 62-year-old man from Eastbourne was arrested in Chailey on Sunday afternoon and remains in police custody for questioning. On Wednesday afternoon (July 8), magistrates granted detectives a warrant of further detention for 24 hours.
