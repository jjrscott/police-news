Police are appealing for witnesses after a series of deliberate fires in Eastbourne.

Officers are investigating four fires in the space of two weeks - three of these have been at the Alexandra Arms pub in Seaside in the early hours of July 2, the evening of July 8 and the early hours of July 11. The fourth fire was at a disused property in nearby Fort Lane around 11.30pm on Wednesday (July 15).

No one has been injured during any of the fires, but extensive damage has been caused to the buildings.

Detectives are conducting numerous enquiries to determine who is responsible for the fires.

They are keen to hear from anyone who may have any CCTV footage or dash cam footage from the area at the time of the fires, or anyone who has recently seen any suspicious behaviour in the vicinity.

One suspect is described as a white man, of slim build, wearing a grey and white hooded top, and grey and white tracksuit bottoms. Two other suspects are described as wearing dark clothing.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 130 of 11/07.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Arson and deliberate fires are taken very seriously by the fire service, the police and the ambulance service, as they endanger lives and divert valuable resources.

The emergency services work closely together, and with Crimestoppers, local authorities and neighbourhood watch schemes, to reduce the number of arsons and deliberate fires in our communities.
