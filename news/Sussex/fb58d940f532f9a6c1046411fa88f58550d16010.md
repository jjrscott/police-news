A second man has been charged in connection with a double fatal house fire in Eastbourne.

It follows the tragic incident in Croxden Way, just before 1am on Tuesday 10 July, 2018, in which Gina Ingles, 34, and her son Milo Ingles-Bailey, four, died, and Gina's partner Toby Jarrett was seriously injured.

John Tabakis, 30, from Hastings, was arrested in connection with the investigation on 15 January and released on conditional bail. He has since been charged with perverting the course of justice and remanded in custody to appear before Brighton Magistrates' Court on Thursday 20 August.

Andrew Milne, 42, from, Hastings, also remains remanded in custody, charged with two counts of murder and one of attempted murder. He is next scheduled to appear before Lewes Crown Court on 28 August.

A 28-year-old woman from Hastings, arrested on suspicion of committing an act or series of acts with intent to pervert the course of justice, remains released under investigation, pending further enquiries.

Anyone with any information about the investigation is urged to report it online or call 101, quoting Operation Druffield.
