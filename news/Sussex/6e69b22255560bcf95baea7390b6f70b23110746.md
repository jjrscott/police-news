Police are appealing for information after a man was assaulted in Crawley.

Officers were called to Kilnmead around 11.20pm on Wednesday (August 5) to reports of a man being attacked. The victim suffered serious facial injuries requiring hospital treatment.

The suspect is described as white, approximately 6' 1" with very pale skin and black cropped hair. He is thought to be between 25 and 30 years old, and was wearing a black tracksuit with a shiny black stripe down the sides of the legs.

He left the scene in a vehicle, thought to be a white Ford Fiesta van.

Anyone who saw what happened, or who saw either the suspect or the vehicle in the area at the time, is asked to contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 1617 of 05/08.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
