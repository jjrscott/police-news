A Crawley-based special needs school has received a cash boost from Gatwick Police.

The Â£500 donation will help to fund a new playground project for equipment for disabled children at Manor Green College, enabling them to be physically active.

The money has come from the Police Property Act Fund (PPAF) - a pot of money made up from the sale of found property and from property confiscated by order of the court, and then sold.
