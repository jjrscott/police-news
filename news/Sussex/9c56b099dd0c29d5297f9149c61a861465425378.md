Police are appealing for witnesses after a crash was caused by wood which fell from a lorry on the A27.

The incident occurred on the westbound carriageway between Hollingbury and Patcham just after 9am today (Thursday 25 March), causing two vehicles to collide.

Each vehicle contained adults and young children, but thankfully no serious injuries were reported.

We're urging anyone who saw what happened - in particular anyone with dash cam footage - to email collision.appeal@sussex.pnn.police.uk quoting serial 333 of 25/03.
