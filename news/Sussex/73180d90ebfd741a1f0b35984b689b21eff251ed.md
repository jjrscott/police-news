The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) has confirmed it is investigating after Sussex Police made a voluntary referral following an incident in Montpelier Road, Brighton, on 7 July. Video footage was shared widely on social media of the arrest and restraint of a man on the ground.

After body worn video footage in relation to the whole interaction was seen by the IOPC and Sussex Police's Professional Standards Department (PSD), it was decided that Sussex Police would solely refer the matter relating to an interaction prior to the restraint in the street, which did not form part of the published video.

A male officer, stationed at Brighton and Hove, is being investigated by the IOPC for misconduct. The officer has not been suspended but is working non-public facing duties pending the outcome of the IOPC investigation.

Advice was sought from specialist staff safety trainers in relation to the restraint and the technique used, which is approved by the Home Office, and this was considered appropriate and proportionate.

An investigation by Sussex PSD into a second video shared showing an arrest in York Road, Brighton on 26 June, concluded that there were no misconduct issues.
