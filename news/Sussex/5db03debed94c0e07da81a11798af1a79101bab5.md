Police are reminding dog owners to control their pets near livestock after a pregnant sheep was killed in a field in West Sussex.

The incident happened at Nyewood, near South Harting, on Thursday morning 25 March, where an unknown dog got into a field containing a dozen sheep, all of which were all in lamb, killing one ewe and injuring another.

PCSO Colin Booker said; "These particular sheep were not part of a farm or business, they were all pets owned locally and had been raised since they were lambs.

"The ewe that was killed had been bottle-fed by a 12-year-old girl who had been looking after the ewe since it was born and she is is understandably devastated.

"We urge dog owners to take the necessary steps to prevent sheep worrying by keeping their dogs on a lead while in rural areas near livestock.

"In addition to the human distress and animal suffering that is caused, an owner can legally shoot a dog that is chasing livestock and seek compensation from the person responsible for the animal, so please don't take the risk and keep your dog on a lead if in doubt."

The incident remains under investigation and police would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident or has any information to report online or call 101 quoting serial 280 of 25/03.
