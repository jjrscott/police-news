Police are appealing for witnesses to a fatal collision on the Washington Road at Steyning close to Wiston House on Christmas Eve night (Thursday 24 December).

Emergency services were called to the collision at 10.40pm involving a silver BMW which had been travelling west, left the road and collided with a tree. Despite the efforts of the responders, a 21-year-old man from Horsham sadly died at the scene.

Police remained at the scene for six hours for investigation and recovery to take place. The road will remain closed this morning (Friday 25 December) to allow highways to clear the carriageway.

Police are working to establish the circumstances of the collision and are appealing for witnesses to email collision.appeal@sussex.pnn.police.ukâ€¬ or ring 101 quoting Operation Finchley.
