A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a woman's body was discovered inside a house in Eastbourne.

Police and ambulance paramedics were called to Broad Oak Close at 1.59pm on Sunday (July 5) after a visitor to the house raised the alarm. The woman had suffered serious injuries and was sadly declared dead at the scene.

Around an hour later, a 62-year-old man from Eastbourne was detained by police officers at Chailey and arrested on suspicion of murder. He remained in custody on Sunday evening.

It is understood that the woman was known to the man and police are not currently looking for anyone else in connection with her death. Nobody else was injured.
