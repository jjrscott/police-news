Police are appealing for witnesses after an aggravated burglary in Hastings.

Officers were called to a property in Brackendale around 11.40pm on Thursday (August 20) to reports of two men entering and threatening the occupant with a firearm.

Around Â£2,000 in cash was taken from the address. The occupant was not injured, but was left very shaken by the incident.

The two men had their faces covered and were wearing tracksuits, one grey and one dark blue.

Police investigating the matter are keen to hear from anyone who saw any suspicious behaviour in the area, in particular from two men in tracksuits, between 11.30pm on August 20 and 00.15am on August 21.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 1678 of 20/08.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
