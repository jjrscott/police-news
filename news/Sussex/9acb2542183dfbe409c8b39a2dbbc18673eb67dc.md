A man who pleaded guilty to committing offences of racially or religiously aggravated criminal damage by daubing graffiti on buildings in Hove has been ordered to stay in his home overnight and pay compensation.

Bahman Khorsandian, 77, of Hogarth Road, Hove, appeared at Hove Crown Court on 19 June and admitted the offences after police carried out an investigation into 80 reports of anti-Islamic graffiti being daubed on homes and businesses in George Street, Church Road, Blatchington Road, Portland Road and Western Road between October 2018 and June 2019.

Khorsandian was captured on CCTV committing the offences and he was arrested after police issued a CCTV image and appeal to identify him on social media. When the graffiti was translated it was deemed to be offensive.

After appearing at Hove Crown Court on 17 July, Khorsandian was sentenced to a community order to remain at his home between the hours of 10pm to 8pm for eight months and to be electrically monitored, banned from possessing any material which could be used for graffiti in a public place for two years and ordered to pay Â£1,200 compensation to the city council for the cost of removing the graffiti.

Chief Inspector Dee Wells said: "We take all reports of hate crime seriously and will be robust in dealing with this offences. This graffiti was criminal damage and offensive to some members of our local community."
