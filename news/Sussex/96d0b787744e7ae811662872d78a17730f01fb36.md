A man has been arrested following a six hour standoff with police in Worthing.

Officers, including armed officers, and other emergency services attended a property in Broadwater Street West around 8.35am on Thursday (16 January) following concerns for a man who was threatening to harm himself.

The man refused to come out of the flat for police until just before 2.30pm when he was subsequently arrested on suspicion of making threats to kill and threats to cause criminal damage. He remains in custody while the investigation is ongoing.

Adur and Worthing Chief Inspector Sarah Leadbeatter, said: "We would like to thank the public for their patience while we were dealing with this incident and apologise for any inconvenience caused by part of the road being closed.

"This was an isolated incident, not involving a firearm, contained within the property with no wider threat to the community, including the local schools."
