Police are seeking to identify this person in connection with a burglary in Worthing.

A red leather handbag containing a bank card was stolen from a house in Canterbury Road, Tarring, on the afternoon of Wednesday 27 May.

The card was then used to make purchases from The Wine Shop, in nearby South Street, around 5.10pm the same day.

Police have released a CCTV image of the suspect and are asking anyone who recognises them to report it online or call 101, quoting serial 1296 of 08/06.
