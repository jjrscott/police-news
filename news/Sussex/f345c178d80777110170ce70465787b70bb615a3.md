Police are seeking witnesses to a late-night attack on a teenage boy in Brighton city centre.

At 12.40am on Tuesday (25 August) a report was received that the 17-year-old boy had been found with facial injuries, having been attacked by the skate park at The Level in Brighton, at some time since 11.30pm on the Monday evening.

The boy, who does not come from Brighton, was treated for his injuries at hospital. He had been punched in the face several times and lost a tooth, and had cuts inside his mouth and bruising on his face and right arm and shoulder.

Nothing was reported stolen.
