Police have made two arrests in connection with catalytic converter thefts in West Sussex.

About 2am on Tuesday (26 January), officers stopped a vehicle on the A259 near Arundel suspected to be involved in thefts.

Officers conducted a search of the vehicle and located four catalytic converters in a concealed area accessed via the rear seat.

Two men - aged 32 and 54 - were arrested on suspicion of theft from a motor vehicle and remain in custody for questioning.

DCI Simon Dunn said: "Catalytic converter theft can have a serious financial impact on victims and we are taking targeted action against thieves.

"There are a number of measures people can take to deter thieves, including parking in a secure or well-lit area and considering locks or guards.

"We also encourage people to continue reporting any thefts to us, so we can build a picture of the crimes and respond effectively."

Anyone who has been a victim of a catalytic converter theft, or who may have any other information including relevant CCTV, doorbell or dash cam footage, is asked to contact police. This can be done either online or by calling 101. Always dial 999 in an emergency.
