Two men were arrested after police pursued a vehicle in Brighton on Wednesday night (September 16).

Officers were made aware of a suspicious vehicle in the area, which they tracked to Coldean Lane. However, when they signalled for the vehicle to pull over, it failed to do so and a pursuit ensued.

It ended a short while later when the vehicle reversed into the police car twice, before the driver then decamped. No one was injured during the collisions.

A man was arrested on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle, two counts of theft from a motor vehicle, drug driving and possession of a controlled Class B drug. He remains in custody at this time.

A second man was also arrested on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle, two counts of theft from a motor vehicle, and possession of a controlled Class B drug. He remains in custody at this time.
