A property in St Leonards associated with violence, anti-social behaviour and drug issues has been shut down under a closure order.

The order, under the Anti-Social Behaviour Crime and Policing Act 2014, was heard before Hastings Magistrates' Court on Tuesday (November 17). It prevents anyone from entering the premises in Lovat Mead for three months from November 17.

The address has been associated with anti-social behaviour and crime for a number of months, with officers executing two positive drugs warrants at the premises. Police have also received various reports of assaults at the address, and other continued criminal activity.

Chief Inspector Sarah Godley, Hastings and Rother district commander, said: "The closure of a property in Lovat Mead follows a number of incidents of anti-social behaviour, drug issues and assaults at the location over recent months.

"We listened to the concerns from residents regarding the problems the occupants and those visiting the flat have been causing, and this closure will help prevent this behaviour from continuing.

"We were able to work closely with local authorities to ensure the closure order was granted by the courts. We will continue to robustly tackle issues which affect our communities the most and urge you to report matters of concern to us to ensure relevant action can be taken."

People can report incidents to police either online or by calling 101. Always dial 999 in an emergency.
