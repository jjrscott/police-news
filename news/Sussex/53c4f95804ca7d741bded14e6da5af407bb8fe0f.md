Police are appealing for witnesses to a fight outside a store in Battle Road, Hastings.

Officers were called to what at first was thought to be a car accident near the junction with Old Harrow Road and Battle Road, around 6.15pm on Monday (10 August).

Two men were seen fighting in the Co-op car par after which a car driven by one of them was reported to have rammed the other's car before driving off.

Both men sustained injuries and later that evening police arrested a 40-year-old man at an address in the town in suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm, criminal damage and driving whist unfit through drink. After being interviewed he was released on police bail until 7 September while enquiries continue.

Enquiries also continue to trace the other man believed to be involved.

Detective Constable Ian Dearling said; "If you saw this incident, and maybe also have footage of it, or if you have any other information, please contact us either online or by calling 101, quoting serial 1331 of 10/08.
