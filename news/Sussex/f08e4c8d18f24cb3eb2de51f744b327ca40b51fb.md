Police are appealing for witnesses to a fatal collision on the A259 in Hastings.

Officers were called to the A259 Rye Road around 5.10pm on Tuesday (March 9) to reports of a collision between a car and a pedestrian.

The pedestrian - a 40-year-old local man - was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

Three men have been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and all remain in custody at this time.

Investigating officers are appealing for any witnesses to the collision, or anyone who saw a blue Ford Fiesta and a black Ford Fiesta being driven in the area at that time, to get in touch.

They would particularly like to hear from anyone who may have any relevant dash cam footage.

Information can be passed to police by emailing collision.appeal@sussex.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101 quoting Operation Starboard.
