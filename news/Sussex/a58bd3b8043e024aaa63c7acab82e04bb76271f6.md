Police re searching for two suspects after a man was attacked in Crawley.

At 2pm on Thursday (10 September) the 20-year-old local man was walking his dog by Ifield Mill Pond when he was approached by a man who demanded his mobile phone. When this was refused the man punched and kicked him before running away with a second man when passers-by shouted at him.

The victim sustained facial and leg injuries for which he needed hospital treatment.

The suspect is described as black, 19/20 years, 6', of stocky build, wearing a plain black hoody with hood up and black face mask, black tracksuit trousers and black trainers.

Detective Inspector Cheryl Lewendon said; "This was a random and vicious attack. The motive was robbery but the suspect clearly didn't expect the response of the young man or the attention of passers-by."

Anyone who saw what happened is asked to contact Sussex Police online or by calling 101, quoting serial 1172 of 10/09.

You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
