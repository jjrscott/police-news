Police are appealing for witnesses to a single-vehicle collision in Arundel.

Officers were called to London Road at 4.50pm on Friday (2 October) to report that a Landrover towing a small trailer had overturned.

No serious injuries were reported.

The driver - a 68-year-old man - was arrested on suspicion of drink driving and has been released under investigation.

Police are keen to speak to witnesses who saw the vehicle prior to the collision, or to anyone with dash-cam footage, to come forward and assist with enquiries.

Anyone with information can report online or call 101, quoting 920 of 02/10.
