Police are seeking witnesses after a driver sustained serious injuries when two cars were in collision in Bognor.

At 4.15am on Saturday (5 September) a black Hyundai Coupe left the road and collided with a tree in Lidsey Road, Bognor, and a black Audi A3 then collided with the Hyundai.

The 33-year-old man driving the Hyundai was taken to St Richards Hospital, Chichester, to be treated for serious but not life threatening injuries.

The 59-year-old man driving the Audi sustained a minor hand injury.

PC Steve Taylor of the Surrey and Sussex Road Policing Unit said; "If you saw what happened please contact us either by emailing collision.appeal@sussex.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting Operation Navy."
