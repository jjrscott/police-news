Detective Inspector Kimberly May said: "Thank you to the public for their patience and understanding while this work was being carried out, as it may have caused some disruption to local residents.

"The deployment of armed officers was in response to specific information. I am satisfied that there is not, nor was there ever a threat to the wider community
