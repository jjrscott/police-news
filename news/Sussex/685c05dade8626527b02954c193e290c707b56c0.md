Two men were arrested after a van failed to stop for police in Hastings.

Officers were on patrol on Tuesday (January 5) when they ran a vehicle check on a van they'd seen crossing the roundabout from Queens Road to Elphinstone Road.

The check showed the vehicle has no MOT and no insurance. Police signalled for the van to pull over but the driver failed to do so.

A short pursuit ensued before the van came to a stop in Henderson Close, Hastings. Two occupants ran from the vehicle - one was detained by officers nearby, and the second was detained with the use of a dog and thermal imaging drone camera.

A 38-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of driving while disqualified, failing to stop when required to do so by police, and theft of a motor vehicle.

A 33-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle.

Both have been released on conditional bail until February 2 while enquiries continue.

Both men were also issued with Fixed Penalty Notices for being in breach of the government's Covid-19 restrictions.
