Police are seeking witnesses after a car driver ran away from a collision on a road between Worth and Turners Hill.

At 12.50pm on Friday 11 December a silver Peugeot 206 coupe being driven north along Turners Hill Road, Worth, left the road, hit a tree and finished up back in the road, facing the direction from which it had come and narrowly missing other vehicles.

The driver, described as white, in his thirties, with blond or ginger hair, ran off in woodland and disappeared across nearby Tulleys Farm. It is not know if he was injured.

PC Christine Davidson of the Surrey and Sussex Road Policing Unit said; "We are still trying to identify the driver, and to establish the ownership of the car.

"If you saw what happened, and particularly if you saw this silver Peugeot and its manner of driving in the minutes before the crash, please contact us via collision.appeal@sussex.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting serial 535 of 11/12."
