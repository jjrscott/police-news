Police investigating a report of a street robbery in Eastbourne are appealing for the victims and any witnesses to come forward.

Officers received a report that two men had been approached by two teenage boys who threatened them with a knife and a bottle before robbing them in Langney Road on Monday 17 August at about 1pm.

The victims walked off towards Clarence Road. Two suspects, a 17-year-old boy and a 16-year-old boy were arrested nearby shortly afterwards and detained on suspicion of robbery and possession of a bladed article.

They were later released on bail until 14 September.

Detective Constable David Hawes said: "We are trying to trace the victims of this robbery and would like to hear from them or anyone who witnessed it. Please contact us."

Report online or ring 101 quoting serial 701 of 17/08.
