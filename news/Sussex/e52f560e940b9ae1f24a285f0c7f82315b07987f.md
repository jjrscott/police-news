Police are appealing for witnesses after a motorcyclist was seriously injured in a hit-and-run in Lavant.

A dark coloured BMW collided with the motorcycle in Hunters Race around 10pm on Sunday 19 July, but failed to stop at the scene.

The rider - a woman in her 20s - was taken to St Richard's Hospital in Chichester with serious leg injuries.

It is believed the BMW will have sustained damage to the driver's side.

Anyone who saw either vehicle around the time of the collision, or who believes they have dash cam footage of the dark coloured BMW, is asked to email collision.appeal@sussex.pnn.police.uk quoting serial 1516 of 19/07.
