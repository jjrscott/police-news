CPS has authorised the charge of Steve Bouquet, 52, a security guard, from the London Road area of Brighton. On Sunday (22 December) he was charged with 16 counts of criminal damage.

This related to the wounding and killing of cats in the city between October 2, 2018 and June 1, 2019. He has also been charged with possessing a knife blade or sharp pointed article in a public place on June 2, 2019. He has been bailed to attend Brighton Magistrates Court on Thursday 23 January 2020.
