Police are appealing for information after the theft of scaffolding from outside a property in St Leonards.

Shortly before 1.45pm on Thursday 9 July, two men were seen dismantling scaffolding in Horntye Road and placing it into a white dropside hire vehicle.

Enquiries were made later that day and it was realised the men were not from the company responsible for the scaffolding at that property.

Officers investigating the theft would like to speak to anyone who saw the two men, or anyone who has any other information that could assist with the investigation.

They are particularly keen to speak to the man pictured, as they believe he could help with their enquiries.

Anyone who recognises him or anyone with any other information is asked to contact police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 347 of 10/07.

Alternatively, you can call the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
