Police are appealing for witnesses following a burglary and assault in Nuneaton.

The incident occurred yesterday (Wednesday 27 November) at around 9.20pm in Highfield Road.

A number of masked offenders broke into a house. As the offenders left the property two police officers on patrol in their car attempted to intervene but were assaulted before the offenders escaped in a car.

One of the officers suffered a minor hand injury and the other a minor head injury. Both officers were taken to hospital as a precaution but later discharged and stayed on duty.

Detective Sergeant Chris Cook from the Nuneaton Offender Management Unit said: "We'd like to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time, especially if they have dash cam or CCTV footage. We are urging people to come forward as they may be able to provide key information about this incident."

If you can help, please contact Warwickshire Police on 101, quoting incident 435 of 27 November 2019. You can also provide information anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their online form https://crimestoppers-uk.org/
