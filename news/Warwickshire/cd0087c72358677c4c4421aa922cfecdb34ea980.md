Two men have been arrested in connection with drug offences following an incident in Rugby yesterday (Tuesday, 22 December).

At around 2.20pm, officers from the Rugby Proactive CID Team were out on patrol in the Benn area of the town when they witnessed suspected drug dealing on Park Road.

They detained two men, both aged 18 from Coventry and London, who were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A controlled drugs after a quantity of Class A drugs, cash and mobile phones were recovered.

They have been released on conditional bail until January while enquiries continue.
