Warwickshire Police is appealing for witnesses or information following a robbery in Kenilworth yesterday afternoon (Wednesday 25 November).

Shortly before 3.45pm, officers were called to reports of a robbery on Clarkes Avenue.

It's reported three males in a silver VW Passat followed a van, and two of them then got out and threatened the driver.

Two of the males then got into the victim's van and drove off in it, with the VW Passat also leaving the scene.

One of the suspects was believed to be holding a baseball bat.

This morning, a 28-year-old man and an 22-year-old woman were arrested in Stratford in connection with the incident. They are currently in police custody.

If anyone witnessed the incident or any suspicious behaviour in the area, has any dashcam footage or may have seen the stolen van (a white Ford Transit with the registration of NC57 LLK), please call Warwickshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 208 of 25 November 2020.

Information can also be given anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
