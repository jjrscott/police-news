Officers searching for missing Ryton man Darran Jones have found a body.

The body was discovered in Ebbor Gorge, Somerset, earlier yesterday afternoon (Friday 20 September).

Formal identification has not yet taken place but it is believed to be that of Darran Jones, who was reported missing from Ryton on Tuesday 10 September 2019.

Darran's next of kin has been informed and have requested that their privacy be respected. Officers are not treating the death as suspicious at this time.

We would like to thank the public and the media for their help in sharing an earlier appeal.
