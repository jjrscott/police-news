A body has been found as part of a search for 65-year-old Alison Lomax.

Formal identification is yet to take place but the death is not being treated as suspicious at this time.

Alison's next of kin has been informed and we would ask their privacy is respected.

Thank you to everyone for their help in sharing an earlier appeal.
