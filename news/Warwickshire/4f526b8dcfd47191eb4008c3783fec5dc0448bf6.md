Investigating officers are appealing for witnesses to a robbery in Coleshill.

A 15-year-old boy was on his bike on Packington Lane around 6.15pm on Tuesday (19 May) when he was approached by two youths on a scrambler motorbike.

The individuals are understood to have threatened the teenage boy by saying they had a knife before knocking him to the floor and taking his bag, mobile phone, and pushbike.

He suffered cuts to his body, which are not believed to be life-threatening at this time.

A passer-by - a man in his 30s - attempted to stop the two youths as they rode away but was hit by the motorbike and suffered arm injuries and cuts to his ear.

The youths left on the motorbike in an unknown direction. One of the youths was believed to be wearing dark clothing while the other was thought to be dressed in grey clothes.

Enquiries are ongoing and we are keen to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident, who was in the area at the time, or who might have CCTV footage.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting incident number 342 of 19 May.
