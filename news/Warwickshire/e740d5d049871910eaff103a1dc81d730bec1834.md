Did you witness a non-stop collision in Rugby?

Officers are investigating after a Ford Fiesta - thought to be silver in colour - was in collision with a pedestrian walking along the footpath on Leicester Road towards the entrance of Elliott's Field at around 7.20pm on Saturday (14 November).

The vehicle is understood to have entered the island by Tesco and mounted the pavement before colliding with the pedestrian - a man in his 40s - who sustained an ankle injury, which is not thought to be life-changing at this time.

The driver failed to stop and headed off in the direction of Brownsover.

Enquiries are currently ongoing but officers are appealing for witness who may have been in the area at the time of the incident or who saw the vehicle and the manner in which it was being driven prior to the collision.

Anyone with information is asked to call on 101 quoting incident number 365 of 14 November.
