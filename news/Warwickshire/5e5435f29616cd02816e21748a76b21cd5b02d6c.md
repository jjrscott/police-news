Police are currently on the M40 following two collisions yesterday evening and early this morning.

The first - involving four HGVs and a car - is understood to have happened shortly after 11pm on Monday (21 September) on the northbound stretch of the motorway between J12 (Gaydon) and J13 (Leamington/Warwick).

A driver of one of the HGVs suffered a serious leg injury, which is thought to be life-changing at this time. He was taken to hospital where he remains in a stable condition.

Shortly afterwards around 12.20am on Tuesday (22 September), a second collision took place involving three HGVs and one car.

Officers remain on the scene and there may be delays as we continue to investigate. The road is currently closed and motorists are advised to avoid the area.

Anyone who witnessed either incident or has dashcam footage is asked to call 101 quoting incident 435 of 21 September (first collision) or 9 of 22 September (second collision).
