Police are appealing for information after a robbery in Nuneaton.

Police were called at 3.59pm yesterday (Wednesday 15 July) to A&A Off Licence in College Street with reports of a robbery.

A man entered the store and assaulted a member of staff. He then caused damage to the shop and stole a quantity of cash.

Detective Sergeant Paul Sartoris from Nuneaton Serious and Complex Crime Team said: "This was undoubtedly an extremely frightening incident for staff at the shop.

"I believe there were people in the area at the time and if anyone saw anything suspicious, no matter how small, I would urge them to get in touch."

Anyone with information should call police on 101 quoting incident 249 of 15 July 2020.

Alternatively, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org
