A new Warwickshire Roads Policing Newsletter is now available to help raise awareness of the work being done to reduce the numbers of people killed or seriously injured (KSI) on Warwickshire's roads and protect people from harm.

The first issue is a bumper issue covering two months, and pulls together all the roads policing news into one place so that it can be easily read online, printed or shared electronically to demonstrate some of the good work being done.

It is hoped the new newsletter will help to reassure the public that there is a strong roads policing presence in Warwickshire and help boost public confidence in Warwickshire Police.

The newsletter will be produced monthly and it is anticipated at some point it will be renamed and expanded to include more partner information.
