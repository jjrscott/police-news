Two men have been arrested after suspected class A drugs and cash were seized in Nuneaton on Friday (19 February).

A 30-year-old man of no fixed abode and a 31-year-old man from Coventry were arrested in connection with the haul after plain clothed detectives from Nuneaton Proactive CID spotted a suspected drug deal in Norman Avenue.

Detectives stopped one of the cars involved and following a search seized what they believe to be crack cocaine and heroin, and cash.

Both men were arrested on suspicion of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply. The 30-year-old was released under investigation and the 31-year-old was bailed until next month while enquiries continue.

Detective Constable Dan Stanton from Nuneaton Proactive CID said: "Seizures such as this show the hard work we are putting in to help eradicate the supply of drugs in our communities.

"This type of behaviour will not be tolerated and we are determined to continue the disruption and supply of drugs throughout the county.

"We ask anyone with information relating to drug dealing to contact us.

"We will always act on information provided."

Anyone with information can call police on 101. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
