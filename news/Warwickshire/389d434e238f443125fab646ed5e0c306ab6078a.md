A man has been detained under the Mental Health Act after he admitted carrying out an unprovoked attack on a pensioner in his own home in Rugby.

Marcin Gacioch, 33, of no fixed abode, will be detained until he is no longer considered a risk to the public.

On the morning of 22 January 2019, Gacioch forced access to the home of his victim - a man in his 80s - where he assaulted him causing significant head injuries.

A few hours earlier, he had carried out another unprovoked attack on a man in his 60s in Murray Road, Rugby. The man suffered head injuries.

Gacioch was arrested later the same day.

He was sentenced at Warwick Crown Court on Wednesday (6 November) having previously pleaded guilty to wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and assault. The court heard he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and delusions.

He also pleaded guilty to two counts of burglary.

Detective Sergeant Mark Calvert from Warwickshire Police CID said: "Gacioch is clearly a risk to the public; the judge recognised this and imposed this sentence in order to protect people from his actions."
