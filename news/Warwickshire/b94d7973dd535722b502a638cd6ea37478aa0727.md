Police have arrested a man after a cannabis farm with 13 plants was found in a loft at a Nuneaton property.

Officers from Warwickshire Police attended the property in Bucks Hill on Friday (17 January) following a report of a disturbance.

They discovered the plants following a search of the property and arrested a 58-year-old man from Nuneaton on suspicion of cultivating cannabis and abstracting electricity. He has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

PC Chloe Harrison said: "This was an excellent seizure by officers. We would always encourage members of the public to contact us if they have information about possible drug production in our communities."

Anyone with information that could help police with this investigation or any other concerns about drug production, dealing or use in the community can call police on 101. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
