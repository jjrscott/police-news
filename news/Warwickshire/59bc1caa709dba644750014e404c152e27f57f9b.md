On Thursday 19 September 2019 a joint operation with Northamptonshire Police, Leicestershire Police, Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency and HM Revenue and Customs took place to check the legal and safe status of vehicles on the A5 and A426.

PC James Graham said: "Using Automatic Number Plate Readers (ANPR) strategically located on the A5 and A426 vehicles were intercepted and escorted to a check site to be processed -

 * 40 vehicles were intercepted and processed.
 * 20 vehicles were seized for offences relating to insurance and vehicle excise license offences
 * 8 Traffic Offence Reports were completed for various offences
 * 17 immediate and 12 delayed prohibitions were issued

"The A5 Partnership is a collaboration of Police Forces working together to reduce risk on our roads and tackle criminality. It shows that by sharing information and resources we can target cross border issues to ensure that we protect the public from harm. We have already worked together on Operation Hillman to combat the illegal butchering and theft of sheep and Operation Haydon checking heavy goods vehicles for road worthiness.

"We look forward to working together on future operations."
