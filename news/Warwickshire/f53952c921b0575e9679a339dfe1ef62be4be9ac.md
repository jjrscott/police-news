**UPDATE, 27/03/2020: **Thank you to everyone who shared this appeal. We have identified one of the males and he has been spoken to by officers. We are still appealing for help to identify the other male.

Officers investigating a homophobic assault in Nuneaton earlier in the month are issuing CCTV images of two males who may have information to help with their enquiries.

At around 7.25pm on Saturday 7 March, a man in his 20 was subjected to homophobic abuse and then punched in the face in Queen's Road. He suffered minor injuries.

Enquiries are ongoing and anyone with information is asked to contact police.

PC Kirsty Nichols said: "We believe the males pictured may have information to assist our ongoing investigation.

"Additionally, we would like to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident and has not yet spoken to police. Anyone with information can call 101 quoting incident 433 of 7 March 2020 or you can call the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
