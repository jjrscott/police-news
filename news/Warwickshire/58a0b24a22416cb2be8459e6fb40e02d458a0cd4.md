We're continuing to investigate a burglary in Kingsbury and are appealing for help to identify these two individuals as part of our ongoing enquiries.

The incident happened shortly after 1.30am on Wednesday 9 December when two people are reported to have entered the back garden of a property on Tamworth Road.

The individuals are understood to have forced entry to a shed and removed a number of items including saws, drills and a hedge trimmer.

Around 3.15am the same individuals are thought to have returned to the garden and removed further power tools.

We believe the individuals (pictured) may have information that could help with our investigation and would ask them or anyone who knows who they might be to get in touch.

Officers are also keen for anyone who was in the area at the time or witnessed anyone acting suspiciously to come forward.

Anyone with information should call 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting incident number 88 of 9 December.
