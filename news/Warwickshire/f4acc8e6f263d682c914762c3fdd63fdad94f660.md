A suspected 'cannabis farm' has been shut down in Leamington following concerns from local residents.

Officers forced entry to the property on Court Street shortly after 5pm on Saturday evening, where a large number of cannabis plants and electrical equipment were located and seized.

Two foreign national males were located inside the premises and are currently being supported as suspected victims of modern day slavery. They are being safeguarded by police and specialist organisations whilst enquiries are ongoing.

One man has been arrested in connection with the investigation and has been released under investigation.

Leamington's Safer Neighbourhood Team (SNT) have been running Operation Switch throughout the summer to identify and tackle drug dealing in and around the town. Officers would continue to encourage anyone with any concerns about the supply and use of illegal drugs in their community to please report it. Information can be given via www.warwickshire.police.uk, 101 or via Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Concerns around suspected modern slavery can be reported to Warwickshire Police or directly to the National Modern Slavery Helpline on 0800 121700. In an emergency, always call 999.
