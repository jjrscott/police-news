Warwickshire Police is appealing to the public to help locate a man who is wanted on recall to prison.

Officers are trying to locate 29-year-old Craig Edge, who is believed to have connections to the Nuneaton area.

Craig was released from HMP Hewell in August after serving a sentence for burglary.

He has released with conditions which have now been breached, and is wanted on prison recall.

Craig is slim and was last wearing a silver metallic jacket. He has connections to Bedworth, and the Camphill and Horeston Grange areas of Nuneaton.

If anyone has seen him or knows of his whereabouts, please call Warwickshire Police on 101.
