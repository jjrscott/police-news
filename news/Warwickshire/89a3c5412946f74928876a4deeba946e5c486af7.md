We are continuing to appeal for information and witnesses as part of our ongoing investigations into an attempted robbery at a jewellers in Kenilworth.

The incident happened in Talisman Square at around 3.55pm on Christmas Eve.

Two people riding a green Kawasaki motorbike are reported to have approached the store before the passenger got off and tried to enter the shop.

The offender was prevented from entering and left empty handed.

Enquiries are continuing and investigating officers are particularly keen to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time or who saw a man wearing a distinctive white motorcycle helmet with a red England crest (pictured).

Detective Sergeant Pete Sherwood said: "Fortunately, nobody was injured but staff were left badly shaken. Our enquiries are ongoing to trace the people responsible.

"If anyone saw people either before or after the attempted robbery took place, or has any information about this incident or the helmet, we'd urge them to get in touch with us. Any information, no matter how small, may be significant."

Anyone with information should call 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting incident 273 of 24 December 2019.
