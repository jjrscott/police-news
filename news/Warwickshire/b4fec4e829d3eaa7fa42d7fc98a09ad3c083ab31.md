A man was arrested and suspected class A drugs seized in Leamington yesterday (Tuesday 11 August) afternoon.

Plain clothed officers from Leamington proactive CID were on patrol when they spotted a suspected drug deal in George Street.

The 32-year-old man from Coventry was arrested on suspicion of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply.

Detective Sergeant Gavin Hampton from Leamington Proactive CID said: "We work hard to disrupt crime by removing illegal drugs from the street, and tackling those we suspect are responsible for supplying drugs.

"Drug crime has a hugely detrimental effect on communities so we hope this type of proactive policing reassures the community that we are taking action.

"Cracking down on drug crime is a priority for the force and I would like to assure the public that we will continue to record and act on all intelligence received. We will not hesitate to take robust action when necessary."

Police will act on all information about the production, supply and use of drugs. If you have information about suspected criminality in your neighbourhood, you can report online at www.warwickshire.police.uk or call our non-emergency number 101.

Alternatively you can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or visit their website crimestoppers-uk.org

The suspect in this case has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.
