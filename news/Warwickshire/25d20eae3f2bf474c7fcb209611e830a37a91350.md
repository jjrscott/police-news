Warwickshire Police is appealing for information following an attempted robbery in Nuneaton this morning (Saturday 13 February).

At around 8.30am, a woman in her 50s was walking in Hartshill Hayes Country Park and stopped to take a photo, when an unknown male on a bike approached her from behind and tried to take her phone.

The woman pushed the suspect away from her, but he then pulled out an item, described as a 'flick knife', causing an injury to the woman's arm and damaging her coat.

The suspect then punched the woman in the face, and left the area on his bike.

Paramedics attended the scene but the woman did not require hospital treatment.

The man is described as white, wearing a black hooded top and jogging bottoms. He was wearing a black snood/face covering and was riding a black and grey mountain bike.

PC Joanna de Vogel from Warwickshire Police said: "This is a concerning incident which has left the victim understandably traumatised, and a number of enquiries are now ongoing to locate the individual responsible.

"If anyone witnessed the offences or recognises the description of the suspect, please call 101 quoting incident 65 of 13 February 2020.

"Officers will be in the area in the coming days to conduct additional patrols. If anyone has any concerns, please speak to us."

Information can also be given anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
