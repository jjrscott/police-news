Fines will be issued for Covid legislation breaches in Leamington last night.

Officers attended reports of parties in Russel Terrace and Bedford Street and fines will now be issued to people who attended.

Police have also received information about another party potenaitally taking place in the town tonight and appropriate patrols are being put in place to ensure there are no further breaches of Covid legislation.

Inspector Dave Valente said: "People attending the parties last night showed a complete disregard for the law and the safety of others.

"The 'rule of six' is quite clear and is in place to help slow the spread of coronavirus. Where there are clear and obvious breaches of this rule we will not hesitate to take action."
