A man has been arrested as police crackdown on county lines drug supply in Rugby.

Officers carried out a raid in Park Road, Rugby, on Tuesday (8 October).

A 57-year-old man from Rugby was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of drugs.

Officers also seized a substance believed to be heroin, and a mobile phone.

The man has since been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Speaking about their ongoing efforts to tackle county lines drug supply, Detective Sergeant Heidi Twynham from the Rugby Offender Management Unit said: "We continue to tackle the problem of class A drugs making their way on to the streets of Rugby and we will continue to take action against those we believe to be involved.

"Our message is clear; if you come to Rugby to deal drugs you are not welcome and we are looking out for you.

"We need the public to continue to report suspicious activity and help us tackle county lines crime. The information you provide may be the missing piece of the jigsaw that helps us to arrest a criminal, seize drugs or protect a vulnerable person."

Anyone with information is asked to call Warwickshire Police on 101. Alternatively, information can be reported anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
