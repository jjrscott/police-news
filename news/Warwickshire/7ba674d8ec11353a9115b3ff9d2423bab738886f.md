A prolific shoplifter has been jailed for five months after being arrested as part of a targeted policing operation by Nuneaton and Bedworth Safer Neighbourhood Team (SNT).

The operation was set up after concerns were raised around the amount of shoplifting in the town and involved a mixture of uniformed and plain clothed officers.

The officers caught Christopher Hannifin from Coventry in the act and arrested him in Mill Street, Bedworth on Monday (25 January).

Hannifin, 41, of Deedmore Road, Coventry appeared at Warwickshire Magistrates' Court on Tuesday where he pleaded guilty to thefts from five shops in Bedworth over the last couple of weeks and assaulting a shop worker at one of the shops, in Leicester Road.

Sergeant Elliott Butler from Nuneaton and Bedworth SNT said: "This operation was launched in direct response to concerns raised by local businesses and members of the public. We set out to identify the suspect causing the most harm which turned out to be Hannifin.

"Officers from the SNT caught him in the act and arrested him.

"Officers and PCSOs worked together with local shopkeepers as part of this operation. It was a great example of community focussed proactive policing and it has led to a prolific offender being taken off the streets.

"We will continue to work with them to help deter shoplifters in the town."
