Officers in Leamington have charged a man following two robberies in the town at the weekend.

The first incident occurred at a shop in Clemens Street at around 5.15pm on Saturday (6 June). It is alleged that a man threatened staff with a knife after they confronted him as he tried to steal items from the store.

The same happened again at a shop in Radford Road at around 6.35pm.

Matthew Court, 37, of no fixed abode was arrested later that night and charged with two counts of robbery and is due to appear at Warwickshire Magistrates' Court today (Monday 8 June).
