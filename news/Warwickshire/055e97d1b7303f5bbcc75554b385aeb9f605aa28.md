Warwickshire Police is appealing for witnesses or information following an assault in Nuneaton last night.

At around 7.25pm, it's reported a man in his 30s was walking on Meadow Street when three men got out of a red Mercedes A class.

The man was chased onto Bottrill Street, where he was assaulted by the group. He sustained injuries to his knee and bruising on his body, and was taken to hospital for treatment. He has since been discharged.

The suspects are described as three men - two of whom were around 6ft tall with short shaved hair and were wearing black clothing. The third man was believed to be bald.

Detective Sergeant Paul Sartoris from Warwickshire Police said: "We're appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the assault, or the vehicle in the area at the time.

"We are currently treating this as an isolated incident, and a number of enquiries are ongoing to locate those responsible.

"If anyone has any information, please call Warwickshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 371 of 4 July 2020."

Information can also be given to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
