"We're keen to identify the person or people responsible as soon as possible and are appealing for anyone who may have information about the incident, saw anything suspicious in the area at the time, has any dash cam footage from the area or saw the offenders fleeing the scene, to get in touch."

Anyone with any information that could help police with their enquiries is asked to call Warwickshire Police on 101 quoting incident 343 of 17 April 2020. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
