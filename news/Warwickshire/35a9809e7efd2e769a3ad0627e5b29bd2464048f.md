Warwickshire Police is appealing for witnesses or information following three incidents in Stratford and Bidford this week.

At around 9pm on Monday night (20 January), three unknown males forced entry to a property on Congreve Way, Stratford. They assaulted the victim with an unknown object before leaving the address and potential running to Barrie Close. Nothing was stolen. Two of the males were dressed in black and one was wearing grey. **Inc 406 of 20 January 2020.**

Between Sunday and Tuesday, a property was broken into on Scott Close, Bidford. An untidy search was made and a bottle of alcohol was stolen. **Inc 183 of 21 January 2020.**

At around 10am yesterday (Tuesday 21 January), unknown persons attempted to gain entry to a different property on Congreve Way using a sledge hammer. They then left the area, potentially in a silver Saab. **Inc 434 of 21 January 2020.**
