Warwickshire Police is appealing for information following an incident in Mancetter on Thursday evening (4 March).

At around 7.15pm, a 14-year-old girl was walking on Manor Road when a van pulled over.

It's reported the sole occupant of the van - a woman - asked the teenager for directions, and an altercation then took place between them both.

The girl then left the scene and the van drove off.

The driver is described as a woman with long blonde hair, wearing a black puffer jacket. She was believed to be Eastern European, and was believed to be driving a Transit-style van with tinted windows.

Investigating officer, Det Sgt Paul Sartoris from Nuneaton CID said: "We are currently conducting enquiries and would like to speak to the driver of the van, so we can ascertain the exact circumstances of the incident.

"We are also appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or saw the van in the area - or who may have dashcam footage - to please come forward.

"Anyone with information is asked to call Warwickshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 314 of 4 March 2021."

Information can also be given anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
