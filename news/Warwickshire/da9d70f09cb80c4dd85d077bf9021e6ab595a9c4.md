Warwickshire Police is appealing for the public's help and for any CCTV footage following reported suspicious activity in the Maple Park area of Nuneaton this week.

At around 1.30am on Sunday (12 July), officers received a report of suspicious activity around Marwood Close, Rockingham Drive, Northbourne Drive and Upton Drive. Two cars were stolen from a driveway in Marwoods Close and have since been recovered.

On Monday (13 July) around 1am further reports were received of suspicious activity on Upton Drive. It's believed the activity may have been related to the targeting of high-value vehicles.

At 4.15am this morning (Friday), police were made aware of two males seen to be putting a fishing rod inside a house letterbox on Rockingham Drive. A 15-year-old boy was arrested shortly afterwards on suspicion of attempted burglary. He is currently in police custody.

If anyone has witnessed any of the above activity or has CCTV at these times/dates in the above locations, please call 101 quoting incident number 45 of 17 July 2020.

Information can also be given anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.

Please ensure all keys are stored securely and for further advice on how to protect your vehicle, please see the advice pages on our website.
