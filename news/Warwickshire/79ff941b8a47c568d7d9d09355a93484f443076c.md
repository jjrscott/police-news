The girl suffered serious head injuries when a black Skoda Citigo collided with her at around 5.45pm yesterday (Friday 17 July).

She was taken to hospital where she died this evening.

A 32-year-old woman from Leamington was arrested at the scene following the incident on suspicion causing serious injury by dangerous driving.

Superintendent Emma Bastone from Warwickshire Police said: "Our thoughts remain with the family of the little girl following this terrible incident.

"We have launched a thorough investigation into how the collision occurred and we're keen to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident or saw the child or the car in the moments leading up to the collision.

"We're also keen to speak to the driver of a silver or blue Mazda we believe was driving behind the Skoda at the time of the collision but left the scene.

"We'd like anyone in the area with CCTV or dash cam footage from the time of incident to get in touch with us as soon as possible so we can check it for evidence."

Anyone with information that could help police with their enquiries should call 101 quoting incident 324 of 17 July 2020. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
