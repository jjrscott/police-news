Have you seen Warwick man Nigel Honey?

The 50-year-old, who was reported missing on Tuesday (29 December) is described as white, bald and around 6ft 1in tall.

Nigel is known to ride a pedal bike with a backpack and usually carries a large motorbike chain around his shoulder or waist whenever he's on the bike.

Officers and his family are growing increasingly concerned for his welfare and are asking anyone with information to come forward.

Anyone who knows where Nigel might be is asked to call 101.
