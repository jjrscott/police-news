We are appealing for witnesses following a reported indecent exposure incident in Bishops Itchington last Thursday (17 December).

At around 6.30am in the alleyway between Lakin Drive and Chapel Street, a man is alleged to have made inappropriate comments to a woman and indecently exposed himself to her.

The victim, a woman in her 50s, was not harmed but left shaken following the incident.

The man is described as white, believed to be in his 30s, over 6' tall, clean shaven, wearing a beanie hat, a green bomber style jacket and smart jeans. He was also believed to be wearing distinctive builder-style boots that were a sandy colour with their laces undone.

Investigating officer PC Conor Hickinbotham said: "This was understandably a frightening experience for the victim which is why we have increased patrols in the area.

"While investigations are ongoing, I would urge anyone who witnessed the incident, has CCTV of the area at around the time of the incident, or anyone who recognises the description of the man and thinks they might know who this is, to get in touch either via our website or by calling 101 quoting incident number 46 of 17 December.
