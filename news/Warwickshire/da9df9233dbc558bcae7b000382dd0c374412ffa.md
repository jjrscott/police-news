Officers searching for missing **Coventry** man Keith Appleton have sadly found a body in the River Avon today (Saturday, 20 February).

While formal identification is yet to take place, the body is believed to be that of the 61-year-old who was reported missing on 18 January.

The death is not being treated as suspicious and a file is being prepared for the coroner.

Detective Inspector Jim Rankin from Rugby CID, said: "Our thoughts remain with Keith's family at this difficult time, who are being supported by specially trained officers.

"Thank you to everyone who shared our earlier appeals and in particular the many local residents who have assisted with the investigation to find Keith, alongside his many family and friends who have provided invaluable information to help us.

"I'd also like thank our colleagues at Warwickshire Search and Rescue who have worked tirelessly to support the search effort."
