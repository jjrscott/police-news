A man has been arrested on suspicion of drugs offences following an incident in Rugby.

At around 2.15pm yesterday (Monday 4 May), officers from Rugby Proactive CID were on patrol on Bath Street when they witnessed a suspected drugs deal.

The officers stopped and detained the man on Lawford Road, where a quantity of suspected class B drugs, cash and a mobile phone were seized. Following a search of an address on Winfield Street, further suspected class B drugs and drug-related paraphernalia were seized.

A 24-year-old man from Rugby was arrested on suspicion of possession of class B drugs with intent to supply. He has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Anyone with any information concerning suspected drug dealing in the area is asked to call Warwickshire Police 101 or report it via the force website. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
