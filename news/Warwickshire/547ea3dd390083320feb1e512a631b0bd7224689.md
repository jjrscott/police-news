Please see update below in bold.

**The individual has now been identified and the incident is being treated as a medical episode.**

We're appealing for the public's help to identify a male following an incident in Rugby this morning (Monday).

Police were called to Newbold Road shortly after 3am after concerns were raised for the welfare of a male.

Officers attended along with the emergency services and found an individual who had suffered facial injuries.

He was taken to hospital where he remains in a critical condition at this time.

Detective Sergeant Mark Calvert said: "So far despite extensive work we've been unable to identify the male who is in hospital in a critical but stable condition.

"He is described as a white male with dark brown hair possibly in his late teens or early 20s.

"We're carrying out a number of lines of enquiry as part of our ongoing work but we're keen to identify this male and establish how he came to suffer his injuries.

"We would ask anyone who was in the area at the time or who may be able to help identify the male to get in touch."

Anyone with information that can help with our investigation should call 101 quoting incident 15 of 22 February.
