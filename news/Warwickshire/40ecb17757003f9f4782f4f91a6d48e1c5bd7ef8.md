Two people have been arrested after a car failed to stop for police yesterday (Thursday 26 November) morning.

The Volkswagen Passat, which is believed to have been used in a robbery in Kenilworth on Wednesday, failed to stop for officers in Stratford.

Officers spotted the car in Drayton Avenue and a pursuit began with the vehicle being driven through red lights and hitting speeds of 70 miles per hour in a 30 miles per hour zone.

The car eventually stopped after it collided with a police car in Windsor Street.

Officers arrested the two occupants of the car and seized what they suspect to be class A drugs.

A 28-year-old man from Weymouth was arrested on suspicion of robbery, dangerous driving, failing to stop, driving under the influence of drugs and possession of class A drugs with intent to supply. He was bailed until December for these offences while enquiries continue and then detained on an outstanding warrant for failure to appear at court.

A 22-year-old woman from Stratford was arrested on suspicion of robbery and later bailed until December while enquiries continue.

The robbery occured in Clarkes Avenue, Kenilworth at around 3.40pm on Wednesday. A man was threatened and had his van stolen.

Anyone with information that could help police with their enquiries can call 101 quoting incident 77 of 26 November 2020. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
