Five people have been arrested on suspicion of drugs offences following an incident in Rugby yesterday morning (Monday 13 July).

At around 11.30am, officers from Rugby Proactive CID observed suspicious behaviour near to Rounds Gardens.

A nearby property was searched and cash, knives, scales, phones and suspected drugs were seized from the address.

A 15-year-old boy, a 16-year-old girl, a 19-year-old man, a 20-year-old man and a 41-year-old man were all arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of class A drugs. They have been released on bail.

Protect is a campaign being run by Warwickshire Police alongside a range of partner agencies to tackle Serious and Organised Crime (SOC).

The broad-ranging operation covers four key areas of activity:

 * Pursue - prosecuting and disrupting those involved in SOC
 * Prevent - stopping individuals from becoming involved in SOC
 * Protect - increased levels of protection against SOC
 * Prepare - reducing the impact of SOC where it occurs
