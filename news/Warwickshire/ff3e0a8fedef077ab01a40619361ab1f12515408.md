A man will appear in court charged with assaulting and racially abusing police officers in Nuneaton.

Lee Amos, 36, faces charges of assaulting an emergency worker, using threatening or abusive words or behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress, and racially aggravated harassment.

An officer was allegedly punched and kicked, and other officers spat at and racially abused after responding to a report raising concern for a man in Edward Street on 31 October.

Amos, of no fixed abode, will appear at Warwickshire Magistrates' Court on 5 January 2021.
