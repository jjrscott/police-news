Warwickshire Police is appealing for witnesses or information following a fail to stop collision near Church Lawford last month.

At around 1.25pm on Sunday 29 December, a collision took place between a car and a cyclist on the A428, in the direction of Bretford.

The cyclist, a man in his 60s, sustained serious injuries and was taken to hospital where he is still receiving treatment.

It's believed the vehicle did not stop and then passed through Church Lawford and continued towards Bretford.

The vehicle may be a Silver Vauxhall Vectra, with a 2008 or 2009 registration plate. It is likely to have sustained lower near side bumper damage.

Following the collision, it may have travelled onto Wolston, on the Fosse Way towards the A45, to Brandon or out of Bretford back towards Easenhall.

A number of enquiries are currently ongoing to locate the vehicle and officers would like to speak to anyone who may have witnessed the collision or recognises the vehicle pictured.

Alternatively, if any repair garages have had a Vauxhall Vectra of this description in for repairs or scrap, please let officers know.

If anyone has any information, please call Warwickshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 180 of 29 December 2019.

Alternatively, you can call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
