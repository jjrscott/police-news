Officers investigating an attempted robbery in Atherstone are appealing for potential witnesses to come forward.

It happened in Nursery Road around 3.15pm on Friday (20 November).

A 14-year-old boy was in an alleyway opposite Queen Elizabeth Academy when two unknown individuals approached him.

One is reported to have threatened him - using what is believed to be a knife - before asking whether he had any money. He was then told to hand over his AirPods but refused.

The second individual reportedly threatened the boy with a knife. When a member of the public intervened, the offenders left in the direction of Church Walk.

The victim was left shaken but uninjured following the incident.

The first individual, who is described as male, mixed race, of skinny build, and around 5ft 7in tall, was thought to be wearing a blue hooded coat and black joggers.

The second male was understood to be dressed in a black hooded coat, joggers with black shoes and a black mask.

He is described as mixed race, around 6ft tall, and of heavy build.

Enquiries are currently ongoing but officers are keen for anyone who witnessed the incident, or who saw anyone acting suspiciously in the area at the time to come forward.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting incident number 218 of 20 November.
