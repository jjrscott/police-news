A woman who terrorised two vulnerable man in Stratford has been jailed for one year and 10 months.

Lucy Coventry, 36, of Carew Close, Stratford appeared at Warwick Crown Court yesterday (Thursday 17 December) to be sentenced after pleading guilty to four counts of breaching a restraining order.

The restraining order was put in place to stop Coventry from taking financial advantage of vulnerable people to fund her drug habit.

Offices from Stratford SNT gathered evidence to show she had breached the restraining order on numerous occasions between May and November by approaching the vulnerable men to ask him for money for drugs.

Coventry was also ordered to pay a Â£150 victim surcharge and given five year restraining order.

PC Amy Jones from Stratford Safer Neighbourhood Team said: "Coventry's behaviour has had a significant impact on the victims in this case. I commend the victims' bravery in coming to the police for help and supporting this prosecution.

"Restraining orders are often put in place to protect some of the most vulnerable members of our community and we are committed to enforcing them and ensuring anyone who breaches them is brought to justice.

"This restraining order was put in place to stop Coventry from using vulnerable people to fund her drug habit. Hopefully this conviction will give others who are in a similar the position the confidence to come forward and report it to police. We will protect you."
