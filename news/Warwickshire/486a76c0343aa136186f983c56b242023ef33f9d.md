Quick thinking staff at two banks in Nuneaton helped to prevent two local people being defrauded out of almost £10,000 yesterday (Monday 19 October).

In the first incident, a man in his 80s tried to withdraw £2000 at the request of someone claiming to be from the HMRC.

In the second incident a man in his 60s tried to transfer £7,600 at the request of someone claiming to be from the Lloyds Bank fraud team.

Fortunately, in both incidents staff at the bank became suspicious and initiated banking protocol, a national scheme that enables bank branch staff to spot potential fraud victims. They contact police and no money was lost.

Detective Sergeant Paul Hainsworth from the Warwickshire Police fraud team said: "These types of fraudsters can be very cunning. In one of these attempted frauds the offender knew the victim's home address and told him bank staff were in on the fraud.

"I would like to say well done to the bank staff who were alert and helped to prevent any money being lost. We work closely with banks helping to raise awareness of fraud and the signs to look out for.

"Remember, the HMRC or your bank will never contact you out of the blue to ask you to withdraw or transfer money."

Enquiries are ongoing into both incidents. Anyone with information can call 101. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
