We're asking the public to remain vigilant after a number of attempted telephone scams in the county.

Yesterday afternoon, a number of calls were made to residents in the Nuneaton area purporting to be from police officers in London.

On each call, the victims were either told their card had been cloned or that money had been taken from their account, in a bid for them to hand over their money or bank details.

Thankfully, due to the victims' vigilance on each occasion, no money was stolen.

However, a number of similar calls were reported in the county earlier this month where unfortunately money was stolen in two incidents.

No police force will ever call you asking for money. If you receive a call like this, please report the incident to police or Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.

Detective Inspector Dave Andrews from Warwickshire Police said: "Whilst in the majority of these cases no money was taken, unfortunately we have had incidents this month where it has been.

"We'd ask people to please keep sharing this advice with friends and relatives, especially those who may be elderly or vulnerable.

"We take reports of this nature very seriously and these incidents are currently being investigated as part of a wider campaign aimed at tackling online and courier fraud.

"Fraudsters are often very convincing and give the person they are calling no reason to believe they are not genuine. If you think someone is trying to scam you, tell someone straight away. Don't be pressured. Give yourself time to stop and think. If in any doubt, hang up the phone and do not provide your personal banking details."
