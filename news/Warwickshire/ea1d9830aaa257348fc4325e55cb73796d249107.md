Following a Warwickshire Police investigation, a man has been sent to prison for drugs offences in Rugby.

Ian Murray, aged 49 of Pennington Street, Rugby, appeared at Nightingale Court, Birmingham on Friday (26 March) for sentencing.

On 7 March 2019, Murray was stop searched after being approached by plain clothes officers on Pennington Street, Rugby.

He was found in possession of crack cocaine and heroin. A subsequent search of his home address recovered drug paraphernalia scales, cling film, a 'dealer list' and cash.

Murray denied the offence however was found guilty following a trial at of possession with intent to supply class A heroin and class A crack cocaine. He was last week sentenced to 30 months' imprisonment.

Investigating officer, Det Constable Tom Quinlan said: "This was a great result following a stop search by officers in Rugby.

"We work closely with our partners and the wider community to proactively target people we believe to be involved in the supply of drugs, and will use the powers we have to make sure their activity is disrupted."
