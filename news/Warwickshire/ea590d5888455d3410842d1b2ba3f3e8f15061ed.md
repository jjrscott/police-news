Warwickshire Police is appealing for witnesses or information following a robbery in Nuneaton yesterday evening (Friday 29 November).

At around 6pm, a woman in her 30s was asked for money by two people in a park on Fife Street.

She was then assaulted, causing her to sustain facial injuries which required hospital treatment, and her handbag was stolen.

The suspects are described as a man and a woman. The woman is described as white, of a large build, about 30 years old, with long brown hair. She was wearing white trousers.

DS Dave Moorman from Warwickshire Police said: "A number of enquiries are now ongoing in order to identify and locate the suspects, and we are appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the incident to please make contact.

"If anyone has any information, please call Warwickshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 442 of 29 November 2019."

Alternatively, information can be given to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
