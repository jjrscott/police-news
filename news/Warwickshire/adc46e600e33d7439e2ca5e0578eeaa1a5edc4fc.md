Did you witness a suspected road rage incident in Nuneaton on Sunday (10 November)?

A woman was driving along Lutterworth Road at around 6.30pm when a vehicle - a silver Volkswagen - is reported to have pulled out in front of her unexpectedly.

The woman flashed her headlights and shortly afterwards the vehicle came to a stop.

The driver of the Volkswagen is then understood to have got out of his car and approached the woman's vehicle.

A man in his 50s got out of the woman's vehicle and a verbal altercation broke out between the man and the male driver of the Volkswagen.

The Volkswagen driver is then believed to have punched the man to the face causing him to fall and hit the kerb. He suffered head and face injuries.

Enquiries are currently ongoing and we are keen for any witnesses that saw what happened to come forward.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting incident number 330 of 10 November.
