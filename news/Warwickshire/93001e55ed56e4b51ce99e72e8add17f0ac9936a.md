Warwickshire Police is appealing for witnesses or information following an incident in Bedworth.

On Sunday morning (14 June) a suspected disturbance took place in the Exhall area of Bedworth before a man, woman and two children were reported to be seen getting into a car together.

The woman and two children were safely located in the Wood End area of Coventry this morning (Tuesday 16 June).

A 26-year-old man from Bedworth has been arrested on suspicion of kidnap. He is currently in police custody.

Detective Inspector Dave Andrews from Warwickshire Police said: "We understand this may sound concerning to the community, but it is currently being treated as an isolated incident. All the individuals were known to each other and we are not currently looking for anyone else in connection with this.

"We are trying to establish the exact circumstances and as part of our enquiries, we would like to speak to anyone who may have witnessed a disturbance on Sunday morning or seen a grey Saab car (with a registration ending in XAF) in the area over the past few days.

"If anyone has any information, please call Warwickshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 127 of 14 June 2020."
