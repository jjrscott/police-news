Warwickshire Police is appealing for information following an attempted robbery at a jewellers in Kenilworth.

The incident happened in Talisman Square at around 3.55pm on Tuesday (24 December).

Two people riding a green Kawasaki motorbike approached the store before the passenger got off and tried to enter the shop. The offender was prevented from entering and left empty handed.

Detective Inspector Collette O'Keefe, of the Warwickshire Police Serious and Complex Investigation team, said: "Fortunately, nobody was injured but staff were left badly shaken. Our enquiries are ongoing to trace the people responsible.

"If anyone saw the people either before or after the robbery took place, or has any information about this incident, they should call 101 quoting incident 273 of 24 December 2019 or anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
