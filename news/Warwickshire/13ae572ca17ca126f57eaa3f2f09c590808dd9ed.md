Police have released a CCTV image of a man they want to trace as part of their investigation into an armed robbery at a shop in Nuneaton.

The incident occurred at around 1.25pm yesterday (Wednesday 6 January) at a shop in Abbey Gate Shopping Precinct.

A man in a high visibility jacket entered the shop and threatened staff with what police believe to be a small firearm before leaving with the contents of the till.

The suspect left the store and went the Nuneaton Bus Station where he got a taxi to Elderberry Drive. He was last seen heading in the direction of Cedar Road.

The suspect is described as a white man of medium build and height.

Sergeant Edd Murray said: "We appreciate this isn't the greatest photo but it is the best we have at the moment and we hope someone may recognise this man or someone may have seen someone matching the description of the suspect acting suspiciously in the area before the incident.

"We're keen to speak to anyone who recognises this man or anyone with any other information that could help with our investigation. We'd also like to hear from anyone with dash cam footage from the area around the time of the incident.

"Enquiries are ongoing and if we get better CCTV images we will consider releasing these."

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting incident 154 of 6 January 2021. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
