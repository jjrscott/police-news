Three men have been arrested by police in Water Orton after officers on routine patrol in the early hours of Saturday (3 October) morning spotted a motor home that had been stolen from West Midlands.

As officers approached the vehicle three men fled and were arrested following a lengthy foot chase.

A 47-year-old man from Dudley, a 22-year-old man from Solihull and a 22-year-old man from Birmingham were all arrested on suspicion of theft. All three have been released under investigation for these offences while enquiries continue.

Officers seized a knuckle duster and the 22-year-old man from Birmingham was later charged with possession of an offensive weapon in a public place. He will appear at Warwickshire Magistrates' Court on 6 November 2020.

Anyone with information that could help police with their ongoing enquiries can call 101 quoting incident 49 of 3 October 2020. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
