Warwickshire Police is appealing for witnesses or information after a dog was attacked by another dog in Warwick last night (Thursday 18 February).

Between 10.30pm and 11pm, a woman was walking two dogs outside Sanders Court on Bridge Street, when an off-lead Staffordshire Bull Terrier attacked one of her dogs.

Sadly, one of the dogs sustained serious injuries and had to later be euthanised by a vet.

Enquiries are currently ongoing, and investigating officers would like to speak to anyone who may have witnessed the incident. If anyone has any information or dashcam footage, please call Warwickshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 400 of 18 February 2021.
