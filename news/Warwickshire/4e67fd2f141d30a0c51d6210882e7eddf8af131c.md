Warwickshire Police is appealing for witnesses or information following a distraction burglary in Nuneaton on Wednesday (4 September).

At around 1.30pm, a man entered a property on Croft Road, claiming he was there to do work in the loft.

He then asked for an amount of money upfront to carry out the work, before leaving the property in a white Transit van.

He did not return and no work was carried out.

The suspect is described as a white man, in his late 30s or early 40s, with a 'round face', ginger hair and a ginger beard. He was wearing a navy blue t-shirt, blue shorts and work boots.

Enquiries are ongoing. If anyone witnessed the offence or has any information, please call Warwickshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 297 of 4 September 2019.

Alternatively, information can be given to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
