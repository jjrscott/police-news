A 33-year-old woman from Bedworth and a 37-year-old man from Nuneaton have been arrested on suspicion of possessing class A drugs with the intention of supplying them.

The man and woman were arrested as part of ongoing efforts to tackle the supply and use of drugs in Warwickshire.

At around 11.55am on Tuesday (22 September), officers from Warwickshire Police Proactive CID stopped a car in Heath Road, Bedworth.

The officers searched the vehicle and seized what they believe to be class A drugs.

Both suspects have been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Detective Constable Dan Lydster from Proactive CID said: "Drug suppliers seem to think they are safe to go about their business in Warwickshire while targeting some of the most vulnerable members of our community, supplying them with illegal drugs and exploiting their vulnerability.

"We remain committed to coming down hard on criminals in our area, disrupting their activity and making it as hostile as possible for them to deal."

Anyone with information that can help police with their ongoing enquiries should call 101 quoting crime number 23/40733/20. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
