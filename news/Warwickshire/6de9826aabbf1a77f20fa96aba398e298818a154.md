PC Chloe Harrison said: "I would appeal for anyone who witnessed the incident to please get in touch.

"If anyone recognises the man pictured in the dash cam image can they please contact police as we believe he may have information important to this investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting incident 299 of 17 December 2020.
