Officers investigating a courier fraud scam have arrested three people in connection with the incident.

An elderly couple in Nuneaton were contacted in September by someone purporting to be from the Government 'Claims Advisory Department' advising them that they were owed money back on their mortgage. The fraudsters then asked the victims to send cash to them over a period of three months to enable cheques to be authorised in respect of this mortgage refund.

The victims, a man and a woman in their 80s, sent over Â£30,000 to the suspects either via recorded post or by meeting face-to-face with a courier who collected the cash.

Their bank alerted the police when the victims tried to withdraw further money, and an investigation was launched which saw Warwickshire Police intercept and arrest three suspects who had arranged to collect more cash from the victims' home address yesterday afternoon (Wednesday, 2 December).

Three males, aged 17, 19 and 47, all from Cambridge, were arrested on suspicion of fraud by false representation. They have been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Detective Sergeant Paul Hainsworth from Warwickshire Police said: "This was a very upsetting incident for the victims who lost a significant amount of money at the hands of fraudsters, who continue to prey on individuals, particularly the elderly and the vulnerable.

"The fraudsters' stories are often believable and they will put a lot of pressure on victims to convince them to withdraw or transfer money.

"Please think about your loved ones and neighbours and make sure they know how to avoid scams such as these. I hope yesterday's arrests demonstrate that we will not tolerate crimes of this nature, which can have devastating impacts on victims who are often left feeling scared and worried that their home is no longer safe, and we will do everything in our power to bring offenders to justice."

**Government departments, the police or your bank will never:**

 * Contact you out of the blue and ask for your personal details, including your PIN number, password or account details
 * Ask you to transfer money into another account for fraud reasons
 * Ask you to withdraw cash and hand to someone for safe keeping
 * Ask you to purchase high value items such as gift cards
 * Send someone to your home to collect cash or other high value items, bank cards, account details or PIN numbers

**Protect yourself**

 * If you are unsure whether someone on the phone is genuine, hang up and then use a different line to call the organisation they are purporting to be from using a number from the phonebook or internet to verify their identity
 * Don't give out your personal information to anyone over the phone, including your PIN number and bank account or card details
 * If you have given out your personal banking details to someone over the phone or have given someone your card details, contact your bank immediately to cancel your card
