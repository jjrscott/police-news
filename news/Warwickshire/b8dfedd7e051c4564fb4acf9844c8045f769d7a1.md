Did you witness the theft of a vehicle in Polesworth on Thursday (5 March)?

A woman in her 20s had pulled up on Anker View when two men threatened her and demanded the keys to her car.

The men then took the car - a white VW Golf R - and drove off in the direction of Saint Edith's Road. It is believed they may have been travelling in convoy with a second vehicle - possibly a dark coloured Subaru Farista.

One of the men is described as being around 5ft 9in tall and of slim build.

He was reported to have been carrying a man bag, wearing dark trainers, gloves, a black top with a white zip and black bottoms with his hood up and a black scarf covering his face.

The second man is thought to have been wearing a black tracksuit top and bottoms with his hood up and a black scarf covering his face. He was wearing gloves and had dark coloured trainers with a fluorescent stripe and tongue.

Enquiries into the incident are currently ongoing and officers are keen to speak to anyone who was in the area, who witnessed the incident, has dashcam footage or saw anyone acting suspiciously at the time.

Anyone with information can call DC Charlotte Naughton on 101 or the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting incident 339 of 5 March.
