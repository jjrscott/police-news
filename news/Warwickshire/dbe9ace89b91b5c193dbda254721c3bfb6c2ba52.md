Warwickshire Police is appealing for witnesses or information following a sexual assault in Leamington in the early hours of this morning (Wednesday 13 November).

At around 3.45am, it's reported a woman in her twenties was sexually assaulted in an alleyway off Regent Place.

The suspect is described as a male in his late twenties, with dark black hair and a beard, wearing an orange jumper and black jeans.

"An investigation has been launched and a number of enquiries are currently ongoing, including CCTV being reviewed. As part of the investigation, we would also like to speak to three men who were in the area at the time and may have witnessed the offence.

"If anyone has any information, please call Warwickshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 33 of 13 November 2019."
