The force is recognising Armed Forces Week this week by raising the Armed Forces flag at its headquarters in Leek Wootton.

Armed Forces Week is an opportunity to acknowledge the men and women who make up the Armed Forces community - from currently serving troops to service families, reservists, veterans and cadets.

Warwickshire Police will be supporting both Reserve Forces Day today (Wednesday) and Armed Forces Day on Saturday (27 June).

Assistant Chief Constable Alex Franklin-Smith said: "In January 2018 we signed the national Armed Forces Covenant, demonstrating our commitment to treating service personnel and their families with fairness and respect, and recognising their dedication and sacrifice in serving our country.

"As part of this commitment we look forward to celebrating Armed Forces Week with our county's military community, and supporting the covenant's great work in the future."

In August 2019 the force was awarded Gold in the Ministry of Defence's (MOD) Employer Recognition Scheme (ERS).

The gold award represents the highest badge of honour available to organisations that employ and support those who serve, veterans and their families.

Warwickshire Police originally signed the Community Covenant in 2012. In 2014 this was superseded by the Armed Forces Covenant (AFC) and so in 2018 the force re-signed.

In signing the AFC it is demonstrating its commitment to treating service personnel and their families with fairness and respect, and recognising their dedication and sacrifice in serving our country.

The force employs several veterans - anyone who has served in Her Majesty's Armed Forces at any time including National Servicemen, Regulars and Reserves - as police officers and staff. It also has a Reservist Policy in place to support its employees.

The Reservists have an essential role in our Armed Forces and, through their dedication and professionalism, they make a vital contribution to protecting the nation's security at home and overseas.

Reservists give up their spare time to serve in the Reserve Forces - balancing their civilian life with a military career.

Armed Forces Week is designed to celebrate their continued role within the military community.

Inspector Lucy Sewell has served with the Royal Signals for more than 30 years, during which time she has deployed to Afghanistan, Germany, Nepal and Canada.

She said: "Joining the Reserves gives you an opportunity to enjoy a range of extraordinary new experiences and to develop new skills you would not ordinarily have in your day-to-day life.

"It has also provided me with skills that are transferrable to my role as a police officer."
