Officers searching for missing Warwick woman Susan O'Callaghan have this afternoon (Tuesday) found a body in Hill Wootton.

Although formal identification is yet to take place, the body is believed to be that of the 56-year-old who was reported missing earlier today.

The death is not being treated as suspicious at this time and Susan's next of kin has been informed. A file will be prepared for the coroner.

Thank you to everyone for their help in sharing an earlier appeal - our thoughts are with Susan's family and friends at this difficult time.
