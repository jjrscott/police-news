Four men have been arrested after police seized drugs and cash in Leamington.

While on patrol in Augusta Place yesterday (Wednesday 31 March) officers from Leamington Proactive CID stopped and searched two men. They seized cash and what they believe to be class A drugs.

A search of a nearby property resulted in more cash and suspected drugs being seized.

A 19-year-old man from Coventry and a 44-year-old man from Leamington were arrested on suspicion of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply.

A 22-year-old man from Coventry and a 41-year-old man from Leamington were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of drugs.

All the suspects were later released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Anyone with information that might help police with their enquiries can call 101 quoting incident 219 of 31 March 2021. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
