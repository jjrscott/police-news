Detectives from Nuneaton Proactive CID arrested two men in connection with drug offences on Friday (5 June).

They recovered cash and a mobile phone after they stopped a car in Avenue Road after spotting it acting suspiciously.

The two men from Nuneaton, aged 19 and 24, were initially arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of drugs.

The 24-year-old was subsequently arrested on suspicion of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply after a substance believed to be cocaine was recovered from his clothing, along with a further amount was seized from his property.

The two men have been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Detective Constable Sian Cook from Nuneaton Proactive CID said: "The dealing of drugs in our communities causes untold misery and we remain committed to tackling the problem."

Anyone with information that could help police with their enquiries should call 101 quoting crime 23/23146/20. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
