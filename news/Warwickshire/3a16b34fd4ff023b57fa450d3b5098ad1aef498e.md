The family of a 24-year-old man who died in a motorbike collision last weekend have paid tribute to him.

Luke Greenway sadly died on Sunday (12 April), after the collision on Kingswood Road on Saturday afternoon (11 April).

His parents, Marie Brown and Jonathan Greenway, said: "It is with deep sadness we can confirm the passing of our much-loved son, Luke Greenway.

"Luke was a kind, caring person who was an excellent brother to Daniel, Ben and Macy and an adoring partner to Callie.

"With an infectious personality he had the ability to put smiles on the faces of those he surrounded himself with.

"During his school years, Luke attended Nathaniel Newton, Michael Drayton, Hartshill and Etone before gaining a qualification in Public Services at North Warwickshire and Hinckley College.

"As someone who loved to be outdoors, he was a talented footballer and always enjoyed spending time fishing.

"He will be a huge loss to us all, and will never be forgotten.

"We would like to thank the key workers involved in supporting Luke at the scene and at University Hospital Coventry."

If anyone witnessed the collision and has not yet come forward to police, please call 101 quoting incident number 275 of 11 April 2020.
