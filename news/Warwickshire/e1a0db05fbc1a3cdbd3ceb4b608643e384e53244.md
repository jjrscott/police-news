A 28-year-old woman has been sent to prison for nine months after admitting to a series of vehicle crimes.

Camilla Lewitt, 28, of no fixed abode appeared before Coventry Magistrates' Court yesterday (Wednesday 24 February) where she pleaded guilty to four counts of theft from a motor vehicle, two counts of attempted theft from a motor vehicle and 10 counts of vehicle interference.

The court heard how she committed the offences in Warwick and Leamington in January and February.

Lewitt was arrested after being identified from CCTV.

PC Callum Howell from the South Warwickshire Vehicle Crime Team said: "Lewitt is a prolific offender and vehicles around Warwick and Leamington will be a lot safer following this sentencing.

"We have seen a rise in vehicle crime across the county recently and hopefully this arrest and conviction will help reassure people the vehicle crime team is being proactive in addressing it and bringing offenders to justice.

"Members of the public can help us by taking basic safety precautions to protect their vehicles and make it harder for opportunistic offenders."
