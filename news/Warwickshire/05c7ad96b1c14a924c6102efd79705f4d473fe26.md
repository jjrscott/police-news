Eighty three knives were surrendered in Warwickshire during Operation Sceptre.

Operation Sceptre is a national campaign aimed at reducing knife crime. Between 16 and 22 September, people across the country could surrender knives anonymously at their local police station.

Chief Inspector Dave Kettle, head of safer neighbourhood policing in Warwickshire, said: "We're pleased that people have handed in these potentially dangerous items. Any of these could have been used to commit an offence and instead now they will be destroyed.

"This was just one week of activity and we will continue to do everything we can to tackle knife crime. If anyone has concerns about someone carrying a knife then please contact police."

**Numbers surrendered at each station in Warwickshire:**

 * Stratford - 17
 * Nuneaton - 16
 * Rugby - 15
 * Leamington - 35
