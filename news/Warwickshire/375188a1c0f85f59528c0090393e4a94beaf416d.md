Police are appealing for help after a teenager was attacked outside a Gun Hill shop.

The 16-year-old was with friends outside the Co-op at around 4.55pm yesterday (Thursday 25 February) when a man punched him to the face and knocked him off his bike.

The boy took refuge in the shop and the police were called.

The suspect tried to punch another man who intervened to help the boy.

Officers have released CCTV and are keen to identify the man in the image who may have information about what happened.

Anyone with information should call the investigation team on 101 quoting incident 287 of 25 February 2021 or the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
