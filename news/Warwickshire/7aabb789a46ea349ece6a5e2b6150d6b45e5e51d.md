Police cordoned off an area in Alexandra Road, Nuneaton this afternoon (Thursday 5 September) following the discovery of a suspicious item at a property.

Explosives experts were called for advice as a precaution. They confirmed that the item posed no risk to local people and the cordon has now been lifted.

The property was searched as part of an ongoing investigation. Officers earlier seized what they now believe to be an imitation firearm, cash and class A and B drugs.

A 22-year-old man from Nuneaton has been arrested on suspicion of possessing a firearm and possession of drugs.

Detective Inspector Paul Thompson from Nuneaton CID said: "I'd like to thank everyone for their patience while we managed this incident. Our enquiries are ongoing and we'd appeal for anyone with information to get in touch."

Anyone with information that could help police with their enquiries can call 101 quoting incident 18 of 5 September 2019. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

NOTE TO MEDIA: Explosives experts did not attend the scene.
