Investigating officers appealing for witnesses to an assault in Nuneaton.

It happened at a property on Queens Road shortly after 6pm yesterday evening (Wednesday).

A man in his 20s was walking towards an apartment block when he saw three men outside.

After letting them into the block, he went up one flight of stairs and was assaulted - suffering head injuries and a stab wound to his arm and lower back, which are not believed to be life threatening at this time.

He was taken to hospital but has since been discharged.

The three men - two of whom are described as being black and the other white - were all wearing dark clothing and are believed to have left on foot along York Street towards Fife Street.

Enquiries into the incident are currently ongoing and anyone with information, who was in the area at the time, or who can help is asked to call 101 quoting incident 281 of 10 February.

Alternatively information can be provided anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
