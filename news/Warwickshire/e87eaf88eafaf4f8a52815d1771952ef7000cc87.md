Officers investigating county lines activity in Leamington are carrying out enquiries after three males were arrested in Leamington last night.

At around 7pm, a white vehicle was stopped on Grove Place. A small bottle was located in the vehicle, containing a liquid suspected to be acid.

A 17-year-old boy and 18-year-old man, both from Coventry, and a 21-year-old man from London, were arrested on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon.

They have been released on bail while enquiries continue.
