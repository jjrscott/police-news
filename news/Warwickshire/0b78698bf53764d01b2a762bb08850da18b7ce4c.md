Officers from Rugby Proactive CID arrested three people and seized a large quantity of suspected class A drugs and cash in the town yesterday afternoon.

After spotting a suspected drug deal while on patrol in Claremount Road the plain clothed officers seized drugs and arrested a 39-year-old man from Rugby on suspicion of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply.

They then searched a nearby house where they seized more class A drugs and cash, and arrested a 16-year-old boy from London and a 43-year-old man from Rugby on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of drugs.

The 39-year-old was also wanted in connection with an incident where a man was racially abused and he was arrested on suspicion of a committing a racially aggravated public order offence. He has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

The 16-year-old was later arrested on suspicion of obstructing a police officer after it was alleged he gave false information when he was taken into custody.

The 43-year-old was also arrested in connection with a theft from a shop last year. He was released under investigation for the drugs offence and bailed until next week for the theft offence. He was then detained under warrant for failure to appear at court.

Anyone with information that could help police with their investigation should call 101. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
