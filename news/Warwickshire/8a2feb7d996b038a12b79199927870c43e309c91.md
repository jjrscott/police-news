Two people have been arrested on suspicion of drugs offences following an incident in Rugby yesterday (Wednesday 20 May).

At around 2.30pm, officers were made aware of a suspected drug deal in an alleyway off Deepmore Road.

Suspected class A drugs were seized at the scene and further drugs were seized following a search of a property nearby.

A 36-year-old woman from Rugby and a 15-year-old boy from Leicester were both arrested on suspicion of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply. They have been released under investigation whilst enquiries continue.
