Warwickshire Police is appealing for witnesses or dashcam footage following a collision in Warwick this morning (Friday 22 January).

Police were called at around 7.20am to a report of a van colliding with a wall on Coventry Road.

The ambulance service were also in attendance. Sadly the driver of the Renault Master van, a man in his late 30s, was pronounced deceased at the scene. His next of kin has been informed.

Road closures were in place and have since been removed.

PC Jamie Blood from the Serious Collision Investigation Unit at Warwickshire Police said: "Our thoughts are with the man's family, who are currently being supported by specialist officers.

"We're appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the collision or who may have dashcam footage to please come forward.

"Anyone with any information is asked to call Warwickshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 45 of 22 January 2021."
