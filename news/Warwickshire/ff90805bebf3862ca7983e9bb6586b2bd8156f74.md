People across Warwickshire are being urged to uncover their potential and consider a career with the police with the launch of a new campaign.

The campaign, #UncoverYourPotential, was produced by Women of Warwickshire (WOW), the women's staff network for Warwickshire Police, in conjunction with second year students from the Creative Media and Film Production course at the University of Worcester.

The centrepiece of the campaign is an exciting video, starring officers and staff of all roles and ranks across Warwickshire Police, which is fun, engaging and surprising, with a message that the force hopes others will want to share.

This will be supported by posters, social media and an education pack for all primary and secondary schools across the county.

The educational campaign will provide an opportunity for students of all ages to take part in activities, including a colouring competition for younger pupils, a lesson and the opportunity to meet their local PC or PCSO.

Inspector Lucy Sewell, of WOW, said: "WOW aims to provide a support network for all women, whether officers, staff, Special Constables, apprentices or volunteers, and helps our women to fulfil their full potential and to work with others to progress diversity issues.

"The first major piece of work undertaken by WOW is the #UncoverYourPotential campaign.

"We wanted to tackle general sexism within society and challenge unconscious bias both within the force and amongst the public regarding the stereotyping of certain roles in the police service.

"We also wanted to show the huge range of opportunities available to everyone if they join Warwickshire Police - we are about so much more than bobbies on the beat!

"We also hope that the campaign will encourage more women to join our force. Warwickshire is increasingly diverse, and in order to have a workforce which reflects our communities and provides a better service to our public, we need more women to work with us, whether in frontline policing or one of our vital support staff roles."

You can view the video by searching for Warwickshire Police YouTube, or follow the hashtag #UncoverYourPotential on Twitter or Instagram.
