Chief Superintendent Ben Smith from Warwickshire Police has thanked the 'vast majority' of people who 'behaved responsibly' as pubs, bars and restaurants reopened on Saturday (4 July) following the lockdown.

The force had extra officers on the streets on Saturday to help keep people safe, and ahead of the weekend Chief Superintendent Smith urged people to behave responsibly and respect social distancing.

He said: "As we expected, the vast majority of people who went out over the weekend behaved responsibly and we'd like to thank them.

"There's no doubt it was a busy weekend for officers across the whole county but despite some isolated incidents people were generally well behaved at licensed premises.

"I'd also like to thank owners and staff at pubs and bars. It has been a particularly tough few months for their businesses but most have worked exceptionally hard to ensure their premises were safe to welcome back customers.

"Away from the pubs and bars, there were unfortunately a number of officers assaulted in drunker incidents over the weekend and we will be looking to deal with those responsible in a robust manner."
