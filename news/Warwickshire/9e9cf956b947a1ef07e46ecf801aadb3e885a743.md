A man has been arrested following an incident in Nuneaton.

Officers were called to a report of suspicious behaviour on Camborne Drive shortly before 4pm on Monday (20 January).

A man was reported to be purporting to be a police officer and threatening a 15-year-old boy.

Officers - including armed officers - attended the scene. An item - believed to be an imitation firearm - was subsequently seized and an 18-year-old man from Nuneaton was arrested on suspicion of possessing an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.

**He has been bailed until 17 February while enquiries continue**.

Inspector David Williams said: "Understandably incidents of this nature are concerning for the public but we'd like to reassure them that officers were quickly on the scene.

"No-one suffered any injuries and there was no threat to the wider public.

"Enquiries are continuing however and we would ask anyone who was in the area at the time to get in touch.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting incident 268 of 20 January.
