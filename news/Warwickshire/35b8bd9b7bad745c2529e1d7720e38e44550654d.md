Police are continuing to search for 61-year-old Keith Appleton, who was reported missing from Rugby last week.

Keith was last seen at 9.45am on Monday (18 January), walking along Newbold Road.

He is white, 5'10", of a slim build. He was last thought to be wearing a black jacket with a hood, a shirt and jumper, smart suit trousers, formal shoes, and may have been carrying a clip board.

Det Insp Jim Rankin from Warwickshire Police said: "It's now been over a week since Keith was reported missing and despite a considerable number of enquiries, unfortunately we have so far been unable to locate him.

"We would appeal to everyone to please keep an eye out for him, and would also like to hear from anyone who may have any dashcam footage between 9.45am and 10.15am on Monday morning along Newbold Road, and/or the Avon Mill junction with the Leicester Road.

"Volunteers from Warwickshire Search and Rescue have also been helping with our searches, and we would like to thank them for all of their assistance so far.

"If anyone has seen Keith or knows of his whereabouts, please call Warwickshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 220 of 18 January 2021."
