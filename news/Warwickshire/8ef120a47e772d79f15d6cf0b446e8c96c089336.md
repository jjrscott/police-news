Two men have been arrested on suspicion of drug offences following an incident in Rugby yesterday (Tuesday, 15 December).

At around 2pm, officers from the Rugby Proactive CID Team were out on patrol in New Bilton when they witnessed suspected drug dealing on Bridle Road.

They detained two men, aged 25 from Rugby and aged 24 from London, who were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A controlled drugs after a quantity of Class A drugs was recovered.

The 24-year-old from London was also arrested on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon after a knife was found on him.

The Rugby man was released under investigation and the man from London was given conditional bail until January while enquiries continue.
