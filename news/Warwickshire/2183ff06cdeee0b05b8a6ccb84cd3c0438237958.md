Were you near the Fords fields in Leamington yesterday afternoon (16 March)?

Police were called to Westlea Road at around 5.10pm following a report of a group of around 30 males on the nearby fields. One of the group was thought to be carrying a knife.

Officers attended the scene and two knives were seized.

An 18-year-old man from Warwick and a 19-year-old man from Leamington were arrested on suspicion of committing a section 3 public order offence - affray.

Both remain in police custody at this time.

No-one was injured as a result of the incident but enquiries are currently ongoing and we are looking for people who were in the area at the time or who witnessed the incident to come forward.

Anyone with information should call 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously quoting incident number 321 of 16 March.
