Officers are investigating and are appealing for witnesses to a disorder incident in Ansley Common.

It happened near to Limes Coppice at around 3.10am on Sunday (22 December).

Four men and two women believed to be in their 20s are reported to have been in the road fighting around a silver or grey Nissan Juke car.

As a result of the incident, one man received stab injuries to a leg, which are not believed to be serious. A quantity of cash was also taken.

Enquiries are ongoing and we are looking to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident.

We also believe two cars - a dark coloured Vauxhall Astra and the make and model of the second is unknown - may have been driving past while two men were fighting.

We are keen for those individuals to come forward and talk to officers.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting incident 60 of 22 December.
