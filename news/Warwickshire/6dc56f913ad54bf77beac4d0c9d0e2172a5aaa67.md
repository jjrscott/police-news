Warwickshire Police is appealing for help to locate a man who may be able to assist with an investigation.

Between around 10.30pm-11pm last night (Thursday 21 May), a woman in her 30s was assaulted on Leicester Road, Bedworth.

A passing vehicle stopped to assist the woman and drive her to hospital. The driver is believed to be a man named Sam, who had brown hair.

The woman sustained broken ribs and is currently receiving treatment for her injuries.

A 43-year-old man from Bedworth has been arrested on suspicion of S20 assault. He is currently in police custody.

Officers investigating the offence would like to speak to the driver, as he may be able to help with enquiries. He is being treated as a potential witness, not a suspect.

If anyone knows who the driver may be or has any information which could assist with enquiries, please call Warwickshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 568 of 21 May 2020.

Alternatively, information can be given to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
