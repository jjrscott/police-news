Police in Rugby have seized cannabis with an estimated street value of more than Â£200,000 during a warrant in the town.

The warrant was executed at a property in York Street this morning (Tuesday 25 February).

The warrant was carried out by the Rugby Safer Neighbourhood Team (SNT) and Rugby Proactive CID.

A 15-year-old boy of no fixed abode and 20-year-old man of no fixed abode were arrested on suspicion of cultivating cannabis.

PC Charlie Young from Rugby SNT said: "We executed this warrant based on information from the community. It led to two arrests and a significant amount of drugs confiscated.

"Drug use and supply has a hugely damaging effect on communities in terms of serious violent crime, exploitation, antisocial behaviour and petty crime.

"If you are concerned about drug cultivation or dealing in your neighbourhood please tell us. You can call 101, speak to your local safer neighbourhood team or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

"My message to people cultivating and dealing drugs is we are targeting you and we will take action to bring you to justice."
