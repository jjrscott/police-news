A Rugby man has been arrested by detectives investigating a text scam in which a man was conned out of almost £10,000.

The man was arrested this morning (Monday 1 February) by officers from the Warwickshire Police Fraud Team on suspicion of fraud and money laundering.

On 22 January, the victim - a man in his 60s from Nottinghamshire - reported receiving a text message claiming to be from HSBC stating that a new payee had been added to his account. He clicked on a link in the text and a short time later he received a call from someone claiming to be from the bank saying his account was in danger and he needed to transfer funds to another account.

The man transferred £9,350 into an account set up by the scammer.

The incident was reported to Action Fraud and the investigation taken on by the Warwickshire Police Fraud Team after the suspect was identified in Rugby.

Detective Constable Stuart Clasper from the Warwickshire Police Fraud Team said: "We are committed to stamping out telephone fraud which costs victims millions of pounds a year.

"The public can help by being alert to the signs of a scam. Please remember, your bank will never make contact asking you to transfer your money."

The suspect has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Anyone with information that could help police with their ongoing enquiries should call 101 quoting crime 23/3162/21. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

If you receive a text message you suspect is a scam don't just ignore it, forward it to 7726. This will be investigated and may help someone else falling victim.

If you have been a victim of fraud report it to Action Fraud at https://reporting.actionfraud.police.uk/lreporting or by calling 0300 123 2040. If you or someone else is in immediate danger or risk of harm dial 999 now.
