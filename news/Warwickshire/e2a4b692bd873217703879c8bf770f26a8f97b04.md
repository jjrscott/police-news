Detectives are appealing for witnesses following an assault in Leamington.

At around 7pm on Friday (18 September), a man in his 20s was assaulted in Newbold Comyn Park. He sustained a serious face injury and extensive enquiries are ongoing to trace those responsible.

Two men from Leamington, aged 26 and 38, have been arrested on suspicion of assault.

Detective Constable Magnus McCauley from Warwickshire Police Serious and Complex Crime Team said: "We'd like to speak to any witnesses, or anyone in the area with dash cam or CCTV footage so we can gather information about this incident.

"This was a shocking attack that left the victim with a serious face injury that will require surgery. We're determined to bring those responsible to justice."

You can pass information to Warwickshire Police by calling 101 or the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting incident 355 of 18 September 2020.
