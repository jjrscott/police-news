The head of the Leamington safer neighbourhood team as described vandalism caused to one of their vans as "disgusting".

The van was vandalised while parked outside the police station on Newbold Terrace over the night of Sunday (27 September) and Monday.

The van is now off the road while the graffiti is removed and police are appealing for information to help identify those responsible.

The same vandalism was discovered by officers earlier today (Tuesday 29 September) on the Queen Victoria statue in The Parade.

Sergeant Trent McMurray from the Leamington Safer Neighbourhood Team said: "This is a disgusting act of vandalism. At a time when my team are working hard to protect people in Leamington during the pandemic, it is really disappointing to be treated in this way; it's clear some people have no respect for society.

"We have carried out enquiries including viewing CCTV from the area but have been unable to identify those responsible."

Anyone with information that could help identify those responsible can report it at https://www.warwickshire.police.uk/ro/report/ocr/af/how-to-report-a-crime/ or by calling 101. Please quote crime number 23/41827/20. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
