Warwickshire Police have charged a 34 year old man from Nuneaton with driving whilst unfit through drink or drugs after a member of the public called the police at 20.50 hours on 13 December due to concern about a vehicle parked on the B4114 Nuneaton Road near Monwode Lea Lane.

Officers arrived and arrested the driver who was taken to Nuneaton custody where he was also charged with driving whilst disqualified, driving without insurance and criminal damage.

He is currently scheduled to appear at Warwickshire Magistrates Court at 11am on 5 January 2021.

Police also charged a 31 year old man from Warwick with drink driving after he was arrested in Hayle Avenue, Warwick at 00.29 hours on 13 December when officers stopped the vehicle he was driving.

He is currently scheduled to appear before Warwickshire Magistrates Court at 10am on 5 January 2021.

Warwickshire Police is publicising arrests made during December for drink or drug driving as a way of demonstrating how officers are being proactive in targeting people suspected of drink or drug driving. This is part of a campaign aimed at changing people's behaviour and reducing the number of people killed and seriously injured on the county's roads.

Officers are also asking the public to provide intelligence about anyone they believe may be drink or drug driving in Warwickshire to police by dialling 101 or 999 if a suspected offence is in progress. Reports can also be made anonymously to independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
