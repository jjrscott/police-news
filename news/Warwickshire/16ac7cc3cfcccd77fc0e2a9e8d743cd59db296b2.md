We are appealing for witnesses and dashcam footage after a serious collision in Nuneaton.

It took place on the A444 southbound carriageway around 6.15am this morning (Tuesday) and involved a cyclist and an HGV.

The cyclist - a man in his 40s - suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospital where he remains in a critical but stable condition. His family are being supported by specially trained officers.

The HGV driver was uninjured.

Officers are asking anyone who was travelling along the stretch of road, who witnessed the collision, or who has dashcam footage to get in touch

Anyone with information that can help the investigation should call 101 quoting incident number 25 of 2 February or email sciu@warwickshire.pnn.police.uk
