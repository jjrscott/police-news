Detectives from Leamington Proactive CID yesterday (Wednesday 24 June) arrested two people after executing a warrant in Gordon Court, Leamington.

The warrant resulted in a 50-year-old woman from Leamington and a 37-year-old man of no fixed abode being arrested on suspicion of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply.

Detectives seized a substance believed to be class A drugs, and cash.

Both suspects have been released under investigation while enquiries continue. Anyone with information that could help police with their enquiries can call 101 quoting crime 23/25966/20. You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
