Two men have been arrested in connection with a distraction burglary.

The 18-year-old man from Netherton, West Midlands, and 19-year-old man from Evesham were arrested in Coleshill yesterday (Wednesday 15 July) by officers from the Warwickshire Police Operational Policing Unit as part of an investigation into a distraction burglary in Overslade, Rugby on Monday afternoon.

The victim - a woman in her 90s - reported that on Monday a number of men came to her property in a white transit van and pretended to do work before demanding money. When she said she didn't have the money one of the men barged past her and searched the drawers in the bedroom. He said they would come back a few days later for the cash.

After they left the victim noticed a quantity of cash had been stolen from her purse.

The men have been arrested on suspicion of burglary in connection with this incident and also in connection with a burglary in Derbyshire.

Enquiries are ongoing.

Police are keen to speak to anyone in the area who received a visit in similar circumstances.

Anyone with information that could help police with their investigation can call 101 quoting incident 157 of 14 July 2020. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
