Were you on Cottage Close in Sydenham around 6.15pm on Tuesday (3 December)?

A woman in her 40s was walking in the street when she was approached from behind by two individuals who attempted to snatch her handbag.

A struggle ensued before the woman was assaulted to the face and the ribs.

The bag - containing a quantity of cash, a mobile phone and other personal items - was taken.

The individuals did not speak during the incident and left the area in an unknown direction.

Enquiries are currently ongoing but we would like to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident, or who saw anyone acting suspiciously in the area at the time.

Anyone with information is asked to call DS Pete Sherwood on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting incident number 352 of 3 December.
