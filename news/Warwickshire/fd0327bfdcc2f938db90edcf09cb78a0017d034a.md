Warwickshire Police is appealing for any witnesses or information following an attack that took place last night (Monday 8 March) on Lighthorne Road, Kineton.

At around 9.25pm, a 20-year-old man was out for a walk when two Asian males got out a black BMW X5, assaulted him and threatened him with a knife.

As another vehicle drove down the street the two men returned to their car and left the scene.

Any information can be given by calling Warwickshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 0379 of 8 March 2021.

Information can also be given anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
