Two teenage boys have been arrested on suspicion of robbery following an incident in Kenilworth on Friday (3 April).

At around 4pm, a 14-year-old boy was riding his orange bike close to Just Tyres on Kenilworth Common, when he was approached by two males who stopped him and asked him for his bike.

One of the individuals is reported to have been holding what is described as a kitchen knife while the second had a large piece of wood.

The victim jumped off his bike and left the area. He was uninjured but left shaken up.

A 14-year-old boy and a 15-year-old boy, both from Kenilworth, were arrested on suspicion of robbery and have been released on police bail

Investigating officers would like to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident. Anyone with information is asked to call Det Con Anita Dyer at Warwickshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 229 of 3 April, or information can be given to the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
