Two people have been arrested in connection with drugs offences, following an incident in Leamington yesterday (Thursday 12 November).

At around 2.30pm, a car was stopped by police on Leicester Street in the town.

A quantity of Class A and cash was seized, and a 16-year-old boy from Manchester was detained close by and arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply.

Shortly afterwards, a 32-year-old woman from Kenilworth was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of controlled drugs.

Det Sgt Sarah Wolsey from Leamington CID said: "Thank you to the public for their cooperation yesterday while the incident was ongoing and the road was blocked.

"Two arrests have now been made and both have been released under investigation while enquiries are ongoing."

If anyone has any concerns or suspicions about the supply of illegal drugs in their community, including individuals with multiple mobile phones, tablets or 'SIM cards' with no reasonable explanation, unknown or suspicious looking characters coming and going from a neighbour's house or someone acquiring money they can't account for, please report it to police. Information can be given by calling 101 or reporting online.
