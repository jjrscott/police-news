As pubs, bars and restaurants open this weekend, Warwickshire Police and Warwickshire County Council have joined forces to remind people that while restrictions are being eased, Coronavirus is still prevalent in the community and people still need to behave responsibly.

Pubs across the country will be allowed to open this Saturday (4July) with social distancing measures in place to help restrict the spread of Coronavirus.

Warwickshire Police will have extra officers on the streets of the county over the weekend to help keep people safe and they are urging people to know their limits when it comes to alcohol, respect social distancing and look out for their friends.

Warwickshire County Council is also urging people to drink responsibly. Drinking more than the recommended amount of alcohol increases the risk of many diseases and cancer. The Chief Medical Officer advises that adults consume no more than 14 units per week and this should be spread across the week rather than in one single occasion. If you feel that you are not in control of the amount alcohol you are drinking, services continue to be available, to find out more visit https://www.warwickshire.gov.uk/alcohol

Warwickshire Police and Warwickshire County Council are also reminding people the reopening of the pubs might be an anxious time for victims of domestic abuse. If you're worried about your partner or a family member becoming aggressive or abusive after a few drinks, there are services available to help you. Please remember, you are not alone. If you need help and support, please visit www.refuge.co.uk or call 0800 408 1552. In an emergency please call 999.

Chief Superintendent Ben Smith, Head of Local Policing at Warwickshire Police, said: "We appreciate many will have been looking forward to the pubs reopening and people will want to go out and have a drink with their friends. However, it is important to remember that social distancing measures remain in place; Coronavirus is still in our community and it is still dangerous.

"We will have extra officers on the streets Saturday night to help keep people safe. However, it is important everyone takes responsibility for their behaviour; these measures are in place to protect you, and your friends and family. Where people are failing to social distance we will work with the council to use enforcement powers."

Portfolio holder for Adult Social Care and Health at Warwickshire County Council, Councillor Les Caborn said: "As we see further changes to lockdown measures, we're all looking forward to being able to visit the places we haven't been to for a while. If you're thinking about going to the pub or visiting a restaurant this weekend, please remember to drink responsibly. Alcohol can not only impact your health, but also your judgment and behaviour.

"Seeing pubs begin to open can also cause concerns for people in an abusive relationship as partners or family members may become more aggressive after a few drinks.

"Anyone who needs support to manage their drinking can visit https://www.warwickshire.gov.uk/alcohol or if you need help and support in an abusive relationship visit https://www.refuge.org.uk/"

People are being urged to adhere to the following advice:

 * Adhere to social distancing rules.

 * Practice good hand hygiene

 * When drinking, know your limits

 * Follow instructions from staff at the venue

 * Plan your day

 * Consider how you are going to get home safely

 * Look out for your friends
