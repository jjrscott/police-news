Investigating officers are appealing for witnesses to a robbery in Mancetter.

A man in his 20s was outside a property on Nuneaton Road around 5.15pm on Wednesday (15 January) when he was approached by three unknown men.

One of the men is reported to have threatened the victim before his watch - a gold and stainless steel Rolex Yacht Master with a blue face - was stolen.

The three men are described as wearing dark tops with the hoods up. They are understood to have left on foot towards the railway bridge.

The victim was uninjured but left shaken by the incident.

Enquiries are ongoing and we are keen to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident, who was in the area at the time or can help with the investigation.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting incident number 318 of 15 January.
