Police are asking all road users to please take extra care following a collision involving a car and a cyclist that occurred just before 6pm on Thursday 23 April 2020 at the junction of Queen's Road, Nuneaton with the Roanne Ringway.

The cyclist, a man in his 40's, suffered serious injuries including a broken arm and was taken to George Eliot Hospital by ambulance for further assessment and treatment. He remains in hospital awaiting surgery.

Any witnesses to the collision are please asked to contact Warwickshire Police on 01926 415415 quoting incident 305 of 23 April.

Officers investigating the circumstances of the collision are taking the opportunity to ask all road users to please take extra care on our roads.

With more vulnerable road users such as runners, walkers and cyclists choosing to take their daily exercise in the fresh air, we are asking them to continue to be vigilant even though the roads may be quieter and to stop look and listen especially at junctions.

We are also asking drivers to slow down and please take extra care around these vulnerable road users giving them extra space and time.

Please take extra care and stay safe on our roads.
