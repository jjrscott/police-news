Three men have been arrested in connection with class A & B drugs offences in Rugby.

At around 12.15 pm yesterday afternoon (Thursday 30 April), a vehicle was reported acting suspiciously in a car park on Chapel Street, Rugby.

Officers attended and the occupants of the vehicle were searched, which led to a subsequent search at a property in Morton Gardens. A significant quantity of suspected MDMA, amphetamine and cannabis was found and seized from the property, alongside a large amount of cash.

A 27-year-old man, a 34-year-old man and a 39-year-old man have all been arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A & B drugs. They are currently in police custody.
