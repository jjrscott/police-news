Detectives investigating a burglary in Old Arley are appealing for help to identify a car that was in the area at the time.

The burglary occurred in Rectory Road at between 4pm and 4.15pm on Thursday 31 October. Entry was forced to the house and a number of items were stolen including bank cards and a mobile phone.

CCTV enquires have identified a white Audi - possibly an A1 or A3 - driving down Rectory Road around the time of the incident.

Detective Constable Sian Cook from Warwickshire Police Proactive CID said: "We're keen to identify the driver of this car as they may have witnessed the burglary or have dash cam footage that could be vital to our investigation."

Anyone with information that could help police with their enquiries should call 101 quoting incident 317 of 31 October 2019. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
