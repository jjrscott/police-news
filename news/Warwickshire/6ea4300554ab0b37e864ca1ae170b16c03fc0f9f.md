A man has now been charged following an armed incident in Warwick last month.

Daniel Reid, 34, of Emscote Road, Warwick was charged with possession of an air weapon with intent to cause fear of violence and five counts of assaulting an emergency worker.

Police were called to Reid's home address on 28 February out of concern for his welfare when it is alleged a firearm was pointed at them.

Reid will appear at Coventry Magistrates' Court on 7 May.
