Investigating officers are appealing for witnesses to a robbery in Leamington.

A man in 30s was outside the Co-op on Clemens Street at around 12.50pm on Tuesday (9 March) when he was approached by another man who threatened him before taking his mobile phone and tobacco.

The victim was left shaken but uninjured while the man - who was understood to be with another man that did not speak - left the area in the direction of Brunswick Street.

He is described as white, around 6ft tall, in his late 30s to early 40s, of slim build, with mousey brown short hair that is shaved on the sides.

Enquiries are currently ongoing and officers are keen to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident, who was in the area at the time or who saw anyone acting suspiciously.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting incident 129 of 9 March.
