Police are asking the public to help find a 28-year-old man who is wanted after failing to attend court.

Zathon Dale Williams, 28, from Bedworth, is wanted after failing to appear at Warwick Magistrates' Court last week where he faced a charge of conspiracy to supply cocaine.

Police have been carrying out enquiries to locate him and are now appealing to the public for help.

Anyone with information about his whereabouts is asked to please contact Warwickshire Police on 101.

Information can also be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
