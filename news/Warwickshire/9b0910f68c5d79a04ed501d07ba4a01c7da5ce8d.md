Updated News Post

Please see update in bold below.

We are appealing for witnesses to a fatal collision in Whitnash to come forward.

It happened on Golf Lane shortly before 12.30am on Friday (8 May) and involved a moped.

The moped is understood to have been travelling from the Sydenham area and turned into Golf Lane from Whitnash Road before the rider came off his bike and collided with a lamppost.

The rider - a man in his 30s - suffered serious head injuries and was taken to hospital **where he later passed away.**

**His next of kin has been informed and his family is being supported by specialist officers.**

Enquiries are currently ongoing but police would like to speak with any witnesses to the incident or people who saw the moped and the manner in which it was being ridden prior to the collision.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting incident number 6 of 8 May.
