The family of a man who died following a collision in Rugby at the weekend has paid tribute to him.

Officers were called to the A428 Crick Road around 2.30am on Saturday (21 March) following a collision between a silver BMW 320D estate and a pedestrian.

The pedestrian - Benjamin Peacock (pictured below) - was sadly pronounced deceased at the scene.

Paying tribute to the 42-year-old, his family said: "There can be no pain more terrible and deep than that of losing a son, brother, grandson, nephew, uncle, cousin and friend.

"We all have a vacant place now in our hearts. We can not forget his footsteps, hugs, nor his dear loving face. The smile that lit up a room for everyone.

"Rest in peace our darling boy. Our 'party party' Ben."

We are continuing to appeal for witnesses to the collision and are keen to speak to anyone who saw two pedestrians on the Crick Rd between the Paddox Public House and the canal bridge shortly before the collision.

Anyone with information should call the Serious Collision Investigation Unit on 01926 415415 quoting incident number 40 of 21 March.
