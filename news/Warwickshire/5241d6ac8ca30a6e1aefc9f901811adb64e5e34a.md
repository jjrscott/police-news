Warwickshire Police is appealing for help to locate 33-year-old man from Coventry.

Aftab Miah was due to appear at Warwick Crown Court in August 2019 in connection with a charge of possession with intent to supply class A.

He did not appear and a Bench Warrant has now been issued by the court.

He is described as an Asian man, around 5ft 8ins, of a stocky build.

If anyone has seen Miah or knows of his whereabouts, please call PSI Roger Hazlewood at Warwickshire Police on 101.
