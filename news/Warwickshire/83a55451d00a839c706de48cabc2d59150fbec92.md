Police are calling for help from the public after disorder involving a group of people left two men in their 20s in hospital.

Police officers and paramedics went to the scene of the incident at 12.04am today (Sunday 13 October). Detectives believe the disorder started in the Spread Eagle Public House in High Street before spilling out on to the road.

The men were taken to hospital with head injuries. Their injuries are not thought to be life-threatening or life-changing.

A 30-year-old man from the Tamworth area has been arrested on suspicion of assault in connection with the incident.

Police believe there are a number of witnesses, some of whom intervened to try to break up the disorder.

Detectives investigating the incident are keen to speak to anyone who may have seen what happened and the events leading up to the disorder.

They are particularly interested in speaking with anyone who may have captured footage or images on their mobile phone.

Anybody with information can contact police on 101 or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111, quoting incident 1 of 13 October 2019.
