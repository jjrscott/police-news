Warwickshire Police is appealing for witnesses following a collision at Coombe Abbey Country park yesterday afternoon (Sunday 11 October).

At around 1.55pm, a motorcycle was in collision with a nine-year-old boy on the main driveway.

The motorcyclist, which was in company with another bike, did not stop and left the scene.

The boy was taken to hospital by ambulance and has since been discharged.

Sgt Scott Good from Warwickshire Police said: "We're appealing for any witnesses or dashcam footage to this incident, which left a child requiring hospital attendance. Thankfully he was not seriously injured, but the motorcyclist did not stop at the scene and we are now actively trying to locate him.

"If anyone witnessed the incident or has any information, please call 101 quoting incident number 179 of 11 October 2020."

Information can also be given anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
