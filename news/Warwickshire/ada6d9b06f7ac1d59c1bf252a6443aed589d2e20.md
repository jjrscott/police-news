The May Roads Policing Newsletter is now available to help raise awareness of the work being done to reduce the numbers of people killed or seriously injured (KSI) on Warwickshire's roads and protect people from harm.

There continues to be a strong roads policing presence in Warwickshire and the newsletter pulls together all the roads policing news into one place so that it can be easily referenced and shared internally and externally with partners and the public to demonstrate some of the good work being done.

The newsletter is produced monthly and it is anticipated at some point it will be renamed and expanded to include more partner information.
