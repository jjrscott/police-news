Eight people were arrested this morning as part of an investigation into organised criminality in Warwickshire.

Officers from the force's Serious and Organised Crime Unit (SOCU) executed warrants in Rugby, Daventry, Bishops Tachbrook and Lighthorne Heath.

A 43-year-old man and a 38-year-old woman were arrested in Montgomery Drive, Rugby. A 28-year-old man was arrested in Kingsley Road, Bishops Tachbrook. A 77-year-old man was arrested in Wortley Close, Rugby and a 27-year old man was arrested in Spinney Close, Lighthorne Heath. A 40 year old man was arrested in Leamington Town Centre.

A 44-year-old man and a 33-year-old woman were arrested in Hood Road, Daventry.

All are currently in police custody, arrested on suspicion of Conspiracy to supply Class A drugs. 5 of the people were also arrested on suspicion of possessing firearms They are being interviewed by detectives at this time.

During the day officers also recovered a quantity of illegal drugs and cash with the help of specialist search teams and dogs.

Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Inspector Richard Brown from SOCU said: "Today's action shows that we will continue to target those who feel they are "untouchable" and are causing serious harm to our communities.

"Organised crime groups who supply illegal drugs both locally and across the country, use violence, quite often involving gun and knife crime to protect their business interests. This has a devastating impact on some of the most vulnerable in our society - often young people or vulnerable adults who are used and abused by these networks.

I would like to reassure the communities of Warwickshire today that we will not tolerate this kind of serious criminality and will use all of the powers available to us to bring offenders to justice and keep our county safer."

Protect is a campaign run by Warwickshire Police to tackle Serious and Organised Crime. It sees the force working closely with partner agencies to disrupt and dismantle organised crime groups.
