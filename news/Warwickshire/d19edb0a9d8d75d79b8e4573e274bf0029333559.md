Warwickshire Police is appealing for witnesses or information following a robbery in Kenilworth this afternoon (Monday 26 October).

At around 2pm, a woman in her 70s was walking through the alleyway from the car park behind Iceland to Barrowfield Road when a male approached her and stole her handbag.

The bag has since been recovered.

The suspect is described as white male, approx. 5'9", of a slight build, whose face was unshaven. He was wearing a multi-coloured hat (believed to be brown or beige) and a dark-coloured bomber jacket.

PC Steven Jones from Warwickshire Police said: "This was an understandingly traumatic incident for the victim and a number of enquiries are now underway to locate the offender.

"If anyone witnessed the incident, any suspicious behaviour in the area or may have dashcam/CCTV footage of this location, please contact us.

"Any information can be reported by calling 101 and quoting incident number 195 of 26 October 2020."

Information can also be given to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
