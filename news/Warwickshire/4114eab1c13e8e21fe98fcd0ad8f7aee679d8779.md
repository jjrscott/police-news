Detectives investigating a telephone fraud have arrested a man from London.

The investigation was launched after a woman from Stoneleigh and her sister were conned out of Â£9000 on Tuesday (6 October).

The victims report a man claiming to be from the police contacting them saying he was investigating counterfeit money. He persuaded the women to withdraw the money and then called them back and got them to read the serial numbers on the notes. The offender said the notes were counterfeit and then sent someone to pick them up.

The 27-year-old was arrested on suspicion of fraud on Friday and later released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Detective Sergeant Paul Hainsworth from the Warwickshire Police Fraud Investigation Team said: "We've seen a spike in these types of offences in Warwickshire over the last few weeks and we're urging people to be on their guard.

"It is important people remember the police will never ask you to withdraw money.

"If you receive a phone call you are concerned about say you will call them back; a genuine caller will be fine with this, only fraudsters will put you under pressure to act immediately. Make sure you use a number from the phonebook or the internet, and call back on a different phone as sometimes offenders will keep the line open."

Anyone who can help police with their ongoing enquiry should call 101 quoting incident 146 of 7 October 2020. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
