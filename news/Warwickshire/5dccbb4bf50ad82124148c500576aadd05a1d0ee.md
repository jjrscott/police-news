A car fire in Nuneaton is being treated as arson, detectives have confirmed.

The incident occurred at around 10.40pm on Sunday (19 April) in Bucks Hill.

Police Staff Investigator Mark Linnett from the Nuneaton Serious and Complex Crime Team said: "Our main line of enquiry moment is that someone deliberately set fire to a black Audi parked on the driveway in Bucks Hill.

"The vehicle was destroyed and the flames also caused damage to the brickwork at the address. It's extremely lucky the fire didn't spread further and that nobody was hurt.

"We're appealing for anyone with information, who witnessed the incident or who has CCTV or dash cam footage from the area to get in touch."

Anyone who can help with the investigation should call 101 quoting incident 483 of 19 April 2020. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers 0800 555 111.
