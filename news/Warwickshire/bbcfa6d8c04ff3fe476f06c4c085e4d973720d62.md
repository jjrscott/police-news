A man has been arrested after a car failed to stop for police in Rugby yesterday morning (Tuesday 2 March).

Officers from Rugby Proactive CID attempted to stop the car after spotting the driver involved in a suspected drug deal in Clifton Road.

As officers approached the car and identified themselves, it reversed at speed colliding with an officer and an unmarked police car.

The driver left the scene; however, later in the day a 22-year-old man from Rugby presented himself at Rugby Police Station and was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and being concerned in the supply of drugs. He has since been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Fortunately, the officer was not injured in the incident.

Talking about the supply of drugs in Rugby, Detective Constable Matthew Rapkins from Rugby Proactive CID said: "The people who deal drugs don't care about damage they cause in our communities. We will continue to be proactive in identifying those responsible and seeking to bring them to justice."

Any witnesses to this incident or anyone with information can call 101 quoting incident 123 of 2 March 2021. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
