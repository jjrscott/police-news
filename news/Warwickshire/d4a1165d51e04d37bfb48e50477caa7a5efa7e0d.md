Two vehicles have been seized by police after one was found to be stolen and the other was on cloned number plates.

Officers were made aware of a Land Rover Discovery in Stockton yesterday (Tuesday 7 April) which was believed to have been stolen. On attendance, the vehicle was confirmed to have been stolen from Northamptonshire last Thursday (2 April).

Whilst in the location, officers checked a Mazda which was parked next to the Land Rover. This was found to have been using cloned number plates, and both vehicles were subsequently seized.

Investigating officer, PC Mottram from Warwickshire Police, said: "These vehicles were likely linked to each other and were potentially going to be used to commit further offences.

"They have now been taken off the streets and seized for forensic examination.

"This is a message to criminals - even in the current circumstances, our work is still continuing and if you steal or clone vehicles, we will find you."
