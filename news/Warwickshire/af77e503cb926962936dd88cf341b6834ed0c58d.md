A man and a woman have been arrested on suspicion of drug offences following an incident in Nuneaton yesterday (Tuesday, 15 December).

At around 2pm, officers from the Nuneaton Proactive CID Team were called to a report of suspicious activity at an address on Cornish Crescent.

On attendance, they discovered a large quantity of what is believed to be cannabis along with drugs paraphernalia and cash inside the property.

A 30-year-old woman and a 36-year-old man, both from Nuneaton, were arrested on suspicion of possession of a controlled Class B drug with intent to supply. They have been released on police bail while enquiries continue.
