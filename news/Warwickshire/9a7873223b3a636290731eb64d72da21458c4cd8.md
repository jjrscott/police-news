A post-mortem has taken place of a man whose body was found in a property in Nuneaton last week.

Officers were called to Sunnyside Court shortly after 2pm last Thursday (2 July), where sadly a man in his 50s was found deceased.

A post-mortem has concluded there are no suspicious findings, and a file will now be prepared for the coroner.

The man's next of kin has been informed.

A 46-year-old man from Nuneaton who was arrested in connection with the incident has now been released with no further action.
