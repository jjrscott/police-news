The Warwickshire Police control room uses an approach called THRIVE to assess how best to respond to your call or contact.

THRIVE stands for Threat, Harm, Risk, Investigation, Vulnerability and Engagement. THRIVE methodology is a recognised technique in policing and is used by a number of police services around the country.

In practice, using THRIVE means the force makes an individual assessment of every contact, to ensure the most suitable response is provided. This could include an immediate deployment of officers, a response within the hour, a scheduled appointment or a telephone call from one of our investigators. On some occasions, police are not always the appropriate agency to deal with your matter and we will aim to signpost you to the most appropriate agency.

THRIVE helps us to make appropriate decisions about the level of resource we commit to each incident. That means we can deploy the right people, with the right skills, to deal with incidents. This is good news for victims, as it helps us to use our finite resources as effectively as possible.

THRIVE is about providing an appropriate and proportionate response, rather than having a "one size fits all" approach to certain types of crime.

In addition you can now report non-emergency crime online here.

Make the right call - you can find a whole host of useful information on our website.
