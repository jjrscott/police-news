The man who died following a collision in Atherstone last month has been named as Steven Creswell.

The 58-year-old was driving on the southbound carriageway of the A5 around 6.40am on Sunday 29 November when his silver Mercedes was involved in a collision with an HGV.

The HGV driver was uninjured.

Steven's family are being supported by specially trained officers and have asked that their privacy be respected at this difficult time.

Officers are keen to speak with anyone who saw the incident, or who saw the vehicles and the manner in which they were being driven prior to the collision.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting incident number 46 of 29 November.
