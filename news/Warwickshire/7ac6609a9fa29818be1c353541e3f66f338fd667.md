Warwickshire Police is appealing for witnesses or information after a woman was bitten by a dog in Wellesbourne last week.

At around 11.15am on Friday 15 January, a woman was walking her dog on Mountford Sports Field when a black Labrador approached her and bit her on her knee. The woman required hospital treatment for the injury.

The Labrador and its owner - believed to be a white woman in her late 50s or early 60s, with short grey hair - then left the location.

Enquiries are ongoing and investigating officers would ask anyone who may have witnessed the incident to please call Warwickshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 102 of 15 January 2021.
