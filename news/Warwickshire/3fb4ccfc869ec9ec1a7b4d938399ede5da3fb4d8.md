A man has been jailed for four-and-a-half years for a drug offence following an investigation by Warwickshire Police Proactive CID.

On 23 July 2019 a drug warrant was executed in Walton Road, Wellesbourne. While the warrant was being executed, Shpresim Rexhaj, 29, from Coventry pulled up in his car. He tried to drive away but was prevented by officers and detained.

They seized a key from Rexhaj which they used to open the premises where they found more than Â£20,000 worth of cocaine in a washing machine. His fingerprints were found on the drugs.

Rexhaj was arrested and last week at Warwick Crown Court pleaded guilty to possession of class A drugs with intent to supply.

Detective Sergeant Gavin Hampton from Leamington Proactive CID said: "This is another example of how proactive policing and targeted investigations are negatively impacting on those who think they can profit from the supply of drugs.

"We are committed to making Warwickshire as hostile as possible for criminals like Rexhaj."
