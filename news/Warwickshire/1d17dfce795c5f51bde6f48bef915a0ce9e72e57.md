Four people have been arrested for suspected drug offences following an incident in Leamington last night (Thursday 1 October).

Officers attended a property on Windmill Road at around 7pm, where a large quantity of suspected class A drugs, knives, cash, drug paraphernalia and an imitation firearm were recovered.

A 17-year-old boy from Manchester, two 18-year-old men from Coventry and a 52-year-old local man were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of controlled drugs. They are currently in police custody.

Det Con Davis from Warwickshire Police said: "We're proactively working to relentlessly tackle those suspected of being involved in the production and supply of illegal drugs in our communities.

"We're currently conducting a number of criminal investigations and want to send a strong message to anyone concerned in the supply of drugs in Warwickshire - you will be caught.

"We would urge the public to support us and tell us about any concerns you have around drug dealing in your community."
