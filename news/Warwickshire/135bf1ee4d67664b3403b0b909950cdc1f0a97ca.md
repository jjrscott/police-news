CORRECTION: Please note correction to age in bold below.

A man has been charged following an attack on a teenage man.

The 19-year-old suffered a serious head injury following the incident in Radford Road, Leamington on 18 August 2019.

It is alleged that following the incident the suspect threatened witnesses and gave false information to a police officer.

Luke Kybird, 25, of Lambourn Crescent, Leamington, appeared at Warwick Magistrates' Court yesterday morning (Tuesday 3 September) charged with inflicting grievous bodily harm without intent, obstructing a constable in execution of their duty and threatening to damage or destroy property.

Kybird was bailed to appear at Warwick Crown Court on 4 October.
