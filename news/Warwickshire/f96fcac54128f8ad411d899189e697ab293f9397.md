Warwickshire Police is appealing for witnesses to a serious vehicle collision that occurred on the A4071 Rugby relief road, at approximately 2115hrs on Saturday 5 September 2020.

The collision is believed to have occurred as a 2001 registered blue 325 BMW was travelling along the relief road towards the A45 when it collided with a Ford Fiesta travelling in the opposite direction. A dark grey 2005 registered Audi A3 was also travelling in the same direction as the Ford Fiesta and failed to remain at the scene.

As a result of the collision the 25 year old male driver of the BMW from Leamington Spa and a 19 year old male travelling with his brother in the Ford Fiesta suffered serious, potential life changing injuries. The 22 year old brother in the Ford Fiesta was also injured in the collision. Following the collision, all three were taken by ambulance to University Hospital Coventry & Warwickshire.

Officers investigating the incident are appealing for witnesses or footage of the collision or of the dark grey Audi A3 or the blue BMW 325 before or after the collision occurred.

Any witnesses are please asked to contact Warwickshire Police on 101 quoting incident 418 of 5 September 2020.
