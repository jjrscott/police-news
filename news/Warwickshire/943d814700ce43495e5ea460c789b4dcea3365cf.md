Following a Warwickshire Police investigation, an 18-year-old man has been convicted for drugs offences in Leamington.

Daine Dwyer of Lordswood Road, Birmingham, appeared at Warwick Crown Court on 11 March.

At around 2pm on 18 December last year, officers conducted a stop search on Dwyer on Eagle Street in Leamington.

He was found with six grams of cocaine, weighing scales, a mobile phone with drugs-supply related messages and cash on him.

He was arrested and charged, and later pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply class A drugs. He will be sentenced at the same court on 25 March.

Det Con Paul Luke from Leamington CID said: "Illegal drugs bring misery to our communities and this conviction is another example of our officers doing all they can to remove the supply of them from our streets.

"If anyone has any information about the production or supply of drugs in their community please let us know and we will act on it."
