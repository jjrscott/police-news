A Bidford man has been sentenced to prison for online child sex offences.

David Chapman, aged 33 of Waterloo Road, appeared at Warwick Crown Court yesterday (Tuesday 11 August).

In March, he pleaded guilty to offences of Distributing Category A/B/C images, Making Category A/B/C images and inciting a child aged 15 to engage in sexual activity.

All of the offences took place online between 2015 and 2017, and the offence of inciting a child involved Chapman contacting a teenage girl in the USA.

Chapman was caught after intelligence was received from an internet service provider, and he was arrested by police in March 2018.

Yesterday, he was given a custodial sentence of four years and six months, and was ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register for life. He was also issued with a Sexual Harm Prevention Orders, and made to pay a victim surcharge.

Investigating officer, Detective Constable Mark Churchill said: "Chapman preyed on children - some of the most vulnerable members of our communities - and thanks to the diligence of an internet service provider, his actions were intercepted.

"Whilst social media and the internet provide a wealth of positive opportunities, children and parents need to be aware of the dangers and know how to spot signs of online child sexual exploitation.

"We remain committed to tracking down and investigating those who seek to obtain this kind of material, to ensure their offending is stopped and they are brought to justice for their actions."
