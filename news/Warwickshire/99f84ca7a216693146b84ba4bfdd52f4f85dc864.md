Following a Warwickshire Police investigation, two people have been sentenced for drugs offences in Nuneaton.

Jay Bailey, aged 37 of Marlborough Road, Nuneaton and Melissa Sampson, aged 33 of Arley both appeared at Warwick Crown Court on 19 January 2021.

On 12 August 2019, both were arrested on suspicion of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply (heroin) in the Marlborough Road area of Nuneaton. They were stopped by officers and found to be in possession of Heroin with a street value of Â£340, following a stop search.

Both were later charged and found guilty. They were convicted of possession with intent to supply class A Heroin and being concerned in the supply of Heroin.

At court, Jay Bailey was sentenced to three years and six months and Melissa Sampson was given a two year sentence.

Following the sentencing, investigating officer Det Con Darren Giles from Nuneaton CID said: "The misery drugs can cause is well known not just to those who take them but to those in the local community as well.

"We will proactively target people we believe to be involved in drugs and use the powers we have to make sure their activity is disrupted.

"I hope this sentence acts as a deterrent to others - we will thoroughly investigate all drugs activity so we can bring offenders to justice and protect our communities from harm."
