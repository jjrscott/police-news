The September Roads Policing Newsletter is now available to help raise awareness of the work being done by police and partners to reduce the numbers of people killed or seriously injured (KSI) on Warwickshire's roads and protect people from harm.

The newsletter pulls together all the roads policing news into one place including updates from partners so that it can be easily shared.

The newsletter is produced bi-monthly and it is anticipated at some point it will be renamed and expanded to include even more partner information.
