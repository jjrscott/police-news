A man in his 40s has died following a collision on the M40 this morning (Tuesday).

Police were initially called to the northbound stretch of the motorway between J12 (Gaydon) and J13 (Leamington/Warwick) shortly after 11pm yesterday evening (Monday) following a report of a collision involving four HGVs and a car.

A man in his 30s suffered a serious leg injury and was taken to hospital where he remains in a stable condition. Three other people suffered minor injuries.

At around 12.20am a second collision - involving three HGVs and a car - took place on the same stretch of road just prior to Warwick Services.

Officers attended along with teams from the West Midlands Ambulance Service but a man was pronounced deceased at the scene.

His next of kin has been informed and is being supported by specialist officers at this time.

Two further individuals suffered minor injuries.

Enquiries are ongoing and we are appealing for witnesses to both collisions to come forward. Officers are also keen for anyone who has dashcam footage to get in touch.

Anyone with information should call 101 quoting incident 435 of 21 September (in relation to the first collision) or incident 9 of 22 September (for the second collision).
