Two people have been arrested for drugs offences after a vehicle was stopped in Stratford this morning (Friday 4 September).

At around 11.15am, officers from the Southern Vehicle Crime were on patrol within Stratford when they saw a blue Skoda Fabia travelling along the Birmingham Road. The vehicle had a faulty rear light and no insurance, and was acting suspiciously near to the canal.

The vehicle was stopped and Class A drugs, cash and mobile phones were recovered.

Two 19-year-old men, both from Birmingham, were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A drugs. Two addresses in Birmingham have been searched and both men remain in custody whilst enquiries continue
