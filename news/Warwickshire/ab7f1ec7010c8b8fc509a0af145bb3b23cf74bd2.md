Do you recognised any of the individuals pictured?

Officers investigating a public order incident in Nuneaton on Wednesday 24 June would like to speak to them as they believe they could help with the ongoing investigation.

Police were called to a report of a gathering of people in the car park area of Alexandra Street between 11.45pm and 12.15am.

On attendance, officers were threatened with assault, bottles were thrown and damage was caused to a private property.

A 20-year-old man of no fixed above was arrested for being drunk and disorderly and received a Â£90 fixed penalty notice.

A 20-year-old from Nuneaton was arrested for assaulting an emergency worker and was given an adult caution. He was also arrested to prevent a breach of the peace but released with no further action (NFA).

Enquiries are ongoing but anyone pictured, who recognises those people in the images, or has information that could assist with enquiries is asked to get in touch.

Anyone with information should call 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting crime number 602 of 24 June.
