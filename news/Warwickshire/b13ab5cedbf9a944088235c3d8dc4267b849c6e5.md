A woman who assaulted four police officers has been jailed.

Gemma Laws, 27, of Heming Walk, Nuneaton was arrested following a disturbance at her home address.

In the early hours of Sunday (21 March) morning, officers responded to a report of a disturbance.

Laws opened the door and punched an officer in the face. As officers attempted to force entry and arrest Laws another was punched and another had glass thrown at them.

A fourth officer was assaulted in the police car on the way to custody.

Appearing at Coventry Magistrates' Court on Monday Laws pleaded guilty to four counts of assaulting an emergency worker and was sentenced to 32 weeks in prison.

Speaking after the sentence, Deputy Chief Constable Debbie Tedds said: "Our officers put their lives and safety on the line every day to protect all of us; they should never have to tolerate physical abuse when carrying out their duties.

"Violence has a huge impact on officers and their families, and most people would agree that assaults on police officers and other emergency workers are totally unacceptable."
