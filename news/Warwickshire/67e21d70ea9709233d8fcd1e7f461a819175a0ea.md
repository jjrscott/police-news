Warwickshire Police is appealing for witnesses following an incident in Nuneaton yesterday evening (Monday 1 June).

At around 6.40pm, police were called by a third party to an incident at Bermuda Park Railway Station. It's reported two teenage girls had been seen getting into a car with a man in his 20s.

The vehicle, a blue Ford Focus, was stopped by police shortly later on the A444 near Bedworth, and a 25-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of kidnap. He has been released on bail whilst enquiries continue.

Investigating officer, Det Sgt Darryl Horncastle from Warwickshire Police said: "We are appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the vehicle at the train station or in the area at the time to please come forward.

"I appreciate this may sound concerning to the community but at this stage there is no indication the girls came to any harm whilst they were in the vehicle. They are both safe and enquiries are ongoing to establish if any offences took place, which is why we are keen to speak to any witnesses."

Anyone with any information is asked to call Warwickshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 344 of 1 June 2020.

Alternatively, information can be given to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
