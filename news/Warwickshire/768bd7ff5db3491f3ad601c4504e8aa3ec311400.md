Police are appealing for witnesses after two women were robbed at knifepoint in Bedworth town centre.

The incident happened at around 10.10pm yesterday (Monday 30 December) on Rye Piece Ringway at the junction with Chamberlaine Street.

The victims were approached by a male who threatened them with a knife before fleeing with one of their bags.

Officers want to speak to anyone who might have seen anything around that time, particularly drivers with dashcams fitted.

Detective Constable Gavin Wallwork, the investigating officer, said: "We believe there were people in the area at the time. I'd therefore like to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident, especially those with dashcams in their vehicles, or anyone else with information. Any information could help the investigation."

Anyone with information should contact Warwickshire Police on 101 quoting incident 399 of 30 December 2019. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
