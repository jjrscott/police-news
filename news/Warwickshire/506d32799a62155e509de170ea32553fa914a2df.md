Police are appealing for information after a cat was injured in a suspected firework attack in Leamington.

The cat returned to its home in Edmondscote Road on Friday (6 November) afternoon with a badly injured leg.

Inspector Wayne Boulton from Leamington Safer Neighbourhood Team said: "This was a cowardly and shocking attack on a defenceless animal. The cat doesn't tend to travel far from home so the attack will most likely have happened in the area around Edmondscote Road. We'd like to hear from anyone who has information that can help us identify those responsible."

Anyone with information can call 101 quoting incident 184 of 6 November 2020. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
