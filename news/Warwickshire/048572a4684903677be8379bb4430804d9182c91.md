Investigating officers are appealing for witnesses to a robbery in Bedworth.

A man in his 30s was heading along Park Road around noon on Wednesday 1 July when he turned into the alleyway behind All Saints Church.

As he walked along the alleyway he was approached by an unknown man - described as white and with a ponytail - who asked him a question.

The victim responded to the question and the man is reported to have assaulted him - causing broken ribs, a broken nose as well as cuts and bruises to his face. The injuries are not believed to be life-threatening at this time.

The suspect then took the victim's mobile phone and a white carrier bag before leaving in the direction of Bedworth town centre.

Enquiries are ongoing and we are keen to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident, who was in the area at the time, or saw anyone acting suspiciously.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting incident number 220 of 1 July.
