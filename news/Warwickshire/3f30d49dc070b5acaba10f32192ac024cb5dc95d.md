Officers from Leamington Safer Neighbourhood Team seized cannabis, suspected crack cocaine and heroin, and cash after they responded to a report of a Covid breach at property in Avenue Road, Leamington yesterday (Wednesday 10 February) morning.

When they attended the address they found the 19-year-old man from Walsall at the property in breach of Covid legislation.

While they were there they smelt cannabis and saw signs of class A drug use. A search led to cannabis and cash being seized and the man being arrested on suspicion of possession of drugs and money laundering.

The suspected crack cocaine and heroin were seized after the man was taken into custody and he was further arrested on suspicion of possession of drugs with intent to supply.

The man has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

The suspect and the resident at the address were both reported for fines for breach Covid legislation.

Anyone with information that could help police with their investigation can call 101 quoting incident 181 of 10 October 2021. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
