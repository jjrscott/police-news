Five individuals have been arrested on suspicion of possessing an offensive weapon following an incident in Rugby.

Officers were carrying out patrols on Newbold Road at around 1.30am on Sunday morning (11 October) when they noticed a vehicle being driven in a suspicious manner.

As officers approached, a knife was reported to be thrown from the vehicle, which was subsequently recovered by police.

The vehicle parked up and a number of individuals left the area on foot.

Shortly afterwards, a 16-year-old boy, a 17-year-old boy, an 18-year-old man an two 19-year-old men - all from Rugby - were arrested on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon. They have been released while enquiries continue.

As part of our ongoing investigation we're keen to identify who was in possession of the knife and are asking those who saw anyone acting suspiciously in the area at the time to get in touch.

Anyone with information about the incident can call 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting incident 22 of 11 October.
