Officers investigating a robbery in Nuneaton are appealing for anyone who was in the area to come forward.

An 11-year-old boy was walking with a friend along Vale View shortly before 9.30pm yesterday (Saturday) when he was approached by a group of three boys who asked if they could borrow his phone.

He is then reported to have been threatened with what is believed to be a bladed object before the phone was taken and the suspects left the area on foot.

One of the group - who are thought to be around 14 or 15 years old - was understood to be wearing a distinctive grey top with goggles on the hood.

The victim and his friend were not injured during the incident but were left shaken up.

Detective Inspector Martyn Kendall said: "Thankfully the victim did not suffer more serious injuries but it was still an unpleasant experience and we continue to investigate the circumstances around what happened.

"Enquiries are ongoing and we would like to hear from to anyone who witnessed the incident, who saw anyone acting suspiciously or who can help with the investigation.

"We're particularly keen to speak to people who were walking or driving along Vale View between 9.15pm and 9.45pm yesterday evening. Any information no matter how small could help with our investigation."

Anyone who can help should call 101 quoting incident number 455 of 27 June. Information can also be given anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
