We're appealing for help to locate a wanted man.

Officers would like to speak to Ricky Aucott (pictured) as it's believed he may have information about a criminal damage and assault incident that took place yesterday (Tuesday).

The 30-year-old is described as white, of medium build, around 6ft 3in tall, with brown hair and a brown beard.

He is believed to have connections to the Gun Hill area of Coventry and Nuneaton.

Anyone who sees Aucott or knows where he might be is asked to call 101.
