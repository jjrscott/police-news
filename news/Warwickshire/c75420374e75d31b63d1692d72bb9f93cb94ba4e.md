Three men have been arrested following a police pursuit that ended in Balsall Common.

At around 10.15pm on Wednesday (23 September) police received a report of a vehicle that was suspected to have been involved in vehicle crime.

A vehicle was subsequently spotted by officers heading towards Warwick. They attempted to stop the vehicle - a Saab - but it failed to stop and made off.

A pursuit followed and the police helicopter was deployed before the Saab collided with a police vehicle on the A3400 in Balsall Common.

Minor damage was sustained to the police vehicle and no-one was injured. A number of items including bolt croppers, a hammer, a screwdriver and two drills were recovered by officers.

A 19-year-old man from Leicestershire was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving, failing to stop, and going equipped.

A 24-year-old man from Wigan was arrested on suspicion of failing to stop and a 38-year-old man from Berkshire was arrested on suspicion of going equipped.

All three remain in police custody at this time.

Enquiries are currently ongoing and officers are keen for anyone who was in the area or who has dashcam footage to come forward.

Anyone with information should call 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting incident 401 of 23 September.
