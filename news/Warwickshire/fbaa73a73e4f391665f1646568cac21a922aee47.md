A suspect has been questioned over graffiti in Leamington.

A police van was vandalised while parked outside Leamington Justice Centre on Newbold Terrace over the night of Sunday (27 September) and Monday.

The same vandalism was discovered by officers on Tuesday (29 September) on the Queen Victoria statue in The Parade.

Officers probing the vandalism have arrested a 19-year-old man from Leamington on suspicion of causing criminal damage. He was also arrested on suspicion of possession of class B drugs after cannabis was seized by officers.

The man has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.
