Warwickshire Police is appealing for witnesses or information following a robbery in Rugby last week.

At around 6.15am on Thursday (12 September), a man in his 40s was walking on Murray Road when he passed two other men talking outside a house.

As he walked further down the road, one of the men approached him and threatened him, whilst holding a bladed object.

The victim handed over his money and the suspect then ran off in the direction of Clifton Road.

There were no reported injuries.

The suspect is described as a while male, believed to be about 16 years old and around 6ft tall. He was wearing a grey tracksuit, black trainers and a baseball cap.

Enquiries are ongoing and investigating officers would like to speak to anyone who witnessed the offence. If you have any information, please call Warwickshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 38 of 12 September 2019.

Alternatively, information can be given to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
