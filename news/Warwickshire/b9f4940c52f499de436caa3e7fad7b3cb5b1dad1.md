We're appealing for witnesses to an exposure incident in Ash Green on Sunday (14 March).

A woman in her 30s was walking along Vicarage Lane around 11.30am when a white Seat car pulled up.

As she approached the vehicle the window was down and she noticed a man was exposing himself.

She walked away and the car drove off. She was uninjured.

Enquiries are currently ongoing but anyone who was in the area or noticed anyone acting suspiciously at the time is asked to call 101 quoting incident 159 of 14 March.
