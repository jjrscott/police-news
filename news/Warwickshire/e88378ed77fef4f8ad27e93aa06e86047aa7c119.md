Warwickshire Police is appealing for witnesses or information following an arson near Meriden on Sunday (1 December).

At around 4.15pm, a red Ferrari broke down on Maxstoke Lane, and recovery was arranged.

As the recovery vehicle was leaving at around 5.45pm, the driver was assaulted with what's believed to be a baseball bat, and the car was set on fire.

The victim sustained injuries to his stomach which required hospital treatment.

The car was seriously damaged.

The suspects are described as all wearing dark clothing.

Investigating officer, Detective Constable Karl Roberts said: "This is a concerning incident, which has left a man assaulted for simply doing his job.

"We believe a number of cars drove past the location during this time, and we'd like to speak to anyone who may have witnessed the offence or any suspicious behaviour to please come forward.

"If you have any information, please call Warwickshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 357 of 1 December 2019."

Information can also be given to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
