Police hunting for David Fitzpatrick, 55, from Rugby have made an arrest.

As a result of our media and social media wanted appeals yesterday (Monday 2 September), officers arrested a 55-year-old man on suspicion of harassment.

Thank you to everyone who shared the appeal and contacted police with information.
