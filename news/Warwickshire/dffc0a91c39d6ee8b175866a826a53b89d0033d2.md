A man from Birmingham has been convicted of theft and common assault and jailed for almost a year.

David Ball, 44, of Britford Close, Birmingham appeared before Coventry Magistrates' Court on Wednesday (10 March).

He was jailed for 50 weeks.

He was arrested on Tuesday (9 March) after he stole alcohol and assaulted a security guard at a shop on Old Warwick Road in Leamington.

The security guard was assaulted after challenging Ball when he saw him on CCTV removing security tags from the bottles.

Ball pleaded guilty to theft and common assault.

He was also jailed for breaching a suspended sentence order after he had previously been convicted of committing a series of thefts in Worcestershire.

PC Jack Read and PC Jenn Fitchew, both from Leamington Police Station, said: "Ball is a prolific offender and the courts have given him a sentence that reflects societies view that people should be able to do their job without fear of being injured."
