Over 5,000 people have been caught for speeding offences in Warwickshire during just two weeks of a month long operation aimed at reducing speeding in the county.

Speeding has a direct link to the number of people killed or seriously injured on the county's roads and the first phase of the campaign urged speeding motorists to slow down and obey speed limits by providing statistics and information to encourage them to change their behaviour. See media release.

This was followed by a two week enforcement period to catch those that continue to speed on Warwickshire's roads.

During the two week's from 20 January 2020 to 02 February 2020, the speed of vehicles was checked by officers, including the Special Constabulary, PCSOs and Warwickshire's many community speed watch volunteers.

The results are as follows:-

In excess of 2800 vehicles' speeds were checked in 78 separate speed checks

193 drivers were warned about their speed at the roadside or by letter following Community Speed Watch deployment.

39 drivers were reported via a Traffic Offence Report for speeding and will receive a letter in the post.

One driver was arrested on suspicion of drink driving.

In Warwickshire mobile and static cameras are also used and the following speeding offences were recorded during the two week enforcement period:-

168 speeding offences were recorded by our mobile speed camera vans

1,768 speeding offences were recorded by our static spot speed cameras

2,270 speeding offences were recorded on our Motorway Roadworks Enforcement Average Speed cameras (yellow cameras).

1,023 speeding offences were recorded by the overhead gantry HADECS Motorway Variable Speed Cameras.

In total 5,229 speeding offences were recorded by cameras in the two week enforcement period.

Inspector Kirsty Clough said "It is disappointing that over 5,000 people were still caught speeding as they drove through Warwickshire during the two week enforcement period despite the campaign to educate drivers around the dangers of speeding during the preceding seven days."

"Speed is one of the four biggest dangers whilst driving, called 'the fatal 4' and the difference of a few miles per hour can be the difference between life and death. It is hard to understand why so many people continue to put their own life and the lives of others at risk by speeding on Warwickshire's roads."

In Warwickshire, between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2019, 91 people were killed and 659 seriously injured in collisions where speed or loss of control was recorded as a contributory factor.

Inspector Clough continued "We are asking people to slow down and drive at a speed that is appropriate to the road environment and conditions. Speed limits are there to protect the public and are a maximum not a target."

"The police seek to educate the driver to change their behaviour and for some of those drivers caught speeding during those two weeks, speed awareness courses will be offered to enhance this learning process."

Warwickshire Police is working closely with partners including Warwickshire Fire & Rescue Service, West Midlands Ambulance Service, Warwickshire County Council, Highways England, and national campaigners including BRAKE to reduce the number of people killed or seriously injured on the county's roads.

**What will happen if I 'm caught speeding?**

Speeding drivers who are eligible for and accept a conditional offer of a fixed penalty receive 3 penalty points and Â£100 fine. Fines are collected by Her Majesty's Courts & Tribunal Service and go directly to the Treasury.

Excessive high speed offences will not get a conditional offer and will be prosecuted via the courts.

You could be disqualified from driving if you build up 12 or more penalty points within a period of 3 years. New drivers who receive 6 or more penalty points within the first two years of driving will have their license revoked.

Those drivers who admit the offence of speeding and are eligible may be offered the opportunity to attend a speed awareness course on the effects and dangers of speeding as an alternative to a speeding fine and penalty points.

The course aims to influence the attitudes and behaviour of drivers by directly challenging attitudes towards speeding, offering motorists' insight, awareness and understanding about their speed choices, and helps equip participants to change their behaviour.

The course is not a way to consistently avoid fines however, you can only attend one speed awareness course every three years.

Warwickshire Police also offer a National Motorway Awareness Course and if this is offered only one can be attended every three years.
