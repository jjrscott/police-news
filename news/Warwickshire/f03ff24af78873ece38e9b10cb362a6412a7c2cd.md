Enquiries are ongoing following the death of a 54-year-old woman in Lillington on Monday morning (24 August).

Police were called at 2.38am to a report of a disturbance at a property on Valley Road. Upon arrival, a woman with a serious head injury was discovered inside. Officers started CPR but sadly she was pronounced deceased at the scene.

A 15-year-old girl and a 28-year-old man who were arrested on suspicion of murder have been released on police bail while enquiries continue.

Two men from Maidenhead, aged 23 and 57, who were also arrested on suspicion of murder remain in police custody.

Chief Inspector Caroline Corfield from Warwickshire Police said: "A number of enquiries are currently ongoing, and we would appeal to anyone who was in the area at the time of the incident or may have CCTV or dashcam footage to please make contact.

"Anyone with information, no matter how insignificant it may seem, is urged to call 101 quoting incident number 34 of 24 August 2020.

"Our thoughts are with the woman's friends and family at this difficult time."

Information can also be given anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
