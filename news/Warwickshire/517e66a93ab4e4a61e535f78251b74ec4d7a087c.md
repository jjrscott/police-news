The March 2020 Roads Policing Newsletter is now available to help raise awareness of the work being done to reduce the numbers of people killed or seriously injured (KSI) on Warwickshire's roads and protect people from harm.

The newsletter aims to pull all the roads policing news together into one place so that it can be easily read online, printed or shared electronically.

It is hoped the newsletter will help to reassure the public that there is a strong roads policing presence in Warwickshire and help boost public confidence in Warwickshire Police.

The newsletter will be produced monthly and it is anticipated at some point it will be renamed and expanded to include more partner information.
