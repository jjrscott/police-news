Inspector Daren Webster said: "Following the success of previous tours in Warwickshire over the past couple of years we're delighted to welcome the tour back again this year. It will be wonderful to see some of the world's top cyclists battling it out in a televised individual time trial on the streets of our county.

"To allow the race to pass through there will be fixed road closures in place throughout the day to allow the race to start and finish safely.

"While inevitably there will be disruption due to the nature of the event, the event organisers will keep this to a minimum.

"Our Safer Neighbourhood Teams will be in attendance for community engagement and reassurance."

All road closure information is subject to change. For up to date details about the closures, route, timings, public transport, spectator parking and key locations please visit Warwickshire County Council website here and there will be regular updates on our social media platforms Facebook and Twitter and throughout the day.
