Warwickshire Police is appealing for information after a number of sheep are believed to have been run over in a field near Bidford in the past week.

Officers were informed yesterday (Wednesday 11 March) that three sheep had been found dead in a field at the Barton Crossroads/Honeybourne Road on Friday (6 March).

A further eight ewes were found dead in the same field yesterday, and another seven were severely injured and had to be euthanised by a vet.

It is believed the animals were deliberately run over by a vehicle.

Rural Crime Officer Carol Cotterill said: "This is a very distressing incident which has left a number of sheep injured or deceased, and has caused their owner to be understandably shaken and upset.

"Unfortunately we do believe this to be a deliberate act and we are treating these offences very seriously. We are currently working with the RSPCA to identify the circumstances of the incident.

"If anyone has any information, or witnessed any suspicious vehicles or behaviour in this location over the past week, please let us know by calling 101 and referring to incident number 47 of 11 March 2020.

"Any information, no matter how insignificant it may seem, may help us to investigate this cruel act and identify those responsible."

Information can also be given anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
