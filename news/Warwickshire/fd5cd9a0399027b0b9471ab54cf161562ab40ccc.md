Warwickshire Police is appealing for witnesses or information following an assault in Coleshill on Tuesday evening (16 March).

At around 5.30pm, a woman in her late 30s was in the skate park area of Coleshill Memorial Park when she witnessed some young males trying to damage the newly planted trees.

The woman asked them to stop, and it's reported one of the males then assaulted her, causing facial injuries. It's reported a racist remark was also made towards the victim.

Investigating officer, PC Thomas Sismey from Warwickshire Police: "We're appealing to the public for any information on this incident - whether you witnessed the offence, or a group of males acting suspiciously in the park.

"This sort of abuse will not be tolerated in our communities and enquiries are now ongoing to identify those responsible.

"Anyone with information is asked to call Warwickshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 309 of 16 March 2021."

Information can also be given anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
