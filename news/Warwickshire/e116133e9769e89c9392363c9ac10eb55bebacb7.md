Our annual campaign to help keep you safe in Warwickshire this Christmas has begun.

'Christmas Presence' will see officers out and about at Christmas events across the county, to provide reassurance and crime fighting tips.

We will also be providing advice across our social media channels every day throughout the holidays using the hashtags #ChristmasPresence and #BestWarwickshireChristmas, which is supported by our colleagues at Warwickshire County Council.

We will focus on a different subject each day to include keeping safe while travelling, protecting yourself when shopping online and getting home safe from nights out. There will also be tips on reporting crimes such as domestic violence, protecting your home and how to report incidents online.

You can follow our Christmas Presence campaign here @warkspolice (twitter) and /warwickshirepolice (facebook).

We will also be following some of our teams who are working throughout the Christmas period, to give you an insight into their work, along with our emergency services colleagues.

Chief Superintendent Ben Smith said: "You may see increased patrols in our town and village centres over the coming weeks, and we hope this makes you feel safe and gives you confidence in your police force.

"Christmas is a happy time for many people, but for the most vulnerable can be a difficult. We would ask residents to help us by checking on elderly or vulnerable neighbours if you can.

"There will be a range of advice on our website, relating to the crimes that sadly sometimes increase over the festive period, including burglary and drink drive offences.

"We wish all of our residents a very Happy Christmas and would ask for your continued support over the holidays."

Report crime at Christmas on our website.

In an emergency or if you see a crime in progress call 999.
