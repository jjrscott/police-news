A Nuneaton man has been jailed for seven years and six months for a string of child sex offences against two young girls.

John Stuart Keens, 64, of Turnberry Drive, Nuneaton was handed the prison term at Warwick Crown Court last week after admitting to sexually assaulting them.

Keens two victims told how they were sexually abused by him when they were under the age of 13. The offences took place between 2014 and 2020 in Nuneaton.

The Warwickshire Police Child Abuse, Trafficking and Exploitation Team launched an investigation in December 2020 after one of the victims disclosed the abuse to her father.

Detective Constable Jade Badhams, of the Warwickshire Police Chile Abuse, Trafficking and Exploitation Team, said: "I am pleased justice has been served and John Keens has been jailed for these terrible crimes.

"I would like to pay tribute to his victims for the bravery they have shown through the investigation and court case.

"This case highlights that Warwickshire Police takes offences of this nature extremely seriously and I would encourage anyone who has been the victim of sex offences - no matter when they occurred - to report it."

Anyone who has been the victim of a sexual offence is encouraged to report the incident to police by calling 101, where specially trained officers will help victims with care and sensitivity, and will work to get the right result for them with their wishes in mind. Always call 999 in an emergency.
