Two men have been arrested for suspected drug offences in Stratford.

At around 11pm last night (Tuesday 16 June), officers from the Southern Vehicle Crime Team observed man acting suspiciously on Scholars Lane. He was detained and searched, and found to be in possession of suspected heroin and a mobile phone. The 41-year-old was arrested on suspicion of possession of Class A drugs.

Officers then attended a property on Scholars Lane, where a man jumped out of a window and ran from officers. He was found in possession of a phone, cannabis and a large amount of cash. A 19-year-old man from Tamworth was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs.

Shortly afterwards, officers searched a flat on Evesham Place, where further suspected heroin was seized.

Both men remain in custody and enquiries continue.
