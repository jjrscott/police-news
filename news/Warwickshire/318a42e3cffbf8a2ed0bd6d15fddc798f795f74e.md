As people are ordered to stay at home, the head of the force's domestic abuse unit has spoken out to reassure victims of domestic abuse and warn perpetrators.

Detective Inspector Tony Hibbert said: "The orders to stay at home and isolate from family and friends are going to prove challenging for everyone. However, it may prove additionally challenging for people in violent and abusive relationships.

"People who have not previously been victims may also find themselves subject to domestic abuse. There is no excuse for domestic abuse and one incident is one too many.

"While as a force we will face our own challenges over the coming months, I would like to emphasise our ongoing commitment to tackling domestic abuse and supporting victims. It remains a force priority and we will continue to be proactive in targeting high-risk offenders and supporting victims.

"My message to victims is don't suffer in silence."
