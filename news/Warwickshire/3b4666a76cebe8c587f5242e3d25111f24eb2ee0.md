Three men were arrested on suspicion of drug offences in separate incidents in the north of the county yesterday.

In the early hours of the morning, officers on patrol in Brandon seized what they believe to be class A drugs from a 38-year-old man from Rugby after he was arrested for failure to appear at court on a separate matter. He was also arrested on suspicion of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply.

Yesterday morning, officers from Nuneaton Proactive CID executed a warrant at a flat in Long Street, Atherstone where they seized class A drugs. A 41-year-old man from Atherstone was arrested on suspicion of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply and later released under investigation.

In the afternoon, officers from Nuneaton Proactive CID arrested a 19-year-old man from Birmingham after stopping a car in Granby Road, Nuneaton. They seized drug paraphernalia and what they believe to be counterfeit currency. The man was arrested on suspicion of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply and money laundering, and later released under investigation.
