We're appealing for witnesses following a fatal collision in Rugby at the weekend.

It took place on the A428 Crick Road around 2.30am on Saturday (21 March) and involved a silver BMW 320D estate and a pedestrian.

The pedestrian - a man in his early 40s - was sadly pronounced deceased at the scene. His next of kin has been informed.

Road closures were in place while emergency services were in attendance.

If anyone witnessed the collision, please call 101 quoting incident number 40 of 21 March.
