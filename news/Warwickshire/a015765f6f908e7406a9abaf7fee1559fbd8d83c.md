Were you driving along the A46 southbound carriageway near Warwick yesterday evening (Thursday)?

A silver BMW is understood to have left the road just prior to the Stanks junction shortly before midnight.

A woman in her 20s - a passenger in the car - suffered life-threatening injuries and was taken to hospital where she remains in a serious but stable condition. Her next of kin has been informed.

Enquiries are ongoing but we're appealing for anyone who was driving in the area, who saw the vehicle or who has dashcam footage of the collision to get in touch.

Anyone with information should call 101 quoting incident number 399 of 11 February.
