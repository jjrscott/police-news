An investigation has been launched and two men arrested following a "frightening" armed robbery and attempted theft in Leamington.

The robbery occurred at 10.10pm yesterday (Thursday 13 August). The victim - a man in his 20s - was walking through an alleyway near Willes Road when he was robbed at knifepoint by two males. The offenders took his phone and earphones.

At 2.41am today, officers responded to a report from CCTV operatives of two males going through the pockets of someone asleep in the street. The suspects were stopped and searched, and two knives were recovered.

A 28-year-old man of no fixed abode and 23-year-old man from Leamington were arrested on suspicion of the robbery.

Detective Sergeant Chris Finch from Leamington Serious and Complex Crime team said: "This was a frightening experience for the victim of the robbery who thankfully wasn't injured.

"Extensive enquires are ongoing to identify the offenders and we have two men in custody helping with our enquiries.

"Anyone who believes they have information that could help identify the people responsible or who were in the area at the time of the robbery are urged to contact Warwickshire Police."

If you have any information, call Warwickshire Police on 101 or the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. Quote incident 496 of 13 August 2020.
