Following a recent National Wildlife Officers course, Warwickshire Police now has an additional 11 new trained Wildlife Officers within the force.

This means there are now 24 trained officers across the county, including officers in our Safer Neighbourhood and Rural Crime teams.

During the week long course, the officers covered all aspects of wildlife crime with input from specialists from around the UK and different wildlife groups.

The officers will also be provided with special kit to fulfil their roles.

This investment is part of Warwickshire Police's ongoing commitment to dealing with rural and wildlife crime in the county.
