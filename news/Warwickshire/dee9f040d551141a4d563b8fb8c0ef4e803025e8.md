Two suspected drug dealers were arrested following an incident in Stratford.

Officers on patrol from the South Warwickshire Vehicle Crime Team noticed a suspected drug deal in Evesham Place, Stratford.

They arrested a 30-year-old man from Stratford on suspicion of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply and seized what they believe to be heroin and crack cocaine.

The search of a nearby property lead to the arrest of a 16-year-old boy from West Bromwich on suspicion of being involved in the supply of class A drugs, and the seizure of what officers believe heroin and crack cocaine, a number of phones, cash, and cannabis.

The incident occurred at around 4pm on Sunday (26 July) afternoon.

The men have since been released under investigation.

Anyone with information that could help police can call 101 quoting incident 243 of 26 July 2020. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
