Officers investigating the supply of drugs from Coventry into Leamington have charged a man in connection with the supply of crack cocaine.

Crack Cocaine was recovered along with cash and a set of scales after plain clothed officers from Leamington Proactive CID spotted a man they believed to be acting suspiciously in Eagle Street, Leamington yesterday afternoon.

Daine Dwyer, 18, formerly from Coventry but now of Lordswood Road, Birmingham was charged with possession of crack cocaine with intent to supply and will appear at Coventry Magistrates' Court today (Wednesday 9 November).
