Investigating officers are appealing for witnesses to a suspected arson in Atherstone.

Police were called to a property on Barsby Close shortly before 2.30am today (Monday) following a report of a fire.

Officers, fire service and ambulance attended the scene and a woman in her 30s and two children were taken to hospital as a precaution following the incident for a check-up.

Their injuries are not believed to be life-changing at this time.

Enquiries are currently ongoing and officers are keeping an open mind as to the cause of the fire, but it is believed it may have been started deliberately.

We are keen to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident or who saw people acting suspiciously in the area at the time.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting incident number 14 of 9 November.
