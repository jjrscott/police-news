Warwickshire Police is appealing for witnesses or information following a robbery in Nuneaton last week.

At around 1.10pm on Tuesday (16 March), a man in his early 20s was walking on Wheat Street when he was approached by an unknown male who is reported to have threatened him with a bladed object.

The victim's Gucci Messenger bag was then stolen from him.

The suspect then ran off in the direction of the town centre. It's believed prior to the incident, the suspect had been in the town centre with another male for around 45 minutes.

The suspect is described as a mixed race male, around 6ft, of a slim build, with black hair. He was thought to be wearing a dark grey/black puffer jacket with the hood up, a white face mask, jogging bottoms and black trainers.

Officers are appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or the suspect in town with another male prior to the offence, to please call Warwickshire Police on 101 quoting incident 188 of 16 March 2021.

Information can also be given anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
