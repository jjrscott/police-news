The February 2021 Warwickshire Police Roads Policing Newsletter is available now.

The Newsletter aims to help raise awareness of the work being done by police and partners to reduce the numbers of people killed or seriously injured (KSI) on Warwickshire's roads and protect people from harm.

The Newsletter pulls together all the road safety news into one place including updates from partners so that it can be easily shared internally and externally with stakeholders and the public to demonstrate some of the good work being done.

It is anticipated at some point it will be renamed and expanded to include even more partner information
