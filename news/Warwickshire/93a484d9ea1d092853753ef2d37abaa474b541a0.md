Two more males have been arrested by officers investigating an incident which led to an 18-year-old man suffering a stab wound in Rugby on Friday (31 July) evening.

The 17-year-old boy and 21-year-old man, both from Rugby, were arrested yesterday (Wednesday 5 August) on suspicion of committing public order offences. They have both been bailed until September while enquiries continue.

Officers initially responded to a report of violent disorder outside the shops in Church Street at around 4.40pm. A short time later, the injured man was discovered near to the junction with Railway Terrace.

Three men involved in the disorder are reported to have left the scene in a blue Vauxhall Corsa.

A black Vauxhall Astra was also seen to leave the scene at the time of the incident.

Three males arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and a man arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving have all been bailed until the end of August while enquiries continue.

Detectives are continuing to appeal for information and are especially keen to hear from anyone with dash cam footage from the area at the time.

Anyone with information that could help police with their investigation should call 101 quoting incident 315 31 July 2020. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
