We're appealing for witnesses to an assault in Nuneaton.

Between 1pm and 2pm on Tuesday (21 January), a man in his 20s was walking by the garages on Snowdon Close when he has approached by two men - one of whom was on a white coloured moped.

An altercation occurred and the victim suffered a stab injury to his arm, which was not believed to be life-threatening. The two men then left the scene on the moped.

A 24-year-old man from Nuneaton was arrested on suspicion of GBH and criminal damage in connection with the incident. He has been bailed until 31 January.

Enquiries are currently ongoing but police would like anyone who saw the incident, or who was in the area at the time to come forward.

Anyone with information should call 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting incident number 197 of 21 January.
