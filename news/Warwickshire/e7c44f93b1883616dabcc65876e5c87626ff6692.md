Were you driving along Dunchurch Road in Rugby at around 1.30am on Friday (1 November)?

We're appealing for witnesses to a collision near the junction with Overslade Lane to come forward.

It involved a silver Ford Focus, which is understood to have collided with a stationary vehicle and left the carriageway.

The driver of the Ford - a man in his 20s - suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospital.

Enquiries are currently ongoing but we're keen to speak with any witnesses to the incident or people who saw the vehicle and the manner in which it was being driven prior to the collision.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting incident number 21 of 1 November.
