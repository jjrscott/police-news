During National Road Safety Week, Warwickshire Police and the Highways England have today 21 November 2019 hosted an educational Logistics Forum attended by local and national hauliers, as well as key local contractors at Warwickshire Police's Headquarters.

The educational forum entitled 'Future Roads' discussed how together Police, Highways England, hauliers and partner agencies such as the Environment Agency and the Road Haulage Association can work together to ensure safe, effective road transport in the Midlands.

Around fifty invited hauliers were in attendance to hear from guest speakers including the Warwickshire Police Commercial Vehicle Unit, Environment England, Highways England Traffic Officers, Driving for Better Business, Dr Gemma Briggs, Tyresafe, HSE and Cemex.

The speakers covered topics ranging from Safer Loads to Distraction Driving.

Dr Gemma Briggs, who is an expert in driver distraction said "Distracted driving is a significant safety issue for all road users. It's so important that events such as this happen, where evidence-based practice can be shared and discussed and new approaches can be considered to help improve road safety for everyone."

Sergeant Stafford from the Serious Collision Investigation Unit said "We have been working tirelessly with many partner agencies, such as Highways England, HSE and the Road Haulage Association, for over a year now to target commercial vehicles as they are increasingly being involved in serious or fatal collisions."

"This has included today's forum providing an ideal opportunity to improve communication between hauliers, police and the various agencies to portray the message that we are proactively enforcing and educating hauliers and their drivers who choose to put others at risk on our roads."

Brake's Road Safety Week between 18 - 24 Nov 2019 aims to encourage everyone to step up and play a part in making our roads safer and everyone who attended has achieved that today.
