Did you witness a non-stop collision in Rugby yesterday afternoon (Thursday)?

It happened on Kingsway between the Kingsway shops and The Griffin at around 3.25pm.

A man is understood to have been driving a car - thought to be blue or silver in colour - when it is was in collision with an 11-year-old boy.
