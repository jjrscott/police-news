Next week, bins will be placed at Warwickshire police stations for residents to anonymously hand in knives.

This is part of Operation Sceptre, a national initiative aimed at tackling knife crime.

Between 16 and 22 September anyone can anonymously surrender a knife in one of the bins located at the police stations listed below. There's no need to leave any personal details.

**List of stations where knives can be surrendered**

 * Leamington
 * Nuneaton
 * Rugby
 * Stratford

While the knives can be surrendered anonymously and those handing them in will not face prosecution for carrying them, if officers suspect they have been used in a crime they will investigate and seek to prosecute.

Chief Inspector Dave Kettle from the Warwickshire Police safer neighbourhood teams, said: "Fortunately, we don't have a big knife crime problem in Warwickshire; however, on a national scale we too regularly see the devastating consequences of carrying a knife.

"This is why we are supporting this campaign. We want to ensure Warwickshire remains a safe county and everyone can play there part in ensuring this happens.

"Every knife that is handed in at a Warwickshire Police Station has the potential to save a life."
