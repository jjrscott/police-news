Warwickshire Police is appealing for witnesses or information following a robbery in Leamington on Friday night (5 March).

At around 10.50pm, a 17-year-old boy was walking on Beverley Road when he was approached by two males. He was punched and chased down the road, and his mobile phone was then stolen.

He sustained facial injuries which required hospital treatment.

Two 15-year-old boys were arrested in connection with the incident and have been released on bail pending further enquiries. A 16-year-old boy has also been arrested this morning and is currently in police custody.

Investigating officer, Det Sgt Jen Baker said: "A number of enquiries are ongoing, and we would ask anyone who witnessed the offence or who may have any CCTV/dashcam footage of the area to please come forward.

"Any information can be given by calling Warwickshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 400 of 5 March 2021."

Information can also be given anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
