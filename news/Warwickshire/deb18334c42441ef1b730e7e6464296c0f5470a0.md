At around 3.15am, three people were reported acting suspiciously on Wadebridge Drive and on surrounding roads.

Officers attended the area and found three individuals inside a parked Ford Focus on Wadebridge Drive.

As officers approached, the Focus collided with a police vehicle and the occupants then left the scene on foot.

The vehicle has now been seized by police.

This morning, a resident on Wadebridge Drive reported their house had been broken into overnight. Both incidents are currently being linked.

Investigating officer, Det Sgt Rav Gill from Warwickshire Police said: "We're appealing to anyone who may have seen or heard any suspicious behaviour in the area at the time, or who may have any CCTV cameras on their properties, to please come forward.

"A helicopter was deployed as part of a search for the individuals overnight, and a number of enquiries are currently ongoing to identify them.

"If anyone has any information, please call Warwickshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 12 of 15 October 2020."
