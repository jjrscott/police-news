Warwickshire Police is appealing for witnesses or information following a sexual assault in Leamington last week.

At around 6.20pm on Tuesday (7 January), a woman was jogging on Brunswick Street (near the junction of Shrubland Street), when two men walked past her.

As she passed, one of them reached out and touched her inappropriately over her clothing.

The suspects are described as:

 * A white man in his early 20s, wearing a black tracksuit top with grey trousers. He had his hood up.

 * A white man of a similar age, wearing a hooded top which had a white panel across the front.

Investigating officers would like to speak to anyone who witnessed the offence or recognises the description of the suspects. If you have any information, please call PC Mark Finch on 101 quoting incident number 389 of 7 January 2020.

Alternatively, you can call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
