A body has been found in Alcester, and is believed to be that of 46-year-old Imed Boudhina. He was reported missing earlier this week.

Formal identification is yet to take place but Imed's next of kin has been informed.

The death is not being treated as suspicious. A file will be prepared for the coroner.

Thank you to everyone for their help in sharing an earlier appeal - our thoughts are with Imed's family and friends at this difficult time.
