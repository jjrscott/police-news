We have launched a new appeal for information relating to our investigation into the death of Ben Peacock.

Ben, who was aged 42, died following a road traffic collision in Hillmorton Road, Rugby, in March.

The incident happened in the early hours of Saturday 21 March this year at around 2.30am.

Ben had attended the Paddox Pub prior to the incident between 9pm on Friday 20 March and 2am on the Saturday morning (21).

We would like to speak to anyone who was also in the pub that evening, as well as anyone who was on Crick Road, Hillmorton between 2am and 2.30am on the morning of Saturday 21st March.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact police on 101 and quote Operation Casing.
