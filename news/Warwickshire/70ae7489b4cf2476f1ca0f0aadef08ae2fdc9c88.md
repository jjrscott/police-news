Today, Balvinder's family released the following tribute:

"With great sadness we announce that our dearest beloved daughter, sister and mum's life was taken from us all.

"She was the light of our life, with a golden kind heart, filled with so much love and happiness, her smile would light up the room with a thousand words, a beauty beyond beauty.

"Words cannot express how much we love you and will miss you. You lived life like there was no tomorrow, you saw many sorrows, yet always stayed positive and smiled and lived for today. You gave us hope and love.

"Our sweetest darling daughter, sister and mum, we hope you can rest in peace now. You will always be in our hearts our darling angel and never forgotten. Until we meet again xx."

Two people have been charged in connection with the investigation. They will next apopear at Leamington Crown Court on Tuesday (1 September).
