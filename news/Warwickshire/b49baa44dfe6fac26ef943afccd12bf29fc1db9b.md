Police are continuing to investigate the death of a man in Nuneaton.

Officers were called by the ambulance service to Sunnyside Court shortly after 2pm on Thursday (2 July), where sadly a man in his 50s was found deceased inside a property.

A 46-year-old man from Nuneaton has been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter. He has been released on bail whilst enquiries continue.

Detective Inspector Ollie Deakin from Warwickshire Police said: "Enquiries are in their early stages as we work to establish the circumstances around the man's death, and we are awaiting the results of a post-mortem.

"If anyone has any information which may be able to assist with the investigation, please get in touch."

Anyone with information should call Warwickshire Police on 101, quoting incident 186 of 2 July. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
