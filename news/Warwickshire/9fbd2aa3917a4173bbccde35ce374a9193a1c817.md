A man has been arrested on suspicion of drug offences following concerns raised by local people.

The man, who is 35 and from Nuneaton, was spotted by officers from Nuneaton Proactive CID when they were on patrol in High Street, Nuneaton yesterday (Tuesday 21 April) afternoon. They were patrolling the area in response to local residents raising concerns about drug dealing in the area around Pool Bank Street.

The officers stopped the man and seized a quantity of what they believe to be class A drugs. More drugs and two mobile phones were seized following a further search in custody.

He was arrested on suspicion of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply and later released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Anyone with information that could help police with their enquiries should call 101 quoting crime reference 23/16722/20. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
