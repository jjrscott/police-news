Warwickshire Police is asking drivers to take extra care on the roads and to do their bit during the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce pressure on the NHS by slowing down and driving safely to avoid a collision.

Inspector Jem Mountford said "In line with Government advice, please stay at home and avoid all travel unless absolutely essential. If you have to use the roads, help to ease the burden on the emergency services, particularly the NHS by taking extra care while driving to avoid a collision."

"With additional pressures on emergency services, it is more important than ever you fasten your seatbelt, drive carefully within the speed limit and do not take any unnecessary risks whilst driving.

"We will continue to police the roads and will be looking for any high risk behaviours such as using a mobile phone whilst driving and speeding as these could put lives at risk. Educating and engaging with communities around road safety will always be our priority but we will also enforce if necessary.

"Stay alert to other drivers and pedestrians who may be lulled into a false sense of security as the roads are clearer and only drive if you need to go out for basic necessities such as food and medicine, any medical need, to provide care to a vulnerable person, or travelling for work purposes, but only where you cannot work from home."
