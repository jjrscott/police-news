We're appealing for witnesses to an incident involving two vehicles that took place in Lighthorne Heath.

A Mini Cooper Sport was being driven along Banbury Road at around 5.45pm on Thursday (10 December) when a white car derived van is reported to have begun driving closely to the back of the vehicle.

The white vehicle is then understood to have attempted to overtake the Mini Cooper during which the Mini Cooper received damage to the offside driver's door.

The driver of the Mini Cooper suffered a slight back injury while the driver of the white vehicle failed to stop.

Enquiries are ongoing but we're keen to speak to the driver of the white vehicle or anyone who was in the area and saw the vehicles and the manner in which they were being driven at the time.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has dashcam footage of the incident should call 101 quoting incident 287 of 10 December.
