Updated News Post

**Please see updates below in bold.**

**We are continuing to appeal for witnesses to a potential assault that took place in Leamington between 1am and 1.45am on Saturday (19 September).**

Officers were called to Church Street following reports of a disturbance and a man in his 40s was found to have suffered a serious head injury. The victim was taken to hospital where he remains in a stable condition.

**It is believed he could have been assaulted by an individual who was part of a larger group and several other groups may have stopped to help the man or seen him while he was on the ground.**

A 40-year-old woman from Leamington, a 44-year-old woman from Warwick, and a 57-year-old man from Leamington arrested on suspicion of assault - GBH **have been released** **under investigation** **.**

**A** **19** **-year-old man from** **Leamington** **has been arrested on suspicion of** **assault - GBH** **.** **He has been relaeased on bail until mid-October. **

Detective Inspector Ollie Deakin said: "We're in the very early stages of the investigation but we're continuing to investigate the circumstances and are keen to establish how the man came to have suffered his head injury.

**" We believe he may have been assaulted by an individual from a larger group but we understand there were several other groups in the area at the time.**

**" Given the time and location where he was found, it's thought that several of those individuals who saw the victim may have been students and we'd appeal for them and any other witnesses to come forward and tell us what they saw. **

**" There were also potentially cars that may have been in the area or driven past so if anyone has dashcam footage, we'd be keen for them to share that with us.**

"If you were in Church Street and the surrounding streets between 1am and 1.45am yesterday morning and saw anything unusual or untoward, please call us.

"Any information, no matter how small it may seem, could prove significant to our ongoing enquiries."

Anyone who can help should call 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting incident 41 of 19 September.
