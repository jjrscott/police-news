Warwickshire Police is appealing for information following a robbery in Stratford last weekend.

Officers were called at 4.35pm on Sunday (19 April) to a report of a robbery in Bishopton, Stratford.

It's reported three males stole an off-road Yamaha motorcycle from a man in his 20s. The suspects are described as wearing surgical masks, and it's believed two were carrying bladed objects.

There were no reported injuries.

It's believed a red vehicle was also involved.

Three people have been arrested in connection with the investigation. A 19-year-old man and a 20-year-old man from Birmingham have been released on bail, and a 19-year-old woman from Redditch has been released under investigation.

Witnesses are sought to try and locate the stolen off road motorbike - a white 4 stroke Yamaha YZR 250 (2016 model). The bike has a blue covering on the seat, and black wheels.

If anyone has any information or has been offered the bike for sale, please contact DS Jen Baker at Leamington CID on 101, quoting incident number 267 of 19 April 2020.

Information can also be given to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
