Two people have been arrested for drugs offences following an alleged incident in Stratford on Friday morning (19 June 2020).

At around 11.50am, officers from the Southern Vehicle Crime Team observed a white Ford Fiesta acting suspiciously in The Fisherman's car park.

The vehicle was stopped and a significant amount of suspected Heroin and Cocaine were found in the vehicle, alongside a large amount of cash and a number of mobile phones. A 1 year-old child (a relative) was also in the vehicle.

A 17-year-old girl and a 19-year-old man, both from Coventry, were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A drugs. They have been released under investigation.

A 27-year-old man from Coventry has also been charged in connection with the incident.
