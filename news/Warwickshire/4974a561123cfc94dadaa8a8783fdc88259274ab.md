Warwickshire Police is appealing for witnesses or information following an attempted robbery near Atherstone at the weekend.

At around 10.15pm on Sunday (21 February) a man was walking his Staffordshire Bull Terrier on the 'Black Path' in Hurley (near to Meadow Road), when he was approached by two unknown males.

One of the males grabbed the dog's lead in an attempt to pull it from the owner, and the second male then hit him in the face.

The owner then ran off with his dog, and the two suspects left in an unknown direction.

The owner sustained a cut to his face, the dog was not injured.

The suspects are described as two males with 'Midlands' accents. One of them was of a medium build, around 5'10", wearing a dark hooded top and a face mask.

PC Thomas Conti from Warwickshire Police said: "We're aware this was a concerning incident within the community, and the dog's owner was left understandably shaken by this.

"Enquiries are currently ongoing to investigate the offence.

"We're appealing to anyone who witnessed the offence or any suspicious behaviour in the area at the time to please come forward.

"Anyone with information is asked to call 381 of 21 February 2021."

Information can also be given anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
