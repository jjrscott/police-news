Warwickshire Police is appealing for witnesses or information after a teenager sustained suspected stab wounds in Leamington on Saturday evening (16 January).

At around 7.10pm, police were called to a report of a serious assault near the recreational ground and the Chinese restaurant on Aylesford Street.

It's reported a 15-year-old boy was approached by a woman who asked for his mobile phone.

When the boy refused, he had an unknown substance thrown on his face and sustained a suspected stab wound to his leg.

The boy sustained injuries to his face, leg and back and was taken to hospital by ambulance. His injuries are not believed to be life-threatening at this time.

A scene guard was in place while officers were conducting enquiries.

Investigating officer, Det Sgt Pete Sherwood from Warwickshire Police said: "We're appealing to anyone who may have witnessed this incident, which left a teenage boy in hospital with his injuries.

"We are currently treated this as an isolated, targeted incident and a number of enquiries are now underway to locate those responsible.

"If anyone has any information, please call Warwickshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 295 of 16 January 2020."

Information can also be given anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
