With the wet weather set to continue over the coming days, Warwickshire Police is reminding motorists of simple measures to help stay safe while driving.

Taking to the road in wet conditions can be hazardous, but you have a better chance of arriving safely if you prepare for the weather.

Even drivers with local knowledge can be caught out during heavy downpours, as the most modern road surface is still susceptible to standing water, which not only creates a potential aquaplaning hazard but also significantly reduces visibility.

Officers would like to remind motorists that during the wet weather it is important to check that all of your lights are working, as well as making sure registration number plates are kept clean.

Drivers are also encouraged to check their tyre pressures and tread depth on a regular basis, ensure brakes are in good working order, top up oil and water levels if required and replace wiper blades if they are not in good condition.

Police are asking motorists to drive safely, within the law, and follow the advice below:

 * Use headlights when visibility is reduced, generally when you cannot see for more than 100 metres (328 feet). You may also use front or rear fog lights but you MUST switch them off when visibility improves.
 * Double the distance you leave between yourself and the car in front of you, as stopping distances are increased by wet roads.
 * If steering becomes unresponsive due to standing water, ease off the accelerator and slow down gradually.
 * Turn off cruise control and drive to the road conditions.
 * Driving through flooded areas risks damaging your engine, leaving you stranded. If in doubt, don't drive through flood water - yours and other people's safety is most important.
 * If you find yourself unexpectedly in deep water, use first gear. Move forward immediately to avoid stalling the engine. Keep your revs high and depress your clutch when you need to.
 * Test your brakes after passing through the water to ensure they are still working effectively.
 * Know your vehicle's capabilities; don't attempt to drive through deep water and risk getting stuck.

Following the above advice should help protect yourself, your vehicle(s) and others from harm while driving on our roads.
