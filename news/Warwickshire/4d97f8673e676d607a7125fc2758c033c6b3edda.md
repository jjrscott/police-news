The April 2020 Warwickshire Police Roads Policing Newsletter is now available. Click the link to view.

The newsletter aims to help raise awareness of the work being done to reduce the numbers of people killed or seriously injured (KSI) on Warwickshire's roads and protect people from harm.

The newsletter pulls together all the roads policing news into one place so that it can be easily shared internally and externally with partners and the public to demonstrate some of the good work being done.

The newsletter will be produced monthly and it is anticipated at some point it will be renamed and expanded to include more partner information.
