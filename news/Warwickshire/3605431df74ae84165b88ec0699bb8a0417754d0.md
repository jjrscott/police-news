Emergency services remain at the scene of a fatal multi-vehicle collision on the M6 northbound between junction one for Rugby and junction two for Coventry.

The incident was reported shortly after 6am this morning (Saturday, 12 December) and involved two HGV lorries, two vans and two cars.

A man in his 40s suffered fatal injuries and was sadly pronounced deceased at the scene. His next of kin has been informed.

Two other men, both in their 30s, suffered injuries to their face and chest and were taken to hospital for treatment. Their injuries are not believed to be life threatening or life changing at this time.

The M6 northbound between junctions one and two remains closed while emergency services are in attendance. Drivers are asked to avoid the area where possible and take an alternative route.

The southbound exit slip road at junction 1 and two lanes on the M6 southbound were closed but have since reopened.

Investigations are ongoing to establish the circumstances surrounding the collision.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has dash cam footage of it is asked to report this to us either via our website or by calling 101 quoting incident number 68 of 12 December.
