Investigating officers are appealing for witnesses to an armed robbery in Rugby.

It happened between 8pm and 8.20pm yesterday (Tuesday) at a premises on Hillmorton Road.

A man is understood to have entered the premises and used a weapon - believed to be a knife - to injure the arm of a staff member.

He then forced his way into the till and removed a quantity of cash before cycling away from the premises.

The man is described as wearing all black clothing.

We are keen to speak to anyone who was on Hillmorton Road at the time or who saw anyone acting suspiciously in the area.

Anyone with information should call 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting incident number 435 of 24 September.
