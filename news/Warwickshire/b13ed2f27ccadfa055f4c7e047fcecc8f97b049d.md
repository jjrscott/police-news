Warwickshire Police is appealing for witnesses following a roadside assault yesterday afternoon (Wednesday 24 February).

At around 4.45pm, a collision took place on the A446 (near to junction 9 of the M42 and The Belfry), involving an HGV and a recovery vehicle.

While the road was blocked, the driver of the recovery vehicle is reported to have got out of his vehicle and assaulted the driver of the HGV.

The recovery vehicle then left the scene.

If anyone witnessed the assault or has any dashcam footage, please call Warwickshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 241 of 24 February 2021.

Information can also be given to the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
