An man who punched a police officer and attempted to headbutt another has been jailed for six months.

Andrew Collier attacked the officers after they responded to a report he had walked into a shop in Mill Crescent, Kingsbury with a claw hammer and a mallet, Magistrates were told.

The 27-year-old was arrested following the incident on 19 December.

Appearing at Warwickshire Magistrates' Court last week he pleaded guilty to two counts of assaulting a police officer and two counts of possession of an offensive weapon in a public place.

Collier, of Range Way, Kingsbury, was jailed for 26 weeks and ordered to pay a Â£128 victim surcharge.

Chief Superintendent Ben Smith, head of local policing, said: "Officers are often subjected to abuse and violence. It is not simply part of the job, it is unacceptable and we will not tolerate it."
