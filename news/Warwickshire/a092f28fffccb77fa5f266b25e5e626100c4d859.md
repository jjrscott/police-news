Following an incident last month, a bar in Leamington town centre has been fined Â£10,000 for hosting a private party and breaching coronavirus restrictions.

Officers attended the venue on the evening of Thursday 22 October, where they found the doors locked but people could be seen inside.

When officers managed to gain access, approximately 90 people were found inside, with no social distancing taking place.

A fine has now been issued for the breach.
