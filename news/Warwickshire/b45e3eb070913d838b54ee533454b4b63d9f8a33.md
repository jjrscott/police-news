Detectives investigating the alleged attempted murder of a man in Balcombe Road, Rugby on Sunday 7 February are trying to identify a driver they believe was in the area at the time.

A man in his 20s suffered stab wounds in the incident which occurred at around 12.20pm.

He is described as having ginger hair, in his late 30s or 40s, around six feet tall and of average build. He was wearing jeans.

"We're not treating the man as a suspect but he may have information vital to our ongoing enquiries."

Four men have been charged in connection with the incident.
