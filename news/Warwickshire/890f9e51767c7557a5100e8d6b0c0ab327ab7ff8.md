Two men who committed a robbery at Whittleford Park just off Queen Elizabeth Road in Nuneaton have been jailed.

Jack Taylor ( _pictured below_ ), 23, of no fixed abode was sentenced to five years in prison at Warwick Crown Court last week after pleading guilty to robbery and inflicting grievous bodily harm.

Craig Williams, 22, of Vernon's Lane, Nuneaton was sentenced to three years and four months in prison after pleading guilty to robbery.

The robbery was committed on 18 June 2019.

The two victims - a teenage man and a man in his 20s - were night fishing and had gone to sleep in their tents. They were awoken by Williams and Taylor shaking their tents.

As they got out of their tents they were assaulted and robbed. One of the victims suffered a serious face injury.

Taylor and Williams fled with a mobile phone stolen from one of the victims.

They were identified following a police appeal and arrested.

Detective Constable Arun Karra, who led the investigation, said: "Taylor and Williams carried out this terrifying attack on two innocent young men, and clearly thought nothing of using violence. Jail is the best place for them."

NOTE TO MEDIA: The force does not have a custody photo for Williams.
