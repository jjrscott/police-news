Four men have been arrested after class A drugs were found at a flat in Nuneaton.

Officers from Nuneaton Proactive CID carried out an intelligence-led raid on the address in Meadow Court, Meadow Street on Tuesday (15 September).

Class A drugs were seized alongside cash, mobile phones and drug paraphernalia.

A 38-year-old man of no fixed abode, a 64-year-old man from Birmingham, a 59-year-old man from Nuneaton and a 31-year-old man from Nuneaton were all arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of class A drugs. The 59-year-old was also arrested on suspicion of possession of cannabis.

Detective Constable Jeni-Leigh Gore from Warwickshire Police Proactive CID said: "The supply and misuse of drugs has a devastating impact on our communities.

"In this case, the action we have taken has led to a significant amount of drugs being taken out of circulation.

"Tackling the supply and use of drugs is a top priority for Warwickshire Police and we will act on all information received from the public.

"If anyone has information that could help with this investigation or about ongoing drug crime they should contact Warwickshire Police on 101 or make a call anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."

The 64-year-old man has been bailed until October and the other suspects have been released under investigation while enquiries continue.
