Warwickshire Police officers carried out a series of searches at addresses in Salford, Denton and Nottingham over the past 2 days (Wednesday 16 and Thursday 17 December) as part of an ongoing investigation into a series of telephone scams.

A 30-year-old man arrested in Salford was arrested and questioned by officers from the Warwickshire Police fraud team on suspicion of fraud by false representation. He was later released under investigation while enquiries are ongoing.

Officers seized potential evidence from all the addresses.

Officers were investigating the case of a woman in her 60s from Rugby who was contacted by someone claiming to be from the HMRC stating there was an outstanding invoice and she was required to pay more than Â£3,000.

The woman went to her bank to transfer the money but fortunately alert bank staff spotted it was a fraud and contacted police.

Detective Sergeant Paul Hainsworth from the Warwickshire Police fraud team said: "Criminals use a range of techniques in these types of phone scams, including demanding money and threatening to send bailiffs around if they don't pay.

"These types of scams often target the elderly and vulnerable. They say they are from organisation such as the HMRC to add credibility to their scams.

"If someone calls, e-mails or texts claiming to be from HMRC asking you to transfer money it is scam; put the phone down and report it to Action Fraud."

Anyone with information that can help police with their ongoing enquiries should contact the Warwickshire Police fraud team on 101. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Reports to Action Fraud can be made by going to www.actionfraud.police.uk or calling 0300 123 2040. If you or someone else is in immediate danger or at risk of harm call 999.
