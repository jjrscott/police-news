Investigating officers are appealing for witnesses after an assault outside a school in Bedworth.

Police were called to a report of two men fighting close to St Michael's Academy on Hazel Grove around 3.10pm yesterday (Thursday).

A man in his 30s was getting into his car when another man is believed to have approached him, assaulted him and attempted to drag him out of his car.

An altercation followed and the man in his 30s suffered facial injuries that are not life-threatening at this time. The second man also sustained facial injuries.

Shortly afterwards a 33-year-old man from Nuneaton was arrested on suspicion of assault - GBH (section 20). He remains in police custody at this time.

Police Sergeant Ed Murray said: "Thankfully the victim's injuries were not life-threatening but we are still looking for anyone who saw anything to come forward.

"Owing to the time of day we know a number of people would have been near the school so if you were in the area and saw something, please get in touch with us. Any information may help with our investigation."

Enquiries are ongoing and we're keen to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time, who witnessed the incident or who knows anything that could help with the investigation.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting incident 204 of 10 December.
