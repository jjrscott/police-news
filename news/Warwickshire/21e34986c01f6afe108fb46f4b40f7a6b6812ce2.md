An investigation has been launched after a woman in her 40s was sexually assaulted in Leamington.

Enquiries are ongoing into the incident which occurred in Dormer Place near to the Pump Rooms at the junction with Parade at between 10pm and 10.35pm yesterday (Saturday 1 August).

The suspect is described as being a clean shaven black male with short hair. He was wearing glasses, a green t-shirt, black jeans, and trainers. He left in a small white car that was parked in Dormer Place.

Police believe the victim stopped to speak to a cyclist around the time of the incident and they are keen to speak to the cyclist. The cyclist is being treated as a potential witness, not a suspect.

Detective Inspector Collette O'Keefe from Leamington Serious and Complex Crime Team said: "This is an extremely concerning incident and we have launched a thorough investigation to identify the suspect. I'd appeal for anyone who was in the area at the time, or anyone who saw or knows someone matching the description to get in touch.

"We'd also like to hear from anyone with dash cam footage from the area at the time."

Anyone with information can call police on 101 quoting incident 484 of 1 August 2020. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
