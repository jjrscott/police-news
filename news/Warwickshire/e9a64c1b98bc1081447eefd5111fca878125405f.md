Investigating officers are appealing for witnesses to an armed robbery in Warwick.

It happened shortly after 10.30pm on Tuesday (10 November) at Tesco Express on Chase Meadow Square.

Two suspects are understood to have entered and used weapons - believed to be a hammer and a knife - to threaten members of staff.

A quantity of cash was taken while cigarettes and alcohol were also removed from the premises.

The staff members were uninjured but left shaken by the incident.

Officers attended the scene shortly afterwards and a 37-year-old man from Warwick was arrested on suspicion of robbery.

He remains in police custody at this time.

Enquiries are currently ongoing and we are keen to speak to any members of the public who were in the store at the time, who saw anyone acting suspiciously or who have information that could help with the investigation.

Anyone with information should call 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting incident number 394 of 10 November.
