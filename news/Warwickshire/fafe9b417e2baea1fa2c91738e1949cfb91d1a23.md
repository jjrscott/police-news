WCC Road Safety Education and Warwickshire Police are helping to spread road safety messages to Warwickshire Primary Schools as part of National Road Safety Week 2020, which begins on Monday 16 November.

This Road Safety Week will see the launch of a brand-new virtual learning resource free for all Warwickshire primary schools.

The County's Road Safety Education Team and Safer Neighbourhood Teams from Warwickshire Police have worked in partnership to develop a virtual assembly to raise awareness about travelling safely and actively.

Key, age-appropriate and timely messages include:
• The benefits of travelling actively;
• How to do this safely by following the Road Safety Code; and
• Remembering to wear light, bright and reflective clothing.

Warwickshire Police also share a further message to raise awareness of the importance of safe, considerate and legal parking on the school run.

Sergeant Shaun Bridle, from Warwickshire Police, said "The National Road Safety Week assembly contains some really important road safety advice not only for the children but also for their parents who might need to use cars to drop off or collect their children from school.

"As well as explaining what unsafe parking looks like to children, we are asking parents to help keep children safe on our roads by parking safely and away from the school gates, even if the weather is bad or they are running late."

Cllr Jeff Clarke, Warwickshire County Council Portfolio Holder - Transport & Planning, said: "Road Safety Education is a skill for life and embedding safe practice should begin as soon as children start to walk and be built upon, steadily, throughout their education.

"After the prolonged absence, resulting from the first Covid-19 lockdown, we have generally seen an increase in pupils at our schools taking advantage of safe and active travel options and this is a trend that we hope to see continue for the future.

"Our Road Safety Education Team will be using National Road Safety Week 2020 to continue to embed the vital messages around road safety when travelling to schools to both pupils and parents across the County."

This resource can be accessed free of charge by all Warwickshire primary schools during National Road Safety Week, 16 - 22 November 2020 by contacting Warwickshire Road Safety Education Team at roadsafetyeducation@warwickshire.gov.uk
