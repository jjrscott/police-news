Two men have been arrested on suspicion of drugs offences, following an incident in Nuneaton yesterday (Thursday 27 February).

At around 3.20pm, a man was observed conducting a suspected drug deal on High Street in the town.

He was subsequently arrested on Earls Road on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of controlled drugs and theft. The 30-year-old currently remains in police custody at this time.

As part of the investigation, a property on High Street was later searched. A significant quantity of suspected class A drugs were seized, and a 29-year-old man from Birmingham was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply. He has been released under investigation whilst enquiries are ongoing.
