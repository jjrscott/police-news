A man from Leamington has been arrested on suspicion of importing heroin.

In November, officers were notified of a package intercepted by the UK Border Force containing the drug.

The 29-year-old man was arrested by officers from Leamington Proactive CID today (Monday 11 January) and he remains in custody.
