Warwickshire Police is investigating after a 17-year-old girl was sexually assaulted in Leamington.

The incident happened between 7-8pm on Tuesday (30 March) in Avenue Road between York Walk and Station Approach.

The suspect is described as being around 5 foot 10 inches tall, dark skinned, of average build and between 30-40 years old with dark curly hair and a full dark beard. He was wearing a dark coloured t-shirt and jeans and spoke with a foreign accent.

The suspect was with two other males. All of the males are described as speaking with foreign accents. One of the males is described as wearing a horizontal striped t-shirt.

Detective Constable Erin Craig from Leamington CID said: "This was a terrifying attack on a young girl and she is being offered support. We have launched a thorough investigation to identify the man responsible.

"We're keen to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident or anyone who thinks they may know the offender.

"Understandably, the victim was extremely distressed following the incident so we're also keen to speak to anyone who saw her following the attack."

Anyone with information is urged to contact Warwickshire Police on 101, quoting incident 418 of 30 March 2021 or call the independent charity Crimestopper anonymously on 0800 555 111.
