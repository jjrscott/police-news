Warwickshire Chief Constable Martin Jelley said: "I am delighted that Katharine's enormous contribution as a volunteer to policing in Warwickshire has been recognised with this award. Katharine has been a Special Constable for 27 years and her long term commitment to this and her work with Girlguiding UK shows she is truly deserving of this honour.

"The Special Constabulary is an essential part of modern policing and the work which Katherine and her specials colleagues do is invaluable."

"I am extremely privileged to lead the 91 Specials we have, who in 2020 have dedicated tens of thousands of hours of their time to help protect people in our county.

"When I joined the Specials in 1993 I wanted to give something back to my community, I look forward to continuing to do this in both my Specials role and within Girlguiding for many years to come."
