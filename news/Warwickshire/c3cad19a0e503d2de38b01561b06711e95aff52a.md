A stolen vehicle and a vehicle with no insurance have both been seized from Stratford.

At approximately 9pm last night (Monday 10 August), officers from the Southern Vehicle Crime team were patrolling in the Alveston area when they located a van, which was suspected to have been stolen with keys from an address in Coventry.

Whilst dealing with this vehicle, officers also came across another vehicle which was being used without insurance. Both vehicles were seized and enquires are ongoing.

The stolen vehicle will now be given back to its rightful owner.
