Officers are continuing to investigate the death of a woman at a property in Rugby.

Police were called to Featherbed Lane shortly after 3pm yesterday (Sunday 12 April), after a woman in her forties was found deceased inside the property. Her next of kin has been informed.

A 47-year-old man from Rugby has been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in police custody.

Detective Inspector Collette O'Keefe from Warwickshire Police said: "The death is currently being treated as unexplained, and we are awaiting the results of a post-mortem.

"Our thoughts are with the woman's family and friends at this difficult time."
