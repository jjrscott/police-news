West Midlands Police and Warwickshire Police have a strong operational partnership and we are delighted to now work together on delivering forensic services.

Such regional collaborative working within this field complements the national direction of travel in this area.

By sharing resources across our forces, this ensures a sensible approach to provide the best services to the public in the most efficient and effective way.
