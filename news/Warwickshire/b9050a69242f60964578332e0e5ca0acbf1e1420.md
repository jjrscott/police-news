Officers are appealing for witnesses to an incident involving a motorcyclist in Nuneaton.

It happened around 1.30pm on Thursday (11 June).

The victim - a man in his 30s - was riding his blue and white Yamaha motorbike along Queens Road when he became aware of another motorbike - a black Lexmoto - very close behind him.

The Lexmoto motorbike, which had two people on board is then reported to have started pulling wheelies, driving on the wrong side of the road and dangerously overtaking as it travelled from Edward Street to Vernons Lane.

As they were riding along Vernons Lane, the Lexmoto is understood to have pulled alongside and the rear passenger repeatedly kicked the Yamaha causing damage and scratches to the left indicator and side of the bike.

The Yamaha continued onto Black-A-Tree Road at which point the Lexmoto rider - who is described as being of large build and was wearing a pink helmet - made off in an unknown direction.

The rider of the Yamaha was uninjured but left shaken up by the incident.

Enquiries are currently ongoing and we're keen to hear from anyone who was in the area, who witnessed the incident or has dashcam footage.

Anyone with information about the incident should call 101 quoting incident number 218 of 11 June.
