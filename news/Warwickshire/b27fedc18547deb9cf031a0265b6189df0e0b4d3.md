Two teenage boys have been arrested in connection with a burglary in the West Midlands, following assistance from the National Police Air Service (NPAS) in Warwickshire.

At around 1pm on Saturday (22 February), a burglary took place at a house in Binley Woods in Coventry.

Shortly afterwards, officers located a car near Shilton, Warwickshire, which had been in a collision with another car.

It's believed this vehicle had been involved in the earlier burglary, and five males were seen to run from the car.

Following a pursuit involving the police helicopter, a 16-year-old boy and an 15-year-old boy from Coventry were arrested on suspicion of burglary. They have been released on bail whilst enquiries continue.

An investigation is ongoing and officers would like to speak to anyone who may have witnessed the collision, or any suspicious behaviour in the area. If anyone has any information, please call Warwickshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 185 of 22 February 2020.

Alternatively, information can be given to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
