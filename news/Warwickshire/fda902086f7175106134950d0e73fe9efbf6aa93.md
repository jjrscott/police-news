Warwickshire Police is appealing for witnesses or information following a robbery in Sydenham last week.

At around 7.05pm on Wednesday (17 June), a 33-year-old man was walking in an alleyway by the canal (near Stanley Court), when a man approached him and threatened him. It's believed the suspect was holding a bladed object.

A quantity of cash was stolen from the victim, and the suspect then left the area on foot.

The victim was not injured.

The suspect is described as a white man, around 5' 10", clean shaven with a spotty complexion, aged between 25-30. He was believed to be wearing a black tracksuit and a black baseball cap.

If anyone witnessed the offence or any suspicious behaviour in the area, please call Det Sgt Jenny Baker at Warwickshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 340 of 17 June 2020.

Information can also be given anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
