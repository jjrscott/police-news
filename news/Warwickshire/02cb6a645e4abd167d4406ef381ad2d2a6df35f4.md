Police are continuing to search for 61-year-old Keith Appleton, who was reported missing from Rugby last month.

Keith was last seen at 9.45am on Monday 18 January, walking along Newbold Road.

He is white, 5'10", of a slim build. He was last thought to be wearing a black jacket with a hood, a shirt and jumper, smart suit trousers, formal shoes, and may have been carrying a clip board.

Det Insp Jim Rankin from Warwickshire Police said: "It's now been exactly four weeks since Keith was reported missing and despite a considerable number of enquiries, unfortunately we have been unable to locate him.

"Keith's family are desperately worried for him, and would continue to ask anyone who may have been travelling on Newbold Road or Leicester Road on the morning of Monday 18 January, and have a dashcam, to please get in touch with police.

"They send their thanks to everyone who has responded so far and to the continued efforts of Warwickshire Search & Rescue volunteers who are providing exceptional support to our search efforts.

"We would continue to appeal to everyone to please keep an eye out for him. If anyone has seen Keith or knows of his whereabouts, please call Warwickshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 220 of 18 January 2021."
