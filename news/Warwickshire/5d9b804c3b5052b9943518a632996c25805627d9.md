We are appealing for witnesses to an assault in Nuneaton.

It happened on Attleborough Road close to the Attleborough Arms pub between 4.30am and 5am on Sunday (22 December).

A man is reported to have punched a 19-year-old woman to the head before pushing her to the floor and kicking her.

A 21-year-old man from Nuneaton was arrested on suspicion of assault ABH in connection with the incident. He has been bailed until mid-January.

PC Steven Jones said: "Investigations are ongoing and it is believed the two individuals were known to each other.

"There were a number of cars that drove past at the time of the incident and we're keen for those people to come forward and speak to us.

"We'd also like anyone who saw the incident or had contact with the woman in the aftermath to come forward.

"Any information, no matter how small, could be significant to our investigation."

Anyone who can help should call Warwickshire Police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting incident number 88 of 22 December.
