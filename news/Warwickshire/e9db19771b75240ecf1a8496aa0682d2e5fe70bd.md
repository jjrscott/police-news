Warwickshire Police is appealing for witnesses following a collision in Middleton near Tamworth this morning (Tuesday 8 December).

Police were called shortly before 10.50am to a report of a two vehicle collision by the junction of A446 London Road and Coppice Lane.

The collision involved a white Fiat and a grey Ford Transit tipper truck, believed to be pictured below. It's reported the grey truck did not stop at the scene.

The driver of the Fiat, a woman in her late 80s, has been taken to hospital by ambulance.

Inspector Mick Huntley from Warwickshire Police said "We're appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or may have any dashcam footage to please come forward.

"The grey truck is likely to have a number plate missing and front end damage - and we would also ask anyone who sees a vehicle matching this description to please make contact.

"Any information can be given by calling Warwickshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 85 of 8 December."
