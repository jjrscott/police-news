Warwickshire Police dispersed approximately 30 vehicles that were believed to be breaching a High Court Injunction to prevent car cruising in the Bassetts Pole area on Sunday evening, 10 May 2020.

The operation was put in place to focus on a recent spike in car cruising across North Warwickshire and the West Midlands and involved officers from the Northern Special Tasking Team, Coleshill SNT and Warwickshire OPU.

Two traffic offence reports were also issued for defective number plates and a number of car occupants were spoken to during the operation.

Special Chief Officer Katherine Hancock said "In recent weeks, we have been made aware that large numbers of vehicles have been breaching the Car Cruising High Court Injunction in North Warwickshire. In response to this, on the request of Coleshill SNT, officers from the Special Constabulary were asked to assist with proactively policing the area covered by the High Court Injunction."

"This has led to a downturn in vehicles using North Warwickshire for car cruising opportunities."

Car cruising is not only dangerous to those taking part, but anyone who is found to be breaching the High Court Injunction risks having their vehicle seized, hefty fines and could even face imprisonment.

SCO Hancock added "We will continue to proactively police the area and will continue to report those breaching the High Court Injunction."
