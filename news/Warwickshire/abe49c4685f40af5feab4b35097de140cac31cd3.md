Warwickshire Police is appealing for witnesses or information following an aggravated burglary in Leamington last night (Monday 15 February).

At around 8.40pm, officers were called to a property on Tachbrook Road.

It's reported three males entered the property, one with a bladed object and punched one of the occupants. He sustained minor facial injuries but did not require medical treatment.

The offenders then left the scene. Nothing was stolen.

The suspects are described as an Asian male and two white males, wearing dark tops, masks and jeans.

Detective Inspector Cindy Stephenson from Warwickshire Police said: "A number of enquiries are currently ongoing to identify and locate those responsible.

"This was an understandably very frightening experience for the house occupants, but thankfully there were no serious injuries.

"If anyone witnessed the incident or has any information, please call Warwickshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 400 of 15 February 2021."

Information can also be given to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
