In light of Warwickshire moving into Tier 4, Warwickshire Police are urging communities to follow the new rules and stay home.

Assistant Chief Constable Debbie Tedds said: "We understand that the move to tighter Tier 4 restrictions is difficult, particularly at the end of what has been an extremely challenging year.

"While this would normally be a time of celebrating and welcoming in a new year with friends and family, this time we must do this in a different way and a way that keeps us all safe.

"I am urging people to follow the Tier 4 rules which are in place to protect us all, our families and loved ones, and our wider communities.

"Throughout the pandemic, the vast majority of people in Warwickshire have stuck to the rules and played their part to protect themselves and others, no matter how difficult, for that we sincerely thank them.

"But despite all our best efforts, the virus continues to spread. We have to carry on taking the necessary steps to prevent this.

"We will continue to engage with people, explain the rules and encourage them to do the right thing.

"But those who deliberately break the rules and place others at risk will face enforcement action and can expect to receive a fixed penalty notice."
