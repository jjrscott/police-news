A dawn raid saw two people arrested as part of an investigation into drug supply in Warwickshire.

This morning (Friday 7 February) officers executed a warrant in Quinneys Court, Bidford on Avon.

A 28-year-old man of no fixed abode and 28-year-old woman from Bidford on Avon were arrested on suspicion of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply and money laundering.

A large amount of what officers believe to be class A drugs and money were seized from the property.

Detective Constable Karl Brennan from the Warwickshire Police Priorities Team said: "We've apprehended two people this morning and seized a large quantity of drugs and cash.

"Our enquiries are ongoing and I'd encourage anyone with information to contact us."

Anyone with information that could help police with this investigation or any other information about drug dealing should call 101. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
