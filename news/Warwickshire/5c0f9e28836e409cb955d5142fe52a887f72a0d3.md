Officers investigating the death of a man on Meadow Road, Rugby last Thursday (31 October) have released a further appeal.

At around 5.10pm, it's believed an altercation may have taken place in the bridge area of Parkfield Road. Officers would like to speak to anyone who has any dashcam footage or recordings of this incident.

It's also believed some 'trick or treaters' may have seen the incident on Meadow Road, and officers are keen to speak to them as potential witnesses.
