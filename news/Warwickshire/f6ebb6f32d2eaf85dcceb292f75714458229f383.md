We're appealing for the public's help to locate Chris Michael Sheldon.

It is understood the 42-year-old may have information about an assault and criminal damage incident that took place at a property in Curdworth on Sunday (19 April).

Sheldon is described as white, around 5ft 10in tall, of medium build but with a large stomach and no tattoos.

He is bald and clean shaven but may have brown stubble. He usually wears trainers, jeans and a polo shirt.

Sheldon is believed to be living in the Marston Green area and also has links to Sutton Coldfield.

Sheldon, or anyone who knows where he might be, should call 101 quoting incident 378 of 19 April.

**Note to editors - We do not have an image of Chris Sheldon at this time.**
