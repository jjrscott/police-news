Warwickshire Police is appealing for witnesses or information following a robbery in Nuneaton on Friday (21 February).

At around 2.05pm, two teenage girls were approached by a man on Coventry Canal, near to Coton Arches.

The man grabbed a Sony SLR camera off one of the girls and threatened her.

He then left on foot heading away from Coton Arches.

The suspect is described as white, approximately six foot, with dark hair and stubble with patches of grey. He was believed to be wearing a beanie hat and grey hoodie.

Investigating officers would like to speak to anyone who witnessed the offence or who may have been offered this item for sale over the weekend.

If anyone has any information, please call Warwickshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 202 of 21 February 2020.

Alternatively, information can be given to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
