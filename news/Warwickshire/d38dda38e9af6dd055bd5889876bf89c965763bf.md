Throughout this week, Warwickshire Police, Barnardo's and Warwickshire County Council are raising awareness of child exploitation (CE).

Police are issuing advice to parents, carers and friends on recognising the signs of child sexual exploitation (CSE), ahead of the National Child Exploitation (CE) Awareness Day tomorrow (Wednesday, 18 March).

Sexual exploitation can happen to anyone regardless of where they live, what their parents or carers do for a living or what their race, religion or sexuality is.

It may be presumed that CSE only happens to vulnerable young girls, but girls and boys can be sexually exploited.

Sexual exploitation affects thousands of children and young people every year. By knowing the tell-tale signs, we can all play an important role in reducing that number.

Look out for:

 * unexplained gifts
 * changes in mood
 * going missing
 * staying out late
 * being secretive about where they are going
 * lack of interest in activities and hobbies
 * missing school.

**Get help**

It's important to remember that there are people to help you if you or someone you know is or has been sexually exploited.

If something's not right - please speak to someone. Exploitation is never your fault and abusers can be very clever in the way they manipulate young people. It is not ok for someone to expect you, or your friends, to do something you don't want to do sexually.
