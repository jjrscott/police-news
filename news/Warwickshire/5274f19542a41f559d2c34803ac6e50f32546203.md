A man has been arrested for drug offences after a warrant and search at a property in Bedworth as part of a Warwickshire Police investigation.

This morning (Friday 14 August), officers from Proactive CID executed a warrant in Leicester Road. They seized a quantity of what they believe to be class A drugs.

A 38-year-man from Bedworth was arrested on suspicion of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply.

Detective Constable Dan Stanton from Warwickshire Police Proactive CID said: "Today's warrant was the result of an ongoing investigation, including intelligence and information gathered from the community.

"The seizure of the drugs demonstrates our commitment to target the supply of drugs in Warwickshire and I hope it provides reassurance to local people that we are working hard to tackle this type of criminality.

"This warrant is just one example of the initiatives and investigations Warwickshire Police have in place to tackle the issue."

Anyone with information that could help police with their ongoing enquiries should call 101. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
