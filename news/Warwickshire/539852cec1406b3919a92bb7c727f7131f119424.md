Warwickshire Police has issued three £10,000 fines to people for organising illegal gatherings in contravention of Covid legislation.

Fines were issued to two men following a party with more than 60 guests in Bramcote on 12 September.

Another fine was issued to a man after a festival at Stratford Recreational Ground was attended by more than 200 people on 24 August.

In addition, a £200 fine was issued to a pub owner in the Nuneaton and Bedworth district after officers responded to a report that staff weren't wearing masks and people were standing at the bar instead of sitting at tables.

The announcement comes as the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) releases national fixed penalty data.

Assistant Chief Constable Debbie Tedds said: "While most people are following the rules and doing their bit to stop the spread of the virus, there are clearly some people who don't think the rules apply to them. I hope the severity of the fines sends out a very clear message to others thinking of organising an event.

"We are committed to engaging with our communities, explaining the risks and people's responsibilities, and encouraging compliance with legislation; but, be under no illusion, where there are clear and deliberate breaches of legislation we will not hesitate to take action."
