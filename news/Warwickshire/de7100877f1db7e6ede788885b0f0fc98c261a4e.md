He is understood to have had his face covered during the incident.

Detective Sergeant Jenny Baker said: "Enquiries are currently ongoing and we are keen for anyone who saw the incident to come forward.

"We would also ask for anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area or who has information, which would help with enquiries to please get in touch.

"Any details, no matter how small, could be important in our investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 quoting incident number 5 of 14 October.
