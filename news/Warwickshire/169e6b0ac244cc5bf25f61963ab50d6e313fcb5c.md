A prolific shoplifter who committed a series of thefts from shops in Nuneaton has been jailed.

Jonathan Laws, 38, of Church Road, Nuneaton, was jailed for 16 weeks after been convicted of the thefts at Warwickshire Magistrates Court today (Thursday 26 March).

Laws was arrested by officers who were on patrol in Vernon's Lane, Nuneaton yesterday afternoon.

He pleaded guilty to eight counts of theft. The offences took place at different shops in Nuneaton between 29 February and 19 March.

PC Nicola Cairns from the Prisoner Processing Team at Bedworth Police Station said: "Laws is a prolific offender who committed these offences over a number of weeks.

"I would like to thank the local businesses who worked with us to help ensure this conviction.

"Shoplifting does not just affect the businesses targeted; the costs get passed on to consumers so it is a crime that affects the whole community.

"I welcome the custodial sentence and hope it reassures the public that we work hard to take criminals off the streets."
