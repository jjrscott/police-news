The November Roads Policing Newsletter is now available to help raise awareness of the work being done by police and partners to reduce the numbers of people killed or seriously injured (KSI) on Warwickshire's roads and protect people from harm.

The newsletter pulls together all the roads policing news into one place including updates from partners so that it can be easily shared internally and externally with stakeholders and the public to demonstrate some of the good work being done.

The newsletter is currently produced bi-monthly and it is anticipated at some point it will be renamed and expanded to include even more partner information.
