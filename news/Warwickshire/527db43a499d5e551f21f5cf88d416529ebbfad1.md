Warwickshire Police is appealing for information to help locate a 57-year-old man.

Phillip Tedstone was released from HMP Oakwood in Staffordshire in December, after serving a sentence for robbery and having an imitation firearm.

He has now breached the conditions of his release and is wanted on recall to prison.

Tedstone is 5"11, with tattoos on his head, neck, arms and hands.

He is thought to frequent Leamington Spa and Warwick.

If anyone has seen him or knows of his whereabouts, please call Warwickshire Police on 101.

Information can also be given to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
