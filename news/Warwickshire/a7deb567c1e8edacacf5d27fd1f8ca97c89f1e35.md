Investigating officers are appealing for witnesses to a racially aggravated incident in Nuneaton to come forward.

A blue Chevrolet was reported to be driving erratically between Queens Road and the Coton roundabout next to the Ropewalk Shopping Centre car park between 5pm and 5.10pm on Thursday (2 July).

After stopping just before the roundabout, the driver is understood to have got out and approached a grey car driving behind it.

He is alleged to have used racially abusive language towards the driver of the grey car before driving away in the direction of Attleborough.

Enquiries are ongoing but officers would like to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident, who was in the area at the time, or who has dashcam footage.

Anyone with information should call on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting incident number 270 of 2 July.
