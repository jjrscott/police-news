Three men have been arrested on suspicion of drugs offences following an incident in Stratford yesterday evening (Monday 15 June).

Between around 7.40pm and 8pm, officers from the Southern Vehicle Crime team were patrolling the Bishopton area, when they saw a suspected drug deal taking place between Drayton Avenue and Meadow Close.

Shortly after this, two men were seen leaving a nearby block of flats on Drayton Avenue and getting into a vehicle.

Officers attempted to stop the vehicle but it made off, and following assistance from OPU officers, it was later stopped on the A46 towards Coventry.

A large amount of cash and a number of mobile phones were seized, and an 18-year-old man and a 27-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the Supply of Class A drugs.

Following the search of a nearby flat in Stratford, a 30-year-old man from Stratford was also arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the Supply of Class A drugs.

All three men remain in custody as enquiries continue.
