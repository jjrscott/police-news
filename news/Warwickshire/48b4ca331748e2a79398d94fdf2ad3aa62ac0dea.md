Two people have been arrested in connection with drugs offences following an incident in Rugby.

Officers from Rugby's Proactive CID team were patrolling on Avon Street at 2.25pm on Wednesday (24 June) when they witnessed a suspected drug deal taking place.

A quantity of drugs - believed to be crack cocaine and heroin - were seized and a 29-year-old man from Nottingham was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of drugs.

He has been bailed until 17 July pending further enquiries.

Shortly afterwards, at around 2.30pm officers were on Newbold Road when they noticed an individual acting suspiciously.

A quantity of drugs - believed to be class A - were seized and a 20-year-old woman from Rugby was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of drugs.

She has been released under investigation.

Enquiries are currently ongoing but anyone with any information concerning either incident or suspected drug dealing in the area is asked to call 101.
