Five police officers were allegedly assaulted while responding to incidents on Christmas Day.

An 18-year-old man from Gun Hill allegedly assaulted an officer after he responded to a report of a disturbance in Daffern Avenue, Gun Hill on Christmas morning. He was later charged with assaulting an emergency worker and will appear at Warwickshire Magistrates' Court on 19 January 2021.

A 31-year-old man from Nuneaton allegedly kicked an officer in the arm and back of the head, and kicked another in the shoulder after they responded to a report of car colliding with a house in Arley lane, Ansley on Christmas afternoon. He was arrested on suspicion of assaulting a police officer and dangerous driving, and later released under investigation while enquiries continue.

A 35-year-old man from Corby allegedly grabbed an officer and punched another after they responded to a report of a disturbance at a property in Shillingston Drive, Nuneaton on Christmas evening. He was arrested on suspicion of assaulting the officers and being drunk and disorderly, and later released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Superintendent Mike Smith, policing lead for communities and response, said: "Fortunately, none of these officers was seriously injured but it does serve as a reminder that while most people were enjoying Christmas with their families, our officers continued to put themselves in harm's way to help protect our communities."
