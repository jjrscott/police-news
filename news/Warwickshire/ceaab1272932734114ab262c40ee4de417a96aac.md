A man and woman have been arrested on suspicion of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply.

While on patrol in Dovecote Road, Nuneaton, officers from the North Warwickshire Vehicle Crime Team and Nuneaton Proactive CID spotted a car being driven by a man they believed to have been disqualified from driving.

After stopping the 33-year-old man from Nuneaton they seized a quantity of class A drugs and arrested him on suspicion of driving while disqualified and possession of class A drugs with intent to supply.

A search of a property on Russett Avenue, Nuneaton led to more drugs being seized and a 41-year-old woman from Nuneaton being arrested on suspicion of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply.

Lead investigator, Detective Constable Dan Stanton from Nuneaton Proactive CID, said: "I hope this type of proactive policing shows the community we are taking action over the suspected supply of drugs in Warwickshire.

"As ever, it is essential people in Warwickshire continue to tell us about issues in their communities."

Anyone with information about the supply of drugs is asked to contact Warwickshire Police on 101. Alternatively, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org
