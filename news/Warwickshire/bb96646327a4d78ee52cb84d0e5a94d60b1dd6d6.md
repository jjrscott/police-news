We are appealing for witnesses to a robbery in Studley.

It happened on Priory Lane off Birmingham Road at around 6.45pm on Sunday (26 April).

A group of four men were walking along the road when they were approached by two men who got out of a white Ford Transit van before assaulting one of the group and taking his mobile phone.

The victim - a 19-year-old man - suffered facial injuries that are not believed to be life-threatening.

A 19-year-old man and a 20-year-old man from Evesham were arrested on suspicion of robbery. They have been bailed until 18 May.

Enquiries are ongoing but it is believed the individuals were known to one another.

Officers are keen for anyone who was in the area at the time, who witnessed any suspicious behaviour, or who can help with the investigation to come forward.

Anyone who can help should call 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting incident number 449 of 26 April.
