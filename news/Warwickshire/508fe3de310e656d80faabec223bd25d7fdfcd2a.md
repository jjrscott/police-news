Warwickshire Police have once again been out on the county's roads looking for any drivers who may be behind the wheel under the influence of drink or drugs.

Officers arrested a 22 year old woman from Banbury on suspicion of driving under the influence of cocaine after stopping her car on the B4100 in Gaydon at 02.10hours on Wednesday 16 December 2020. She has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

At 11.35 hours on Tuesday 15 December officers also stopped a car on Nuneaton Road, Hartshill and arrested a 34 year old man from Swadlincote in Derbyshire on suspicion of drink driving. He was taken into police custody at Nuneaton where he spent the night and was later charged before being released at 05.29hours on 16 December. He is due to appear before Warwickshire Magistrates at 11am on 19 February 2021.

Warwickshire Police is publicising arrests made during December for drink or drug driving as a way of demonstrating how officers are being proactive in targeting people suspected of drink or drug driving. This is part of a campaign aimed at changing people's behaviour and reducing the number of people killed and seriously injured on the county's roads.

Officers are also asking the public to provide intelligence about anyone they believe may be drink or drug driving in Warwickshire to police by dialling 101 or 999 if a suspected offence is in progress. Reports can also be made anonymously to independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
