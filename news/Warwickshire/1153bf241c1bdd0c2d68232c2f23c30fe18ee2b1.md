A forty-three year old man from Nuneaton has been charged with drink driving after a tip off from a member of the public.

Officers arrived and identified the suspect who failed to provide a breath test.

He was arrested at 20.45 hours on 9 December in Croft Road, Nuneaton and after spending the night in custody was charged with drink driving the next morning.

He is currently scheduled to appear before Warwickshire Magistrates at 10am on 5 January 2021.

Over the festive period, all front line officers including Patrol, SNT, Vehicle Crime Teams and OPU will be using police powers to stop and test drivers suspected of drink or drug driving.

Warwickshire Police is also asking the public to help make our roads safer by providing intelligence about anyone they believe may be drink or drug driving in Warwickshire to police by dialling 101 or 999 if a suspected offence is in progress. Reports can also be made anonymously to independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
