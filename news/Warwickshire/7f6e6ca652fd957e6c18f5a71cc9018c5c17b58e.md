A man has been convicted of manslaughter, following the death of 24-year-old Cain Jackson in Rugby last year.

Ethan Tucker, aged 18 of Meadow Road, Rugby, pleaded guilty via video link at Warwick Crown Court today (Monday 27 April).

Police were called to Meadow Road in Rugby shortly after 6pm on Thursday 31 October 2019, following a report of a stabbing outside a property.

The victim, Cain Jackson, sustained serious injuries and sadly died at the scene.

Ethan Tucker was arrested on the same night and later charged with murder. He was remanded in custody, where he later entered a guilty plea to manslaughter. This plea was accepted by the courts and he was today convicted of the offence.

Following the outcome, investigating officer Detective Inspector Teresa McKenna from Warwickshire Police said: "This was a tragic event which led to a young man losing his life, and our thoughts remain with Cain's friends and family at this difficult time.

"This has been a complex investigation and I would like to thank everyone who came forward to give evidence to support our enquiries, and ultimately helped to bring the defendant to justice."

Ethan Tucker will be sentenced on 22 May 2020.
