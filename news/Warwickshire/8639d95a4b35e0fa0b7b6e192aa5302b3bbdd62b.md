Officers are appealing for witnesses to a fatal collision near Atherstone.

It happened on the southbound carriageway of the A5 between Atherstone and Hartshill at around 6.40am on Sunday (29 November) and involved a silver Mercedes and an HGV.

The driver of the Mercedes - a man in his 50s - suffered fatal injuries. His next of kin has been informed and they are being supported by specially trained officers.

The HGV driver was uninjured.

The road was closed from the Mancetter Island and Holly Lane Island while emergency services dealt with the incident.

Officers are keen to speak with anyone who saw the incident, or who saw the vehicles and the manner in which they were being driven prior to the collision.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 and speak to PC Abimilech quoting incident number 46 of 29 November.
