Following a Warwickshire Police investigation, two men have been convicted of drugs offences in Leamington.

Kevin Lavery, aged 52 of Kingsway, Leamington and James Barnes, aged 21 of Brighton Street, Coventry, appeared at Warwick Crown Court today (Wednesday 24 March).

On 29 September last year, Lavery was arrested in an alleyway off Nevill Close, Leamington, after being found in possession of class A drugs.

During a subsequent search of his home address, James Barnes was located and found in possession of a quantity of crack cocaine and heroin, a quantity of cash, weighing scales and a drugs line mobile phone.

Both men pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply Class A drugs at court today. Barnes was sentenced to four years and six months in prison, and Lavery will be sentenced at a later date.

Investigating officer, Det Constable Paul Luke said: "This was a great result following an investigation by officers in our Proactive CID team in Leamington.

"We work closely with our partners and the wider community to proactively target people we believe to be involved in the supply of drugs, and use the powers we have to make sure their activity is disrupted.

"I hope this sentence acts as a deterrent to anyone involved in drug dealing, and goes some way to reassuring the public we will thoroughly investigate these offences, so we can bring offenders to justice and protect our communities from harm."
