Two people have been arrested in Leamington as part of Warwickshire Police's ongoing crackdown on drug dealing.

Suspected class A drugs were seized when officers stopped a known drug user in Gresham Avenue on Wednesday (23 September) afternoon.

The 50-year-old woman from Leamington was arrested on suspicion of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply.

A search of nearby property led to more suspected class A drugs being seized and 19-year-old man of no fixed abode was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of drugs.

Both suspects have been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Detective Constable Paul Luke from Leamington Proactive CID said: "It is important people living in Leamington tell us if they know who is dealing drugs so we can help keep our communities safe."

If you have concerns around drug dealing in your area you can report it to Warwickshire Police on their website https://www.warwickshire.police.uk/ro/report/ocr/af/how-to-report-a-crime/ or by calling 101.

Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
