Warwickshire Police is appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Rugby last Thursday (10 October).

At around 4.50am, two males entered a petrol station on Leicester Road.

A member of staff was assaulted, causing them to sustain a head injury which required hospital treatment.

A quantity of alcohol and cigarettes were stolen from the shop.

The suspects then left in a black Mercedes car along Leicester Road towards the roundabout at the bottom of Newbold Road.

Det Con Beverley Ward from Rugby CID said: "A number of enquiries are currently ongoing and we are appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or any suspicious behaviour in the area to please come forward.

"If you have any information, please call Warwickshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 47 of 10 October 2019."

Alternatively, information can be given anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.
