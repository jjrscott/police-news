Detectives made four arrests and seized large quantities of cannabis and cash in an operation across the South East.

On Wednesday 13 January search warrants were executed at locations in Surrey, Sussex and Berkshire, with the support of colleagues from Sussex as well as Thames Valley Police.

Two cannabis 'factories' were found at a house in Horley and at a commercial site in Reading, containing between them, mostly at the Horley address, a total of some 300 cannabis plants in various stages of cultivation.

Three vehicles were searched at an address in East Grinstead

An address was also searched in Hounslow, West London.

£100,000 cash was seized, most at the Horley address.

More than seven kilos of herbal cannabis with an estimated potential street value of £70,000 were also seized at the Horley address.

Police Dogs Sox (pictured) and Dave worked with their handlers PCs Claire Bird and Colleen Drummond to sniff out the cannabis.

A man aged 40 from East Grinstead and a man aged 49 from Hounslow were arrested in Reading, and a man aged 59 and a woman aged 61, both from Horley, were arrested, all on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of cannabis.

After being interviewed all four were released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Detective Constable Katy Lewis said: "This is another example of our continuing proactive focus on serious and organised crime that affects our communities, even during these challenging times."
