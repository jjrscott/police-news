We are appealing for witnesses following reports that a woman was sexually assaulted in Woking in the early hours today (19 November).

The incident is alleged to have taken place around 3.30am in a car park behind Pound House in Board School Road.

The victim had been out walking her dog in the town centre around midnight when she started talking to the suspect near the KFC in Chertsey Road.

They walked along Maybury Road before heading down North Road towards Boundary Park and then along Board School Road to the car park where the offence took place.

The suspect is described as white, aged mid 20s-early 30s, between 5ft 5 and 5ft 6 tall, of a stocky build, with black facial hair and wearing a dark hooded top and dark clothing.

We are appealing to anyone with any information, including anyone who might have seen either of them prior to the incident, to come forward. If you can help please contact us, quoting crime reference number PR/452001222739 via
