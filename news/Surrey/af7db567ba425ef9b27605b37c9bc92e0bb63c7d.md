Officers were reminded of how invaluable our four-legged colleagues are yesterday, when a police dog uncovered a bag of drugs hidden in woodland in Woking.

Officers were responding to a domestic call on Willow Way in Woking at around 10am yesterday (19 October).

After the suspect left the scene on a bike, a short chase ensued which lead officers into nearby woodland. The man was found but did not have the backpack he had been seen carrying. Police dog Ludo was sent in to look for it and within minutes, had located the backpack, which was hidden well within the brambles behind a fallen tree. The bag contained a passport, as well as a large amount of cannabis and weighing scales.

The suspect, an 18-year-old man from Woking, was arrested on suspicion of threats to kill and being concerned in the supply of class B and possession with intent to supply class B drugs. He has been released under investigation.

Investigating Officer PC James Webster said "We rely on our fantastic police dogs and their handlers on a daily basis and this is one example of many where we are so grateful for their expertise and assistance."
