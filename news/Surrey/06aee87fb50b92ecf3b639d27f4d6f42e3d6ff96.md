We'd like to speak to them in connection with a burglary in Englefield Green.

It happened at around 2pm on Thursday 12 March at a property on Vegel Crescent.

An investigation is currently underway and we are keen to speak to the two men pictured.

They are believed to have been in the area at around 10.30am and may have information which can assist with our enquiries.

If you know who these men are, or you have any other information that could help our investigation, please contact Surrey Police on 101 (999 in an emergency) quoting reference PR/45200028823.

You can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111; or through their anonymous online form:https://crimestoppers-uk.org/.
