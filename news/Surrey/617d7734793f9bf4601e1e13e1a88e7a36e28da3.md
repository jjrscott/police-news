Officers were called to the River Thames near Waterside Drive in Walton-on-Thames by a member of the public, following reports of a man's body in the water around 3.40pm yesterday afternoon (Friday 7 February).

Emergency services attended the scene and sadly the body of a man has been recovered from the river.

While the body has not been formally identified we believe it is connected to the search for Gary Peter Sturgess, aged 60, from St Neots in Cambridge, who went missing on January 18 earlier this year.

The family have been informed.

Formal identification will take place in due course.

The family wish for their privacy to be respected.
