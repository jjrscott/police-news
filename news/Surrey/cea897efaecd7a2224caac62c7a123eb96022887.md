At around 5:20pm on 19 April, we were called following reports of the discovery of a man at the side of the road in Newark Lane in Ripley.

The 62-year-old cyclist was treated by paramedics at the scene but was sadly pronounced dead shortly afterwards.

The man's next of kin are aware and our thoughts remain with them at this difficult time.

The road was closed for a couple of hours whilst the cyclist received medical assistance.

We are trying to establish the circumstances leading up to the cyclist's death. If you have any information or any dashcam footage which might help our investigation, please call 101 and quote reference PR/45200041063.
