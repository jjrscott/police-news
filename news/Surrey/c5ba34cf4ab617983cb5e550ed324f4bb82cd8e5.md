A body, believed to be that of missing man Hajo Roozendaal was found in a field near Ashtead last night (10 March).

Hajo, 45 was last seen on Tuesday evening.

Although formal identification is yet to take place, Hajo's family are aware and being given the appropriate support from specially trained officers. Our thoughts remain with them at this difficult time.

Enquiries are ongoing to establish the circumstances of the death, although it is not believed to be suspicious and there is no evidence of any third party involvement at this time.

We would like to thank everyone who shared our appeal and assisted with the search.
