We are appealing for witnesses after a woman was repeatedly deliberately driven at by a car and knocked off her pushbike, on Friday, 27 November, in Ashford.

The incident happened on the road outside of The District Arms pub around 9.50pm, following an argument between the victim and three men in a parked vehicle.

The suspects, who were unknown to the victim, then followed her in their car and drove at her a number of times.

The victim managed to get away but was left shaken and with minor injuries to her hands and legs.

Two of the suspects are described as white, of a slim build, and around 5ft 7". One of them was wearing a camouflage jacket and another was wearing a blue jumper.

PC McDonald, who is investigating, said: "This was a nasty and unpleasant incident which could have left the victim with much more serious injuries.

"We are appealing to anyone who may have been travelling in the area on that night and has any dashcam footage of the incident, to get in touch.

"It is also believed that one of the suspects recorded the incident, so if you have seen this footage we would like to talk to you."
