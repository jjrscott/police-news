We are appealing for witnesses following an altercation outside flats on Godstone Road, Whyteleafe on July 6.

Two men standing on the road in front of the flats were reported shouting abuse at one of the occupants in the flats at around 12.15pm.

The suspects arrived at the location in a large white van with yellow and green sign writing on the side.
