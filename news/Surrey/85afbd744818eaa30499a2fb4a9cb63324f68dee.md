A man has been arrested in Frimley on suspicion of catalytic converter theft.

Just after 1:30pm on Wednesday (10 March), a car using potentially cloned number plates was picked up by an Automated Number Plate Reader in Sandhurst.

Traffic units conducted an area search and the car was found with no occupants in the car park at Frimley Park Hospital. Two catalytic converters and some tools were recovered from the boot.

A 21-year-old man from Slough has been arrested on suspicion of theft and released on police conditional bail.
