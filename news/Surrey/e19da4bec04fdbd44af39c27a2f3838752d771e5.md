We are appealing for witnesses following a fire at a house in Epsom last week.

Officers were called to Gainsborough Road in Epsom at around at 10pm on Friday evening (2 October) following reports of a fire at a residential address.

No one was injured but the house was badly damaged.

An investigation is underway as the fire is believed to be deliberately started. We are appealing to anyone who may have witnessed anything suspicious in the area to come forward with any information.
