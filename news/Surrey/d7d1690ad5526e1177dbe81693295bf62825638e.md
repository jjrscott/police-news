Did you help a 28 year-old man on Portsmouth Road in Guildford at around 7pm on Thursday 27 February?

The man was treated for a cut to his head after he reported that he was struck from behind by a vehicle. We're keen to speak to the member of the public who subsequently helped him to establish what happened. The collision is believed to have happened close to St Catherine's footpath at around 7pm.

If you saw what happened please call 101 quoting PR/ 45200023488.

Alternatively, if you do not wish to leave your name, call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
