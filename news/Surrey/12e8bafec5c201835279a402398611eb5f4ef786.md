A 16-year-old boy is in custody after being arrested on suspicion of harassment earlier today (12 November), following an incident at a Camberley school.

Officers attended Ravenscote School in Camberley following reports that the boy had gained access to the school grounds.

The same teenager was arrested last week for similar incidents at Heather Ridge Infant School in Camberley on Monday, 2 November, following reports of a boy repeatedly offering his vape to pupils. A second report at the same school of a boy matching the same description who was acting suspiciously was reported on Wednesday, 4 November.

PC Dan Lomas, who is investigating the case, said: "This type of behaviour can understandably cause a significant amount of concern for the school children involved, the teachers and the parents.

"We would like to reassure the local community that any form of harassment will not be tolerated by Surrey Police and we are working with the schools to ensure a thorough investigation is conducted.

"We would like to encourage the reporting of these kinds of suspicious incidents as this kind of information from the public can help us identify those responsible and ensure they are dealt with."
