Sometimes you can just be in the wrong place at the wrong time, as jailed drug dealer Alexandre George Hendy, 24, of Northwood Avenue, Knaphill now knows.

In the early afternoon of Wednesday, 4 September 2019, a group of uniformed police officers were standing outside HMP Coldingley in Bisley when they noticed a black Audi A4 driving towards nearby houses. Seemingly upon seeing the police officers, and no doubt getting that sinking feeling that his day at the 'office' was about to take a turn for the worse, the Audi driver, Hendy, stopped in the middle of the road, turned the car around and drove away.

Curiosity aroused, police drove after the car. They noted erratic driving and then when he was stopped, fidgety behaviour from Hendy. The car was searched under section 23 of the misuse of drugs act and a large amount of cocaine was found in a small bag in the passenger footwell, alongside a set of digital scales and a number of empty bags. There was also a bag of white powder in the car's centre console.

Last week at Guildford Crown Court, Hendy was sentenced to two years and eight months in jail for possession with intent to supply class A drugs.

Officer in charge PC David Oliver says: "We often proactively patrol drug dealing hotspots, but sometimes it can be a piece of good luck and being in the right place at the right time that leads to an arrest.

"How ever it happens, it is always satisfying to see someone dealing class A drugs on the county's streets get a custodial sentence."
