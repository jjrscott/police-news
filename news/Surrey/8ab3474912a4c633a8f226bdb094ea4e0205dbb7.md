The case against a serving Surrey Police Community Support Officer has been dismissed after she was found not guilty of racially aggravated harassment at Brighton Magistrates' Court on Wednesday (9 October).

The charge against 34-year-old PCSO Danielle Carter related to an alleged offence that took place on December 1, 2018 in Reigate.

Following the conclusion of the criminal process, the circumstances of the case have been reviewed by Surrey Police's Professional Standard's Department which has determined no internal misconduct process is required.
