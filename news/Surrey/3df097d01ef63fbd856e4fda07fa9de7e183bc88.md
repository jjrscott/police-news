We are appealing for witnesses following an incident of indecent exposure in Brookwood County Park in Woking.

At approximately 8am today (14 May), a man approached the female victim and exposed himself. He began to follow the woman who ran away to the car park where she alerted other members of the public and contacted the police.

The male suspect is described as olive skinned, aged between late 20s to late 40s, around 5ft 7 tall, of average build with short dark hair and slight facial hair. He was wearing dark clothing and a puffa jacket. We believe he may be Eastern European or Turkish.

If you witnessed this incident or have any information which might help this investigation, please call 101 and quote ref PR/45200049701.
