We are appealing for witnesses following a fatal collision on the A31 at Runfold last night (16 October).

The collision, involving four vehicles, including a moped, took place around 9.35pm on the eastbound carriageway.

The male rider of the moped was sadly pronounced dead at the scene. His next of kin have been informed.

No one else was injured as a result of the collision.

Emergency services, including fire and ambulance crews, remain at the scene and the road is currently closed on the eastbound carriageway at the Shepherd and Flock roundabout, on the westbound carriageway between the A31 and the A331. St George's Road is also closed between the bridge and the junction with Guildford Road.

The road closures are likely to be in place for several hours, and motorists are advised to seek an alternative route.

Anyone who witnessed the collision, or a white moped being driven prior to the incident taking place, particularly anyone with any dashcam footage, is asked to contact us straightaway on 101, quoting incident reference PR/P19240272.
