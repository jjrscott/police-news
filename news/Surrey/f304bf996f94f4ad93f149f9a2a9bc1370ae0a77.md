Police are looking for the owner of this necklace, which was recovered recently after an attempted burglary in Tadworth.

On Tuesday 16 February at around 9.30pm, a man called at a house on Burgh Heath in Tadworth. He claimed that his ball was in the occupant's back garden, and asked if he could come into her house in order to retrieve it. She refused and told him to come back the following day. When the occupant woke up the next morning, she found the side gate to her property open.

This necklace was found in the porch of this house. It does not belong to the occupant, and we believe that it may have been stolen in a burglary. We are trying to trace the owner, but if you recognise it and think that it belongs to you or someone you know, please get in touch.
