Do you recognise the man in these images?

We're releasing CCTV images of a man who we believe could help us with our investigation into an incident of fraud.

A sum of around £1000 has been withdrawn from the 89-year-old victim's bank account over the course of a month.

The withdrawals took place on a number of dates at various locations in Redhill.

The man seen in the CCTV images may be able to help us with our investigation.

If you know him or have any information which could help, please get in contact with us, quoting PR/45200075385 via:

• Webchat on our website surrey.police.uk

• Online https://www.surrey.police.uk/ro/report/ocr/af/how-to-report-a-crime/

• Calling us on 101

If you do not wish to leave your name, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
