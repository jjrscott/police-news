Thank you for sharing our CCTV image appeal on Friday following damage to the Runnymede Borough Council offices in Addlestone on Wednesday (15 April).

A man aged in his twenties has subsequently been issued with a Community Resolution in relation to this matter.

Please don't share our original appeal any further

As always your help in getting the word out about our appeals is very much appreciated.
