A Camberley man is behind bars for 20 months after he pleaded guilty to assault after complaining about the noise at his neighbour's barbecue in September 2019.

Samuel Amuni, 23, of Alsace Walk, Camberley, entered the guilty plea to assault occasioning actual bodily harm and having an article with a blade when he appeared at Guildford Crown Court earlier this month.

The assault occurred during a social gathering at an address in Alsace Walk on the evening of 7 September. Around 10.40pm, the next door neighbours complained about the noise. Shortly afterwards, Amuni, kicked open a gate and entered the rear garden. He was described as wearing gardening gloves and was carrying an aluminium baseball bat and a large, machete-style knife.

Amuni swung both weapons at a man standing in the garden, striking him in the right shoulder with the baseball bat and causing a cut to his wrist with the machete. Other people at the gathering managed to restrain Amuni before calling police, and he was arrested.

Surrey Heath Borough Commander Inspector Bob Darkens said: "From an initial complaint about the noise, this quickly escalated into violence and could have had far more serious consequences had Amuni been allowed to continue unchecked. This case is the result of a full and thorough investigation and demonstrates that we will not condone violent behaviour of this nature in our local communities."
