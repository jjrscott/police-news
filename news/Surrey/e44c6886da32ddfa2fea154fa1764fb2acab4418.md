We are appealing for witnesses after a man was violently assaulted on York Road, Woking, and left with serious injuries.

Officers were called to the scene following reports of a fight taking place at around 8pm on Wednesday, 11 November.

On arrival at the scene the suspects had fled the area and the victim was taken to hospital with serious injuries including severe concussion.

Detective Sergeant Emma Broad said: "This was a violent attack which took place in a public place so we are hoping someone might have seen something. We are aware that the incident was also filmed on Snapchat and are asking people to stop sharing the video.

"These incidents are not acceptable and will not be tolerated by Surrey Police. Officers are conducting a thorough investigation and would like to speak to anyone who may have information."

Two men aged 19 and 17 from Woking, have been arrested on suspicion of assault causing grievous bodily harm and released on police bail. The investigation is ongoing.
