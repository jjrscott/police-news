We are appealing for witnesses following an attempt burglary at an address in Guildford Road in Bagshot.

At around 8:50pm, the 81-year-old female victim noticed someone outside her front door. When she opened the door, the suspect said he was a police officer and gained entry to her house by saying there had recently been burglaries in the area.

He searched the victim's house but did not take anything, He also tried to gain entry to a neighbouring property before making off.

The suspect is believed to be white, in his 40s, around 5ft 7 tall, and clean shaven. He was wearing black clothes at the time of the incident.

Surrey Heath PC Daniel Lomas, said: "This was clearly a crime targeting elderly residents. The suspect pretended to be a police officer to gain the victim's trust and get into her home. Someone will know who the offender is, and I would appeal to you to please come forward so we can prevent this from happening again."

If you recognise the suspect shown in the E-fit or if you have any information which might help us with this investigation, please call 101 and quote reference PR/45200023471. You can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111; or online at https://crimestoppers-uk.org/.
