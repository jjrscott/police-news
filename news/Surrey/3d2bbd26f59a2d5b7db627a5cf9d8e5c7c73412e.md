We have released images from CCTV footage of two men we would like to speak to in connection with a burglary at a residential property in Guildford on Wednesday 15 January.

Between 5.30 and 6.30pm, two men approached a property on Woking Road and gained entry to the property by smashing a rear UPVC door window.

The first suspect was wearing a light coloured tracksuit with his hood up, black gloves and trainers, believed to be Nike Air Max's. The second suspect was wearing a light coloured hoodie, dark coloured tracksuit bottoms with three light coloured stripes down the side and possibly flip flops or sliders.

PC Phil Dagnall, of the Guildford Neighbourhood Policing Team said: "A dark blue Skoda Octavia saloon car on a '60' registration may also be connected.

"If you think you have any information about who these two suspects could be or if you saw anything on Monday evening which could help us, please contact us.

"I would encourage the public to follow our safety advice on how you can keep your home safe and help prevent burglars entering your home and taking your belongings. For more advice, please visit our website https://www.surrey.police.uk/burglary ."
