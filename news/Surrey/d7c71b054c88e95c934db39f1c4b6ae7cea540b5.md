A 16-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of harassment, following two separate incidents at Heather Ridge Infant School in Camberley last week.

Officers were called on Monday, 2 November following reports of a boy repeatedly offering his vape to pupils.

A second incident was reported on Wednesday, 4 November and involved a boy matching the same description acting suspiciously.

Officers attended the location and arrested a teenage boy on suspicion of harassment.

PC Johnny Harris, who is investigating the case, said: "This type of behaviour can understandably cause a significant amount of concern for the school children involved, the teachers and the parents.

"We would like to reassure the local community that any form of harassment will not be tolerated by Surrey Police and we are working with the school to ensure a thorough investigation is conducted."

The boy has been released under investigation and enquiries remain ongoing.
