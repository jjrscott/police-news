We are appealing for witnesses following a sexual assault in Goldsworth Park, Woking, last weekend.

At approximately 8.30am on Saturday, 2 November, a man was spotted standing in a bush with his trousers below his hips. It was presumed the man was urinating by the pathway leading to Tresillian Way.

A couple of minutes later a woman was sexually assaulted by a man, who is believed to be the same man seen in the bush, near the alley way between Perley Brooke Lane and St Andrews Church leading up towards Waitrose.

The man is described as a tanned male, of slim build, approximately 5ft. 7 inches tall, believed to be in his early 30's, with a small amount of dark brown stubble. The man is believed to be either Polish or of Eastern European descent.

At the time of the incident he was wearing a dark grey/black waterproof coat, with grey panels down the side, dark blue / black tracksuit bottoms, trainers, and a cap on under his hood.

We are carrying out several enquiries to establish the circumstances of this incident and we are appealing to anyone who was in the area around the time of the offence, or anyone with any other information, to come forward. If you can help, please call us on 101, quoting crime reference number PR/45190117031.

You can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form: www.crimestoppers-uk.org
