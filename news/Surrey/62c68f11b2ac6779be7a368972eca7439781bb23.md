We are appealing for witnesses following an incident involving a horse and rider on Saturday (4 April).

Police were called to Gangers Hill around 4.30pm following the incident. The female rider was taken to hospital with serious injuries.

Unfortunately, she died in hospital on 6 April, as a result of the injuries she sustained.

Our thoughts are with her friends and family at this time.

The horse sadly had to be put down at the scene following the incident.

We are appealing to anyone who may have seen what happened or who has any other information, including any dashcam footage, to contact us on 101, quoting reference number P20075656.
