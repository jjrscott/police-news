We are appealing for witnesses following the assault of a man in Epsom in the early hours of Saturday (31 October).

The incident occurred at approximately 12:40am on Reigate Road, Epsom, and left the victim with blackened swollen eyes, cuts and pain to his wrist.

The victim was walking towards Ewell Downs Road with his wife when he was assaulted in an unprovoked attack. The two suspects pulled him to the floor and began kicking him, before fleeing the area.

The two suspects are described as:

Male 1: White, 5ft 10 tall, slim build, gingery-blonde hair, wearing dark jumper.

Male 2: White, 5ft 8 tall, slim build, brown hair, wearing black and grey long-sleeved top and faded blue jeans.
