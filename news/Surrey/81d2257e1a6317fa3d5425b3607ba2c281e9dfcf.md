Two teenage boys have been arrested following a robbery in Staines-upon-Thames last Thursday afternoon (2 January).

The two victims were walking down by the river in Bridge Street around 2pm when they were chased by three suspects, who were described as wearing balaclavas.

One of the suspects threatened the victims with a knife before demanding that they hand over their mobile phones and a quantity of jewellery. One of the victims was also pushed to the ground and kicked.

The two suspects, aged 15 years and 14 years, both from Hounslow, were located nearby shortly afterwards and were arrested on suspicion of robbery and possession of an offensive weapon. They were interviewed and have been released under investigation.

The third suspect remains outstanding.
