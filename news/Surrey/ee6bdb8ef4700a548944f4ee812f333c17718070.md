We're appealing for witnesses after staff members at Sainsbury's on Redding Way, Woking, were subjected to verbal and racist abuse and threatening behaviour.

The incident occurred on 9 February at around 11.30am after staff asked two people to wear their masks in the store. The two suspects then proceeded to verbally abuse them and behave in an intimidating manner.

The suspects are a man and a woman who are described as white, with an English accent and in their late 60s. The woman is of a stocky build, around 5ft 4 inches tall and was wearing a long dark fluffy coat. The man is of a slim build, around 6ft 1 inches tall and was wearing a short dark coat and jeans.

We have released CCTV images of two people we would like to speak to in connection with the incident. If you recognise either of them, or you witnessed this incident, or you have any other information which could help, please get in touch with us as soon as possible.

Investigating Officer, PC Florie Chiriac, said: "This type of behaviour is utterly unacceptable, especially given that the victims were just doing their job. Wearing a face mask in supermarkets is mandatory (unless you are exempt), and we all have a role to play in limiting the spread of this deadly virus and keeping each other as safe as possible.

Racist abuse of this nature has no place in our local communities and will simply not be tolerated."
