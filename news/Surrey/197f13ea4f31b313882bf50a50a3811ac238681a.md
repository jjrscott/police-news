We are appealing for witnesses after two men working at a hand car wash in Upper High Street Car Park were subjected to threats and racist abuse.

At approximately 12.09pm last Tuesday (22 October), a dark coloured BMW entered the open air public car park from the Upper High Street entrance and on passing the local hand car wash, stopped and entered into a racially aggravated verbal argument with two of the staff.

The driver of the BMW then drove around the car park and returned to the car wash to continue making threats and allegedly got out and threatened staff with a knife.

The BMW driver was described as being a man in his 30s with short, black cropped hair and of a large athletic build with tattoos on his neck and hands.

The car is believed to be a dark coloured BMW 1 Series hatchback or similar.

**Were you parked in the car park or getting your car cleaned at the time? Did you hear or see a loud argument involving staff from the car wash located at the Upper High Street entrance?**

If so, you may have vital information or dashcam footage which could help us.

Please call 101 or report online (www.surrey.police.uk/ro/report/) quoting reference number PR/45190112192 with any information you may have.

If you'd prefer not to speak to police, you can give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form (www.crimestoppers-uk.org/).

Hate crime will not be tolerated in Surrey. Surrey's profile of hate crime is constantly developing and we rely on those affected coming forward and making reports.

Victims having the confidence in both themselves and us to make reports is incredibly important if we are to know the true extent of hate crime in our county.

If you have been a victim of hate crime yourself, please make a report, either by calling 101 (999 in an emergency), call the Stop Hate UK helpline on 0800 138 1625 or download the Surrey Stop Hate UK app on the Apple and Google app stores.

Please don't suffer in silence.
