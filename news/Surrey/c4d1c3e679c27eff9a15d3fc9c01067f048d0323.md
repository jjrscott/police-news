We're appealing for witnesses following a serious collision in Bagshot this morning (30 January) involving a car and pedestrian.

Officers were flagged down and directed to the A30 London Road, close to the junction with Jenkins Hill, at 08.53 after a collision between a driver and an elderly man. Sadly, despite the efforts of the police officers and ambulance crew, the pedestrian passed away at the scene. The driver is being assessed by medical professionals.

The A30 will remain closed between the American Golf roundabout and the junction of the A30 with Lambourne drive while specialist collision investigation officers carry out their work. Drivers should divert via the B3015 (the Maultway), the B311 (Red road) and A322.

If you witnessed the collision or may have CCTV or dashcam footage of the incident, you should make contact with the Surrey Police contact centre via the "Live Chat" function on www.surrey.police.uk, or via private chat on Facebook or Twitter, quoting the reference number PR/P21020540. You can also call us on 101, asking for Surrey Police.
