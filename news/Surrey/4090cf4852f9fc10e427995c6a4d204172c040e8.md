We are pleased to announce that a missing teenage girl from Redhill was found late last night. Thank you to everyone who shared our appeal.

We are pleased to share that a missing 15 year old girl from Redhill, who had not been since Thursday evening (March 12), was located overnight (early hours of March 14).

Thank you to everyone who shared our appeal we really appreciate all the help you give us when someone goes missing. We now ask that you remove or delete any references to the girl so that she can regain some sense of normalcy and we can restore her privacy, and that of the family.
