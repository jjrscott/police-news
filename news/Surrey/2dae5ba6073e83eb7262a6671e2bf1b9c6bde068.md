We are appealing for witnesses following an aggravated burglary in Warlingham in the early hours today (25 February).

Officers were called to a residential address in Fern Close at around 2.38am following reports of three men breaking in. The occupants woke up to find two persons wearing balaclavas in their hallway. The victim chased them out onto the driveway and sustained minor injuries before one of the suspects made off in the victim's car, a blue Ford Focus, and the other two suspects made off on foot. The victim was given medical treatment at the scene.

Shortly before this, CCTV picked up what is believed to be the three suspects at two other addresses nearby. At one address they appeared to be trying car door handles on a driveway in Chapel Road. They also appeared to be trying to gain entry to another address in Crowborough Drive.

The suspects are described as three white men in dark clothing and wearing balaclavas. They were believed to be carrying weapons or tools.

We are appealing for your help in identifying and tracing the suspects involved. If you recognise any of the men in these CCTV images, we want to hear from you.

Do you live in Warlingham? Would your CCTV cameras or dashboard cameras have captured any part of these offences? Were you travelling overnight, perhaps on the way to or from work? Did you see a blue Ford Focus being driven through Warlingham any time after 02:30am?
