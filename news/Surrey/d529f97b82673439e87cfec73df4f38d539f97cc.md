Police have arrested two men following a 20 minute high-speed pursuit across North Surrey late last night.

Officers spotted a black Honda Civic, that had previously failed to stop for police, in Seven Hills Road, Cobham at around 23:20. The officers signalled to the vehicle to stop, but it made off at speed towards the Brooklands area.

A senior officer authorised a pursuit, and the vehicle was followed through Weybridge, Walton on Thames, over Hampton Court bridge, into Lower Sunbury and Lower Halliford. The vehicle eventually came to a stop at 23:40 in Dunboe Place, Shepperton, where the occupants of the vehicle decamped and the 18 year old driver, along with one of the passengers, were arrested.

Inspector Paul McDowell said:

"The decision to pursue a vehicle is not one we take lightly. At all times the safety of the public, our officers, and the individuals in the car was our utmost priority.

In order to safely conclude the pursuit we were assisted by police dog handlers from both Surrey Police and the Metropolitan Police, along with a large number of police units (including armed police acting as unarmed officers) and the National Police Helicopter.

We appreciate that this operation will have caused significant concern locally and we are grateful to the people of Elmbridge and Spelthorne for their understanding and support."

We are aware of a number of parked cars that were damaged by the vehicle during the pursuit. We'd ask anyone who believes that their vehicle may have been damaged to contact us using the online reporting system on our website quoting reference PR/45200077340.
