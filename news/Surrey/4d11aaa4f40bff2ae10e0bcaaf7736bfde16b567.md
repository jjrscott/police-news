We are asking people in Staines and Egham to be on their guard after four similar sexual assaults were reported to us in the last six months.

In each case, the latest of which was Friday, 29 January, a young man approached a woman and sexually assaulted the victim by touching her. The man was either on foot or on a black e-scooter.

The man is described as white, around 17 years old and five feet seven inches tall with a slim build. In the most recent report he was wearing a long black parka style coat and grey camouflage tracksuit bottoms.

PC Jamie Dickie, who is investigating says: "We believe the assaults to have been committed by the same person because the scenario is similar in each case.

"Our advice is always that if a situation feels worrying, trust your instincts and look for a way to put distance between yourself and the other person. Call the police as soon as it is safe to."

If you can help us identify the man, please contact us through the live chat on surrey.police.uk, quoting PR/45210009785, or send us a private message on Facebook or Twitter. If you would prefer not to give your name, you can talk to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
