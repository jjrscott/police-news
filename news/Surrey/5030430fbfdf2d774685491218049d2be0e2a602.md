Surrey Police is appealing for witnesses following a fatal collision in Ash Vale this morning (May 14).

Officers were called to Vale Road at around 11.08am after a report of a collision between a white Kia and two pedestrians.

The pedestrians, a couple in their 70's, were crossing the road when they were in collision with the Kia.

Both pedestrians were taken to Frimley Park Hospital. The male pedestrian sustained serious head injuries and sadly died later in hospital.

Surrey Police is appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the collision or the moments leading up to it to come forward. Officers are particularly keen to speak to the driver of a white van that was behind the Kia at the time of the collision.

Anyone with information or dashcam footage is asked to call Surrey Police on 101 quoting reference P20109600.
