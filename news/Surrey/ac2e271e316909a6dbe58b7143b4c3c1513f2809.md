Two men were arrested on suspicion of various offences following a police pursuit on Saturday night (16 May).

Officers were on patrol around 10.50pm in Tanhouse Lane, Oxted, when they spotted a vehicle, believed to be connected to rural crime. As they attempted to stop the vehicle, one of the occupants began throwing bricks out of the window, causing damage to the police car. The vehicle was brought to a stop and both occupants were detained. Following a search of the vehicle, a number of paving slabs, believed to be stolen, were found.

A 21-year-old man from Godstone was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving, failing to stop, theft of a motor vehicle, criminal damage, theft, driving a vehicle otherwise than in accordance with a licence and possession of cannabis.

A 21-year-old man from Lingfield was arrested on suspicion of aggravated vehicle-taking, criminal damage and assaulting an emergency worker.

Both men have been released under investigation and enquiries remain ongoing.

Chief Inspector Mike Hodder from Surrey Police's Roads Policing Unit and Rural Crime Lead said: ''Our officers are always out proactively targeting those who target our rural communities.

"In this particular instance, those involved made a determined effort to escape so much so that they put police officers' lives at risk by throwing bricks at their vehicle.

"Undeterred, the officers pursued the vehicle and detained the two occupants, as well as recovering a large quantity of paving slabs.

"I want to reassure the public that we will continue to target those who cause misery and loss to our rural communities."
