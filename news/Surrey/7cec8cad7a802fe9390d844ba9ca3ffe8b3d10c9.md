We are appealing for witnesses and dash camera footage from the Horley area last night after an incident in Ladbroke Road.

A 17 year old woman left her home for a walk at around 10pm on Saturday 22 August, and sometime later became aware of a man behind her as she walked north along Balcombe Road from the Kings Head junction (with Smallfield Road) towards the Shell Garage Roundabout. The man is believed to have followed her into Ladbroke Road, where he asked if she wanted him to accompany her home. When she refused he grabbed towards her, leaving her with a number of scratches.

The man is described as having a tanned complexion, with short hair. He is around 5'10" tall, or skinny build and was wearing a leather jacket and jeans. He had a local accent.

Neighbourhood officers have been visiting homes and businesses in the area conducting house to house enquiries and reviewing CCTV. Police are keen to trace the man involved, as well as narrow down the time frame for the incident.

We are keen to speak to anyone that was walking, riding or driving along the B2036 (Balcombe Road) or Ladbroke Road; between 10pm last night and 01:30am this morning. Of particular interest is anyone who has any footage (mobile phone, CCTV, dashcam or helmet-cam footage) from the route between those two times - even if you believe it does not show the man (as this may still help to focus the time frame).

Anyone who believes that they may be able to assist with the investigation is asked to contact police using the chat or report online functions on surrey.police.uk or via 101, quoting reference PR/45200089153.
