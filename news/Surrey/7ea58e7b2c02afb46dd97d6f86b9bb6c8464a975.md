Counter Terrorism Policing has launched a campaign to help keep crowded places secure over the festive period.

Officers are calling on the public and those who work in our busy towns and cities to remain vigilant and report any concerns to staff, security or - in confidence - to the police at https://act.campaign.gov.uk/.

This annual campaign asks everyone to be the extra eyes and ears of the police, so we can work together to tackle terrorism.

Assistant Chief Constable Dave Miller, Head of the Surrey and Sussex Police Operations Command, said: "We are asking everyone out and about enjoying the season to put security at the top of their festive list.

"The chances of any one person being caught up in a terrorist incident are low. But sadly, as we saw in 2017 and even at the end of last month, attacks can be carried out anywhere and anytime.

"The national threat level remains Substantial, meaning an attack is likely, so we need to remain vigilant.

"Our message to people across Surrey and Sussex is not to worry that you might be wasting our time. If you see something that doesn't look right - ACT. Report it either to local security or staff - or to police at https://act.campaign.gov.uk/ or via 999 if it is clearly an emergency - and let us check it out.

The campaign is being supported by police forces across the country. We are not running this campaign because of any particular threat in Surrey or Sussex.

"A few minutes of your time could be a precious gift that helps saves lives. Please be a good CT citizen this festive period."

 * We are asking everyone out and about over the festive period to be a good CT citizen - to remain vigilant and if they see something that concerns them to ACT.
 * The chances of any one person being caught up in a terrorism incident are low but the national threat level remains Substantial, meaning an attack is likely. So we all must remain alert, not alarmed.
 * We are also asking for businesses and other organisations that operate in crowded places across our region to support us by displaying our messages.
 * We are particularly encouraging members of the public visiting busy towns and cities, or staff who work in crowded places, to be aware of our message.
 * If you see something that doesn't look right, report it to local security, a member of staff or to police - in confidence - https://act.campaign.gov.uk/) or by calling 999.
