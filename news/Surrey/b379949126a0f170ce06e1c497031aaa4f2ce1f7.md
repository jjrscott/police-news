We are appealing for witnesses following an assault and attempted robbery in Ewell on Thursday, 3 December.

Officers were called to Cheam Road following reports of an assault which took place at some point between 2.25pm and 2.35pm. The victim was approached by three suspects who tried to grab his bike and assaulted him multiple times, leaving him with bruises to his face.

The first suspect has been described as a white male, around 16 years old, of slim build and wearing a black or navy coat with a hoodie underneath and tracksuit bottoms. His hood was up but he had light blond hair.

The second suspect was also described as a white male, aged around 15 years and of a slim build. He was wearing a dark coat, dark hoodie and dark tracksuit bottoms. He also had his hood up and had light coloured hair.

The third suspect was described as a dual heritage male, aged between 15 and 16 years old and of slim build. He was wearing a dark coat, dark hoodie and dark tracksuit bottoms. He had his hood up but had dark curly hair.

PC Stuart Glover of the Epsom and Ewell Proactive Team said: "We are appealing to anyone who may have any more information to come forward. This incident happened during broad daylight and it's likely it would have been seen by quite a few people."
