We're appealing for witnesses after a collision involving three vehicles on the M3 earlier this evening.

Officers were called to reports of a collision between a HGV, van and a blue Peugeot at junction three of the M3 northbound at around 6.30pm today (18 January).

Three people have been taken to hospital, with one person receiving life threatening injuries.

The road remains closed for the foreseeable future and we ask people to please avoid the area for the time being.

If you were driving on the M3 around this time and believe you may have dashcam footage of the vehicles involved, or if you witnessed the incident, please contact us quoting P21012114 via:
