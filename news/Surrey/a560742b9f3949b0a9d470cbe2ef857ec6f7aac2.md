A man has appeared in court following an incident in Gatley Avenue, Ewell, on Friday evening (June 26).

Damian Dolor, 42, from Epsom, pleaded guilty to racially aggravated disorderly behaviour with intent to cause harassment, alarm or distress under section 4A of the Public Order Act when he appeared at Guildford Magistrates' Court yesterday (29 June).

He has been released on bail and will be required to wear an electronic tag pending sentencing, which will take place on 14 August.

East Surrey Chief Superintendent Clive Davies said: "We appreciate that there was a great deal of disturbance in the vicinity of Gatley Avenue on Friday night and we are grateful to the local community for their understanding and support while we dealt with this incident."
