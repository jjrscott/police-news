We are appealing for witnesses after a victim was attacked on 22 June in Guildford.

The victim was walking around the back of the Odeon Cinema complex on Bedford Road when he was followed by the suspects.

The male suspect then attacked the victim repeatedly punching him in the face leaving him with facial injuries which required hospital treatment.

One of the suspects has been described as a white male of slim build in his 30's with short brown gelled hair. He was wearing a light blue or green short sleeved t-shirt with a 'Y' on the front and three buttons down from the collar. The top had a different colour lining to the neckline and sleeves. He was possibly wearing shorts.

The female suspect was white, in her 40's or 50's and of large build.

If you witnessed this incident or have any CCTV footage which might help this investigation, please call 101 and quote ref PR/45200064219. Alternatively, if you prefer to remain anonymous, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 11.
