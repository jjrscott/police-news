We are appealing for witnesses after a woman was subjected to a sexual assault at a park in Dorking yesterday evening (21 October).

An investigation is underway into the offence, which is believed to have taken place sometime between 9.30pm and 10.10pm at the Meadowbank park in Mill Lane.

A cordon was in place and a number of pathways leading into the park were closed while we carry out further enquiries.

We are appealing to anyone who was in the area at the time and may have seen something suspicious, or anyone with any further information, to contact us as a matter of urgency.
