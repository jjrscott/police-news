We've charged a 26 year-old man in connection with our investigation into an assault that took place close to the exit inside Thorpe Park on Staines Road in Chertsey on Saturday 18 July shortly before 4:55pm.

Two groups of people were involved in an altercation on the bridge close to the exit and a 26 year-old man was subsequently treated for an injury to his stomach. He is now recovering at home. No-one else was hurt.

Craig Harakh of Jeffreys Road in Lambeth, London has been charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent and possession of an offensive weapon as part of our investigation.

He has been remanded to appear at Staines Magistrates' Court via videolink on 22 July 2020.
