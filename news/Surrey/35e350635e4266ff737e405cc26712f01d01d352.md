We're releasing CCTV images of two men we'd like to speak to in connection with a fight in Camberley on 16 September.

Officers were called to reports of a group of young men fighting on Park Street at around 4.40pm.

Upon police arrival, the group had dispersed. Two men were treated at the scene for their injuries.

An 18-year-old man from Camberley was arrested on suspicion of robbery and affray and has been released under investigation.

We think that the two men seen in the CCTV images might be able to help us with our investigation.
