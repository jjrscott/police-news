We are continuing to appeal for witnesses after two men were assaulted in Camberley (Wednesday, 16 September).

Surrey Police received calls at around 4:40pm of reports that two men were attacked by a group of three men as they left the Pure Gym in Park Street, Camberley. The fight is reported to have ended after less than a minute with both the suspects and victims dispersing quickly.

This appears to have been a targeted attack and while there have been reports of one of the suspects carrying a knife, this appears to have been used to threaten, rather than injure, during the attack.

It is also possible that the suspects may have disposed of the knife, and we'd ask anyone who may have seen this happen in the local area, or may have found a knife locally, to get in contact as it could be vital evidence.

We are keen to speak to anyone who witnessed the attack, and has not yet spoken with us, as we make fast-time enquiries to arrest the three men responsible.

If you saw, or recorded, the fight; if you know the identity of the suspects (or outstanding victim); or if you know where they are now, please contact Surrey Police quoting crime reference number PR/P20217560 via:

 * Live chat function on the Surrey police website http://surrey.police.uk
 * Online https://www.surrey.police.uk/ro/report/ocr/af/how-to-report-a-crime/
 * Call on 101

If you do not wish to leave your name, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111
