We're releasing images of items that we believe may be stolen in an effort to reunite them with their owners.

The items have been recovered as part of an ongoing burglary investigation in the London area linked to Surrey and Sussex.

The items include:

 * A large assortment of coins
 * Brown box labelled 'Jay's Brighton. The County Jewellers. 56, King's Road'.

If you were the victim of a burglary and recognise any of the below items, please contact us via webchat on our website or by calling 101 and quoting the crime reference number PR/ 45200025501.

We'd like to take this opportunity to remind you of the following crime prevention advice:

 * Register your valuables using an accredited property database.
 * Take photographs and keep documents like receipts related to your property so you can prove ownership.
