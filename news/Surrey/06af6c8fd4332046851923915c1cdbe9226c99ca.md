Assisting with a search is all in a day's work for Police Dog (PD) Gunny and his handler.

A police dog comes with lots of specialist skills. A loud bark, fast paws, a sharp bite (when necessary). But there is perhaps one skill that they are valued for above all othersâ€¦their nose. With a sense of smell believed to be more than 10,000 times stronger than humans, our police dogs can be trained to track people, blood, drugs and weapons.

PD Gunny's nose was required to track down some property discarded during a police pursuit in Hersham Road in Walton-on-Thames in the early hours of Monday (15 February). Gunny made quick work of the search, and helped to locate a mobile phone and a bag nearby.

PC Sanders, PD Gunny's handler, said: "It's always good to get a result on a live incident, it's what we train the dogs to do and when the missing physical evidence is located, these results strengthen the investigation process."
