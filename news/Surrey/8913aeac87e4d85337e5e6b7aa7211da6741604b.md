We are continuing to appeal for witnesses following a serious sexual assault in Woking at the end of April.

The assault took place in Wisley Lane sometime between 8 and 9.30pm on Monday, 27 April.

The area is popular with dog walkers and we would like to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time and may have seen something suspicious.

A 52-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the incident and has been released on conditional bail while our enquiries continue.

Detective Sergeant Andy Cooper said: "I would like to reassure the local community that we believe the suspect and the victim are known to each other and that we have already made an arrest in connection with the incident. We would like to reassure the public that we are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.

"We know that the area is popular with walkers and we are hopeful that someone may have seen something which could be useful to our investigation. If you have any information which might help, please come forward straightaway."

If you can help, please contact us on 101 quoting crime reference number PR/45200044733. Alternatively, if you do not wish to leave your name, please the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
