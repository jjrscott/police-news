We're investigating a report of a fail to stop collision where a 29 year-old woman said she was clipped by a vehicle before falling and injuring her head on the Street in Wrecclesham on Thursday 16 January at around 9pm.

The vehicle, which was described as dark, did not stop where the woman was injured, around 50 meters prior to the roundabout at the junction of Wrecclesham Road and School Hill. The woman was treated at hospital for injuries to her head, including a broken jaw and cuts and bruises.

Officers have been carrying out enquiries in the area and reviewing CCTV. We are now appealing for anyone who saw what happened to contact us.

Please call Surrey Police on 101 (999 in an emergency) quoting P20012901.
