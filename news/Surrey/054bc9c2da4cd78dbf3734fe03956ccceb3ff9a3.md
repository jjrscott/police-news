Detectives investigating the murder of Phillip Bagwell in Leatherhead in the early hours of 10 June are renewing their appeal for people who were driving in the area at the time to come forward - particularly if they have dash-cam or helmet-cam footage.

CCTV footage shows a number of vehicles driving along North Street and Station Road (the one-way system) in Leatherhead between 2 and 4am on Wednesday 10 June. Officers are keen to speak to anyone who was in that area at that time as they may provide information relevant to the enquiry. In particular there is a white van shown on CCTV driving along Station Road at around 3am, which officers are keen to trace.

DCI Chris Friday said "We are looking to trace all vehicles in the area between 2 and 4am including the occupants of a white van as they may have witnessed what happened, but may not have realised the significance of what they saw at the time.

I am also keen to identify any dash-cam or helmet-cam footage from North Street and Station Road from the early hours of 10 June, between 2 and 4am.

It was an unusual time of day for people to be driving, so I am hope that this appeal may jog some memories.".
Anyone who was in the North Street and Station Road area between 2am and 4am on Wednesday 10 June, and has not already spoken to officers, is asked to call Surrey Police on 101, quoting ref PR/45200059647.

A 32 year old man from Leatherhead has been charged with murder. He is next due to appear in Guildford Crown Court on 13 July.
