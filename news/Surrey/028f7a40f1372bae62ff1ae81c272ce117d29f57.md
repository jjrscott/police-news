We're appealing for witnesses following a serious collision in Effingham yesterday evening (14 January) involving a car and a pedestrian.

Officers were called to Forest Road at around 5.53pm, following reports of a collision involving a man and a black Saab.
The pedestrian, a man in his 50s, is in hospital with serious and potentially life-threatening injuries.
The driver was uninjured.
The road was closed for around three hours while emergency services responded to the incident.
Anyone who witnessed the collision or who might have CCTV or dashcam footage, should call 101 and quote the reference number PR/P120010814.
