We are appealing for information after a man was attacked by three teenage boys in Stanwell last Tuesday evening (17 March).

The man was walking along Clare Road near the junction with Town Lane towards Tesco around 5.45pm when the three suspects approached the man. One of the boys struck the victim before they all cycled off.

The assault is believed to have been unprovoked and may have been racially aggravated.

We are urging the victim to come forward as we continue our ongoing enquiries into the circumstances surrounding this incident. He is described as Asian with short hair and was wearing glasses and a burgundy top.

Two of the suspects are described as white, while the third is described as of dual heritage. There are no other descriptions of the suspects at this time.

If you witnessed this incident, or you have any information which could help, please contact us on 101, quoting crime reference number PR/45200030730. Alternatively, if you do not wish to leave your name, call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
