Two years since he was reported missing, we are re-appealing for the public's help in locating a missing 60-year-old man from Camberley.

John Upton was last seen in Camberley on Thursday, 29 March 2018. The latest unconfirmed sighting of John was in Bordon, Hampshire, on 3 February.

He was last seen wearing a black hooded jacket, black trousers and black plimsolls. John is described as white, 6ft 2 tall, and walks with a distinct hunch. We would like witnesses to bear in mind that this is an old photo of John and may not reflect how he currently looks.

John may be sleeping amongst the homeless community in Brighton, Sussex, but he also has links to Milton Keynes, Luton, and Camberley. There have also been unconfirmed sightings in Liphook.

He is a particular fan of the James Bond films, and may use this name or Roger Moore as an alias.

Anyone with information regarding John's whereabouts is asked to contact Surrey Police on 101 (999 in an emergency), quoting PR/45180033843.
