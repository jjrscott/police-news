We are appealing for witnesses following a burglary at a residential property in Thames Ditton last night (21 October).

Police were called to Orchard Avenue earlier today (22 October), after the victim discovered that over Â£4,000 worth of tools, including drills, batteries and saws, had been taken from the property after the suspects forced entry.

It is believed the burglary took place between 4pm yesterday and 8am today.

PC Brown, who is investigating, said: "We are appealing for witnesses who may have seen any suspicious people or vehicles in the area last night.

"The suspects were likely to have used a vehicle due to the amount of items stolen so if you have any footage from CCTV, doorbell cameras or dashcams that could assist us with our investigation, please get in touch."
