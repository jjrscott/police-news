We are appealing for witnesses following an attempt robbery in Camberley last Tuesday (18 February).

The two victims were sitting on a bench behind Surrey Heath Borough Council offices, when they were approached by two men just before 6pm.

The men have threatened the victims. The victims managed to run away uninjured and without anything being stolen.

The suspects are described as two teenage men, wearing dark clothing with their hoods up.

We are appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident or has any further information to call us on 101, quoting crime reference number PR/45200019647. Alternatively, if you do not wish to leave your name, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
