We can confirm that a woman missing from Virginia Water, who was the subject of a media appeal earlier today, has now been found.

We're grateful to the media and public for their assistance in helping to find her.

We now ask that any appeals or photos of the woman are removed or deleted so that she can regain her privacy. Thank you.
