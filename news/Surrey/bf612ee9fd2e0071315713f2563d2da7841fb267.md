We are appealing for witnesses following an unprovoked assault in Leatherhead on Sunday, 14 March.

We received calls at around 4pm to say that a group of teenagers were seen having an altercation in the large field which runs alongside the River Mole that can be accessed via Randalls Road. Three teenage boys were seen hitting another on the head from behind leaving the victim with facial injuries.

All three of the suspects have been described as wearing track suits and black balaclavas.

We are appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the incident to get in touch.
