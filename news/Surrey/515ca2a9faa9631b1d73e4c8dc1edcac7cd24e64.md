We are appealing for witnesses after a man exposed his genitals at a Coronavirus testing centre in Epsom on Tuesday (September 15) morning.

The incident took place at the Upper High Street car park testing centre between 11am and 11.25am when the suspect arrived on foot and sat down within the cordon tape at the site. The suspect refused to leave when asked and stood up, exposing himself to staff twice before leaving the site on foot heading off on to the Upper High Street in the direction of Epsom Town Centre.

The suspect, a 29 year old man of no fixed address was found by officers on Waterloo Road where he was arrested for exposure.

PC Jull from Epsom and Ewell Neighbourhood Patrol Team, said: "The whole incident took place in full view of the car park and was seen by numerous members of testing staff and possibly members of the public. We are appealing for further witnesses who may have been in the car park at the time."

The man is described as a white male with tanned skin, around 35 years old, 6'1" tall and of a skinny build. He had short dark hair and was wearing a blue hooded top, dark blue faded jeans, turquoise Adidas trainers and carrying a black Nike backpack.
