We are appealing for witnesses following an altercation which officers believe left a man with minor wounds in Tadworth yesterday.

At around 6.50pm, a small group of males were arguing in a car park located on Chavecroft Terrace.

During the argument, one of the group was seen to retrieve a knife from a nearby bush which he used to hit the victim. Shortly after this, the victim is thought to have left the scene in a blue Vauxhall Corsa, which we believe contained two other males and two females.

The suspect is described as in his early 20s, mixed race and medium build with short dark hair.

Officers are carrying out a number of enquiries today to identify those involved and are conducting house-to-house enquiries in the local area.

Detective Sergeant Tom Griffin said: "This appears to have been a particularly violent incident and we are working hard to establish the exact sequence of events and locate those involved. I would ask anyone who was in the area and saw what happened or may have information that could help the investigation to contact us as a matter of urgency."

If you witnessed this incident, or have any information which might help our investigation, please call 101 and quote ref PR/45200052125. You can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111; or through their anonymous online form: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/
