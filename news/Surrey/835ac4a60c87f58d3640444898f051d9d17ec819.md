Surrey Police are appealing for witnesses after a man sadly died and another man was seriously injured in a collision on Shepperton Road, Laleham.

Officers were called at around 17:54 to a report of a collision between a scrambler-type motorcycle and a blue BMW car. The collision happened close to the car park for the play area at the far north east of Laleham Park (close to the junction with Abbey Drive).

Despite the efforts of the ambulance crew, one of the two men on the motorbike was declared dead at the scene. The other rider has been taken to hospital with serious injuries. The men's families have been informed. The driver of the BMW was uninjured.

We are appealing for witnesses to come forward to assist our investigation into the cause of the collision. We are specifically looking to speak to anyone who saw it happen; or saw the manner of driving of either vehicle between 17:30 and the time of the collision; or who has dashcam or helmetcam footage from the immediate area between 17:30 and 18:00.

If you think you are able to assist the investigation, please contact us through the "Live Chat" function on the Surrey Police web page, quoting reference PR/P21037307. You can also contact us by calling 101.
