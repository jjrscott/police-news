We are appealing for witnesses following a serious collision on the A25 near Westcott earlier this morning (28 October).

Officers were called to the collision, involving a Mercedes Sprinter van and a Ford Fiesta Zetec, around 6.25am.

The road is likely to remain closed in both directions for the next couple of hours while we deal with the incident.

Anyone who witnessed the collision, or with any information which could assist our enquiries, is asked to contact us on 101, quoting incident reference PR/P19249676.
