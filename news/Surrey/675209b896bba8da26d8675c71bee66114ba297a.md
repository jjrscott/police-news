We are appealing for information following an assault and robbery on Pollard Road in Woking.

The incident occurred on Wednesday, 2 October at around 7.30am as the victim was leaving for work. The victim, who was in a blue Toyota Aygo, was about to turn right onto Princess Road at the top of Pollard Road, when the suspect has thrown a brick through the open car window, hitting the victim on the head.

The suspect has then threatened the victim with a knife and demanded the victim get out of the car before stealing his mobile phone and running off in the direction of the Princess pub.

The suspect is described as male, Asian, around 17 years old, 5ft 9 tall, of slim build, with dark brown hair and was wearing dark tracksuit bottoms and a grey camouflage jacket.

Detective Constable Antony Brady, who is investigating the incident, said: "This was a terrifying ordeal for the victim who was left visibly shaken and had to be treated by paramedics on scene. We are appealing for help from the public who may have seen anything or has any information which could help us progress our enquiries. If you live or were travelling in the area at the time, you might have CCTV or dashcam footage which could assist us."

If you can help, please call us on 101 quoting reference PR/45190100385 or report online via our website.

If you don't want to speak to police, you can call the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
