We are pleased to be able to update you that the 74-year-old missing man from Shepperton has been located.

Can we also take this opportunity to thank everyone who shared our appeal, contacted us with information and kept an eye out for him.

We are now taking down all references to the missing man, and we ask you to do the same so that we can help to restore his privacy.
