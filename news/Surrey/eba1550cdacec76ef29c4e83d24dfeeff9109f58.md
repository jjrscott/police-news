​We are appealing for witnesses following a theft in Farnham on Tuesday, 24 September.

We are appealing for witnesses following a theft in Farnham on Tuesday, 24 September.

At approximately 3pm, the victim, a man in his 70's, had been shopping in Farnham and was travelling on his red mobility scooter along West Street near The Post Office depot, when a woman carrying a clipboard approached him. The woman explained that she was collecting money for a charity, and stated she was deaf. She showed the man a sheet of paper with multiple names on it, claiming that each person had paid £10 to the charity.

After she had shown the victim the names of other people who had given money to the charity, he took out his wallet and gave her a £10 note. The woman leant over and thanked the man numerous times and kissed his cheek, but whilst doing so, removed £300 from his wallet before leaving on foot.

The woman is described as slim, in her late 20's to early 30's, approximately 5ft 4 inches tall, wearing dark clothing and carrying a clipboard.

PC Paul Armer, who is investigating the incident said: "If you were in Farnham on Tuesday and happened to see the woman with the clipboard, or have any information that might help us identify her, please make contact.

"We are keen to identify who she is because she preyed on an elderly man who was trying to go about his day, and took money from him. I would also urge people to be vigilant and make sure their purses and wallets are well secured, as well as making sure you cover your pin number when using chip and pin machines."
