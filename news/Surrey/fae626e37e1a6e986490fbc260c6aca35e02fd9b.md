We have released CCTV images of two men we'd like to speak to in connection with fraudulent activity in Ewell.

We were called to reports of fraudulent activity at a cash machine at a BP petrol station in London Road after a man was seen fitting a device to the cash machine around 1pm on 29 March.

10 minutes later, he was seen removing the device along with the victim's bank card.

We are keen to speak to the men in the CCTV images as we believe they may have information which could help us with our investigation.

If you recognise them or have any information which might help, please call us on 101 and quote ref PR/45200034028. You can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111; or through their anonymous online form: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/
