We are appealing for witnesses following the assault and robbery of two 15 year old boys in Watchetts Recreation Ground, near Camberley Rugby Club, in Camberley.

The incident occurred on Wednesday 26 August at around 5:15pm as the victims were walking past the toilets.

As they walked past the toilets two older men, of around 18 years of age, demanded the bag that one of the victims was carrying. One of the suspects then punched one of the victims in the face. We believe that the suspects were on foot - though they may have had pedal bikes nearby.

The first suspect is described as a white male of skinny but muscular build, around 6 foot tall, about 18 years old, with a stubbly beard and wearing a grey jumper with purple jogging bottoms.

The second suspect is described as a mixed race male of muscular build, around 5 foot 11 inches tall, about 18 years old with a goatee beard and was wearing a full grey tracksuit, possibly with a blue tracksuit underneath it.

Police are appealing for witnesses and if you:
• can help,
• saw something that didn't look right,
• know anyone who may have been involved
• were in the area with dashcam
• or live in the vicinity with CCTV

Please contact us via LiveChat or by calling 101 quoting incident reference PR/P20200380.

Following our initial enquiries two males are in custody both arrested on suspicion of robbery.

You can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111; or through their anonymous online form: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/
