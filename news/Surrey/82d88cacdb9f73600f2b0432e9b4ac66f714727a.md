We are appealing for witnesses after an armed robbery at a pub in Ash this morning (7 December).

Police were called to the Lion Brewery pub in Guildford Road around 8.20am following reports that two men posing as delivery drivers went to the pub and threatened the occupants with a gun before stealing cash from the premises.

The female occupant suffered a head injury and was taken to hospital. The male occupant was uninjured. Both have been left extremely shaken as a result of the incident.

A thorough search of the area was carried out with armed officers involved but the suspects have not been found.

They are described as white, and were wearing black hats and face masks. One is described as around 5ft 7 tall, while the other is described as around 6ft tall.

Detective Inspector Pete Howgate said: "We appreciate that this will have caused a lot of concern in the local community and we would like to reassure people that we are doing everything we can and pursuing various lines of enquiry to establish who was responsible.

"This appears to have been a pre-planned incident and there was no risk to the wider public. We would like to thank everyone affected by the police activity for their patience and cooperation.

"Our investigation remains ongoing and we are appealing to anyone with any information who has not already come forward, to get in touch with us straightaway."
