The M25 has been re-opened clockwise between Junction 8, Reigate & Junction 10, Wisley today (Saturday 29 February) after the body of a woman was discovered on the carriageway shortly after 06:15am.

Sadly the 36 year-old woman died at the scene, her family has been informed.

Sergeant Andy Audsley from the Roads Policing Team said: "We are trying to establish how the woman, who was a pedestrian, came to be injured in the carriageway. We believe that she may have been involved at some stage in a collision with a vehicle that did not stop at the scene.

"We are asking anyone who saw the woman who was wearing a maroon coat and trousers to call us immediately on 101 quoting P20048965".

We'd like to thank motorists for their patience while the road was closed this morning.

Anyone with information should call 101 quoting crime reference P20048965.

Alternatively, if you do not wish to leave your name, call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
