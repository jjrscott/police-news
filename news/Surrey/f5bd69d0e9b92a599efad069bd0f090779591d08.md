A Woking man has been sentenced to nine months behind bars after being found guilty of theft, escaping lawful custody and possession of cannabis.

Ciaran Edwards, 31, of Old Woking Road, Woking, was arrested after concerns were raised on 2 November 2019 that he had come into possession of a large sum of money. When challenged, Edwards said he had stolen it from work and that he was planning to take more money and flee to Barcelona. He had even booked an e-ticket for his flight.

Officers contacted Edwards' company, where he was employed as a manager, and discovered that he was the only member of staff with access to the cash safes. They waited outside to arrest him after he finished work but he made off from police. However, he was located at his home address later that night.

Following a search of his rucksack, officers found Â£5,546.99 in cash, which was confirmed as being the amount stolen from his company. He was also found to be in possession of cannabis.

He was subsequently charged with two counts of theft, escaping lawful custody and possession of class B drugs.

PC Tom Gorys, who investigated the case: "This is a great result due to a thorough and prompt investigation by officers, which resulted in the recovery of a large quantity of cash and prevented further thefts from the company which had employed Edwards in good faith and trusted him with significant responsibilities. The fact that he was given a prison sentence shows that this sort of pre-meditated criminal behaviour will not be tolerated and should act as a deterrent to anyone planning similar offences and thinking they will get away with it."
