We are appealing for witnesses following an attempted robbery of a woman in her car yesterday afternoon (June 4).

The victim had pulled over on Weston Green Road at around 5pm when she noticed a man approach her car door.

The suspect put his hand on the woman and demanded she give him her jewellery. She managed to prevent this and he subsequently ran away. Nothing was taken during this incident.

We believe the man was the passenger of a small black car.

He has been described as being a white male in his mid-30's, 5'9" to 5'10" tall and of stocky build. He was wearing mainly dark loose clothing with a black beanie and cream gloves.

Inspector Bert Dean said, "This is a shocking crime to happen in our community, it is something that rarely happens. Officers from Elmbridge's Neighbourhood team are making every effort to identify this suspect."

If you have any information which could help this investigation, including CCTV or dashcam footage, please call 101 and quote ref PR/45200057732.
