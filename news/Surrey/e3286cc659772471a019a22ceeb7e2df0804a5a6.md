We are appealing for witnesses after following a serious collision in Chertsey last night (24 October).

The collision, involving a blue Volkswagen Golf and a blue Volkswagen Sharan, took place around 8.45pm in Guildford Street.

The road remains closed while emergency services, including fire and ambulance crews, deal with the incident.

We are appealing for anyone who witnessed the collision, particularly anyone with dashcam footage, or who may have any other information, to come forward as soon as possible. We would particularly like to speak to a man and a woman in a small white vehicle who stopped immediately after the collision took place but left before we could speak to them.

If you can help, please contact us quoting incident reference PR/P20247839 via webchat on our website surrey.police.uk or by calling us on 101.
