We're appealing for witnesses after a 46-year-old man was stabbed on Station Road West in the vicinity of Oxted train station at around 5.50pm this evening (31 December).

The man was treated at the scene by paramedics and remains in hospital in a serious condition.

A police cordon remains at the scene.

We would like to speak to a group of five male and three female youths seen in the area at the time who we believe headed in the direction of Morrison's using a station underpass shortly after the incident.

The group is described as white, aged 15-18-years-old and all wearing dark grey or black hoodies.

T/Inspector Lyndsey Whatley said: "We understand this is an alarming incident for local residents and I would like to reassure the community that we are doing everything we can to find those responsible. I would ask people to please avoid the area for the time being. If you have any information which could help our investigation, please get in contact with us straightaway."
