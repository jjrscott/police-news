We are asking for help in tracing a man who ran away from officers following a pursuit in Woking on Saturday (7 November).

At approximately 1pm officers were near St Johns Hill Road when they spotted a grey Ford Focus which immediately made off, resulting in a pursuit.

The pursuit headed towards Amstel Way, where officers performed a sting which did not appear to deflate the tyres. Shortly after, the vehicle was located on Wishborne way by the lake entrance where the driver of the vehicle had made off from police.

An area search was conducted with a helicopter, drone and police dogs but no trace of the man was found.

Officers are appealing to anyone with footage of the pursuit or driver to upload their footage directly to the following system - https://unitedkingdom1cpp-portal.digital-policing.co.uk/serip/appeal/video-footage-of-pursuit
