We are appealing for witnesses after an electric scooter was stolen from a boy in the play park at the rear of Jelley Way, Woking, at around 5.20pm on Tuesday, 12 January.

The boy was approached by a man described as tall, and wearing dark clothes and a balaclava. The man assaulted the boy before taking the electronic scooter and heading towards the farm area at the rear of the park near to Moor Lane.

Detective Constable Anthony Gravener, who is in charge of the investigation says: ""I would like to reassure the public that incidents like this are thankfully rare but this was, as you can imagine, a harrowing and upsetting experience for the young victim. I would urge anyone who may have witnessed anything in the area to make contact.

"We are particularly interested in locating a man riding a grey or black bicycle who spoke to the boy around ten minutes before the incident took place. He is described as wearing dark clothing and a yellow or green hi vis jacket. If that was you or you know who it might be, please get in touch.

"We are also interested in identifying the young girl and woman in the CCTV image, who were walking nearby when the incident occurred. We would really like to speak to them to see if they saw anything that could help us with our investigation."

The electric scooter is black with white lettering on the base plate, and is made by Kirin.
