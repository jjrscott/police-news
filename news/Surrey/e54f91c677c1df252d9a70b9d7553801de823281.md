We are pleased to say that we have now located a 16 year old autistic girl who had gone missing from her home in Ashford earlier today (Sunday 30 August).

She was found within an hour of our appeal being published and we are enormously grateful to everyone who shared, retweeted or published appeals relating to her. She is now on her way home to her family.

We now ask that you remove these shares and appeals so that we can help her to restore her privacy, and that of her family.
