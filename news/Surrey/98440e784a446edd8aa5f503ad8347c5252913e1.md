We are appealing for witnesses after a robbery in Frimley on Sunday (22 November).

The victims, all in their late teens, were on a footpath between Tesco Express on Balmoral Drive and Pevensey Way with friends between 8pm and 9pm, when they were approached by two male suspects. A knife was shown to the group before the suspects made off with two electric scooters, and rode off in the direction of Balmoral Drive.

The suspects are described as two white men in dark clothing.

Were you in the area of Balmoral Drive or Pevensey Way in Frimley between 8 and 9pm on Sunday? Did you see two men in dark clothing riding electric scooters during this time?
