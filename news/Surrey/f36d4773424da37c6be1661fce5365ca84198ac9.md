On Tuesday (October 20) Surrey Police was called to Dunsfold Aerodrome following reports that two people had been seen jumping out of a freight lorry as it began to unload in the yard.

The call came in after 10pm when it was already dark and so difficult to find two people in a pitch black aerodrome.

At this point a call was put out to the Dog Unit and Sergeant Mike Barnes attended with Police Dog (PD) Lottie who arrived at 10.15pm.

PD Lottie immediately picked up on a track across the airfield and followed it for three quarters of a mile until she found two people hiding behind a pile of tyres. They claimed to be from Iraq and had got into the lorry at Calais.

Sgt Barnes said: "This is another great example of the value of our dogs, supporting the front line resources, quickly locating the two men allowing them to be detained safely."

The two men were arrested on suspicion of illegal entry and taken to Immigration Services in Dover.
