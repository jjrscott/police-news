We are continuing to appeal for witnesses and dashcam footage following the death of a man in Shepperton last night (19 September).

Officers are investigating the possibility of a fail to stop collision after a man was found on Walton Bridge Road with serious head injuries and sadly passed away at the scene.

The investigation into the circumstances of his death is underway and a red van, believed to be involved has been identified.

Sergeant Ben Grilli said "We are appealing to anyone who lives in the Shepperton area and may have CCTV which could help us or anyone who was driving in the area between 6:30pm-9pm and may have any dashcam footage that could assist us to get in touch.

"We urge you to take a look at the footage and get in touch if it shows a red van. As well as this, if you were walking around the area and witnessed a red van, possibly driving erratically then you could really assist us with this investigation."

Two people have been arrested in connection with this incident. One has been released under investigation and the other has been released with bail conditions.
