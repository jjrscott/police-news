As part of a pilot to reduce its carbon footprint, our Roads Policing Unit has introduced the first plug-in hybrid vehicle to its fleet.

The Mercedes E350e is the first of its kind to be used within the Force and will be used by the team to determine the viability of electric cars being used as routine patrol vehicles.

Although the Force already has a number of hybrid vehicles, this is the first of its kind for the RPU, who often participate in high speed pursuits and consequently require vehicles with a higher specification.

Inspector John Lakeman of the Roads Policing Unit, commented: "As a Force we are committed to reducing our carbon footprint where we can. The Roads Policing Unit can sometimes have to drive over 200 miles in a single shift, so it is important we try to counteract this impact on the environment.

"The new addition to the fleet was an ex-demonstrator vehicle and so was purchased at a much reduced price.

"The new vehicle will be used by the team as a routine patrol car to keep the roads of Surrey and Sussex safe."
