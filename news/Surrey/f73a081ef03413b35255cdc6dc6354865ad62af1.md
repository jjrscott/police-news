We are appealing for your help after two men forced entry into the Royal British Legion club just off Church Road in Addlestone at around 11.05pm on Sunday (27 October) and attacked two men present in the location using weapons.

The suspects, who were described as two young males with English accents wearing dark clothing and masks, stole a quantity of cash and subsequently made off in what has been described as a 'black car'.

The victims, aged 57 and 73 were left with serious head injuries and had to be treated on scene and taken to hospital.

They were both discharged from hospital later that evening and taken home by officers.

A 31-year-old man from Feltham was arrested on Monday (28 October) in connection with the incident. He is currently under police bail with strict conditions not to enter the borough of Surrey whilst our investigation continues.

**Detective Constable Helen Flower, who is investigating the incident, said: "This was a terrifying ordeal for the victims who were enjoying a quiet night at the club house. We are appealing for help from the public to help us establish what happened that evening and bring those responsible to justice. Did you hear or see anything unusual that night? Do you have CCTV fitted to your home or business premises in the area? You may have vital information or footage which could help us."**
