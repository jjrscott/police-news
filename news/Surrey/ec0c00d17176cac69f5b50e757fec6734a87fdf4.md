A man has been sentenced to eight weeks in prison after breaking the terms of his Criminal Behaviour Order.

Joseph West, 48 of Albert Drive Woking was issued with a CBO at Guildford Magistrates Court on Saturday, 1 August following a string of unacceptable behaviour in the town. The order prevented him from entering specific areas between certain times and from behaving in a manner which would cause any other person alarm of distress.

Despite warnings, he was arrested on Saturday, 19 September for breaking these conditions twice and appeared at Guildford Magistrates Court yesterday (23 September) where he was sentenced to eight weeks in prison.

Upon his release, his Criminal Behaviour Order will remain in place until 31 August 2022.

Inspector Dave Bentley, Borough Commander for Woking said: "Joseph West continued to break the terms of his Criminal Behaviour Order which was in place to protect our community from his actions. I appreciate the courts giving this custodial sentence and hope it will act as a deterrent for those who wish to disregard orders set by our courts."

"Anti- social behaviour will not be tolerated in Woking and will be robustly dealt with where possible.

We'd like to thank the members of the public who helped us to secure this order as no-one should be subjected to anti-social behaviour like this in our community. Their contribution is helping to keep people safe in Woking."
