We are appealing for witnesses following an assault of a woman on River Lane, Leatherhead, on Tuesday, 23 March.

The incident occurred close to the Leatherhead youth football club at around 5.15pm and was reported to involve a group of young men deliberately kicking a ball at the woman who was out running nearby.

After being hit by the ball at some force, the victim fell over and was taken to hospital with injuries to her ankle.

We are appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the incident to get in touch.
