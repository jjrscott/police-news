We're appealing for witnesses after a collision between two vehicles on Byfleet Road in Weybridge.

We were called to reports of a collision at around 4.30pm earlier today (6 August).

The driver of one of the vehicles left the scene and we were unable to locate him despite extensive searches. He is described as a white man, around 6ft tall and wasn't wearing a top at the time of the incident. We believe he may have an Injury to his face.

The occupant of the second car involved received serious injuries and is being treated in hospital.
