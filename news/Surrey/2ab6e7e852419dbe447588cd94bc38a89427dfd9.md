We're appealing for witnesses after a fight broke out between two large groups of teenagers in Court Recreation Ground on Pound Lane yesterday afternoon (15 July).

The incident occurred between 3.30 and 4.30pm when two groups of males aged in their mid to late teens began fighting. One of the boys used a glass bottle to attack the victims, which left two of them with injuries.

The groups had dispersed before police arrived.

The park was busy at the time and we believe this incident was witnessed by other people in the park.

Borough Commander, Epsom and Ewell, Jon Vale said: "We are doing everything we can to establish the circumstances of why this fight broke out in the first place and identify those involved. I'd like to reassure the community that we believe the two groups are known to each other and that there is no wider threat to the public. If you have any information, please come forward as it could assist us in our investigation."

If you have any information, including CCTV or dashcam footage of the area at the time, please call 101 and quote ref PR/45200073505. Alternatively, if you prefer to remain anonymous, you can report information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
