We are appealing for witnesses following the robbery of a bike in Haslemere on Sunday, 31 May.

The robbery is believed to have taken place around 3:00PM at the recreation ground on Old Haslemere Road in Haslemere. The victim was alone when he was approached by two boys who threatened him before stealing his bike. The suspect riding the bike then disappeared down the footpath leading to Scotland Lane and the other suspect left on foot towards Denby Road.

The suspect who stole the bike is described as a white boy around 16/17 years old with tanned skin. He had thick brown eyebrows with brown hair and an overlapping fringe which was parted in the middle. He was wearing a white T-shirt with a 'Dickies' logo on the back, grey puma tracksuit bottoms and clunky white trainers.

The other suspect is also described as a white male around 16/17 years old. He was of slim build with a spotty complexion. He had short blonde hair which was gelled to the side. He was wearing a white plain T shirt, and black jogging bottoms, with white trainers and a rucksack with 'Nike' in yellow writing.

The bike which was stolen is a specialised young adult's bike which is graphite grey. It has no lights and the orange reflector on the left paddle is missing. It has reflectors on the front and rear wheel. The frame of the bike is a shiny silver colour with a small sticker saying 'MB Cyclery' on it.

If you witnessed the robbery, have any further information or have seen the bike please contact 101 quoting reference number PR/ 45200056154.

If you would prefer to give information anonymously, please contact the independent charity Crimestoppers, through https://crimestoppers-uk.org/, or 0800 555 111.
