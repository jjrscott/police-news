A man from Egham pleaded guilty to possession of a prohibited weapon when he appeared at Kingston Crown Court earlier today (7 December).

Timothy White, 41, of Woodhaw, Egham, was arrested after police were called to his home address on 9 June following a 999 call reporting a concern for safety.

During specialist searches of the address, a number of weapons, including a sawn-off shotgun which had been hidden in the loft, were seized. Damage to the kitchen wall was also photographed and assessed by firearms experts which confirmed the discharge of a shotgun cartridge at close range.

Detective Inspector Craig Emmerson said: "It is not often that prohibited weapons of this nature are recovered as they are usually disposed of very quickly following discharge, or re-circulated within the criminal underworld. I have little doubt that the community is far safer following the conviction of this dangerous individual and the safe recovery of a potentially deadly weapon."

White was charged and convicted of the more serious offence under Section 5 of the Firearms Act 1968. He was remanded into custody and will be sentenced on 14 April at Kingston Crown Court.
