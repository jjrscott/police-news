Local residents in Ash Vale may notice an increased police presence in the area today (27 August).

This is precautionary following a report of suspicious behaviour in the area yesterday.

Officers were called to Vale Road at around 5pm yesterday following reports of two girls being followed by men in a car. Enquiries are ongoing, an investigation is underway and officers have been patrolling the local area today to provide some community reassurance.

Andy Hill, Borough Commander for Guildford said "We do not want to worry local residents but want to reassure that we take reports of this nature very seriously.

"If you witnessed anything yesterday or have any further information, we urge you to get in touch. We'd also like to remind the public to always report incidents such as these to the police."
