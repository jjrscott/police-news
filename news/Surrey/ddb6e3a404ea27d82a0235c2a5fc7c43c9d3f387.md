We are continuing to appeal for witness after a pedestrian was left with life-changing injuries following a collision in Oxshott last month.

The pedestrian, a 73-year-old man from Oxshott, had to have his leg amputated after he was involved in the collision with a silver Honda Civic at 5:43pm on Tuesday 24 December in Warren Lane.

A 37 year-old man from Epsom was arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving, driving whilst unfit through drugs, and driving with a proportion of a specified controlled drug above the specified limit. He was interviewed and has been released under investigation.

Our enquiries are ongoing and we would like to speak to anyone who witnessed the collision, particularly any drivers who were directly behind the vehicle involved.

Investigating officer Sergeant Ben Grilli said: "A man has had to have his leg amputated as a result of this incident and we are really keen to establish exactly what has happened.

"We believe that there would have been witnesses who, for whatever reason, did not stop and speak to police at the time. We would urge them to come forward as a matter of urgency as the information they provide may be of significance to our investigation."

If you can help, please contact us on 101, quoting reference number PR/45190137988. Alternatively, if you do not wish to leave your name, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
