We're appealing for witnesses following a serious collision in Leatherhead last night.

We were called to the A246 Young Street at 10.25pm, close to the junction with the Givons Grove roundabout following a two vehicle collision.

A woman who was travelling in one of the vehicles is in hospital with serious injuries.

Officers are appealing for anyone who witnessed the collision, or who may have CCTV or dashcam footage to get in touch. Please call 101 and quote the reference number PR/P20058468 with any information.

A man has been arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving, aggravated vehicle taking, driving whilst disqualified, having no insurance, failing to provide, and making off without payment.
