Wesley Kevin Davison, 41, of Cowley Avenue, Chertsey was sentenced last week to 30 months' custody for commercial burglary.

On 1 December last year, Davison entered a Woking shop through the fire door, having been spotted loitering outside waiting for his opportunity to do so. He concealed himself in the shop for over five hours. When the shop closed, Davison broke into the locked office and violently smashed open a safe taking Â£4,000.

Davison then broke out of the shop, terrifying members of staff who had rushed to the premises after receiving a security alert.

Investigating officers were able to find CCTV of a man matching the suspect's description going into Woking Library earlier in the day. While there was no CCTV of his face while he was in the library, Davison used the communal computers and logged on using a library card in his own name enabling officers to link him to the burglary.

Davison admitted the offences in court, but disputed some of the facts so the case was decided by a Newton hearing, where the judge decides which party is being truthful. The judge found against Davison

PC Kat Sandys, who oversees burglary investigations for West division's proactive investigation team says: "This was not only something that was clearly pre-planned, but was also really frightening for the brave staff members who quickly responded during the night to a security alert about their place of work. A great team effort by the investigating officers means another dangerous criminal is off the streets."
