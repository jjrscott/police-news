We're asking anyone who saw a man trying to cross the A322 at Bagshot this lunchtime (Thursday 10 October), to contact us.

At 12:52pm we were called to a collision on the A322, close to the M3 roundabout, between a pedestrian and a lorry on the northbound carriageway.

The pedestrian is being treated for a serious head injury and he has been taken by helicopter to hospital.

Partial lane closures are in place on the southbound section of the road and a full closure is in place northbound from the roundabout at the M3 junction. They are expected to remain in place until this evening.

If you saw the man in the area beforehand, or what happened, please call 101 quoting P19234666.

Alternatively, you can use the online reporting system https://www.surrey.police.uk/ro/report/ocr/af/how-to-report-a-crime/ and enter the reference number in the 'Incident Details' section.

You can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111; or through their anonymous online form: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/
