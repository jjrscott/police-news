We have released images of a man we would like to speak to in connection with a hate crime in Farnham on Thursday, 21 January, at around 1.15pm.

The incident took place at Waitrose in Farnham. The store's security guards were outside trying to calm down a man who was shouting and swearing. A store manager intervened to ask him to leave and the man then became aggressive and racially abusive towards one of the security guards.

The man had left the scene when police arrived.

PC Emma Goldup who is investigating says: "We do not tolerate racist abuse and hate speech in Surrey so if you can help us identify the person in question, please get in touch."

We are keen to identify the man pictured in the images. If you recognise the person pictured, or you were in the area at the time and have any information which could help, please contact us quoting crime reference number PR/45210006826 via:

 * Calling us on 101

If you do not wish to leave your name, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
