We are appealing for witnesses after one of our officers was driven at in Epsom on Friday, 26 February.

Officers were responding to a call shortly 3:15pm and stopped a car in Chartwell Place near Downs Road in Epsom.When the officer went to speak to the driver and the passenger, the car accelerated and drove towards her, causing her to have to dive out of the way.

The car, a Vauxhall Insignia, then drove off in the direction of Downs Road. The officer was uninjured but left shaken.

The two suspects were identified and later arrested at Epsom Cemetery.

The driver, a 28-year-old man from Chobham, was arrested on suspicion of driving a motor vehicle dangerously, attempt wounding with intent and failing to stop a vehicle when required by police.

The passenger, a 26-year-old man from Woking, was arrested on suspicion of driving a motor vehicle dangerously and attempt wounding with intent.

Both men have been released under investigation.
