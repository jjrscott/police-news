We're appealing for witnesses following an assault in Woking on 24 May.

The victim was walking alone under a bridge on a canal path on Monument Road when he was struck from behind. The suspects then punched and kicked the victim, leaving him unconscious.

One suspect is described as a white man, roughly 5ft 11, aged around 24-25, of skinny build with brown hair and stubble. He was wearing dark blue tracksuit bottoms. The second suspect is described as an Asian man, roughly 6ft 2, aged around mid to late 30s, of large build with black hair and wearing black tracksuit bottoms.

If you saw anyone acting suspiciously in the area or have any information which could help the investigation, please call 101 and quote ref PR/45200054537.
