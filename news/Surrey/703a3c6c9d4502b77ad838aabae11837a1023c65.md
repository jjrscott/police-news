We are appealing for help to find two men who are wanted in connection with a burglary in Guildford.

Two suspects broke into a residential property in Guildford at 10:40am on 29 February. A large quantity of cash and numerous items of jewellery were stolen from the address. The suspects fled the scene when they were disturbed by the occupant coming home.

We believe the suspects drove to the address in a black BMW and left on foot.

Ibrahim Basha, 27, from Ipswich and Ermir Mataj, 33, both Albanian nationals, are wanted in connection with this incident. Both men have connections to Ipswich, Central London and Surrey.

If you know where these two men are, or have any information which might help us locate them, please call 101 and quote ref PR/45200023644. Alternatively, if you do not wish to leave your name, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
