We are appealing for witnesses after an elderly woman had her car stolen in The Cloisters, Old Woking on Wednesday (17 March) at some point between 2pm and 3pm.

The 80-year-old victim had just pulled into the road and stopped behind a delivery van that was blocking her way, when the suspect approached her car and demanded she get out of her silver Mercedes. He then got in the car and drove off in the direction of Church Road, potentially causing damage to other vehicles in its way.

Unbeknown to the suspect, the victim's dog was in the boot of the vehicle. The suspect was stopped near junction 10 of the A3 and the victim was reunited with her pet and car.

Investigating Officer, Detective Constable Carina Jewell, said: "While this was a terrifying ordeal for the victim, incidents such as this in Surrey are very rare. The suspect did not realise the victim's dog was in the boot of the car at the time it was taken but fortunately the pair have since been reunited."

We are appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the incident or have any dashcam footage to get in touch.
