Police investigating an assault on Thursday evening in Farnham are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

We were contacted at around 9:20pm on Thursday evening after an 18 year old man attended hospital with minor defensive stab wounds to his arm and hands. Further investigation identified that he had been recently assaulted in Farnham. He has now been released from hospital and is recovering with minor injuries.

The victim had been walking along Borelli Walk, a path that runs from South Street along the River Wey towards the sports centre, when he was approached by a group of men. We believe that there may have been an argument or altercation of some sort, and the victim was assaulted.

We would like to hear from anyone who may have seen or heard anything in the vicinity of Borelli Walk, the sports centre or the skate park between 8pm and 10pm on Thursday 23 July; or from anyone who believes that someone they know may have be involved (perhaps they have changed behaviour or been acting oddly since Thursday evening, or have mentioned something to you which leads you to believe they may be involved).

If you have any information which could help, please contact us urgently quoting PR/45200076873.

On Saturday 25 July, police investigating this assault arrested three men, aged 23, 23 and 17 from Farnham. They remain in police custody at this time.
