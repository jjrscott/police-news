Police are appealing for witnesses after a teenager was approached by a man on her way to school on Friday (19 March).

The victim was walking along Chessington Road towards the junction with Ruxley Lane at about 07.50am, opposite the Texaco petrol station, when a white van stopped beside her in slow-moving traffic. A man jumped out, walked around the vehicle to her, and attempted to grab her wrist. She ran away and the vehicle made a U-turn and drove off.

The girl was physically unharmed.

The suspect is described as a white man in his late 30s to early 40s, wearing a grey tracksuit and cap. He is around 5'8" tall.

His vehicle was described as a plain white van with mud splashes on it.
