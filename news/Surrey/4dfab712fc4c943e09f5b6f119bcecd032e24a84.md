We are appealing for witnesses following a serious assault outside Dia Y Noche bar in Epsom in the early hours of Wednesday, 1 January.

We were called to Dia Y Noche bar in The Oaks Square at around 2am following reports of an assault outside the premises. Officers arrived to paramedics treating the victim, a man who was taken to hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries.

Detective Constable Andy Robinson, who is investigating the case said: "This assault happened outside a busy bar where there were almost a hundred potential witnesses, but sadly no one has come forward. If anyone saw the movements of a man described as a white, of large build, wearing a blue short sleeved t shirt and jeans, we encourage you to come forward. It is believed that the assault occurred at around 1.15am and we want to speak to anyone who may have any useful information."

We are appealing to anyone who may have witnessed this or have any further information to get in contact by calling 101, quoting reference number PR/45200000009.

You can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111; or through their anonymous online form: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/
