A man from Woking has been sentenced to two years and ten months behind bars after pleading guilty to making indecent images of children and breaching a sexual harm prevention order.

Wojciech Kurzawa, 45, from Woking, pleaded guilty to making indecent images of children and three breaches of his sexual harm prevention order when he appeared at Guildford Crown Court last Thursday (22 October).

Kurzawa was convicted of three offences of making indecent images of children when he appeared at Guildford Crown Court on 4 June 2019. He was issued with a sexual harm prevention order as part of his sentence on 27 August 2019. The conditions prohibited him from using any device or computer capable of accessing the internet.

On 5 December 2019, Kurzawa's risk management officer attended his home address for a routine visit. During the visit a USB memory stick was seized for examination. A few days later, officers went back to Kurzawa's home address to install monitoring software on his computer.

On 18 December 2019, Surrey Police received notification that indecent images of children had been viewed and Kurzawa was arrested on suspicion of making indecent images of children.

A number of other computers were subsequently seized from his home address containing further indecent images of children.

PC Callum Darby, who investigated the offences, said: "Kurzawa had already been convicted of making indecent images of children and was bound by the conditions of his sexual harm prevention order, which he has blatantly disregarded. The prison sentence he has received today demonstrates that such disregard will not be tolerated."
