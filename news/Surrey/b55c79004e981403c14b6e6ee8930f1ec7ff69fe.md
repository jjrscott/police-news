We are appealing for witnesses following a knifepoint robbery at a bakery in New Haw on Saturday (7 December).

An investigation is underway following the robbery, which took place at Heaters Bakery on Woodham Lane at approximately 4.45pm. A suspect walked into the bakery with a knife and demanded money.
He then left on foot in the direction of the Broadway with approximately Â£100 in cash.
No-one was injured, although staff were left shaken as a result of the incident.
The man was described as in his 60s or 70s, white, 5 ft 8 tall, of a medium build, with a short grey beard. He spoke with a local accent.
At the time of the incident he was wearing a black beanie hat, a black jacket which was done up, and black jeans.
A 44-year-old man from Addlestone was arrested on suspicion of robbery but has since been released under investigation.
Enquiries remain ongoing and we are appealing for anyone with any information or dashcam footage to come forward.
If you can help, please contact us on 101, quoting incident reference PR/45190131426.
You can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111; or through their anonymous online form: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/
