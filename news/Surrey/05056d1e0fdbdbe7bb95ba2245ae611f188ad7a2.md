Updated News Post

UPDATED: Wanted man located.

We are pleased to share that, following information received as a result of a "wanted" appeal earlier this week, a 35 year old man from Leatherhead has been located and arrested. He has been questioned as part of an investigation into a robbery and has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

We are grateful for the public's help in locating the man, but we now ask that appeals and social media posts relating to him are removed, in order to restore his privacy, and preserve the integrity of any possible future criminal proceedings.
