We are appealing for witnesses following a burglary at a store in Addlestone on Sunday 1 December.

Thieves forced the front door to the Co-op in Green Lane around 2.45am to gain entry, before making their escape with bottles of alcohol and two charity boxes containing a quantity of cash.

We're keen to identify two young men seen outside the store at around 2.15am the same morning (1 December), as they may have information which could help with our investigation.

The two young men have been described as in their late teens or early 20s. Both were wearing gloves, tracksuits with their hoods up, and balaclavas over their faces.

One of the young men was dressed all in black, while the other man was wearing a grey hooded jacket and riding a bicycle.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact us on 101, quoting incident reference PR/45190128955, or report it online at https://www.surrey.police.uk/ro/report/ocr/af/how-to-report-a-crime/

Alternatively, if you do not wish to leave your name, call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
