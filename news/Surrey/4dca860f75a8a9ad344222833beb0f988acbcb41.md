A woman remains in a serious condition in hospital after a dog jumped up at her and knocked her over in a park in Ewell on Friday morning (25 September).

The woman, who is in her 60s, was walking alone in Nonsuch Park in Ewell Road around 10.45am when the medium-sized brown dog jumped up at her, causing her to fall on to the concrete path.

She returned home around 11.45am and was taken to hospital after she became unwell. She is currently being treated for a fractured skull and her condition is described as serious.

Three people were with the dog at the time of the incident and we would really like to speak to them as part of our investigation. We are also urging anyone else who witnessed this incident to come forward as a matter of urgency.

Detective Constable Kristian Baker, who is investigating the incident, said: "The people who were with the dog may not have any idea that the woman has been left seriously injured as she went home after her fall. However, we need to speak to them to better understand what has taken place and urge them to come forward as soon as possible. We would also like to speak to anyone else with any other information which could help us."
