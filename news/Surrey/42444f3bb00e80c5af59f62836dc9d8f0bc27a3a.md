We have released images of a group we'd like to speak to in connection with an assault in Gogmore Farm Park in Chertsey.

At around 8:30pm on Saturday 2 May, a group of four males threw an egg at the victim who was also in the park. When the victim approached the group, he was violently punched and kicked. The assault left the victim needing hospital treatment for a fractured cheek bone and serious damage to his teeth.

Prior to this, the group were also seen throwing eggs at passers-by on the Riverbourne Gym side of the park.

They are described as white males in their late teens or early twenties. One of the men is described as around 5ft 10 tall with dark brown hair. A second male was seen wearing a distinctive white hoody with the number 72 on the back of it.

Detective Sergeant Nick Ring: "This was a brutal and unprovoked attack which left the victim with serious facial injuries. I We are keen to speak to the young men pictured in connection with this assault and I would urge anyone who recognises them to contact us as a matter of urgency."

If you recognise the people shown in the images or have any information which might help this investigation, please call 101 and quote ref PR/45200045688. Alternatively, if you do not wish to leave your name, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
