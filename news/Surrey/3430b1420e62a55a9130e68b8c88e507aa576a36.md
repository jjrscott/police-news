We're appealing for witnesses after a collision between a car and an e-scooter in Ashford on Tuesday night (30 March).

The incident happened at around 9.15pm outside the parade of shops in Feltham Road. The man riding the e-scooter suffered minor injuries.

We're particularly keen to trace the car involved in the collision which did not stop following the collision. We believe the car was dark in colour.
