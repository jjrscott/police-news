The cyclist involved in a collision in Sunbury on Sunday afternoon (12 April), has sadly died.

We were called at around 2.13pm to the junction of Staines Road West (A308) and Windmill Road (A244), following reports of a collision involving a Black Mercedes CLK Coupe and a cyclist.

The cyclist, a man in his 50s, suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospital. He died yesterday morning (13 April), as a result of the injuries he sustained. His family have been notified and our thoughts are with them at this time.

The driver of the Mercedes, a man in his 30s, was arrested at the scene on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and has since been released under investigation.

Enquiries remain ongoing and we are continuing to appeal for anyone who saw what happened or has dashcam and CCTV footage of the incident to come forward. Please call 101 quoting reference PR/45200038561 with any information.

You can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111; or online at https://crimestoppers-uk.org/.
