We are appealing for the public's help in locating wanted man Oliver Boswell, who also goes by the name of Patrick.

Boswell, 21, of no fixed abode is wanted in connection with an investigation into an assault.

He is described as white, approximately 6ft. 2 inches tall and of a medium build. He has wavy, brown hair and possibly a beard, but could also be clean shaven. He has a small diagonal scar to the front of his forehead.

It is believed that Boswell may be in the Chertsey area but also has links to Bolton in Manchester, Liverpool in Merseyside, Halifax in West Yorkshire, Warrington and Middlewich in Chesire.

If you have any information which may assist officers in locating Oliver Boswell, please call 101 quoting reference PR/45190092504. Alternatively, if you do not wish to speak to police, you can call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
