Were you in Wood Street Village, Guildford on Saturday, February 29 at around 9.45pm?

We are appealing for witnesses following an incident in which three to five men dressed in black attempted to enter a property via the rear patio doors, surprising the occupants who were watching TV.

One of the victims chased the suspects out of his house and was subsequently attacked and left with injuries that required hospital treatment.

The suspects then ran west down Pound Hill before making off in a vehicle.

If you were in the area at the time have any information, or you have any dashcam footage, please can you call Surrey Police immediately on 101 quoting crime reference PR/45200023805.

You can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111; or through their anonymous online form: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/
