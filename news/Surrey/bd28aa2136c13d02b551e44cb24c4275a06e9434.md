We have released an E-fit image to help identify a man we want to speak to in connection with an indecent exposure in Guildford on Tuesday, 3 March.

Two women were walking along the nature trail of Heath Mill Lane near The Fox Inn public house between 5:30pm and 6pm when they noticed a man exposing himself to them.

The victims ran away and called the police.

The man is described as being in his late 20s to early 30s, around 5ft 8" tall with tanned, olive skin. He was of medium build with shaved, dark brown hair and large eyes, lips and teeth. He was wearing light grey jogging bottoms with a navy blue hooded jumper with yellow markings.

If you recognise this man or witnessed anything suspicious, please contact us on 101, quoting PR/45200024926.
