We're appealing for witnesses after a car collided with a tree in Horley earlier this afternoon (31 March).

Officers were called to reports of a single vehicle collision involving a red Citreon along Brighton Road at around 2.50pm this afternoon.

Despite best efforts of the paramedics, a 92-year-old man was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

The A23 northbound carriageway and Sussex Road was closed in both directions while an investigation into the collision was carried out.
