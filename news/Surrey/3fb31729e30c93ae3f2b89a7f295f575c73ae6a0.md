A man from Staines-upon-Thames has been arrested after being found in possession of an imitation firearm and seven wraps of white powder, believed to be class A drugs.

Officers stopped the man behind the Tesco Superstore on Greenway Terrace, Stanwell at around 3am this morning (16 April) after he was seen acting suspiciously.

The man smelt strongly of cannabis and upon being searched, officers located an imitation handgun in the waist band of his trousers and seven wraps of what is believed to be cocaine.

The 33-year-old was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A drugs and possession of an imitation firearm.

Maxine Cilia, Borough Commander for Spelthorne said: "This was an excellent stop by officers resulting in the recovery of a substantial quantity of suspected class A drugs and an imitation firearm which have now been taken off our streets.

"Despite the ongoing crisis, we are still out there and will continue to do all we can to protect our communities from harm."

The man remains in custody with us whilst the investigation continues.
