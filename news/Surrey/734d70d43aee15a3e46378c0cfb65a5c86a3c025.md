We are appealing for witnesses following an unprovoked attack in Sunbury-on-Thames on Wednesday evening (2 December).

A man was walking home from work around 8.30pm and decided to take a short cut through the estate across Spelthorne Grove. After getting lost, he asked a group of around 10 youths for directions on how to leave the estate. One of the male youths from the group punched him and pushed him to the ground before they all ran off.

The victim was taken to hospital with a broken shoulder.

The group were aged 14-18 years and were both male and female.

Detective Constable Connor Leney, who is investigating the incident, said: "This appears to be an unprovoked and random attack which has taken the victim completely by surprise as he all he did was stop to ask for directions. There are lots of residential properties in the vicinity and we are appealing to anyone who was in the area at the time, or who might have any mobile phone or CCTV footage, to get in touch with us straightaway so that we can progress our investigation."
