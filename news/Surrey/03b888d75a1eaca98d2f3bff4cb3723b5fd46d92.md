Surrey Officers and forensic teams are currently on scene at Church Street in Epsom following a serious sexual assault which occurred last night (19 September).

Officers were called around 9:30pm following reports of members of the public witnessing a sexual assault against a young woman. Following the public's concerns, the suspects were detained close to Ashley Road and then arrested when our officers arrived shortly after. The two suspects, both boys under the age of 16 are currently in custody.

The scene has been sealed off and a cordon is expected to remain in place until further notice.

Detective Inspector Andy Skoglund said "We would firstly like to thank the quick thinking, observant members of the public who assisted in helping the victim and have been helping us with our initial enquiries.

"We have spoken to many witnesses already who were predominately outside the Ye Olde Kings Head Pub on Church Street but looking to anyone who may have any more information to get in contact with us.

"If you have any dashcam or CCTV footage of Church Street, Rosebery Park, Heathcote Road, Downside or St Martin's Avenue taken around that time you may be able to really help us with this investigation.

"Local residents will see us on scene for the remainder of the day whilst we carry out our enquiries and may notice an increased police presence over the next couple of days. This is nothing to be concerned out and we ask that you please respect the cordons that are in place."
