We are appealing for witnesses following a serious assault which took place in Priory Park, Reigate, on Sunday (14 March).

Officers were called to the park at around 3:45pm following reports of an altercation between a group of teenagers close to the pond. Shortly afterwards, a call was received from East Surrey Hospital to say a 16 year-old boy had been admitted with injuries, believed to be as a result of this altercation.

The boy's injuries are not deemed to be life-threatening.

Detective Constable Nick Boulton, who is investigating, said: "We are appealing for the public's help in determining how the victim received these injuries.

"We believe the victim and suspects are known to each other and there is no risk to the wider public."
