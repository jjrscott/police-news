A man arrested following the discovery of a woman's body at an address in Walton-on-Thames yesterday (9 April), has been released with no further action..

The body of the 35-year-old woman was found at an address in Wellington Close just before 3am.
Her family has been made aware and our thoughts are with them at this time.
A post mortem has been completed today (10 April), and as a result the 39-year-old man who had been arrested on suspicion of murder has now been released with no further action.
The death remains unexplained at this time and our enquiries are continuing on behalf of the Coroner.
