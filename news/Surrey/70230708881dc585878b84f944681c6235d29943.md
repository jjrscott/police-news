We are appealing for witnesses after a collision on Maybury Road earlier today (18 November).

Officers were called at around 3pm this afternoon following reports of a serious collision between a car and a push bike.

A female cyclist was treated at the scene by paramedics and taken to hospital with serious injuries.

Maybury Road remains closed whilst officers deal with the incident.

Sergeant Gary Lefort said "We are appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or may have seen a Deliveroo delivery cyclist in the lead up to the collision to get in contact.

"Before police arrived, members of the public assisted in helping the injured cyclist and we urge them to get in contact with us to determine the circumstances of this collision."
