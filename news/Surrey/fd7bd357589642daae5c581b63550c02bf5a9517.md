We're releasing images of a number of tools, which we believe may be stolen following the stop check of a car in Esher.

We're releasing images of a number of tools, which we believe may be stolen following the stop check of a car in Esher.

Following the vehicle stop, three men were found in the possession of crowbars, balaclavas, gloves and an unspecified quantity of a herbal substance. The men were arrested and have been released under investigation.

A number of tools were recovered from the boot of the vehicle. We are releasing images of examples of some of these items as we believe they may be stolen. These include lawnmowers, toolboxes and drills.

If they belong to you please call 101 quoting 4519011753 with confirmation of model serial numbers.
