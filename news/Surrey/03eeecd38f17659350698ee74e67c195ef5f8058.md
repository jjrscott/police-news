We are appealing for witnesses following two incidents, which occurred on the afternoon of Friday (12 March), in New Haw.

The first incident involved an attempted robbery of a young girl at around 3.45pm on Scotland Bridge Road, New Haw, by two suspects. The victim was verbally and physically intimidated by the suspects but fortunately nothing was taken.

The second incident occurred at around 5.15pm on Woodham Lane, Addlestone, where two young boys were also approached by two suspects, verbally intimidated and then threatened with violence. Luckily the two victims managed to get away unhurt and nothing was taken from them.

The suspects are described as a white teenage boy and girl and are to be believed to between the ages of 13 and 18 years of age.

The boy is believed to be around 5ft tall, of slim build, with short blonde hair and wearing a black rain coat and black tracksuit bottoms. The girl is described as being around 5ft 6 tall, of heavy build, with long brown hair in a ponytail and wearing a black t-shirt and black skinny jeans.

The two incidents are believed to be linked and are being thoroughly investigated by officers.
