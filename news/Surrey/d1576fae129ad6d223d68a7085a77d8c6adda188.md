We are appealing for help to find Charlie Saunter, who is wanted in connection with a burglary in Camberley.

Thieves broke into a residential address in Camberley between 10:30pm on 12 March and 5:15am on 13 March, stealing numerous items, including games consoles, mobile phones, laptops and a wallet. The victim's debit card was later used to purchase items from the Esso garage on Frimley Road.

We need to locate 20-year-old Charlie Saunter, of no fixed abode, in connection with this incident. He is described as white, 5ft 9 tall with short brown hair. Saunter has links to Camberley and East Sussex.

An 18-year-old man was arrested in connection with the burglary and has been released under investigation.

If you know where he is or have any information which might help, please call 101 and quote ref PR/45200028700. Alternatively, if you do not wish to leave your name, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
