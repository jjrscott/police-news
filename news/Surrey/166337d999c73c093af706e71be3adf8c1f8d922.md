A police dog (PD) used his tracking skills to find a vulnerable man in Cobham on Tuesday (2 March).

There were concerns for man's safety, who was found in a wooded area in Painshill Park.

PD Gunny was enlisted to help with the search, and quickly located him close to the river. The man was found and treated by South East Coast Ambulance, before being taken to hospital.

PC Neil Sanders, PD Gunny's handler, said: "Although this was all part of a day's work for a police dog, Gunny's excellent tracking skills meant that we were able to find the man quickly and ensure that he received the care and treatment he needed. Police dogs are invaluable when it comes to searches and it is always a bonus when they end successfully."

This latest success story for PD Gunny comes just weeks after he helped to track down property that had been discarded during a police pursuit in Walton-on-Thames (15 February).
