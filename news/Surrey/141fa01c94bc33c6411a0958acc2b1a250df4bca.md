Do you recognise these sunglasses?

They were found, along with a quantity of purses and a bottle of 22-year-old whiskey, after a vehicle was stopped in Roehampton last Thursday evening (21 November).

We believe these items are stolen, and are hoping to reunite them with their rightful owners.

Following the vehicle stop, the 32-year-old male driver was arrested on suspicion of driving otherwise in accordance with a licence and theft of a motor vehicle. Both the driver and his female passenger, 19, were also arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit burglary. They have both been released on conditional bail. The investigation remains ongoing.

If you are the owner of these items, or you have any information which could help us, please call 101, quoting reference PR/45190125318.
