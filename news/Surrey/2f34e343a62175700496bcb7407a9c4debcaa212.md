The family of a man killed in a collision in Whyteleafe have paid tribute, describing him as a "kind, happy and caring young man."

Matthew Berry, 30 from Warlingham was killed following a collision with a car whilst he out walking along the A22 Godstone Road on Thursday, 9 January. His family have since paid tribute:

"Matthew was a kind, caring, happy young man whose sense of fun, energy and light filled the lives of all who knew him. He was just 30 years old and had his whole life ahead of him. That life has been so cruelly taken away. He is loved and sorely missed by everyone.

"Matthew is survived by his wife, Sarah, whom he married in May of last year and by his parents, Allen and Carole and sister, Laura.

"The family would like to thank all of the friends, family, colleagues and wider members of society who have sent their kind and heartfelt messages of love and condolence, which are very much appreciated.

"The family is simply devastated at their loss and has asked to be left alone to grieve following this unbelievably painful tragedy."

This investigation remains ongoing with the Serious Collision Investigation Unit. A 25 year old man from Kenley was arrested in connection and has been released under investigation.
