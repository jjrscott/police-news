We are trying to reunite these items, which we believe have been stolen, with their rightful owner.

The jewellery was recovered following the arrest of three men on suspicion of conspiracy to burgle. A suitcase and a quantity of children's books were also found.

The men, including a 37-year-old from Ascot, Berkshire, a 20-year-old from Stanwell and a 21-year-old from Staines-upon-Thames, were arrested following a police pursuit in Virginia Water in the early hours today (3 December).

If you are the owner of this jewellery, or you have any other information which could assist us, please call us on 101, quoting reference PR/45190129589. Alternatively, if you do not wish to leave your name, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
