We're currently investigating a serious injury collision involving a car and a pedestrian at the A24 junction with London Road in Dorking.

Road closures are expected to be in place for some time this evening on the A24 northbound and associated slip road at the junction with London Road close to the Esso garage.

A 22 year-old man is being treated for a life threatening head injury after he was involved in a collision with a black Volvo V50 estate, which was turning into London Road, at around 5:45pm this evening.

We are appealing for anyone who saw what happened to contact us.

Anyone with information should call 101 quoting P20025895.

Alternatively, if you do not wish to leave your name, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
