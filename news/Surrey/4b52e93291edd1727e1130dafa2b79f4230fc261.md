Three women have been arrested on suspicion of modern slavery offences in Epsom.

Two women have been arrested on suspicion of running a brothel in Epsom after officers carried out a warrant on Monday (25 November).
A 31-year-old of no fixed address was arrested on suspicion of running a brothel under Section 33 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 and released under investigation.
A 23-year-old of no fixed address was arrested on suspicion of running a brothel under Section 33 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 and released under investigation.
A 44-year-old woman of no fixed address was also arrested on suspicion of immigration offences. She has been released and will be referred to immigration services.
More than 50 officers and staff from Surrey Police, as well as partners from other agencies, took part in the four warrants which were carried out at addresses across Epsom.
East Surrey Sergeant James Dawborn said: "The local team in Epsom identified a number of addresses that we believed to be operating as brothels, where women were being trafficked into and around the country.
''We executed several warrants in conjunction with the South East Regional Organised Crime Unit (SEROCU), which resulted in three women being removed from those addresses. They were taken to a dedicated reception centre where other agencies, including Epsom and Ewell Borough Council, Streetlight, Red Cross and Justice and Care were able to provide emotional and physical support.
''We all have a duty to do everything we can to tackle modern slavery and human trafficking in our local communities and ensure that vulnerable victims are safeguarded.''
Modern slavery is a hidden crime and growing problem in our county. In the last three months, Surrey Police has received 26 reports in relation to potential modern slavery cases.
It can be difficult to spot the signs of modern slavery. If you encounter a situation which doesn't seem right, even if you're not quite sure about it, we would encourage you to report it by contacting Surrey Police on 101 (999 in an emergency)
