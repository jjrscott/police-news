On Friday, 20 March, Surrey Police detectives arrested a man who had been wanted by the Polish authorities for eighteen years.

Adam Danielewicz, who was using a name that Polish authorities confirmed belonged to a deceased man, was wanted on a European arrest warrant on charges of drug trafficking, firearms possession and fraud. Danielewicz was located at an address in Walton on Thames.

At a hearing at Westminster Magistrates Court on 21 March, Danielewicz was remanded in custody for the extradition process to continue. He had been sentenced for six and a half years by a Polish court in his absence and the process of him starting to serve that sentence will now begin.

Detective Sergeant Martyn Linton who led the operation said "This is a significant arrest for very serious offences that have taken place in Poland. Danielewicz thought that he could evade justice by hiding in Surrey under a false name. We work with colleagues from around the world on a daily basis and Surrey is not a safe place for fugitives to hide. We will find you".
