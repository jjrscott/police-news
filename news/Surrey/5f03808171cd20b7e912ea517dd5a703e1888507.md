We are appealing for witnesses following a dog attack in Long Gore in Godalming.

We were called at around 10pm on Friday (25 September), following reports that a dog had attacked another dog.

On arrival, two dogs were found injured at the location. Both were taken to a veterinary surgery for treatment, and one has sadly been put to sleep since as a result of its injuries.

A 53 year-old man has been arrested, interviewed and bailed while the investigation continues. His dog has been handed over to Surrey Police.

If you were in the area around Long Gore between 9.30 and 10pm on Friday 25 September and have any information, dash cam or mobile phone footage that may help us, please get in touch.

You can direct message us or report online using webchat or our webform https://www.surrey.police.uk/ro/report/ocr/af/how-to-report-a-crime/ on the Surrey Police website, quoting crime reference number 452000102368.

If you do not wish to speak to police, you can also call independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

In an emergency, please call 999.
