We are appealing for witnesses following an incident outside Thames Court Pub on Friday, August 14.

At around 11pm the suspect, who was believed to have been intoxicated, was seen acting in an aggressive manner, shouting racist abuse from the tow path following a physical altercation.

The suspect has been described as being around 5'8" tall, with short brown hair and wearing a grey t-shirt, black trousers and grey high top trainers with a white sole. He had a cut on his left cheek and spoke with a South African accent.

PC Ben Nardoni, who is investigating the incident said: "We will not tolerate this type of crime in Surrey, and would ask that anyone who was in the area on Friday, 14 August and saw anything, to come forward."
