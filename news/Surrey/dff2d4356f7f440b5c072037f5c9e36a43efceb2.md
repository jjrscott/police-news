We are appealing for witnesses following a robbery on Frimley High Street on Wednesday (11 November).

The victim was walking along the High Street near Subway at around 4.20pm when he was grabbed by the two suspects who held what the victim believed to be a knife to his throat. They then demanded that he remove his jacket and give it to them.

The suspects have both been described as white teenagers. Suspect one was of a skinny build, around 5'8" - 5'10" tall and wearing a puffa jacket and medical mask. The second suspect was also of a skinny build, around 5'8" - 5'9" tall and wearing a grey tracksuit with the hood up, black gloves, a blue medical mask and carrying a black cross body bag.

Investigating Officer, Detective Sergeant Emma Broad, said: "We would like to reassure people that incidents such as this, while shocking, are rare and we are doing all we can to find the perpetrators. If you do have any information that might help our investigation, please get in touch."
