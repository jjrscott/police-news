We are appealing for witnesses following a further incident of sexual exposure in Woking which occurred on Friday, 15 January around 12:30pm on the Basingstoke Canal near Sheerwater, Woking.

The victim was running on the towpath towards Sheerwater and was approached by the suspect who sexually exposed himself before running away towards Woking town.

The suspect is described as a male with olive skin around 30-years-old, skinny build and approximately 5 ft 8 tall. He was seen wearing a grey colour tracksuit of which the hoodie had a chunky zip front.

We are asking anyone in the area of Sheerwater recreation ground with CCTV installed at home or anyone who was driving nearby and may have dashcam footage, to please check for anyone matching this description, or seen behaving strangely.

Inspector Dave Bentley, Borough Commander for Woking said: "We firmly believe that someone in our community will hold the key to identifying this man.

"Please ask yourself whether you know anyone who has been acting strangely - or who was out and about around lunchtime on Friday - who matches our description. If you live in the area, or were driving in the area on Friday, please check your CCTV or dashcam footage; you could hold crucial information that will help us catch this man.

"If you don't want to contact police, you can report any concerns to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111"

Users of the towpath and Woking residents are being urged to exercise caution after a number of offences were reported to Surrey Police which we believe have been committed by different offenders. Any suspicious behaviour or incidents should be reported to us at the time or as soon as it is safe to do so.

 * trust your instincts and if you think a situation is getting worse, look for a way to escape
 * put distance between yourself and the other person if you are able to
 * call 999 as soon as you can.
