We are appealing for witness following an incident between two groups of men outside Jacks Fish and Chip shop in Bagshot on July 14.

A fight broke out between the two groups at around 5.30pm outside the fish and chip shop on the A30. This then continued on to the Guildford Road near to the junction with Waverley Road.

Two men have received minor injuries as a result.

The group have been described as four white men in their late teens.

PC Sam Holloway, the investigating officer, said: "We are seeking witnesses to this incident which happened in broad daylight in the busy Bagshot town centre. There would have been many people passing in their cars or on foot who may be able to help us piece together what happened."

Two men have been questioned about the incident and released under investigation.
