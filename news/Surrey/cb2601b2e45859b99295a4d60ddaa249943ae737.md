It was discovered during a police search of a property in Chertsey on Wednesday, April 15.

Officers attended the address at Cowley Avenue in Chertsey and found the electric mobility scooter which did not belong to the property owner.

The scooter is described as a custom made with Wake Best bicycle handle bars and a Zoom hydraulic disc.

We would like to reunite the mobility scooter with its owner, so if you have any information or know who it could belong to, please call 101, quoting reference number PR/45200039663.
