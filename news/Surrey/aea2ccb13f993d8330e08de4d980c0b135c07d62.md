Local residents will have an opportunity to find out more about plans for the new Headquarters and Eastern Operating Base for Surrey Police in Leatherhead at an online community consultation event taking place tomorrow (Thursday, 11 March 2021).

The Surrey Police team will be joined by designers Scott Brownrigg and planning consultants Vail Williams to present the draft masterplan for a new estate for Surrey Police. The site will be the Force's new home for many years and for generations of future serving officers and staff. It will be a site that both the Force and the community can be proud of.

As well as being our new HQ and Eastern Operating Base, other county-wide operational teams such as Roads Policing, the Contact Centre and Forensics, as well as many others, will be re-locating to Leatherhead.

The online community consultation event will give the public an opportunity to learn more about the plans, see the first design ideas and ask questions of the project team through a dedicated Q&A session.

The event will run from 6pm to 7:30pm on Thursday, 11 March.

Anyone interested in joining the online session should visit https://www.surrey.police.uk/police-forces/surrey-police/areas/au/about-us/newhq/our-new-hq-and-eastern-base/ to sign up.

Chief Constable Gavin Stephens said: "We have been looking for the right site for a number of years and we are delighted to say that the former Electrical Research Association (ERA) and Cobham Industries site on Cleeve Road is exactly what we are looking for.

"Leatherhead will be home for lots of us for many years. It will serve generations of future police officers and staff so we are working hard to ensure it meets both the community and our needs. It will be a site that both the Force and the community can be proud of.

"Many serving officers, staff and volunteers have generations of family members working in the Force or have done so in years gone by and this is what makes us look and feel a family force. This sense of pride in the Force and the privilege to serve our communities means that it is so important to hear your views on the new development."
