We are appealing for witnesses following an incident of indecent exposure in Woking.

Officers were called to Sparvell Road in Woking on Saturday (20 June) following reports of an indecent exposure which allegedly occurred around 5:30PM.

The victim was approached by the suspect who exposed himself before walking away. Did you see a male wearing a t-shirt with light blue jersey shorts and black trainers in the area?

We are appealing to anyone who may have seen anything or have any further information or dash cam / CCTV footage from this area or surrounding streets at this time to get in touch, quoting reference number PR/45200063545.

Surrey Police are keen to encourage members of the public that if you see or experience any such incident please call police immediately using 999.

Sergeant Edward Lyons said "This is sadly not the first incident like this we've had in the area recently. Anyone with any further information, please get in contact so we can find who is responsible. We also urge victims who may not have reported to contact us on 101.
