We are appealing for witnesses following a serious collision on the A240 Kingston Road at the Ewell Junction with Ruxley Lane at 11pm last night (19 March).

The collision, involving a silver BMW 1 Series and a grey Volkswagen Golf, resulted in the road being closed for several hours whilst officers investigated the incident.

A 32-year-old man was taken to hospital with life threatening injuries and two others were treated at the scene for minor injuries.

If you witnessed the incident or have any dashcam footage, please call us on 101 and quote ref PR/45200031112.
