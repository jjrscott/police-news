We are appealing for witnesses following an incident where a horse bolted and ran into the main Petworth Road in Milford on August 30.

Officers attended the scene after the incident at around 4.40pm and spoke to a number of people.

Witnesses at the scene claimed the horse bolted, ran into a street lamp before falling down a bank. It then made its way back up the bank before falling in front of a car.

The officers checked the horse at the scene and it didn't appear to have any physical injuries.

PC Luke Flint from Waverley Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: "We attended the scene and spoke to a number of people on the day but I need them to come forward so I can speak to them further in order to establish the facts around what happened."
