Two men have been sentenced today (14 October), to a combined total of 15 years for sexually assaulting a woman and robbing her of her handbag in Staines-upon-Thames on 7 August.

They were sentenced at Guildford Crown Court after pleading guilty to all charges.

The victim was walking over a bridge towards the town centre when two men ran up behind her and dragged her to the floor. The men held her down and tried to take her clothes off, sexually assaulting her. She tried to push them off before they ran away with her bag, phone and house keys.

A member of the public called the police after finding the woman in distress nearby. The men were identified via CCTV which captured them following the woman and then running off with her handbag.

Ionut Cristea, 27, Green Lane, Staines-upon-Thames, was sentenced to four and a half years for robbery and seven years' imprisonment for sexual assault by penetration, to be served concurrently. He has been ordered to serve a minimum of two thirds of his sentence.

Valentin Buga, 19, Green Lane, Staines-upon-Thames, was sentenced to four years for robbery.

Detective Inspector Vicki Preston, said: "This was a senseless and unprovoked attack which has understandably left the victim extremely shaken. I would like to commend her for her bravery in coming forward and supporting our investigation.

"I hope that today's outcome will help provide closure for the victim and allow her to move on with her life.

DI Preston continued: "I would like to thank those members of the public specifically, who assisted us with our investigation which led to the prompt arrest of those responsible.

The fact that both men are behind bars reflects the lengthy and thorough investigation which was carried out following the attack, and I would also like to thank all those involved for their hard work and determination.
