We are appealing for the public's help in locating two brothers, who are both wanted by officers.

Daniel Andrews, 29, of Crestway, Wandsworth, is wanted for breaching a community order imposed by Guildford Crown Court. We would also like to speak to him in relation to a theft investigation.

He is described as white, approximately 6ft. 1 inches tall and of a large build. He has short, light brown hair and was last seen with a beard.

Luke Andrews, 22, of no fixed abode, is wanted on recall to prison, after failing to comply with the conditions of his licence.

He is described as white, 5 ft. 7 inches tall, of slim build, with short brown hair and blue eyes.

They are believed to be in the Epsom area, and also have links to Wandworth in London.

If you have any information which may assist officers in locating the Andrews brothers, please call 101 or report online (www.surrey.police.uk/ro/report/) quoting reference number PR/45190078865.

If you'd prefer not to speak to police, you can give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form
(www.crimestoppers-uk.org/).
