Did you notice anything suspicious in Riverview Road, Epsom on the night of July 9?

We're appealing for members of the public to come forward with dash cam footage and information after a burglary in Riverview Road where two motorbikes and two mountain bikes were stolen from a shed.

Investigating officer, PC James Wheatland, from the Epsom Neighbourhood Policing Team, said "The suspects got into the garden by climbing over the fence. They then smashed the lock on the door of the garage and gained entry. They removed fence panels adjoined with the neighbouring property in order to get the bikes out. All the bikes stolen were quite distinctive, for example one was a white mountain bike which only had one fork in the front wheel. So if you've been offered these for sale recently, in suspicious circumstances, please let us know."

The burglary is thought to have occurred between 9pm on Thursday, 9 July and 7.30am on Friday, 10 July.
