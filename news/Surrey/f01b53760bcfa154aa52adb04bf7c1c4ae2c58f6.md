Lashah Scott, 26, of London Road, Croydon, was sentenced to four years and six months in prison for two counts of possession with intent to supply class A drugs at Kingston Crown Court on Monday (29 March).

Scott was arrested in October 2020 after investigative work by Surrey Police and the Metropolitan Police's specialist county lines team.

County lines is the name given to urban drug dealers expanding their activities into smaller towns and rural areas, primarily to supply crack cocaine and heroin. Surrey Police had been investigating the activities of a particular county line that was operating in north Surrey, and with Met colleagues' help were able to connect Scott to a phone that was used to conduct drug deals.

When Scott's home was searched, crack cocaine, Â£4000 in cash and the phone used to operate the line were recovered.

Detective Chief Inspector Matt Chapman from the force's serious and organised crime team says: "We are focusing our efforts on finding and bringing to justice the criminals 'at the top'; those who orchestrate and control county lines. We believe Scott was playing a key role in a drugs supply line that was bringing criminality into our communities so to see him sentenced on Monday to a lengthy period behind bars was extremely satisfying.

"Centurion, Surrey Police's county lines task force, continue to work hard to stop drug supply networks coming in to the county and to target those serious and persistent offenders who prey on the most vulnerable."
