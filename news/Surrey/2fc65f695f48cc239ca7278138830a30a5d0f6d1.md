Police dog Oakley was called to action yesterday evening (18 January), after a multi-vehicle collision.

Officers were called to reports of a collision on a slip road between a HGV, van and a car near junction 3 on the northbound carriageway at around 6.30pm.

When they arrived at the scene, a driver involved in the incident abandoned their vehicle and was nowhere to be found.

Expert tracker dog Oakley was quickly tasked with tracking the scent.

A short time later, Oakley found discovered the driver in woodland next to the motorway.

A 48-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving, failing to provide a specimen and failing to stop at the scene of a collision.

A 32-year-old woman remains in hospital with potentially life-threatening injuries.
