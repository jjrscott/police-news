A body, believed to be that of missing teenager Oliver Strode, was found in Alice Holt Forest earlier today (30 March).

The discovery was made around 2pm.

Although formal identification is yet to take place, Oliver's family are aware and are being given the appropriate support. Our thoughts remain with them at this difficult time.

17-year-old Oliver was reported missing on 19 March.

Enquiries remain ongoing to establish the circumstances of the death, although it is not believed to be suspicious or that there is any third party involvement at this time.

We would like to thank everyone who shared our appeal and assisted with the search.
