We are appealing for witnesses after a black Range Rover was stolen from a driveway in Chertsey.

It is believed the theft of the vehicle occurred between 11pm on Wednesday, 17 March, and 12.20am on Thursday, 18 March, from a residential property on Knoll Park Road.

We are appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the incident or have any dashcam or Ring doorbell footage, to get in touch.

We have blurred the registration plates in the CCTV footage to protect the victim, but also because we believe that the vehicle will likely now be using false plates.

If you have any information which could help, please contact us quoting crime reference number PR/45210027585 via:
