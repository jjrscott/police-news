We are appealing for witnesses following an assault in Guildford on Friday, 27 November.

Officers were called to Woking Road in Guildford shortly before 5pm following reports of a man being assaulted at the side of the road.

The victim had engaged in argument with the suspect. They then both got out of their vehicles and the suspect punched the victim in the face. The victim was taken to hospital with a broken nose.

The suspect is described as a white man in his early 20s with brown curly hair and a full sleeve tattoo on his arm. He was wearing a grey and red jumper.

PC Rachel Munday said "This assault took place on a busy road approaching rush hour time, so we are appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the assault or have any dashcam footage to get in touch."
