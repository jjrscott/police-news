We are appealing for witnesses following a collision on the A3 shortly after 2PM this afternoon (14 August).

Officers were pursuing a silver Mazda in response to a 999 call when the vehicle joined the A3 near Pains Hill southbound and begun to travel northbound on the hard shoulder. The vehicle then collided with a black Lexus, leaving a member of the public with minor injuries.

Officers remain at the scene with South East Coast Ambulance, Surrey Fire and Rescue and are currently dealing with traffic management. We thank motorists stuck in traffic for their patience and we advise those planning to travel in the area to find alternative routes.

Enquiries are ongoing to determine what has happened and we are looking for anyone with any further information or any dashcam footage, who may have witnessed a silver Mazda driving dangerously in the area to contact us quoting reference number PR/P20188022 via
