We are appealing for witnesses and dashcam footage after a knifepoint robbery in Farnham on Sunday 15 November.

At about 5.20pm, the 17 year-old victim was cycling along Hale Road towards the Six Bells roundabout when he was approached by two men on mopeds driving at speed towards him. They blocked him in and produced a knife, which they threatened him with and demanded money, before riding away.

The first suspect was described as approximately 6ft 3 tall, and of a large athletic build. He wore grey tracksuit bottoms, a black leather jacket and black biker gloves. He wore a white crash helmet on with the visor down, and spoke with a south London accent. His moped was black or white.

The second man is described as approximately 6ft tall, he was of a skinny build and wore grey tracksuit bottoms and a black leather jacket. He also wore a white crash helmet.

Investigating Officer PC Charlotte Davis said: "This was a very distressing incident for the victim. Fortunately he didn't come to any physical harm, but we are keen to speak to anyone in the area at the time who may have any dash cam footage that may assist our investigation."
