A PTA treasurer from Frimley admitted she stole Â£24,493 over a three year period from its charity bank account when she appeared in court earlier this month.

Danielle Smith, 42, of Frimley, who was the treasurer of the Friends of the Grove (FOG) Parent Teacher Association at the time, was sentenced to 28 months' imprisonment, suspended for two years, after admitting to transferring money from the FOG account into one linked to her and the theft of cash from events held by the charity for the children.

Smith was also ordered to fulfil a 25 day rehabilitation requirement, carry out 100 hours' unpaid work and pay a victim surcharge when she appeared at Guildford Crown Court on 6 November.

The matter was reported to Surrey Police which carried out a full and thorough investigation.

Smith initially only pleaded guilty to online theft but, faced with the overwhelming evidence against her, eventually changed her plea to guilty for 12 counts of theft of cash.

Investigating officer PC Roxy Hudson said: "Not only did Smith take a large amount of cash from the school's charity bank account over a substantial period of time, she also lied about it and tried to blame it on other people who had assisted at the various events held to raise money for the school. Smith clearly abused her position of trust and took money that was raised in good faith to improve the facilities at the school and provide essential equipment for the children. She has done this for her own gain and this is simply unacceptable."
