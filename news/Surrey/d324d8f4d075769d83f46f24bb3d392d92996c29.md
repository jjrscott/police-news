Updated News Post

A man has been found after we issued an appeal for information about his whereabouts.

The appeal was issued after Danny Keet, 39-years-old, was wanted on recall to prison after breaching the conditions of his licence.

We would like to thank everyone who provided information and shared our appeal.
