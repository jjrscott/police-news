Two 17-year-old boys from Woking have been sentenced to a total of six years and three months between them for supplying Class A drugs.

During a 15 month period between 2018 and 2019, the two boys were arrested multiple times for dealing drugs, predominantly in the area of Walton Court.

The arrests resulted in officers seizing 92 wraps of heroin and 140 wraps of crack cocaine.

Both of the defendants were sentenced to three years each for their role in supplying class A drugs and one boy received a further three months for his part in a robbery in Woking in September last year. They have both been on remand since December last year.

Borough Commander David Bentley said: "Walton Court had become a well-known hotspot for drug dealing and anti-social behaviour. Residents faced intimidation on a daily basis. The two defendants were prolific drug dealers and orchestrated much of the criminal activity in this area of Woking. I hope that the fact these are two are now behind bars will send a warning to others involved in the supply of drugs that this behaviour will not be tolerated and is ultimately not worth it."

The thought of your child being sucked in to the drug dealing world is a horrifying prospect. Many parents question how they can prevent it, what behaviours they should be concerned about, or where they can get support if they're worried.

Our view is that it's really important to be aware of the risks they face and continue age-appropriate conversations with your child(ren). More information and guides for parents here: https://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/what-is-county-lines

The warning signs of drug dealing activity are:

 * Going missing
 * Physical injuries
 * Misuse of drugs or alcohol
 * Involvement in offending
 * Deterioration in physical appearance
 * Emotional distance from family members
 * Receiving gifts from unknown sources
 * Recruiting others into exploitative situations
 * Poor mental health
 * Self harming
