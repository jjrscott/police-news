Prolific offender Ben Collis Osbourne, 29, has been issued with a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) following a series of thefts from local shops in Addlestone and Chertsey.

The order prevents him from entering particular shops.

**In Addlestone:**

Co-op, Church Road and New Haw Road

Majestic Wine, New Haw Road

Waitrose, Market Street

Tesco, Station Road

Iceland, Station Road

Alldays, Ongar Parade

**In Chertsey:**

Co-op, Fordwater Road

One Stop, Windsor Street

**In West Byfleet:**

Budgens, Vanners Parade

It also prevents Collis Osbourne from carrying hypodermic needles in public, other than in a safe or enclosed bag or container, and prevents him from disposing of needles in any way other than in a designated needle bin.

The order will remain in place until 2 March 2023.

Runnymede Borough Commander Nick Pinkerton said "In addition to the thefts, Ben Collis Osbourne regularly displays aggressive and intimidating behaviour. He has a real negative impact on our local community and on how safe residents and workers feel in the areas he frequents. Evidence provided by the community plays a really important part in the court's decision to grant a CBO so I am grateful to everyone who helped us obtain this order.

"We won't tolerate this kind of behaviour and we hope that the CBO provides the local community - and in particular local shops - with some reassurance."

Breaches of the conditions of a CBO can lead to arrest. The police rely on members of the public to report this information and you can do so by sending us a private message on any of our Facebook or Twitter pages, or by using the report online or live chat functions on our website http://www.surrey.police.uk.
