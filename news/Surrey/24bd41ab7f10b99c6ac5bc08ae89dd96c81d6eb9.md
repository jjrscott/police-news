PC Stevie Spurgeon has been nominated for a Police Federation Bravery Award after rescuing a partially sighted woman who had fallen onto the train tracks at Leicester Square Underground station in February 2019.

Whilst on a training course in London on 12 February 2019, PC Spurgeon was waiting at the tube platform when she witnessed a commuter fall onto the train tracks. The woman was partially blind and had clearly broken her ankle, so PC Spurgeon rushed to help her whilst radioing her colleagues for further assistance.

The woman was lifted off the platform to safety and PC Spurgeon carried out the first aid necessary whilst waiting for the paramedics to arrive.

PC Spurgeon is usually based at Woking Station but is currently on an out of force secondment.

She said: "I believe that anyone in that situation would have done the same and I was helped by a brave member of the public who I never managed to speak to and thank afterwards.

"Officers often receive special training before they are required to go onto tracks in these situations, but I knew that I had to act quickly.

I'm just glad that the woman was ok as the situation could have ended badly."

PC Spurgeon will attend the awards ceremony in London in July 2021 at which the winner of the National Police Bravery Awards will be announced.
