We are pleased to confirm we have located a missing 15-year-old boy from Weybridge.

The boy had not been seen since 19 April and was found in Bicester.

We are grateful for the help of the public and media in sharing our appeal, but we now ask that you help us to restore his privacy by removing the appeal from your publications, and from social media.
