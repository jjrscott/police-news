We're appealing for witnesses after a woman was assaulted outside Woking train station on Chertsey Road yesterday evening (28 January).

The victim was with a small group of people when she was approached by the suspect at around 7.40pm.

After a verbal altercation the suspect assaulted her, causing serious injuries to her face, before fleeing the scene.

Officers located the suspect on Oriental Road a short time later. A 23-year-old man from Woking was arrested on suspicion of GBH with intent and remains in custody.

The woman is receiving on-going hospital treatment for her injuries.
