We are appealing for information following the discovery of the body of a 19-year-old near the Chobham Common around 5.20pm last Wednesday (2 December).

The teenager has now been formally identified as Lyndon Turner of the Ascot area.

Enquiries remain ongoing to establish the circumstances of his death, which is being treated as unexplained at this time.

We are appealing for anyone with any information which could help us trace Lyndon's last movements to contact us straightaway. We would particularly like to speak to anyone who saw him between 11pm on Tuesday, 1 December and 5.30pm on 2 December.

Lyndon is described as white, 6ft 2 tall, and of slim build. He was wearing a black North Face fleece jacket, black Nike trainers with a red paint design and was also wearing odd socks.

West Surrey Detective Inspector Pete Howgate said: "Our thoughts remain with Lyndon's family and friends at this time. His death is being treated as unexplained and there is a period of time during which we would like to establish his movements. Please get in touch with us if you can help in any way."

Anyone with any information is asked to contact us quoting incident reference PR/45200127754 via webchat on our website surrey.police.uk or by calling us on 101.
