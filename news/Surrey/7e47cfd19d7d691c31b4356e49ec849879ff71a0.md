We are appealing for witnesses after a group of youths caused a disturbance at Lower Box Hill Farm yesterday afternoon.

Between 3 and 3.30pm, a large group of teenagers were seen to swim in the lake near to the farm. A group of three boys then climbed into an adjacent field to chase a herd of cows. This caused upset to the animals and resulted in one cow suffering a large, deep wound to its side. We are still establishing the circumstances which led to the cow receiving this injury.

We believe the group visit the area regularly and we would like to speak to the individuals involved. Patrols will be increased in the area to dissuade any anti-social behaviour.

Surrey Police would like to remind residents that chasing or threatening animals is not only harmful to the animal, but could also result in potential injury to the person.

If you have any information or CCTV footage which could help, please call 101 and quote ref PR/45200056242.
