We are appealing for help to identify a man in connection with shoplifting offences at a Tesco store in Lingfield.

Three incidents took place at the Plaistow Street store during August and September and involved a large amount of wine being stolen.

The suspect is described as middle-aged and tanned with grey hair.

We'd like to find out who the man is in the image as he may be able to assist with our enquiries.

If you recognise him, you can direct message us or report online using webchat or our webform https://www.surrey.police.uk/ro/report/ocr/af/how-to-report-a-crime/ on the Surrey Police website, quoting crime reference number 45200083155.

If you do not wish to speak to police, you can also call independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

In an emergency, please call 999.
