Yesterday (16 December), we released CCTV of a man we wished to speak to, as we believed they may have information that could assist our investigation into an incident of voyeurism at Spectrum Leisure Centre in Guildford.

We believe we have now identified the man in the CCTV footage.

We are grateful for the media and public's help in circulating the appeal, but would respectfully ask that the image and footage are no longer circulated.
