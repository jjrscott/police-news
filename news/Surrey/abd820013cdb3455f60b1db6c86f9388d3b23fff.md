A second man who was involved in a collision in Laleham in February has sadly died.

The collision, involving a scrambler-type motorcycle and a blue BMW, took place around 5.55pm on 21 February in Shepperton Road near the car park for the play area.
Despite the efforts of the ambulance crew, one of the two men on the motorbike was declared dead at the scene. The other rider was taken to hospital with serious injuries, where he sadly died on 24 February.
