Our investigation remains ongoing following a collision between a car and a pedestrian in Godalming earlier this month.

Unfortunately, the pedestrian died in hospital last Wednesday (March 25), as a result of the injuries he sustained in the collision.

He has been named as Ronald Casson, 74, of Brighton Road, Godalming.

The inquest into his death has been opened and adjourned.

The incident took place at the junction of Brighton Road and Flambards Way at 11pm on Saturday, 7 March.

We are still appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the collision or who may have CCTV or dashcam footage to get in touch. Anyone with any information should contact Surrey Police on 101 and quote the reference number PR/P20055420.
