We are appealing for witnesses after two women were assaulted in Farnham Park on July 12.

The incident happened at around 8.30pm near to the adventure playground. The women were assaulted and subjected to verbal abuse by a group of teenage boys purely because of their sexuality.

The suspects are described as a group of about 10 individuals, all male and aged between 11 to 14 years old wearing tracksuits. They were of South Asian ethnicity.

PC Mike Millward of the Waverley Neighbourhood Policing Team said: "This was a completely unprovoked attack on two women in a public place simply because of their sexuality. We will not tolerate this type of crime in Surrey, and would ask that anyone who was in the area and saw something, to come forward."

We are now asking anyone with information to call Surrey Police on 101 quoting PR/45200073218. If you don't want to speak to police, you can call the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
