We're keen to hear from anyone who may have seen what happened during a suspicious incident in Smallfield near Horley last night (Sunday 13 October).

Shortly after 18:05pm we received a report of a Blue Ford Fiesta and a Grey Vauxhall Astra driving erratically on Redehall Road and that the noise of shots being fired had been heard. We did not receive any reports of anyone being hurt.

Specialist officers were called to the area and have been carrying out extensive enquiries overnight to establish what happened.

Borough Commander, Inspector Dan Gutierrez said: "We're keen to establish what happened and take all reports of this nature very seriously. Officers from the local neighbourhood team will be carrying out patrols in the area over the next few days and speaking to residents".

Anyone who has information or any concerns can speak to one of our uniformed officers carrying out house to house enquiries in the area.

Alternatively you can call 101 quoting 45190108586 or you can use the online reporting system https://www.surrey.police.uk/ro/report/ocr/af/how-to-report-a-crime/ and enter the reference number in the 'Incident Details' section.

You can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111; or through their anonymous online form: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/
