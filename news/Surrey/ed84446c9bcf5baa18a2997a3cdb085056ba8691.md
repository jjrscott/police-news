We're issuing a crime prevention reminder following at least six catalytic converter thefts in Sunbury-on-Thames early in the morning on Monday 20 January.

Honda Jazz, Toyota Prius and Auris vehicles were targeted in Evelyn Crescent, Sutherland Avenue, Maryland Way and Vereker Drive.

We are continuing to work hard to establish if any of the reports are linked. Enquiries are ongoing to identify those responsible.

Thieves are attracted by the value of palladium and rhodium, the metals used in catalytic converters. The best way to prevent theft is to make access to your car's converter as inconvenient and difficult as possible.

Here are some tips to prevent catalytic converter theft:

Park in as well-lit areas where possible.
Park close to building entrances or the nearest road in public car parks. This leaves your vehicle in a location where many people can see it.
If you have a garage use it and keep it locked.
Consider CCTV if your vehicle is parked on your driveway or a RING-type device.
Adjust the security system on your car or have one installed that will activate upon vibration, such as those produced by a saw.
Install a catalytic converter-specific security device, such as 'ARMACAT' or 'CATLOC' \- https://blog.toyota.co.uk/catalytic-converter-theft-how-to-protect-your-car
Consider ID Etching - Etching a catalytic converter with a serial number will help police track a stolen converter and overtly advertising that a vehicle is protected by property marking may also deter offenders as it will potentially reduce the opportunities for selling on the converters at reputable scrap metal dealers. More information on ID etching can be found at www.retainagroup.co.uk
Consider welded bolts - If a catalytic converter is a 'bolt on' it is possible to have the bolts welded shut. This is only a deterrent to the lowest grade of catalytic converter thief working with a wrench but may still be enough of a deterrent to help prevent a theft.

If you see any suspicious activity, please report it to us on 101. Obtain as much information as possible, including any vehicle registrations. Please also call us on 101 with any other information. In an emergency or if a crime is in progress always dial 999.

Alternatively, if you do not wish to leave your name, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 **.**
