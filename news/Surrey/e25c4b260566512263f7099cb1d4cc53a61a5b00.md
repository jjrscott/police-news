We're appealing for witnesses after a white Ford Transit van, that was being used to deliver parcels, was stolen on Pyrcroft Road in Chertsey at around 5pm on Tuesday 21 January.

The 26 year-old driver was making a delivery when he spotted a man he did not know getting into the van. The man threatened the driver after an altercation, but a weapon was not seen. The man then stole the van. The delivery driver was not hurt. The van has subsequently been recovered in Virginia Water.

The delivery driver described the man as:

 * Mixed race.
 * Around 30 years-old.
 * 5ft 11ins tall.
 * Average build.
 * Clean shaven.
 * He was wearing a dark hooded top with the hood up and dark trousers.
 * The man spoke with a foreign accent.

A grey Mercedes E Class with two men inside was also seen acting suspiciously in the area at the time.

Anyone who knows who the man is, saw the Mercedes, or who has information that could assist our enquiries, is asked to call Surrey Police on 101 (999 in an emergency) quoting PR/ 45200008329.

You can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111; or through their anonymous online form: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/
