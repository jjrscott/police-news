A man is behind bars after attempting to sexually assault a woman in Guildford in January 2020.

Callum Boteler, 22, of no fixed address, was sentenced to three years and ten months' imprisonment at Guildford Crown Court yesterday (6 January), after pleading guilty to the charge.

The 20-year-old victim was walking along Portsmouth Road on the evening of 12 January when she noticed Boteler walking behind her before disappearing from sight. A short time later, the victim saw him again as she was approaching an alleyway. As the victim walked past, Boteler tried to speak to her, but she carried on walking. He caught up with her, and attempted to grab her arm.

The victim realised she was being threatened and screamed for help which was heard by three police officers who were on patrol nearby. The officers ran to the woman as the suspect attempted to flee, but the officers managed to arrest Boteler at the scene.

CCTV later showed Boteler following numerous women in Guildford town centre earlier that evening.

Boteler was sentenced after pleading guilty to attempted sexual assault and ordered to serve at least two thirds of his sentence in prison. He has previously been found guilty of similar offences in Sussex and was under a Sexual Harm Prevention Order at the time of he committed the attempted sexual assault.

Detective Constable Kerry Plumb, who investigated the incident, said: "A dangerous sexual offender is now off the streets and behind bars thanks to the bravery of the victim and the hard work of officers. The sentence reflects the seriousness of the crime and the predatory behaviour shown by Boteler that day. I would like to encourage anyone who is the victim of a sexual offence to call us as soon as they can - this gives us the best chance of finding and investigating the person responsible."

 * Try to walk with someone else you know to avoid being alone.
