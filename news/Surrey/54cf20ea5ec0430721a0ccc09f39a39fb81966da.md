Surrey Police has concluded its dig in Bisley as part of the investigation into the historic murder of Tina Baker.

Officers arrived at the land at Priest Lane Farm in Bisley early on Monday morning (10 August), accompanied by the Army and specialist forensic officers. Following three days of activity, the dig has concluded with nothing being found. The activity which has taken place is in relation to Operation Sally, the murder of 41-year old Tina Baker in 2002. Martin Gerald Baker, Tina's husband, was convicted of her murder and sentenced to 14 years behind bars.

Tina's body was never recovered and efforts have continued since by Surrey and Sussex Police's Major Crime Team in order to find out what happened to Tina's body. Information which was received led to the decision to carry out this week's activity.

Detective Inspector Chris Rambour from Surrey and Sussex's Major Crime Team said: "Following a thorough search, nothing has been found and the team has concluded its search.

"We would like to thank the Army for their support and for bringing their expertise to this investigation.

"Despite nothing being discovered, we hope that this has provided reassurance to Tina's family, as well as members of the public, that Surrey Police is committed to pursuing all lines of enquiry and will leave no stone unturned to find out what happened to her body.

"Should new information come to light, we will pursue these lines of enquiry.

"We would like to thank the local community for their patience whilst we have been at the scene this week."
