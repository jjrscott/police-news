We have released images of a man we wish to speak to in connection with a disturbance outside a restaurant in Staines-upon-Thames last month.

Police were called following reports of a fight outside Turtle Bay in the High Street at around 12.40am on Sunday 9 February.

The victim, a man, was knocked unconscious after being pushed to the floor. He suffered a broken jaw, two broken teeth and a deep cut to his chin, which required stitches as a result of the incident.

The suspect is described as his late 20s or early 30s, of a slim build with short, dark hair and facial hair. He was wearing a grey sweatshirt, black jeans with a hole on the right knee, and white trainers.

An investigation is currently underway and we are keen to speak to the man pictured, as he may have information which can assist with our enquiries.

If you know who this man is, or you have any other information that could help our investigation, please call us on 101, quoting crime reference number PR/45200015910.

Alternatively, if you do not wish to leave your name, call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
