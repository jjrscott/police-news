We are pleased to share that a 32 year old man from Woking, who was the subject of an wanted appeal issued yesterday (12 June), has handed himself in to police, and was arrested earlier today.

We are grateful to everyone who shared our appeal but we ask that the wanted appeal is now removed from circulation.
