We have released an E-fit to help identify a man who posed as a fake cop and scammed a woman in her 80's out of thousands of pounds.

The suspect first contacted the victim on Sunday, 27 October, where he pretended to be a Detective Constable. Over the course of four days, the suspect persuaded the victim to withdraw money on a number of occasions arranging to meet them at their home address in Addlestone.

In total, the woman was defrauded out of over Â£20,000.

DC Charlotte Irwin who is investigating the case has said "We are urging the public to get in touch if they either recognise the man in the e-fit image or have any more information for us. If you were travelling along Ongar Hill, Addlestone and have a dash cam please check the times between 11:20 to 11:40 on the 27, 28 October and 11:45 to 11:55 on the 30 October 2019.

"Fraud is a serious offence and we want to hold this man accountable to prevent anyone else falling victim to this type of scam."

If you have any information, please call 101, quoting reference number PR/45190115702.

Fraudulent crimes are increasingly becoming more complex and deceptive, much of which is targeted at vulnerable victims.

Action Fraud advises you that the police will never:

 * Contact you to ask you for your pin and bank details.
 * Ask you to withdraw money to them to hand over for safe keeping.
 * Ask you to transfer money out of your account for fraud reasons
 * Send someone to your home to collect cash, cards or pins.

Operation Signature is Surrey Police's campaign to identify and support vulnerable victims of fraud. see more information.
