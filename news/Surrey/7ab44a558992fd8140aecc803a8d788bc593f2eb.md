We are appealing for witnesses following the theft of goods from Maidenhead Aquatics in Guildford and would like to identify the two men seen in CCTV images.

Officers were called to a theft in progress involving two men at the shop on Epsom Road at 3pm on Monday 9 March, which resulted in Â£4,000 worth of goods being stolen. The stolen goods include a range of high value fish tank pumps.

The two men in the CCTV images are believed to have been driving a blue Ford vehicle which was parked on Epsom Road, travelling in the direction of Dorking.

We are keen to speak to these individuals who may have information about this theft.

You can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111; or through their anonymous online form: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/
