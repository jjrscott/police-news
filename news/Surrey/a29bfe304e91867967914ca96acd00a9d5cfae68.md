We are appealing for witnesses to a knifepoint robbery in West End earlier today, Monday 14 October. The robbery occurred in the car park of the West End Social Club just after midday, but we believe the suspect was in the area from around 11:30.

The suspect is described as being a white male in his early 20's, approximately 5'5" tall of slight build and wearing a dark blue hoodie (with the hood up), and jeans and white trainers.

The victim was approached by the man who threatened her with a knife and then stole her car - a silver Ford Focus (BF61 MBX), which was recovered nearby shortly afterwards, though items of property had been stolen.

We believe the suspect walked towards the car park along Windlesham Road, crossing the A319 Bagshot Road at around 11:30. He is then believed to have left the area shortly after midday in a different vehicle via Guildford Road, Lightwater. We believe that the victim's mobile phone was thrown from the car as the suspect left the area.

If you were in the area between 11:30-12:15 and you witnessed the events, or have an active dashcam and were driving through the area please contact us on 101, quoting incident reference PR/45190108800.

It is important to note that we believe this to be an isolated incident but would advise the public to be vigilant and contact us on 999 in an emergency.
