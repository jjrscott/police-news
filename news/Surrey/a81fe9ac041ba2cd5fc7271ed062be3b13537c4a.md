A vulnerable man in Stanwell who was being exploited for his money has been protected thanks to a Closure Order which was granted by Staines Magistrates' Court on 22 November 2019.

Surrey Police applied for a Closure Order for the property in Stanwell following concerns raised about how a man was being exploited by visitors to his address. One of the perpetrators, who was known to be frequenting this address, is already known to Police for links to County Line drug dealing and so the Spelthorne Neighbourhood Team acted quickly both to safeguard the tenant; and to prevent further incidents of anti - social behaviour from impacting on the wider community.

The Order means any unwanted visitors to the address are liable to be arrested.

Closure orders are just one of a number of tactics the force can use to safeguard vulnerable people, deter potential criminal activity and anti-social behaviour.

PC Lucy Salmon from the Spelthorne Neighbourhood Team said: "Closure Orders give victims their lives back and mean we are able to be on the front foot to stop repeated and unwanted behaviour.

"This man was unfortunately being targeted and now thanks to this Order we can arrest anyone who attends his address with ill intentions."

The Order is in place for three months, until February 21, 2020 and was put in place because the Court agreed it was necessary. Surrey Police will now work with partner agencies, to ensure the tenant is safeguarded in the long term.

**What is mate crime?**

Mate crime is when someone says they are your friend, but they do things that take advantage of you, like ask you for money a lot. A real friend does not need to be bought, and someone who takes your money, asks you to pay for lots of things, or makes you feel uncomfortable is not a true friend.

If someone who says they are your friend hurts you, steals from you or makes you do something you don't want to do, you should tell to someone you trust right away.

**What does the term 'County Lines' mean?**

'County Lines' is a national issue involving the use of mobile phone lines by groups to extend their drug dealing activity into new locations other than their own home address.

The crime is called county lines because a single telephone number is used to order drugs, operated from outside the area.

It nearly always involves the exploitation of vulnerable people; including children and adults who need safeguarding.
