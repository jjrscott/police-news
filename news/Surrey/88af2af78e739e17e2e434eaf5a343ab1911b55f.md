We are appealing for witnesses following an incident of dangerous driving in Stanwell yesterday afternoon (April 30).

Officers attempted to stop a black VW Tiguan in Douglas Road at 4.30pm but the single occupant, believed to be an underage male, failed to stop, driving at speed towards the officers and members of the public. It then sped off in the direction of Stanwell High Street.

If you have any information regarding this incident or any dashcam footage, please call Surrey Police on 101, quoting reference PR/P20098020.
