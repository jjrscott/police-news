We have released CCTV images of two men we would like to speak to in connection with a serious assault outside a shopping centre in Camberley earlier this month.

A man was left with a head injury following the assault, which took place outside the Square Shopping Centre in Princess Way around 6.50pm on Saturday, 7 December.

The victim was approached by two male youths outside the shopping centre and a verbal argument took place. One of the youths punched the victim to the head, causing him to fall and hit his head against a concrete pillar. He lost consciousness as a result of the assault.

He was taken to hospital where he remains in a serious but stable condition.

The youths left the scene following the incident.

The suspect who is believed to have punched the victim is described as white, aged 18-23 years, 5ft 10 tall, of a slim build, with black gelled-back hair, and wearing a khaki jacket with a fur collar, jeans trainers and a gold earring.

If you recognise either of the men in these images, or you have any other information which could assist our investigation, please contact us on 101, quoting crime reference number PR/45190131453. Alternatively, if you do not wish to leave your name, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
