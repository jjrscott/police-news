We are appealing for witnesses following a fatal collision on Windsor Road in Egham.

Officers were called to Windsor Road in Egham just after 10:30am this morning (Friday, 27 March) following reports of a two vehicle collision. The vehicles involved were a silver Volkswagen Passat and a black Nissan Qashqai. The female driver of the Volkswagen Passat was sadly pronounced dead at the scene. The other driver was taken to hospital by air ambulance with serious injuries not believed to be life-threatening.

The A308 Windsor Road remains closed whilst officers are on scene.

We are appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the collision, or have any dashcam footage or further information, to contact us by calling 101, quoting reference number PR/P20069677.
