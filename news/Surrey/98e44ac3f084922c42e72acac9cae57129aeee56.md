A man has been sentenced to two years and five months behind bars after pleading guilty to two counts of indecent assault on a child and two counts of indecency with a child.

Charles Phillip Johnson, 72, of Hall Place Drive, Weybridge, was sentenced when he appeared at Guildford Crown Court yesterday (23 February).

An investigation was launched after the victim came forward in August 2018 to report physical and sexual abuse against him by Johnson which took place between 1976 and 1979 when he was a pupil at Barrow Hills School in Witley. Johnson was a teacher at the school at the time.

Johnson was subsequently arrested and interviewed before being charged in 2019.

Johnson was sentenced to a year in prison on 11 July 2017 after pleading guilty to two counts of indecently assaulting a boy under the age of 14 years. He was also given a 10-year Sexual Harm Prevention Order (SHPO).

The offences also took place at Barrow Hills School between 1979 and 1980 while the victim was a pupil and boarder.

The school was owned by the Josephites (a religious order), but was sold by them in 1990. Since then it has been run by Trustees as an independent charity.

Detective Constable Becky Thomson, who investigated the case, said: "I hope that Johnson's guilty plea and the sentence he has received today will in some way help the victim to come to terms with what's happened and move on with his life.

"He had the courage to report Johnson's predatory behaviour and I'd like to commend his bravery in coming forward.

"I would also encourage any victim to come forward to Surrey Police and report any similar incidents. Surrey Police treats all allegations of sexual abuse, whether recent or non-recent, extremely seriously.

"Our priority is victim care and people need to feel confident that if they come forward and report an offence, we can help. We have a dedicated investigation team for such crime and the dedicated unit works to obtain best evidence.

"We also work closely with our partner agencies to pride support and care to victims."
