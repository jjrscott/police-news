All of the items recovered following a stop and search in Ripley have been identified by the owners.

The machinery including two mini diggers, a bobcat, two quad bikes and four motorcross bikes was recovered after officers from our Roads Policing Unit stopped a Scania lorry on the A3 at Ripley on Friday, 3 April.

The driver of the lorry, a man in his 40s, was arrested and has since been released under investigation.

Thank you to everyone who shared our appeal.
