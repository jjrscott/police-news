Surrey Police is appealing for witnesses after two separate callers reported concerns for a woman in a car being driven erratically in the Reigate town area last night.

The car was being driven erratically with its hazard lights on at around 23.25 last night (Saturday 5 October), and the callers described a woman in the car shouting and screaming with at least one other male.

The car is described as being a dark coloured hatchback - possibly a Punto or Corsa.

We are keen to speak to anyone who thinks that they may have seen the same incident; or has dashcam, helmet cam, CCTV, mobile phone or doorball-cam footage from Reigate town centre last night that could help them identify the vehicle or the people within the car.

We are also keen to speak to anyone who recognises the description of the car or the occupants as being them, so that we can confirm that there is not a risk or concern for the people involved.

If you have any information which could help our investigation, please contact Surrey Police on 101 (999 in an emergency) or report online: https://www.surrey.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/cor/tell-us-about-existing-case-report/using reference PR/P19230979.
