The man missing from Sunbury on Thames has been found

We are pleased to update you that we have just had notification from colleagues in another police force area that a man missing from Sunbury on Thames has turned up on their patch.

We'd like to thank the public of Surrey for all their help and support with the appeal, but now ask that you please remove any social media messages and published appeals so that he can recover his privacy.
