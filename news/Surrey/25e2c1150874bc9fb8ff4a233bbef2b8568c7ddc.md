We are trying to locate these cufflinks as part of an ongoing murder investigation following the death of Dennis Kellond in Godstone in April.

The cufflinks are believed to have been stolen from his home and we are keen to establish their whereabouts as part of our ongoing enquiries.

Detective Sergeant Daniel Chant "It's important for us to discover what has happened to these cufflinks, which we believe were stolen from Mr Kellond's home. Following conversations with the family it is believed that these cufflinks were an engagement present from Dennis' late wife so hold extreme sentimental value. It is possible that they have been sold on since, and finding out what has happened to them could assist our investigation into his murder.

"If you have any information about where these cufflinks might be, please get in touch with us straightaway."
