We are appealing for witnesses after a cyclist was found in a seriously condition this afternoon.

Officers were called to White Lane, Titsey just before _1pm_ this afternoon (Saturday, 25 April) following reports of a cyclist who was in a serious condition in the road.

The cyclist was taken to hospital and remains in a life-threatening condition.

An investigation is underway to determine the circumstances of this incident. PS Chris Schultze said "We are appealing for the public's help to find out what has happened. At this stage, it is unclear as to how the cyclist came to be in the condition they were found.

"We would particularly like to speak to the driver of a white van who has been identified as a potential key witness"

If you have any further information or dash cam footage, please contact 101, quoting reference number PR/P20093905.
