We're appealing for help to find missing 24-year-old Julian Francis after he was last seen in the area of Victoria Road in Horley at 8.30pm yesterday evening (16 November). He has also been seen in the area of East Surrey Hospital. We believe he was wearing blue jeans and a dark hoody.

We're worried about Julian and want to make sure he is safe and well.
