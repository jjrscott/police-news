A man has sadly died after he lost control of his motorcycle on Woodham Road, Horsell, earlier today.

The incident happened at around 13:30 today (Sunday 30 August). Police, ambulance crews and the air ambulance all attended, but sadly the man, who was in his 20s, died at the scene. His next of kin have been informed. No other vehicles are believed to have been involved.

Woodham Road has been closed between the Six Crossroads roundabout, and the junction with Castle Road, in order for collision investigators to gather evidence and the emergency services to complete their work. It is likely to remain closed until at least 8pm this evening.

The investigation will be led by the Surrey and Sussex Police Serious Collision Investigation Unit.

PC Jon Belt from the Roads Policing Unit, said: "We are keen to speak to anyone who saw, or even recorded on a camera, the motorcycle in the minutes before the collision. The motorcycle is a distinctive yellow Suzuki, and I would ask anyone who was in the Horsell or Woking area between 1 and 1:30pm this afternoon to check their dashcams, and think about if they saw the bike and can help.

I am also keen to speak to anyone who saw the actual collision, if they have not already given their details to the police."

Anyone who believes they are able to assist is asked to contact us using the "live chat" function at www.surrey.police.uk, quoting reference PR/45200091871.
