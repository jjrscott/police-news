We are pleased to be able to update you that the 15 year old missing from West Molesey has been located.

Can we also take this opportunity to thank everyone who shared our appeal, contacted us with information and kept an eye out for her. The response from the public has been brilliant and is heartening to know that when we need your help, you step up and are there for us.

We are now taking down all references to the missing girl, and we ask you to do the same so that we can help to restore her privacy and help her return to life as normal. Thank you Surrey.
