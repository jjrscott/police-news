We are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a collision involving a black VW Polo; and a pedestrian and his dog.

The incident happened at around 4.40pm today (30 December) at the junction of B2032 Dorking Road and Chapel Road, in Tadworth.

Surrey Police officers were assisted at the scene by colleagues from the South East Coast Ambulance service. The pedestrian was taken to hospital with a serious head injury. The driver of the Polo remained at the scene and is assisting with the investigation. The dog is being looked after by a local vet.

Police are keen to speak to anyone who saw or heard the collision, or the manner of driving of the vehicle in the moments immediately before it happened. In particular they would like to speak to anyone who was travelling along the B2032 Dorking Road, or Chapel Lane in Tadworth between 4.30 and 4.45 this afternoon, and may have captured dashcam or helmetcam footage of the incident or the local conditions.
