We're releasing images of two pedal bikes that we believe may be stolen in an effort to reunite them with their owners.

The bikes have been recovered following a series of recent shed break-ins in the Chadacre Road and London Road area of Stoneleigh.

If you were the victim of a burglary and recognise these items, please contact us via webchat on our website or by calling 101 and quoting the crime reference number PR/45200116773.

Surrey Police recommends the following tips to keep your sheds secure:

 * Fit a good quality padlock, which has a hardened steel shackle (the part which opens and passes through the hasp) to all shed doors. The shorter the shackle the better because it prevents the jaws of bolt croppers being able to be placed around it
 * Use anti-tamper screws or smear hard setting glue on the screw-heads of the door hinges
 * Lock or permanently fix windows shut and cover them, perhaps with an old curtain, so no one can see what is kept inside
 * Install a shed alarm and place a sticker in the window or on the door to advertise the fact
 * Mark valuable property, including lawnmowers, power tool, bikes, and garden furniture by permanently etching on your postcode and house number
 * Chain up bicycles, lawnmowers and motorbikes and secure them to a fixed point in the shed
 * Consider storing more expensive electrical goods indoors or in a more secure building such as a brick-built structure
 * Make sure that fences/gates to your property are secure and remember to put any property away at night or when you go out during the day
 * Darkness is the perfect cover for burglars and the effective and economic answer is to install outside lighting, which comes on only when people are present.
