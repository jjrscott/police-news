We have released CCTV images of two men we would like to speak to in connection with a series of fraud incidents in Ashtead.

Between Saturday, 21 September and Thursday, 10 October four businesses in Craddocks Parade were targeted by fraudsters, we are keen to identify the two men from the CCTV images as we believe they may have information that will help our investigation.

Sergeant Lee Wells, of the Mole Valley Safer Neighbourhood Team said: "We are keen to hear from anyone who recognises the two men in the CCTV images, as we believe they may be able to assist with our enquiries after four businesses were targeted by a card scam.

"The businesses charged a customer an amount to pay, and when the suspect was handed the chip and pin machine, the amount was changed to a much higher amount without the shop knowing. The customer then came back into the store claiming they had been overcharged, and had the money refunded onto a different bank card.

"Following this string of incidents, we are working with banks to come up with some technology to prevent this from happening."

This new fraud is being carried out by "customers" coming into shops as a pair, distracting the person serving them and altering the payment amount to appear as if they have been overcharged.

For example, a transaction for £85 is entered into the card reader, which is then handed to the customer to enter their PIN. The other "customer" then distracts the person serving and the payment has another "0" added, making it £850, and the payment goes through.

The customer then notices this fraudulent "overcharge" and becomes visibly distressed, so the person serving refunds the "overcharge" back onto the "customer's" card.

Surrey Police are urging businesses to treat the terminal like the till, always ensure you are in control of the transaction and have sight of the card reader.

If you can help identify the men in the CCTV, please contact us on 101, quoting incident reference PR/45190106868.
