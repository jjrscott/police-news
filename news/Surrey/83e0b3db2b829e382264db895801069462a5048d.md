We are appealing for the public's help in finding Edmund Rose from Headley, who we believe could have travelled to Spain.

Edmund, 32 was last seen on Thursday, 25 March. He is described as vulnerable and his family are growing extremely concerned for his welfare.

Edmund recently failed to return from France and it's believed that he is in Malaga, Spain.

He is described as being a medium build, having light brown hair, with blue eyes. We believe that Edmund drove to Spain in a distinctive Black Ford Ranger (reg plate LE19 AFN) with 'Harvey Landscapes' written on the back. We are appealing for the public's help by sharing this appeal and contacting us with any further information.

If you can help, please get in touch with us straightaway quoting reference PR/ 45210031680 through 101 or the Live Chat at www.surrey.police.uk

If he is with you or you believe his life is at immediate risk, call 999.
