We are appealing for witnesses following an incident at KFC at Cobham Services at around 11:00am yesterday (Sunday, 2 August).

While queuing for food at KFC, the male victim got into a dispute about social distancing with a woman. She was accompanied by a man, who then assaulted the victim, causing him to fall into a wall. The victim was left seriously injured and required hospital treatment.

 * 6 feet 3 inches tall with a muscular build
 * Tanned skin, possibly mixed race
 * In his early 40s
 * Wearing a red t-shirt
 * Bald or with short black hair

The woman he was with is described as:

 * 5 feet 8 inches tall
 * Mixed race
 * Black curly hair
 * Wearing glasses
 * Wearing a baseball cap

They were also accompanied by a little girl carrying a teddy bear.
