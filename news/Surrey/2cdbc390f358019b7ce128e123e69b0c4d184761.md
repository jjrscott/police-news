A man from Woking has been sentenced to 18 weeks in prison after pleading guilty to one count of burglary at Guildford Crown Court last week (7 October).

William Dawes, 44, of Brookfield, pleaded guilty to one count of burglary relating to an incident that occurred at The Winston Churchill School in Woking, on Saturday 19 September.

Officers were called to the scene after receiving a report of a man trespassing on school property and stealing the purse of a woman participating in a fitness class. The incident occurred between 8.45am and 9am.

After reviewing the CCTV footage, officers were able to identify Dawes and arrested him at his home address on Tuesday 6 October. Despite a search of Dawes' home, the stolen property was not recovered.

Investigating Officer, PC Cat Gates said, "This sentencing is a real achievement for the team whose diligence and dedication has resulted in another burglar being put behind bars. Burglary is a concern for most of us and it will not be tolerated. Surrey Police will do everything possible to secure a conviction for every case that comes our way."
