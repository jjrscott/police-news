We are appealing for witnesses following a serious collision in Lingfield yesterday (27 November) evening.

At approximately 5.30pm we were called to Tandridge Lane following reports of a collision between a Seat Ibiza and a Vauxhall Corsa. Both drivers, a man in his 60s, and a man in his 20s, have been taken to hospital with serious injuries.

If you witnessed the incident, have any dashcam footage which could assist our investigation, or were involved in some other way please contact us on 101 quoting incident reference PR/P19275677.

Alternatively, you can use the online reporting system https://www.surrey.police.uk/ro/report/ocr/af/how-to-report-a-crime/ and enter the reference number in the 'Incident Details' section.

You can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111; or through their anonymous online form: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/
