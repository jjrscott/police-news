A serving Surrey Police officer has been found guilty of common assault.

PC Sam Gerrard, 33, was found guilty following a two-day trial which concluded on Tuesday (25 February), at Basingstoke Magistrates' Court. The charge related to an offence committed while off duty at Popworld nightclub in Guildford on September 19, 2019.

He was found not guilty of public order.

PC Gerrard, who is based at Woking Police Station, assaulted a member of the public who he had accused of stealing his bank card. He was arrested at the scene after passing officers were flagged down.

He will be sentenced on 23 March.

Temporary Deputy Chief Constable Nev Kemp said: "This incident was wholly unprofessional and not in keeping with what we expect of our officers and staff or what the public expect from us.

"On or off duty, police officers should never behave in this way and I am pleased that the officers who were flagged down dealt with a colleague professionally and without any fear or favour."

Misconduct proceedings will now commence following the conclusion of the trial.
