We are appealing for information following a historic sexual assault investigation which took place in Cranleigh in 2012.

The assault was reported in January this year, and is alleged to have taken place on 24 December 2012 in a toilet at Cranleigh Baptist Church.

The only description of the suspect is that he was male.

The assault occurred during an organised Christmas performance and we would like to speak to anyone who was at the church that night.

Detective Constable Neil Palmer said "It has taken immense bravery for the victim to come forward and we are doing everything we can to identify the person responsible for this assault."

"We are looking to speak to anyone who was at the church that evening and may have photographs or seen something suspicious."

If you have any information, please call 101 quoting reference number PR/45200006738. You can always report online at https://www.surrey.police.uk/ro/report/. You can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111; or through their anonymous online form: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/

If you believe you have been the victim of an offence, please call us immediately on 101 (or 999 in an emergency).
