A 36-year-old man from Ealing, London, will spend seven and a half years in prison for three offences of supplying heroin and crack and committing grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent.

Tirenan Powell, who ran a drug dealing county line targeting north Surrey, was sentenced at Guildford Crown Court on Tuesday, 13 October after pleading guilty to the three offences.

Powell was first arrested on 30 June during a proactive patrol of Hounslow. He was wanted for a serious assault on a vulnerable victim in Stanwell and officers believed he was in the Hounslow area. After a chase on foot, Powell was detained by officers who found numerous mobile phones on him as well as a miniature phone and a house key concealed in his underwear. A search of the property this key was for revealed more mobile phones and drug paraphernalia.

PC Katherine Stevens of the force's proactive priority crime team said: "As the line holder, Powell was in charge of the mobile phone line used to deal drugs and would usually be protected by the network of people that he manipulated to do his dirty work, but he wasn't able to hide from us. Seeing this violent offender jailed is a fantastic result and will ensure his vulnerable victims are safe from further harm.
