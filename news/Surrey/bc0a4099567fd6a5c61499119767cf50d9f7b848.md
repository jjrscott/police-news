We have released a new CCTV image of a car in connection with a robbery in Woldingham last month.

The victim was walking along Church Road near Woldingham train station towards Kings Knight Garden Centre on Monday, 23 December at around 11am.

The victim was approached by the driver of what's believed to be the dark coloured Vauxhall Astra in this CCTV image. He then demanded her handbag before hitting her with an unknown object and stealing her handbag. The victim didn't suffer any injuries, but was left shaken.

The suspect is described as:

 * White.
 * 6ft 3ins tall.
 * He had light brown hair.
 * Slim build.
 * Clean shaven.
 * He was wearing a light grey jogging top and bottoms with his hood up, and is believed to have a Southern / London accent.

Investigating officer, Detective Sergeant Patrick Mccann, said "We are really hoping that this CCTV image will assist us with our investigation and we can hold whoever is responsible to account.

"This was a vicious attack and we want to prevent whoever did this from doing anything similar in the future.

"We are looking to speak to the driver of this dark coloured Vauxhall Astra, which we believe has distinctive light coloured driver's wing mirror and appears to be missing part of the grill.

"If you recognise the vehicle or have any further information, please get in touch."
