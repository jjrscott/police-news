We have released some CCTV images of men we would like to speak to in connection with a residential burglary in Godalming on Thursday, 3 December, at around 12.30pm.

Entry was forced to the property on Church Road, but no items were stolen from the address after the suspects were disturbed.

No one was at home at the time of the offence.

We are keen to identify the men pictured in these CCTV images. If you recognise the people pictured, or you were in the area at the time and have any information which could help, please contact us quoting crime reference number PR/45200127986 via
