We are asking for witnesses to a serious assault at Joules nightclub in Reigate town centre in the early hours of Sunday 8 December, leaving a 25 year old man with serious head injuries.

The assault occurred on Bell Street, close to Joules nightclub, at around 01:50 in the morning - we are aware of conflicting reports of the number of individuals present and so, as we are in the initial stages of this investigation, we are reviewing CCTV and we would to like to speak to anyone who witnessed this incident, or may be able to assist us in identifying anyone involved.

As the attack took place as people were leaving the town centre after their nights out, somebody may well have seen what happened. The victim has been left with serious injuries, so we are asking for any information that might help our investigation.

If you witnessed the incident or have any information (including dashcam footage) which could help us with our enquiries, please call us on 101, quoting crime reference number PR/ 45190131585. If you do not wish to leave your name, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
