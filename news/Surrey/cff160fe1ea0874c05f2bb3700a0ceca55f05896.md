We are grateful to the public for their assistance in locating a vulnerable 14-year-old girl who has gone missing from her home in Lingfield.

We are pleased to share that, following our media and social media appeal, we have located the missing 14 year old girl from Lingfield.

We are so grateful for the support we received from the public:

Within two hours of the appeal being published, it had been shared on social media almost 3000 times. More importantly we had a number of pieces of information shared with us through our online Live Chat, social media messaging and via 101 that enabled us to continue our search and, ultimately, to locate the missing girl.

We now ask for your help again. We ask that you remove all references to her from social media in order to restore her privacy and try to establish some sense of normality for her and her family.

Thank you Surrey.
