Officers were called to an incident at around 10.30pm on Wednesday night (August 26) at an address in Taynton Drive, Merstham after a 49 year-old man and his mother were threatened by a group of men with what appeared to be knives and baseball bats.

The group, wearing balaclavas, were banging on the door trying to get in.

Specialist officers and the police helicopter were deployed to the scene and two handguns (both air weapons) were recovered and made safe.

Damage was done to the front of the property during the incident but no-one was hurt.

Borough Commander for Reigate and Banstead, Alex Maguire, said: "We would like to reassure residents that incidents such as this are rare and our officers acted swiftly to detain the suspects."

Two men (aged 38 and 44) were arrested on suspicion of affray and attempted aggravated burglary. Both have now been released on bail with conditions.
