We are releasing images of various antiques and pieces of jewellery, which were stolen during a burglary in Woking in 2019.

In total, over 60 items were stolen in the burglary, and we are trying to find out where these items may be now.

The items include a bronze winged statue, a selection of fruit-shaped tea caddies, a collection of enamel Easter eggs, and a colourful topaz bracelet.

Detective Constable Kerry Plumb, who is investigating the case, said: "We are hoping that seeing these pictures of some of the stolen items may serve as a reminder to members of the public.

"These items, which have a total replacement value of around £150,000, are of great importance to their owner, and we want to do all we can to return them.

"If you have any information about where they can be found, or if you recognise any of these items, and have any queries or concerns about the other related stolen items, please contact me."
