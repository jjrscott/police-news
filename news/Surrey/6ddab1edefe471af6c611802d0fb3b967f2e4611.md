We are appealing for help to find missing 32-year-old woman Annielle Bull who was last seen in Thames Ditton.

Annielle is believed to have left a friend's house on the High Street between midnight and 3am on Sunday 21 and hasn't been seen since.

She is described as 5ft 3 in height, of slim build, with long faded blonde hair and was last seen wearing a black coat with a large hood and a grey jumper.

Annielle has links to Eastbourne and Brighton, but could also be somewhere in Surrey.

We are concerned for Annielle and would like to make sure she is safe and well.

We've been checking CCTV and carrying out enquiries with Annielle's family and friends to assist with the search.

If you have seen her or have any information which could help us find her, please call 101 and quote ref PR/45200064717.
