Police dog Ludo was called to action on Tuesday (19 January), to help in the search for a high risk missing person.

Officers were called at 11.30pm following reports that someone had fled the scene in Hersham following a domestic incident.

When they arrived it was believed that the person was hiding in allotments situated within the search area.

Expert tracker dog Ludo and his handler PC George Larkin were soon tasked with tracking the scent after weather conditions prevented the use of the helicopter.

After initially searching the scene, Ludo tracked towards the allotments where he was let off the lead. He then used the wind to home in on the human scent. After another 35 minutes he uncovered the man hiding within a sheltered seating area in the allotments.

PC Larkin said: "I'm very proud of Ludo, he did exactly what he has been trained to do and saved on time and resources. Had he not found the male when he did then the search would have been stepped up and further officers would have been called out."
