We have released CCTV images of a man we would like to speak to in connection with a large fire at a printing dealership on the A30 in Staines-upon-Thames on Thursday, 15 August.

We were called at approximately 3.05am to reports of a large fire after a witness saw someone throw a firebomb. The suspect is then believed to have made off on foot towards the Crooked Billet roundabout.

Detective Constable Rhian Roberts, who is investigating the incident, said: "If you recognise who this man could be, please come forward and get in touch with us as we believe he may have information that could help us. Perhaps you remember being in the area around the time the incident took place and saw something suspicious?

"We are urging anyone with information that might help with our investigation to come forward. The fire has ruined a family run printing dealership that has been running since 1957, the impact this has had on the family has been, and remains devastating to them.

"The incident happened on the A30, if you were driving in the area on the run up to, and after the incident took place please review your dash cam footage in case it has captured anything that could help with our investigation."

If you can help, please contact us on 101, quoting incident reference PR/45190085932.
