We are appealing for witnesses following an assault and criminal damage in Stanwell yesterday evening (24 August).

Officers were called to Caledonia Road shortly before 8:30pm following reports of a group of around six men damaging vehicles in the street and acting in a threatening manner. The group then smashed the window of a nearby house and assaulted a member of the public who received minor injuries.

The suspects left the scene before officers arrived and despite numerous attempts to locate, no arrests have been made yet. Residents of Stanwell may notice an increased police presence today whilst officers make enquiries and provide reassurance to the local community.

Detective Constable Adam Patterson said "We are appealing to anyone who may have witnessed something or have any further information to get in touch with us.

"If you were driving in the area and may have any dashcam footage of the incident, we need to hear from you."
