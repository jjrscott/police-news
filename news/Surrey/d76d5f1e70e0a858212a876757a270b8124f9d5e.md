Surrey Police have arrested a 21-year-old man from Epsom in connection with two assaults which took place in Epsom yesterday (Wednesday 17 September).

Officers were made aware of a sexual assault by touching at Park Avenue West in Epsom yesterday shortly before 4pm. The victim was walking alone with headphones in when she felt a presence behind her before she was sexually assaulted. The suspect then cycled off towards Parry Close.

The suspect is described as a white man, around 5ft 8" with short black hair. He was wearing a light top and black joggers, black trainers with a white sole and a grey backpack. He was riding a black bike with red shopping bags on the handlebars.

Shortly afterwards, officers were made aware of a common assault which took place nearby with a suspect of the same description. The 13-year-old victim was sitting in a car on East Street, close to Ewell Castle School, when the suspect opened the car door, attempting to assault her. The suspect then ran off towards the Ewell bypass.

The man who was arrested remains in custody.

Jon Vale, Borough Commander for Epsom and Ewell, said: "We'd like to reassure local residents that we are doing everything possible to hold whoever is responsible to account.

"We currently have a man in custody on suspicion of these offences and are appealing to anyone who may have witnessed something or have further information to get in contact to assist us with this investigation."
