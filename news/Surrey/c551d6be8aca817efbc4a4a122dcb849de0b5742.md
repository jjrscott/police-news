We are appealing for witnesses following a collision on the M25 on Sunday, 29 March.

Officers were called to the M25 between junction 5 and 6 just after 8pm following reports of a non-injury collision between a silver Mercedes and a white Toyota.

The driver of the Mercedes, a 45-year-old man from Hampton, failed to stop at the scene and was later located with support from our dog unit and the National Police Air Service. He was arrested on suspicion of driving whilst under the influence of alcohol and was later arrested for failure to produce a specimen. He has been released under investigation and enquiries remain ongoing.

We are appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the collision or have any further information or dash-cam footage to get in contact by calling 101, quoting reference number PR/45200033968.
