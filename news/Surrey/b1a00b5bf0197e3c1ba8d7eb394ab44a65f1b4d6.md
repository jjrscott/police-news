We would like to speak to the man in the CCTV image in connection with the theft of a wallet and fraud offences at a supermarket in Godalming last month.

On 12 March at around 2.20pm, the suspect followed the 76-year-old victim into the toilets in Sainsbury's on Woolsack Way in Godalming.

The suspect stole the victim's wallet and proceeded to make two withdrawals from the Sainsbury's cash machine shortly afterwards.

At 3.20pm, the suspect used the stolen credit card to buy two iPhones from the iStore on Friary Street in Guildford. Around an hour later, the suspect attempted to purchase items from the iStore in The Peacocks Centre in Woking.

We believe the man shown in the CCTV images may be able to help us solve this crime. He is described as in his early 40s, of medium build and bald.

If you can help us to identify the man, or if you have any information which could help us solve this crime, please call us on 101 and quote ref PR/45200028434. You can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111; or through their anonymous online form: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/
