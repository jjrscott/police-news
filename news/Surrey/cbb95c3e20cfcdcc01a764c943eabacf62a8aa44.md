We are appealing for witnesses following an aggravated burglary in Horley on Sunday, 20 December.

Officers were called to the residential address following reports of an aggravated burglary, which had occurred shortly before 8pm.

The victim was at her home address at Riverside in Horley when she answered the door to a man not known to her. The man then forced entry into the property armed with what appeared to be a handgun.

He then searched through the victim's belongings. Enquiries are ongoing to establish whether anything has been taken.

The victim was uninjured but left shaken.

The suspect is described as a black man, around 6 feet tall and approximately 30 years old. He was wearing black jeans, black Nike Air Force trainers, a trench coat with the hood up and black square shaped glasses.

Investigating Officer Phi Manelfi said "It's unclear at this stage whether anything has been taken. Thankfully, the victim was not injured but she has been left extremely distressed.

"We are appealing to anyone to may have seen anything in the area around that time to get in touch."
