We are appealing for witnesses following a collision on Brighton Road A217 in Banstead.

We were called to Brighton Road just before 10am following a collision involving a lorry, causing the road to be closed in both directions. The lorry driver was treated at the scene but sadly pronounced dead shortly after the arrival of the emergency services.

Brighton Road has reopened in both directions.

Anyone with any information, or dashcam footage, should contact Surrey Police on 101 or use www.surrey.police.uk to report and quote the reference number PR/P20039135.
