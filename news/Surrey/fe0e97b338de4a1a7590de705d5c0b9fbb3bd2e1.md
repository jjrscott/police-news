We're releasing images of a man we would like to speak to following an attempted robbery in Weybridge on Sunday 5 January.

At some point between 11:35am and 12:10pm a 16 year-old boy was approached by a man in The Quadrant, the car park area behind Heath Road. The man asked the victim for his property and subsequently ran off empty-handed following a struggle.

We're keen to identify and speak to the man seen in the CCTV images as he was in the area at the time and may have seen what happened.

He is described as:

 * White.
 * 5ft 8ins tall.
 * Slim.
 * Around 20 years-old.
 * He has dark hair and possibly facial hair.
 * He was wearing a black parka style jacket with a hood, black jogging bottoms and black trainers.

Anyone with information is asked to call Surrey Police on 101 (999 in an emergency) quoting PR/ 45200001569.

You can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111; or through their anonymous online form: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/
