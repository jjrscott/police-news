We are investigating a serious assault that happened in the early hours of Christmas Day at the Boogie Lounge nightclub on Waterloo Road in Epsom.

A 19 year-old man was treated at hospital for a serious injury to his eye after he was assaulted with a bottle by another man in the upstairs area of the club shortly after 1:15am.

Enquiries are ongoing to establish what happened, but no-one else was hurt.

We are keen to hear from anyone who saw what happened.

Anyone with information is asked to call Surrey Police on 101 (999 in an emergency) quoting PR/ 45190138099.

You can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111; or through their anonymous online form: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/
