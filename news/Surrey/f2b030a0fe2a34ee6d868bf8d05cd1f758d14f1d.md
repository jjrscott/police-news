We are appealing for witnesses after thieves made off with a large quantity of jewellery after breaking into a house in Camberley on Monday night (16 March).

Three men went to the property around 8.45pm and gained entry after telling the occupant they were there to disinfect all the houses in the street.

One of the men stayed with the victim while the other two went upstairs and made a thorough search, making off with a large quantity of cash and jewellery.

They also removed rings, bangles, necklaces and earrings from the victim.

The suspects are then believed to have left in a car which was parked in Portsmouth Road, driving off in an unknown direction.

The three men are described as around 5ft 8 tall, of medium build, and wearing black hooded tops, black gloves and black masks covering their faces. All three spoke with eastern European accents.

Detective Constable Louise Cilliers, who is investigating the incident, said: "We are carrying out a number of enquiries in the local area and would particularly like to speak to anyone who may have seen anyone acting suspiciously, or a suspicious-looking vehicle, at the time of the burglary.

"We would like to remind people that if you are not sure who is at your door, don't open it. Check the identity of the caller by calling the company they are claiming to be from. Use the telephone numbers listed in your local directory or provided independently by your service provider - do not use any telephone numbers provided by the caller as they may be bogus."
