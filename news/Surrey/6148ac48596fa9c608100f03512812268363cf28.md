We are appealing for witnesses after a burglary at a building site in Churt near Farnham on Tuesday (5 January 2021).

Officers were called to the site at around 10.18pm, where some residential houses are currently being built, and found that a quantity of household appliances and some building goods had been taken.

A 37 year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of burglary and released under investigation. We are now looking for further witnesses to assist with our investigation.

Investigating Officer PC Dave Curran said, "Were you around or driving along Tilford Road between Farnham and Hindhead between 10.00pm and 10.30pm on Tuesday 5 January? Did you notice any persons or vehicles acting suspiciously in the Churt area opposite Avalon Garden Centre between the junctions of Hale House Lane and Hyde Lane? Please review your dashcam footage and let us know if you find anything that might help us."
