We are appealing for the public's help to find 66-year-old Richard Nemo who has gone missing from the Epsom area.

Richard has not been seen since around 12:30p on Tuesday 21 January and we are increasingly concerned for his welfare, especially in the cold weather.

Richard is described as being white British, 6ft 4in in height, of slight build with grey hair. He was last seen wearing black trousers, a black coat and black shoes.

Anyone who has seen Richard since 12:30 on Tuesday 21 January, or has information that may help officers to find him, is asked to contact Surrey Police urgently on 101 (999 if a life is at immediate risk) quoting reference PR/ 45200008213.
