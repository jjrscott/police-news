We are appealing for witnesses following a serious collision in West Clandon this afternoon (12 July).

Officers were called to the A246 Epsom Road shortly before 4PM following reports of a single motorcycle collision. The motorcyclist was airlifted to hospital with life-threatening injuries.

We are appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision or may have any dashcam footage to get in touch, quoting reference number PR/P20161765.

The A246 remains partially closed.
