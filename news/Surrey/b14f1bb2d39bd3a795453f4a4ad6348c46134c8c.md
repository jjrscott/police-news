We are appealing for witnesses after two men were assaulted at St Anne's Drive in Redhill yesterday evening (Saturday, 30 May).

Officers were called at around 7pm last night following reports of a man being stabbed. The suspect, a 46 year old man from Redhill was quickly located nearby and arrested on suspicion of GBH. He remains in custody.

The victim was taken to hospital, his injuries not deemed to be life-threatening and he has since been discharged. Another victim was also identified with minor injuries and was not taken to hospital.

Investigating Officer DS Kerry Akehurst said "It is believed that this assault occurred following a verbal dispute outside the Londi's shop on St Anne's Drive. We are appealing to anyone who may have witnessed this dispute to get in contact."

If you witnessed the assault or have any further information around this assault to get in contact by calling 101, quoting reference number PR/45200055839.

Alternatively, if you wish to remain anonymous, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
