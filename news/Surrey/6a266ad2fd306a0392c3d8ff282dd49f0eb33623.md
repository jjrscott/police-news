We are appealing for witnesses following an altercation involving a cyclist and the occupants of a car on Kingston Road in Camberley at around 3.15pm yesterday (29 July).

A black Peugeot containing four men was being driven along Kingston Road when it was involved in a near collision with a cyclist at the junction with Ballard Road. The cyclist and men from inside the car were then involved in an altercation, during which, damage was caused to the doors, windscreen and tyres of the car. The men in the car left the scene followed by the cyclist.

The cyclist is described as:

 * Asian

 * He had black hair and brown eyes.

 * He was wearing a grey hooded top, grey jogging bottoms and trainers. Both the top and bottoms had a dark blue strip along the arms and side of the legs.

A 16-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of attempted GBH, robbery and possession of an offensive weapon as part of our enquiries. He remains in custody.
