Have you been offered this jewellery for sale?

We're appealing for information following a burglary at a property in Coulsdon in January earlier this year.

A number of items of jewellery were stolen from a house in the Fareham Road area at around 6.30pm on Thursday 9 January.

The residents returned home in the evening to find a rear glass door smashed and the jewellery missing from a bedroom.

If you've seen the items for sale, or have any other information which could assist us, please call us on 101, quoting reference PR/45200003703.
