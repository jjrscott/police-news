We are appealing for witnesses following two burglaries in the Woking area on Thursday, 17 December.

Officers were called to the residential address on High Street, Knaphill, following reports of a burglary, which is believed to have taken place between 1pm and 2pm.

Officers were also called to a residential address in Triggs Lane following reports of a burglary, which is believed to have taken place between 2:15pm and 6:15pm.

In both cases, the residents returned home to find that the property had been vandalised and jewellery had been stolen. We have included some images of this jewellery. We are currently still investigating whether or not these two incidents are linked.

PC Dave Curran said: "These appear to have been a targeted burglaries. While we are still investigating whether or not they are linked, we are appealing to anyone who may have been in the area or seen anything suspicious while driving through to review dashcam or further information to get in touch."

If you have any information which could help with our investigations or recognise any of the jewellery in these images, please contact us quoting PR/45200133055 (Knaphill) or PR/45200133111 (Hook Heath) via:

 * Webchat on our website at surrey.police.uk
 * Online https://www.surrey.police.uk/ro/report/ocr/af/how-to-report-a-crime/
 * Calling us on 101

If you do not wish to leave your name, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

We are asking anyone who has large amounts of gold or valuable family jewellery to:

 * Store valuables in a safety deposit box or bank vault if possible.
 * If you're keeping valuables at home, install a safe that is securely attached to the building (ideally bolted to, or embedded in, a solid concrete floor). A safe that is not fixed to the floor will be removed. To ensure your safe is the best possible standard, visit www.securedbydesign.com - a Home Office approved website listing approved security products or www.soldsecure.com - which lists products approved by the Master Locksmiths Association.
 * Consider adding other security measures to your home, such as CCTV and doorbell cameras, motion sensor lights and an alarm system.
 * Check all doors are locked and all windows, including those upstairs, are secure before you go out or go to bed, and use timer switches on lamps or keep a light on in the evening if you go out.
 * Use a forensic marking product that won't damage the jewellery to mark it as yours and connect it to your address. Always take specialist advice before marking expensive or irreplaceable items.
