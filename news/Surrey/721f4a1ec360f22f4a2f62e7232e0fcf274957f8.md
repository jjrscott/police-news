We are keen to hear from anyone who can help us to identify a man who sexually exposed himself to a woman in the public field off Ten Acre Lane in Thorpe which is located between Thorpe Industrial Estate and an area of landfill.

The woman was walking in the field on Thursday, 14 January, between 2pm and 2.30pm, when the incident took place.

The man is described as white with a tanned complexion, of average height and between 30 and 40 years old. He was wearing a green and black rain jacket and black trousers, and was walking a small black dog.

PC Jake Trussler from North Surrey neighbourhood policing team who is in charge of the investigation says: "This was a distressing incident and we are keen to hear from anybody who can help us identify this man. Perhaps you know a dog walker who owns a green and black jacket and might have been out that Thursday afternoon, or perhaps you were in the area yourself and have had your memory jogged by our description of the man.

"Please cast your mind back and consider whether you have any crucial information that could help us identify this man."

Any suspicious behaviour or incidents like this should be reported to us at the time or as soon as it is safe to do so.

If you find yourself in a similar situation:

 * trust your instincts and if you think a situation is getting worse, look for a way to escape
 * put distance between yourself and the other person if you are able to
 * call 999 as soon as you can.
