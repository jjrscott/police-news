We are appealing for witnesses following a serious assault and robbery in Gogmore Farm Park, Chertsey, yesterday (28 April).

A man was walking his dog around 7pm when he was attacked by a group of four men and two women. The victim was punched and kicked in the head, resulting in serious injuries to his face.

The suspects then made off with the victim's grey Nike backpack and a quantity of cash from his pockets.

One of the male suspects is described as 5ft 10 tall, slim build with dark hair and facial stubble. Two of the other male suspects are also described as slim build and dressed in dark clothing.

It is believed some of the suspects may have left the park on foot in the direction of Chertsey Library.

Two 34-year-old females and a 30-year-old male have been arrested in connection with this incident and are currently in custody.

If you witnessed this incident or have any information which may help our investigation, please call 101 and quote ref PR/45200044403. Alternatively, if you do not wish to leave your name, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
