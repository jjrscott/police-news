We'd like to speak to him in connection with a burglary in Caterham last week, during which a debit card was stolen and used to buy items at a shop in Kenley.

The break-in took place at an address in Banstead Road around 1.30pm on 29 November after the suspect smashed a glass patio door and made off with jewellery and the debit card.

The bank card was used around 20 minutes later at the Co-Op in Godstone Road, Kenley.

The suspect is described as male, white, aged 28-35 years, around 6ft tall, of medium build with stubble and wearing a blue 'Canada Goose' jacket, blue jeans and white trainers.
