We are trying to locate this jewellery as part of an ongoing burglary investigation.

Officers were called to a residential address in St Hilda's Close, Knaphill following a burglary which is believed to have happened on Monday, 20 July. The victims returned home to find that Â£40,000 worth of jewellery had been stolen from their bedroom.

Sergeant Matthew Walton said "We want to recover the jewellery for this victim as it holds extreme sentimental value to them.

"There is a possibility that this has been sold on, so if you have bought it off of someone or been offered it, please get in touch with us."
