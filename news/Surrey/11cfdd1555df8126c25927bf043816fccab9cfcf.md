We are appealing for witnesses following a serious collision involving a car and a cyclist on Station Road, Addlestone.

Police were contacted just before 9pm today (November 2) and the collision has left the man who was riding the bike in a serious condition. The car stopped at the scene.

There are road closures in place between the Premier Inn and Waitrose on Station Road and these are likely to be in place for several hours while our investigation is carried out.

Officers are appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the collision or who may have dashcam footage to get in touch.

Anyone with any information should contact Surrey Police quoting reference number PR/P20255146.
