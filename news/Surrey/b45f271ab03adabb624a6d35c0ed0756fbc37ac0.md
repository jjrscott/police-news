Two men have been sentenced to a total of four years and nine months in prison following a residential burglary in Walton-on Thames in June.

Farhan Ahmed, 24 of New Road, West Molesey, received a custodial sentence of 33 months, while Louis Craze, 23, of no fixed address, was imprisoned for 24 months and given eight points on his licence, when they appeared at Guildford Crown Court after they both pleaded guilty to burglary offences.

Officers were called to the residential property in Hersham Road at around 8pm on 4 June following reports of a burglary in action. The victim was at home alone when she heard shouting outside her door ordering the door to be kicked in. She left her bedroom to find her home had been damaged with two men searching through her belongings.

By the time officers arrived at the address, both suspects had left. Swift investigation led to the car the suspects were using being identified.

This lead to the identification of the two men with witnesses claiming to have seen them fleeing the area, one of which had an injured hand.

Witnesses also reported that one of the men had an injured hand and it was later confirmed that Craze had gone to hospital, claiming that he had been injured after falling off his bike.

The pair were stopped in the getaway car later that night, after stealing petrol from a nearby petrol station, and were arrested for burglary and theft. The pair were successfully remanded in prison leading up to the court hearing where they pleaded guilty to burglary, attempted burglary and making off without payment.

Borough Commander for Elmbridge, Bert Dean said "This is a great result and a huge credit to everyone involved. Tackling burglary is one of our priorities and will not be tolerated in Surrey. I hope that this sentence reassures local residents that Surrey Police will do everything possible to ensure that anyone caught breaking in to steal from other people will be brought to justice."
