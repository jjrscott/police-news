We have released new images of two men we'd like to speak to in connection with a burglary in Englefield Green.

It happened at around 2pm on Thursday 12 March at a property on Vegel Crescent.

One suspect distracted the victim by asking for money for completing work on a neighbour's roof, which allowed the suspect(s) to steal a MBE medal and cash from the property.

An investigation is currently underway and we are keen to speak to the two men pictured.

Investigating Officer Chris Toms, said: "The two men seen in these images may have information which could help us track down the suspect(s) responsible for this crime. The elderly female victim was the target of a planned burglary and has been robbed of her treasured MBE medal and money. Please help us to stop this from happening to someone else and if you have information, call us on 101."

If you know who these men are, or you have any other information that could help our investigation, please contact Surrey Police on 101 (999 in an emergency) quoting reference PR/45200028823.

You can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111; or through their anonymous online form:https://crimestoppers-uk.org/.
