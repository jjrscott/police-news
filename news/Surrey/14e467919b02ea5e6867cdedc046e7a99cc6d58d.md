The thoughts of everyone at Surrey Police continue to be the family and friends of Sarah Everard.

We are aware of events that are being planned by #ReclaimTheseStreets across the country and absolutely understand the importance of their cause. Women should not have to live in fear or change their behaviour to keep themselves safe.

Sadly, due to restrictions to prevent the spread of Coronavirus, arranging and taking part in large gatherings is still unlawful, and this was confirmed by the High Court of Justice yesterday evening (12 March).

We understand there are a number of online events as well as a doorstep vigil that have been arranged for 6pm today (March 13), and we fully support and encourage these as they allow people to stand together over this important matter in a Covid-safe way.

People have sacrificed a huge amount to tackle the pandemic and keep people safe and we are urging our communities to continue to do the right thing. Please do not gather in large groups and put yourselves and others at risk of contracting and spreading the virus.
