We're appealing for witnesses after a woman was robbed and left with serious injuries in the early hours of this morning (1 October).

The victim was walking home when she was approached by a man at the junction of Guildford Park Avenue and Guildford Road at around 1am. The man punched her in the face and demanded her belongings. The victim was continually punched to the face whilst she tried to prevent her bag from being taken. The suspect fled the scene with her rucksack, leaving her on the ground. We believe he fled in the direction of Yorkies Bridge.

The suspect is described as around 5ft 7" tall, of slim build and wearing dark clothing. The rucksack he stole from the victim is black with red and green flowers on it.

The victim was treated in hospital for serious but non-life threatening injuries.

A 28-year-old man from Guildford was arrested at his home address on suspicion of robbery and assault by GBH. He remains in custody.
