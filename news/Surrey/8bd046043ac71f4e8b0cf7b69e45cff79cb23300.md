Surrey Police will again be working alongside local authorities, Surrey Fire and Rescue and the Surrey Trading Standards Service during Halloween and Bonfire Night to target anti-social behaviour.

To ensure responsible trading, Surrey Police is working with local businesses asking shops not to sell large quantities of flour and eggs to those they suspect will use them to damage property. Posters bearing the same message are also being distributed by neighbourhood officers.

'No trick or treat' advice posters are available from local Safer Neighbourhood policing teams, and posters will be on display to reinforce the messaging.

**If you or your children do choose to go trick or treating this year, please remember the following safety tips: **

 * No cold-calling houses and pre-specify which houses to visit by checking with the occupants first
 * Avoid houses where there are people shielding and where there are vulnerable people. Pre-specify which houses you intend to visit by checking with the occupants first
 * Avoid close contact with others and continue to observe social distancing
 * Respect the privacy and wishes of people who do not want to take part in trick or treat - observe the 'No Trick or Treaters please' posters people may display in doors or windows
 * If you are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, please remain within your household
 * Avoid gatherings of six people or more. Perhaps Consider celebrating virtually or with members of your own household as this poses low risk for spread
 * Assess current COVID-19 levels in your community to determine whether to postpone, cancel, or limit your gathering or trip - Find Covid local Alert Level.
 * Covid-19 can be spread by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus, as well as through droplets breathed in
 * Avoid communal buckets of sweets
 * Carry hand sanitiser and wash hands frequently.

Surrey Police ASB Manager Jo Grimshaw said: " _If you are going trick or treating, please follow the safety advice and remember that some people, especially the elderly, might be frightened by groups of people knocking at their doors so please respect any homes displaying a 'no trick or treat' sign. _

_We want people to enjoy themselves safely but Halloween does not legitimise bad behaviour or vandalism and people need to consider how their actions can affect others. _

_Officers will be carrying out high visibility patrols over the coming weeks and taking appropriate action against any anti-social behaviour. Causing damage to someone's property could result in an on-the-spot fine or an arrest so act responsibly and everyone will enjoy Halloween." _
