We're appealing for witnesses after two dogs attacked a horse on North Downs Way on Sunday (22 November).

Two women were riding their horses on Bucklands Hill at around 10.15am when they were approached by two dogs which began attacking one of the horses. The dogs bit the horse's legs and left it with serious injuries. The dogs ran off after the horse and rider managed to fight them off.

A similar incident was reported a short time later on Buckland Lane involving two other horses and their riders. In this incident a man, believed to be the owner, picked the dogs up and took them away.

One of the dogs is described as brindled and the other is described as either dark brown or black in colour. They're both believed to be Staffie cross breeds.
