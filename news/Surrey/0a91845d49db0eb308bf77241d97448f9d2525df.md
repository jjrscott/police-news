Road closures are in place and we are carrying out enquiries following a single vehicle fatal road collision in Ashford earlier this afternoon (Saturday 28 September).

Road closures are in place and we are carrying out enquiries following a single vehicle fatal road collision in Ashford earlier this afternoon (Saturday 28 September).

A black Ford Focus crossed the central reservation on Staines Road West between Fordbridge Road and School Road near the reservoir at 3pm. The car was then involved in a collision with a lamppost on the southbound side of the carriageway.

Sadly the driver, the only person in the car, a 71 year-old man died at the scene. His family has been informed.

Enquiries are ongoing to establish what happened, but we do not currently believe that any other vehicles were involved.

Road closures will remain in place in both directions for the next few hours to allow our investigation to progress.

Anyone who saw the manner in which the vehicle was driving, or what happened should call 101 quoting P19224491.
