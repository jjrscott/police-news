We would like to thank the media and public for their assistance after wanted man Tomasz Mazurkiewicz handed himself in to Staines police station yesterday (Tuesday, 29 October).

He was arrested and will appear at Reading Crown Court this afternoon (Wednesday, 30 October) in response to a previous court order.

We are grateful for the public's help in locating the man, but we now ask that appeals and social media posts relating to him are removed in order to restore his privacy.
