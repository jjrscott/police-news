Surrey Police officers attended Hurst Park this evening following reports of a large group of teenagers fighting.

Around 20 police cars, from both Surrey Police and the Metropolitan Police, attended after we received a call at around 18:50. Once officers arrived the teenagers dispersed quickly on foot, mopeds and bicycles.

A 17 year old man was arrested on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon, and officers are keen to speak to a number of other people in connection with the incident. At this time it is not believed that anyone was seriously injured.

Officers will continue to patrol the area this evening to reassure residents and prevent any further disturbance.

There were a large number of members of the public in the park at the time, and we would ask anyone who could help us identify the people involved, or who has mobile phone footage of the incident, to contact Surrey Police through www.surrey.police.uk, or via 101, quoting reference PR/P20127664.

If you would prefer to give information anonymously, please contact the independent charity Crimestoppers, through https://crimestoppers-uk.org/, or 0800 555 111.
