We are appealing for witnesses following a serious two-vehicle collision in Guildford today (Feb 13).

We were called to Ladymead at 11am near to the junction with Joseph's Road following a collision involving a motorbike and car. The rider of the motorbike, a man in his 60s, has been taken to hospital in a serious condition.

The area is currently heavily congested and motorists should avoid the area and surrounding roads while the investigation is ongoing.

Ladymead is currently closed westbound between Stoke Road and Woodbridge Road.

Anyone with any information, or dashcam footage, should contact Surrey Police on 101 or use www.surrey.police.uk to report and quote the reference number PR/P20035733.
