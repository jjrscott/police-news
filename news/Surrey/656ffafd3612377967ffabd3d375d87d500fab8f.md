A man from Shepperton has been found guilty of a number of burglaries in Staines over the last few weeks.

Richard Reilly, 36, of Oberon Way, pleaded guilty to burglary and theft after he was arrested on Wednesday (October 7) for a burglary at a care home in Staines.

Officers were called to the care home in Mulberry Avenue to view CCTV footage of the burglary which took place at around 6.45pm on October 2. Two men were seen forcing the front door of the home and stealing items from the front office before being escorted out by a member of staff.

Reilly has also pleaded guilty to the following offences:

 * Officers were called to the florists in High Street, Stanwell at 2.44am on September 22 by the owner saying that someone had broken into their shop. On arrival the officers found that the bottom wooden panel of the front door had been forced in, an untidy search had been carried out and the till had been emptied.
 * On October 5 at 4.20pm there was a theft from Boots in Two Rivers Shopping Centre, Staines during which Â£600 worth of Estee Lauder products were stolen.

PC Dave Udal from the North Surrey Policing Team said: "Burglary is a concern of most of us and it will absolutely not be tolerated in Surrey. I hope the fact that we have caught Reilly reassures victims of burglary that Surrey Police will do everything possible to secure a conviction for every case that comes our way."

Reilly has been remanded until 28 October when he will appear at Guildford Crown Court for sentencing
