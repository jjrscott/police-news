Surrey Police is continuing to appeal for information following an attempted murder in Farnham last Friday (6 November).

Officers were called around 9.30pm after a 52-year-old man was deliberately driven at in Farnborough Road by a dark grey Mercedes which failed to stop and drove off from the scene.

The man was taken to hospital and was treated for life-threatening injuries. He remains in hospital in a critical condition.

An investigation was launched and a vehicle, believed to be the one involved in the incident, has been recovered. The vehicle, a silver/grey Mercedes CLS, registration number WR11 VFB, had suffered significant damage to its front windscreen at the time of the offence (photograph of the vehicle attached).

A 38-year-old woman from Watford, Hertfordshire, was arrested in connection with the incident on Tuesday (10 November). She was interviewed and has been released on bail until 8 December.

We have also released a CCTV image of a man we would like to speak to in connection with the incident who we are still trying to identify.

Senior Investigating Officer Detective Inspector Chris Rambour of the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team, which is leading the investigation, said: "We are determined to find those responsible for this offence, where a man has been deliberately driven at and left for dead."

"The team is carrying out a full and thorough investigation to try and establish the circumstances of this incident. Someone out there knows what happened and who is responsible for causing these horrific injuries to the victim. We are appealing for anyone who knows anything to come forward as soon as possible so that we can progress our investigation."
