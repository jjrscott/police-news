We are trying to find the rightful owners of this property after two men were arrested on suspicion of burglary in Hampshire.

Following a report of a burglary in Guildford that took place between Saturday 21 November and Monday 23 November, officers conducted a warrant in Waterlooville in Hampshire on Tuesday 8 December. Two men were arrested at the address, including a 52 year-old man on suspicion of burglary, handling stolen goods and possession of Class A drugs; and a 20 year-old man on suspicion of burglary, handling stolen goods, and possession of Class B drugs. The 52 year-old man has been released on bail, and the 20 year-old man has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

These items were seized at the address, and we believe they were stolen in other burglaries. If you recognise these items and think they belong to you or someone you know, contact us quoting PR/45200124155 via:
