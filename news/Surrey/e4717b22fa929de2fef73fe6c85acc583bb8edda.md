We have released an image of a man we would like to speak to in connection with a number of incidents of indecent exposure that took place in Tadworth.

The incidents took place between July and October 2019, whereby a man has followed girls, and exposed himself to them. During this period of time, we received four reports of indecent exposure.

PC Jon Payne, of the Reigate Neighbourhood Policing Team said, "We are keen to identify who this man is as soon as possible as we believe he may be able to assist with our investigation. If you have any information about who he is, please call us. Fortunately incidents like this are rare, but we want to put a stop to such obscene behaviour as quickly as possible.

"The offender has targeted young girls who have all been between 10 - 12years of age. Police Community Support Officers have been liaising with nearby schools to help share safety advice with pupils on how they can stay safe.

"I would also ask members of the public, if you have been subjected to an indecent exposure by the same individual, then please report it to us as we take such incidents very seriously and want to ensure that we have the full picture of offending."

If you have any information on who this man is, or you have any other information that could help our investigation, please contact Surrey Police on 101 (999 in an emergency) or http://surrey.police.uk/TellUsMore , quoting reference PR/45190110235.

You can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111; or through their anonymous online form:https://crimestoppers-uk.org/.

We know that, if you have been a victim of indecent exposure, you may not wish to report what has happened to you, but we would urge anyone who has been approached in a similar way to report it to us on 101 (999 if a crime is in progress) so that we can identify who is responsible, and also provide you with support.
