We are appealing for the public's help to trace these items following a burglary in Tadworth in August.

During a burglary on Tuesday, 18 August, someone broke through the patio doors of a home in Woodland Way, Kingswood and managed to take a safe from a walk in closet which contained a number of items of jewellery, a few of which are highly sentimental, and cash. The total value of the items stolen is valued at between £30,000 and £40,000.

Have you seen these items? Perhaps you're a pawnbroker or work in a second-hand jewellery store - have you been offered these?

PC Richard Mcvitty said: "We want to recover this jewellery for the victim as it holds extreme sentimental value for them.

"If you work in the jewellery industry and have had any of these items passed on to you, please get in touch."

The items stolen include:

 * Tiffany Great Gatsby 2013/2014 limited edition locket

 * Silver 'Sofia' necklace

 * Greek 'Na Zisis' pin/child's ladybird bracelet

 * Men's gold cross in a baby blue velvet box with bear and letter 'b' on lid

 * Silver mirror (boxed) engraved with 'SIKC'

 * Silver Asprey pen boxes engraved with letters 'YJC'

 * Silver and turquoise necklace

 * Mother of Pearl and Onyx pendant
