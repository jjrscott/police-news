We are appealing for information after a man was left unconscious after he was attacked outside a Camberley nightclub in the early hours of December 8.

The man left Tru nightclub in the High Street just after 3am and was hanging around outside when he was approached by another man. A fight broke out and the victim was punched once to the face, causing him to fall backwards onto the ground. He was left unconscious for a couple of minutes. He was taken to hospital with head injuries and has since been discharged.

The suspect is described as white, around 27 years, tall and of a stocky build, with short black hair. He was wearing a red checked long-sleeved shirt and dark jeans.

We are appealing for anyone who witnessed the assault, or with any other information, to come forward straightaway. If you can help, please call us on 101, quoting crime reference number PR/45190131600. Alternatively, if you do not wish to leave your name, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
