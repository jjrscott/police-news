We're appealing for witnesses following a serious collision involving a car and pedestrian in Godalming on Saturday night (March 7).

Officers were called to the junction of Brighton Road and Flambards Way at 11pm following a report that a man had been in collision with a car. The man was taking to hospital with serious injuries.

The road was closed for a short time as part of the investigation and officers are now appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the collision or who may have CCTV or dashcam footage to get in touch.

Anyone with any information should contact Surrey Police on 101 and quote the reference number PR/P20055420.
