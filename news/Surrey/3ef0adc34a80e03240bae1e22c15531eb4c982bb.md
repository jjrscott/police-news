The family of Phillip Bagwell, 54 who was found dead near his home in Leatherhead on Wednesday, 10 June have paid tribute to him:

"Phillip grew up in the local area and was a friend to many people in and around Leatherhead - but to those of us who knew him for many years he was a good friend, always willing to listen and he had a true caring side.

"Phillip was a good dad and very proud of his two children who both loved him and will miss him.His family have many happy memories and loved him more than he will ever know.

"His friends and family will never forget Phillip and he will forever live in our hearts.

"This tragedy has robbed all of us of time with Phillip and our lives will be poorer for that."

Daniel George Hopper (known locally as Daniel Styles), 32 of Clare Crescent in Leatherhead has been charged with murder in relation to Phillip's death.
