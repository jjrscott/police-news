Officers are continuing to investigate circumstances of the death of 54 year-old Phillip Bagwell at a residential address at North Street in Leatherhead earlier this week.

Officers are continuing to investigate circumstances of the death of 54 year-old Phillip Bagwell at a residential address at North Street in Leatherhead earlier this week.

Earlier today the post mortem established that he had died following serious injuries to his head and abdomen. We are aware of rumours locally that Mr Bagwell had been stabbed, however the post-mortem showed the injuries that killed him were not consistent with a knife attack.

A 33 year-old man arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder as part of our enquiries has been released without charge with no further action.

A 32 year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder and conspiracy to murder remains in custody at this time following a 36 hour extension to his detention being granted by magistrates.

An earlier cordon between Lidl Supermarket and the Penny Black pub has been lifted, however you will continue to see a police presence in the area for reassurance. If you have any concerns you can speak to one of our uniformed officers.

If you have any information that could assist our investigation please call 101, quoting reference number PR/ 45200059647.

Alternatively, if you do not wish to leave your name, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
