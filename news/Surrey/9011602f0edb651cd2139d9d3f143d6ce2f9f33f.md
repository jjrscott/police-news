We are releasing an image of two men we'd like to speak to in relation to a robbery and assault at The Warren Recreation Ground in Epsom.

Two 14-year-old boys were playing badminton when they were approached by the suspects at around 8-8.15pm on 27 May.

The suspects began verbally abusing the boys before punching one of the victims in the head and running off with his headphones.

After a member of the public intervened, the headphones were returned to the victim.

The two men in the image were in the area at the time and we believe they may be able to help us with our investigation.

Police Constable Laura Hardie said: "This was an unprovoked assault on two boys who were minding their own business in the park and I would urge anyone who may have information about this incident, including CCTV footage of the area at the time, to please speak to us. We are doing everything we can to identify the suspects to stop this from happening again."

If you think you may know the men in the picture or have information which could help our investigation, please call us on 101 and quote ref PR/45200054794. Alternatively, if you prefer to remain anonymous, you can call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
