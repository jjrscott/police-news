We are appealing for witnesses to a collision in Hampton Court between a blue Volkswagen Golf and a silver Kia Ceed that resulted in the Volkswagen rolling over several times.

The collision happened just before 5pm this afternoon (10 May) at the junction of Hampton Court Way and Creek Road (opposite Hampton Court Station). The driver of the Volkswagen, a man in his 30s, was taken to hospital by land ambulance with serious injuries. The driver of the other vehicle was uninjured.

There are road closures in place around the station while the emergency services investigate and the vehicles are removed. This is expected to take up to three hours, and drivers are advised to avoid the area if possible (though diversions are in place).

Anyone who saw the collision; or has helmet cam or dashcam footage of the collision, or the manner in which the two vehicles were being driven in the moments before the collision; is asked to contact Surrey Police on 101 quoting reference PR/P20106855.
