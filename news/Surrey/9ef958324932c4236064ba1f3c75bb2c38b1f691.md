We're appealing for help to identify two men we'd like to speak to in connection with two robberies in Sunbury-on-Thames on 5 December.

The first robbery occurred at around 9.45pm when the 15-year-old victim was riding along Staines Road West on his e-scooter when he stopped near the junction with Alexandra Road to check his phone. Two men approached him and began punching him in the head before threatening to stab him. They took his e-scooter and mobile phone before the victim was able to get away.

The second robbery occurred short time later on Vicarage Road. The 14-year-old victim was riding her bike when she noticed two men following her. As she stopped at the junction with Heatherland, one of the men approached her and punched her in the face. They then took the bike and cycled off towards Burgoyne Road.

One of the men is described as black, around 5ft 6inch tall, of slim build and was wearing a red or orange face mask and black puffer jacket. The second man is described as black, around 5ft 7inch tall, of slim build and was wearing dark clothing and riding a black bike.

Detective Constable Rebecca Martin, who is investigating these incidents, said: "This was a terrifying ordeal for these young victims who were subject to cowardly, violent attacks. We're doing everything we can to find those responsible. If you recognise the men in the CCTV images please get in contact with us, they may be able to help."
