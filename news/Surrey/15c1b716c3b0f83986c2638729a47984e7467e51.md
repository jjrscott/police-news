We would like to speak to the man in this CCTV image in connection with an upskirting incident at Morrisons supermarket in Woking in September.

The incident took place around 5pm on 13 September. A man was reported to have followed a woman around the store and filmed up her skirt, before then following her to her vehicle.

The suspect is described as white, in his 50s, of medium build with sandy grey wavy hair and short stubble on his face. He was wearing glasses and dark-coloured trousers with a red checked long-sleeved shirt and dark shoes. He was riding a black road bicycle.
