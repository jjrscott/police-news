We are appealing for witnesses, after a 19 year old man was found seriously injured in Barnes Wallis Drive, Weybridge, late last night.

The man was found unconscious with head injuries close to a bus stop shortly before 23:30 last night (Friday 24 July). His bicycle was found next to him, but a car that we believe may also have been involved had not stopped.

Crews from South East Coast Ambulance and the air ambulance attended, and the man was taken to hospital by land, where he is now conscious but his condition is described as serious.

As a result of early enquiries, officers have arrested a 18 year old man from Chertsey on suspicion of failing to stop at the scene of an accident, and of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. We have also seized a red Volkswagen polo for forensic examination.

We are keen to speak to anyone who may have seen the incident; or the red VW Polo or the man riding the bicycle in and around the Brooklands industrial estate in the minutes before the collision. In particular we urge anyone who may have mobile phone footage, or dashcam or helmetcam footage from the area to come forward and contact Surrey Police on 101, or by reporting online quoting the reference PR/P20172409.
