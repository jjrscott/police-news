A man has been summonsed following a collision last year which led to massive delays on the A3 after the road was closed at the Ripley bypass.

The 23-year-old man from Wandsworth, London, has been summonsed in relation to offences of dangerous driving, driving with no insurance and driving whilst disqualified.

He is due to appear at Guildford Magistrates' Court on 3 March.

Two vehicles were involved in a collision with a lorry on the A3 southbound near the Ripley bypass around 9.15am on 12 August. Fortunately, those involved in the collision only received minor injuries.

The road was closed for two and a half hours while officers dealt with the investigation into the incident and the vehicles were recovered.
