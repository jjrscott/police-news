A drug dealer from Guildford is behind bars for four and a half years after being found guilty of possession with intent to supply class A drugs following a trial which concluded last week.

Claudiu Iftene, 41, of Porchester Road, London, was sentenced at crown court after being found guilty of supplying drugs in the Guildford area.

Iftene was driving a black Audi along Broad Street around 10.45pm on 12 December 2018 and had pulled over when he was approached by officers on patrol.

As soon as he saw the police vehicle, he drove off towards the Rydes Hill roundabout but was stopped in Aldershot Road.

Officers noticed two mobile phones on the dashboard and Iftene's furtive and suspicious behaviour led to them searching his vehicle under Section 23 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.

They uncovered a large quantity of cash in a variety of denominations, as well as a small bag containing white powder in an inside pocket of Iftene's coat, which was later confirmed to be cocaine. Another large amount of cash was also found in his trouser pocket.

He was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A drugs, being concerned in the supply of class A drugs and possession of criminal property.

Â£1,595.00 was later seized from Iftene under the Proceeds of Crime Act after a financial investigation was carried out which confirmed he had no legitimate source of income.

Following the trial at Guildford Crown Court, he was found guilty of possession with intent to supply class A drugs and possession of criminal property, and ordered to forfeit his phones, cash and his Audi.

Sergeant Phil Sheppard, who investigated the incident, said: "Iftene had a large amount of cash and cocaine on him and his phones were continuously ringing while officers were searching him. Following further investigation by our proactive team, a large amount of messages relating to drug supply were found, confirming that he was dealing in the local area.

"The sentence given to Iftene shows that drug dealing will simply not be tolerated in our local communities and that we will do our utmost to ensure that those who supply drugs are brought to justice.

"Information from members of the public can be really valuable in tackling drug dealing in our county. If you suspect someone is dealing drugs, or involved in the supply of drugs, we want to hear from you."
