We still need your help in finding Ashley after he escaped from court in 2018.

Ashley Mitchell, 32, from Wandsworth, was sentenced to four years in prison for possession with intent to supply crack cocaine and heroin at Lewes Crown Court on 27 July 2018.

He left the court that day and has not been seen since. We believe he could be in South London and has connections to Lambeth, Thornton Heath and Croydon. He is also wanted by The Metropolitan Police for numerous other offences.

Mitchell is described as black, 178cm tall, of an athletic build, with short dark hair and brown eyes. He was wearing a white tee-shirt and chinos when he was last seen.

Mitchell was arrested on 18 January 2018 after being stopped by police in a car in Kingston Road, Leatherhead, on 18 January 2018. He was searched and found to be in possession of multiple wraps of class A drugs, as well as a number of mobile phones.
