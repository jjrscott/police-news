We are appealing for witnesses after a victim was attacked and robbed on 20 May in Guildford.

The victim was walking along Woodbridge Road just before midnight when he noticed he was being followed.

The suspect punched the victim repeatedly in the head and hit him over the head with the victim's skateboard. He demanded money before making off with the victim's skateboard. The suspect is believed to have been part of a group who might have been nearby.

The suspect is described as a white teenage boy, 6ft tall with short blonde hair. We believe he was carrying a box of beers.

A 15-year-old boy has been questioned in relation to this incident.

If you witnessed this incident or have any CCTV footage which might help this investigation, please call 101 and quote ref PR/45200052262. Alternatively, if you prefer to remain anonymous, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
