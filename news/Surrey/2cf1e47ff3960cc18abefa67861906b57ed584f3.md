We are renewing our appeal for witnesses following an attempted robbery in Camberley on Tuesday 18 February.

The two victims who were teenage boys were sitting on a bench behind the Surrey Heath Borough Council offices, when they were approached by two men at just before 6pm.

The men made threats before the victims managed to run away uninjured and without anything being stolen.

An e-fit image of one of the men is attached to this appeal. They were described as:

 * One was Asian and the other white.
 * Both were aged in their teens.
 * They were wearing dark clothing with hoods pulled up.

Anyone who recognises the man pictured or who has information should call 101, quoting crime reference number PR/45200019647.

Alternatively, if you do not wish to leave your name, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
