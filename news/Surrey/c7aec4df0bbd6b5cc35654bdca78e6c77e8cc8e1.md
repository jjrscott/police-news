Surrey Police is continuing to work with the community after much of the county was placed under tier 4 restrictions yesterday and ahead of changes to the regulations around Christmas later this week.

The county, with the exception of Waverley, has been placed under tier 4 restrictions which carries the 'stay at home' message, unless you're leaving the house for a legally exempt 'reasonable excuse'.

Travel between Waverley and the rest of the borough has also been restricted, with the below guidance in place:

Those in a tier 4 area (all boroughs of Surrey apart from Waverley) are not permitted to travel outside of their tier and those in a tier 2 area (Waverley) are not permitted to travel into a higher tier area (such as the rest of Surrey), unless for exceptional reasons, such as:

 * travel to work where you cannot work from home
 * travel to education and for caring responsibilities
 * visit (including staying overnight with) those in your support bubble - or your childcare bubble for childcare
 * attend hospital, GP and other medical appointments or visits where you have had an accident or are concerned about your health

T/Assistant Chief Constable Ali Barlow commended the community's high compliance and support since restrictions came in on 23 March earlier this year, continuing:

"As much of the community adjusts to tier 4 restrictions, we are continuing our tried and tested approach of engaging, explaining and encouraging residents on how to keep our communities safe and prevent the spread of the virus. We will only enforce as a last resort.

We do recognise that this is a difficult time for everyone, particularly as different areas are now living under different rules at a time when we thought we'd all be together. Whilst this isn't what we hoped our Christmas would be, it is important that we continue our collective efforts to look out for each other to keep loved ones and the wider community safe this festive season."

A full list of the guidance and rules of living in a tier 4 area can be found on the government website. Similarly, a full list of guidance for living in a tier 2 area can be found here.

Guidance on forming a Christmas bubble can be found on the government website.
