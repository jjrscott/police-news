The family of Dominic Fell who died following a collision in Stanwell on New Year's Eve have issued a tribute.

Mr Fell, aged 23, known as Dom, died following the collision involving a white Toyota Yaris and an HGV at the junction of Bedfont Road and Long Lane at 11.39pm.

His family have issued the below tribute:

"Our Dom - he grew up in Grimsby, went to Tollbar school, studied photojournalism at LCC and travelled the world working for BA, which he loved.

"But Dom was so much more than that. He was a true original; boring wasn't a concept he'd ever grasped. Our lives have been packed with laughter and so much fun because of him and we will miss him dearly.

"Dom, without doubt, was the most loving, generous, and kind young man you could ever wish to meet. He'd do anything for anybody especially his family and friends. We are all shocked and devastated to have lost him from our lives.

"In the words of his mother, 'Dom left an indelible mark on everyone's life, he was a true gem and gentleman'.

"We will all love Dom endlessly and he will live forever in our hearts.

"We'd like to thank everyone for their condolences. It's heart-warming to know he was loved by so many. We'd also like to thank all of those who have made donations to the BA Angels page, the generosity has been overwhelming.

"When we know more about Dom's funeral, we'll let everyone know."
