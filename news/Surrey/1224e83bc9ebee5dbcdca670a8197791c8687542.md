A man has been sentenced after pleading guilty to a poaching offence in Warlingham which took place in December 2019.

Christopher Tucker, 33, of Carshalton, pleaded guilty to possessing an article to kill or take game, contrary to the Night Poaching Act 1828 when he appeared at Guildford Magistrates' Court last month.

Police were called following reports of lamping and suspected poaching on land in Warlingham on 12 December 2019.

They searched the nearby woods with assistance from a gamekeeper and came across two adults and a child, all of whom made off from police before they were eventually detained.

The adults were arrested on suspicion of night poaching and entering land unlawfully with a firearm. One of the men, Tucker, was also found in possession of a head torch, catapult and ball bearings.

Tucker was charged following a lengthy investigation. No further action was taken against the other man arrested.

Tucker was ordered to forfeit the catapult and ball bearings and was also ordered to pay a fine and costs amounting to Â£197.

PC Laura Rowley, Rural Crime Officer for Surrey Police, said:

"In the almost four years I've overseen this role, this is the first time I am aware of this offence actually getting to court. It is notoriously difficult to prosecute this offence due to a number of reasons, including lack of eyewitnesses or proof of the offence taking place. We were also using an offence from the 1800s. The fact that the defendant has been prosecuted should reassure residents that we are invested in rural crime and bringing offenders to justice."
