We're appealing for witnesses after a man exposed himself to a woman out jogging along the Basingstoke canal tow path yesterday (29 September).

The victim was approaching the bridge near the junction with Victoria Way at around 6.30pm when the suspect overtook her on foot and exposed himself before running off in the direction of Knaphill.

For investigative reasons, the description of the suspect is intentionally limited in this press release, however if you were on the canal around this time and saw a male wearing a dark grey hooded top with dark grey or black trousers, please contact us and we can discuss this further with you.

The canal path would have been busy at the time and we believe other people may have seen a man matching the description in the area.

If you experience or see any behaviour like this in our community, please call 999 straight away so we have the best opportunity to catch the suspect involved. Early reporting is vital in our response to these crimes.
