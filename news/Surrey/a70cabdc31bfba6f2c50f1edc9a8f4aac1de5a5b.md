A lorry driver has pleaded guilty to driving whilst disqualified and driving with no insurance after he was caught during a policing operation at Clacket Lane Services in January.

Ashley Cheeseman, 38, of Gloucester Road, Gravesend, Kent, was already disqualified when he was caught and has been sentenced to 16 weeks in custody for both offences.

His driving disqualification was also extended by 12 months, which means he will be banned from driving until 2025.

Officers were on patrol on the morning of 16 January when they noticed a white VW Crafter flatbed lorry containing scaffolding equipment travelling westbound on the M25 between Junctions 6 and 6. The vehicle appeared to be extensively laden and overweight, so officers stopped it at the services.

Before officers could carry out any checks, Cheeseman told them that he was disqualified from driving.

Checks confirmed Cheeseman was disqualified until 2024 with the requirement to undertake an extended driving test when his disqualification expired.

Driving whilst disqualified also meant that Cheeseman was not covered by the minimum third party insurance cover required. He also admitted to not telling his employer he was disqualified.

Chief Inspector Mike Hodder from the Roads Policing Unit said: "The team was out on a policing operation when they noticed the lorry which was laden down with scaffolding equipment. They pulled the vehicle over and discovered the driver was disqualified until 2024 - which also meant that he was not covered by insurance. He then confessed that he hadn't told his employer. Luckily, officers pulled him over before he could do any serious harm to other road users. I hope that the fact he received a prison sentence sends a clear message that getting behind the wheel whilst disqualified is dangerous and utterly responsible - and you will be punished for it."
