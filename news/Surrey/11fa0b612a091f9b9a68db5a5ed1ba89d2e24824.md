An investigation is underway following a suspicious incident along the Basingstoke Canal towpath in the Brookwood area of Woking on Saturday evening (20 March).

A number of enquiries remain ongoing to establish the circumstances surrounding the incident and we are keen to speak with members of the public who were in this area between 5pm and midnight. We would also like to hear from anyone driving through the areas of Connaught Road, Bagshot Road and Brookwood Lye Road, particularly if you have any dashcam footage.

Woking Borough Commander Inspector Dave Bentley said: "I would like to reassure the local community that we are take any matters of community safety extremely seriously. I know the local community are aware of a number of suspicious incidents have been reported along the canal towpath recently and I appreciate that this may be making people feel anxious and unsafe.

"I want to reassure you that these are all being thoroughly investigated and that we are doing everything we can to identify any potential suspects and ensure they are brought to justice."

"We are also working with our partners to launch Canal Watch, a new community initiative that will involve a team of around 30 local volunteers patrolling the towpath at specific times and reporting any suspicious behaviour to the police."

Insp Bentley added: "In the meantime, we would urge anyone who may have seen anything out they consider to be out of the ordinary along the towpath or anyone who has any other information, to come forward as soon as possible. We would also like to hear from anyone who has been the victim of crime to report it to us - you will be taken seriously and it will be fully investigated."
