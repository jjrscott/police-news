We are appealing for witnesses following an assault that happened in a Guildford car park on Christmas Eve.

The incident happened in the open air car park in Bedford Road at 3.20am when a man was punched following a dispute. The victim was taken to hospital with a head injury and has since been discharged.

Officers are appealing for help to identify a potential witness to the incident who was wearing a red Santa hat at the time and also for any witnesses who saw the behaviour of those involved beforehand.

Investigating officer Detective Sergeant Steve Bullard said: "It was busy in this area of Guildford as nearby nightclubs closed and so there may be a number of witnesses to what happened that we have not yet spoken to.

"In particular there is a man wearing a red Santa hat that was stood very close by to the incident who may have heard what was said by those involved. If this was you, please get in touch as soon as possible. As well as that man we need to speak to anyone that was in this car park at the time as they may have also heard what was said between the men involved.

"We know that the quality of these images are not great, but it might be enough to jog the memory of the person pictured to come forward."

Anyone with information should contact Surrey Police via 101 or use www.surrey.police.uk and quote the reference number PR/45190127797.

One man has been arrested on suspicion of causing actual bodily harm and has been released under investigation.
