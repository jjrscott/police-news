A second person has been arrested following an attempted murder in Farnham on Friday, 6 November.

Officers were called around 9.30pm after a 52-year-old man was deliberately driven at in Farnborough Road by a dark grey Mercedes which failed to stop and drove off from the scene. The victim remains in hospital in a critical condition.

Last Thursday (19 November) an 18-year-old-man from Epping, Essex was arrested on suspicion of attempt murder. He has been bailed until the middle of December with conditions.

A 38-year-old woman from Watford, Hertfordshire was also arrested on Tuesday, 10 November and has since been released on bail.

We previously released that a vehicle, believed to be the one involved in the incident had been recovered. The vehicle was a silver/grey Mercedes CLS, registration number WR11 VFB.

In addition to this, investigating officers at Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team have identified another vehicle believed to be involved. This is a silver Mercedes C200 Sport Index with the registration plate RY07 GGP.

Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Inspector Chris Rambour of the Surrey and Sussec Major Crime Team said "This is a complex investigation- however we have made significant progress since it was launched.

"That said, we still need the public's help to enable us to those responsible to account.

"We are releasing the details of a second car believed to be involved, and urging the public to review any dashcam footage taken between 9:15pm and 9:45pm on Friday, 6 November and get in touch if they have any footage of this vehicle."
