We are appealing for witnesses after two burglars broke into a house in Tadworth and threatened the occupant with a knife on Wednesday evening (20 November).

The two men also punched the occupant before pouring petrol in the hallway, making a threat to light it the next time, before leaving. The incident occurred around 7pm at an address in Marbles Way. The occupants had reported that a brick had been through the window around 4am the same day.

The man with the knife is described as around 30 years old, between 5ft 10 and 6ft tall, of slim build and was wearing a dark blue or black tracksuit with a hooded top and jogging bottoms. He had a scarf covering his face and was wearing dark sunglasses and leather gloves.

The second man is described as around the same age and of a similar height and build as the first man. He was wearing a dark tracksuit with a hooded top and had his face covered with a scarf and dark glasses.

A number of enquiries have already been completed and the investigation remains ongoing.

Anyone who witnessed anything suspicious in the area around the time of the offence, or with any other information which could assist our investigation, is asked to contact us on 101, quoting crime reference number PR/45190124906. Alternatively, if you do not wish to leave your name, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
