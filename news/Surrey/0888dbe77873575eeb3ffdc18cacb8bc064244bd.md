We are appealing for witnesses following an incident in Whyteleafe on July 3 when the occupant of a car was threatened by another driver.

The alteration took place at some point between 8pm - 8.30pm when the victim was followed by a large white van as it drove along Godstone Road in Whyteleafe. It continued to follow the victim as they went along Well Farm Heights and up Whyteleafe Hill.

The victim's car was eventually stopped by the van close to Audley Primary School where they were then threatened by the suspect and damage was done to their car.

The van has been described as a large white van with green and yellow sign writing down the side.
