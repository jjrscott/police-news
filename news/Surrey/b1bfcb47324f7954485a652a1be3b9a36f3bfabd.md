A vulnerable missing man has been found!

We are pleased to confirm that we have located a 22 year old man missing from North Surrey, who was reported missing after he sent concerning electronic messages to his friends.

We'd like to thank everybody who shared our appeal - the response from the public was heartening, and it was as a direct result of a piece of information that we received that we were able to locate the man.

We now ask that you remove any appeals you may have shared or made, in order to help the man restore his privacy.
