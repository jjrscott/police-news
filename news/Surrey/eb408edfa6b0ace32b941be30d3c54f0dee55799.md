Officers investigating a burglary in Woking are keen to trace the owners of items recovered during a subsequent warrant.

A house was broken into on Boundary Road at some point between 5:50pm and 6:50pm on Tuesday 1 October. Jewellery and foreign currency was taken.

A warrant was subsequently carried out at an address in Mitcham on Monday 7 October as part of our investigation. We're releasing images of jewellery recovered from this address, which we believe may be stolen.

If you recognise it please call 101 quoting 45190106296.

**We are working hard to reduce the number of burglaries across the county, including those where high-value gold and jewellery is targeted.**

**You can help to deter a burglar from entering your home and stealing your valuable possessions by following these simple crime prevention measures:**

 * Keep all jewellery and other valuables in a safety deposit box if your bank offers this service.
 * If you have to keep your jewellery at home, invest in a home safe. Your insurance company will provide advice as to the best safe to suit your needs
 * Keep an inventory of your jewellery, either on paper or via a company such as www.immobilise.com; include identifying marks and the value
 * In addition, photograph your jewellery against a plain background using a ruler to give an idea of size
 * Check your home insurance to ensure that it covers keeping high-value jewellery at home
 * Install a house alarm and security lighting. Always make sure doors and windows are locked and secure when you go out
 * Make sure your home looks occupied when you are out or away. Use an automatic timer switch to turn interior lights on and off.
 * Consider your privacy settings on any social media platforms and avoid posting about weddings, festivals or other celebrations, where someone may be able to identify that you are not at home or that you own high value jewellery.
 * Try to avoid decorating the outside of your home during religious festivals and events. This could attract burglars, as they may believe that jewellery or other valuables are inside the address.
 * Mark your property with a forensic marking product such as www.selectadna.co.ukFor more crime prevention advice please visit: https://www.surrey.police.uk/cp/crime-prevention/residential-burglary/
