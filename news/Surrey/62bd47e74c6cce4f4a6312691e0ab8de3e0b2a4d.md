We are appealing for witnesses after a man was threatened with a knife on the crossroads between Stroughton Road and Manor Road in Guildford yesterday evening (6 July) at around 8:30pm.

The victim was approached by four males, who are believed to have got out of a red Vauxhall car or similar, by the small parade of shops on the crossroads of Grange Road.

The victim is then believed to have ran from the scene before the four males got back into a red coloured vehicle and drove off.
