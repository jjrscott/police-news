We are appealing for witnesses following a road rage incident in Guildford on Monday, 11 January where a cyclist has deliberately been driven at.

Officers were called to Trodds Lane in Guildford shortly before 4pm following reports that a cyclist had deliberately been driven at twice. The cyclist had got into a verbal altercation with the driver of a silver Rover. Following this, the driver has then turned and swerved deliberately causing the cyclist to fall. The cyclist sustained minor injuries.

We are appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the incident or have any dashcam footage to get in touch.
