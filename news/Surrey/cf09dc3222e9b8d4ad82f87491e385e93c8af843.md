We are appealing for witnesses after an incident of racially aggravated common assault and racially aggravated public order in Bramley.

On Saturday, 27 February at about 3.40pm, a delivery driver pulled up on High Street, Bramley, opposite the community library, to make two deliveries. As he stopped his vehicle, a man driving behind the victim beeped his horn aggressively, pulling up alongside the victim's vehicle and shouting at him through the window. He then parked his car and returned to shout at the victim again, before driving away.

A 52-year-old man was later arrested on suspicion of racially aggravated common assault and a racially aggravated public order offence. He has since been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

We are looking for anyone who might have witnessed this incident to come forward. Were you driving or walking along the High Street in Bramley on Saturday, 27 February between 3.30pm and 4pm? Did you see this incident take place?

If you witnessed this incident or have any information which may help, including dashcam or CCTV footage, please call 101 and quote ref PR/45210020474. If you wish to remain anonymous, you can also call independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
