We are appealing for witnesses after an 80-year-old woman was pushed to the ground outside Sainsbury's on Limpsfield Road in Warlingham.

The victim was queuing to enter the supermarket between 3.30 and 4.30pm on 18 June when the people behind her became agitated by a man in front of her who was looking at his mobile phone and not keeping up with the queue.

As the victim tried to move around the man, she fell face first on the ground, suffering extensive bruising to her body and damage to her teeth. The suspect walked away from the woman and into the store after she fell.

We believe the suspect who pushed or tripped her was in his mid-50s.

Karen Hughes, Tandridge Borough Commander said: "The victim has been left with extensive bruising and was extremely shaken as a result of this incident. We are keen to find the person responsible and would urge anyone with information to please come forward."

Multiple members of the public were in the queue at the time and would have witnessed the incident. If you are one of these people, or have any information which could help the investigation, please call 101 and quote ref PR/45200064821. Alternatively if you prefer to remain anonymous, you can call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
