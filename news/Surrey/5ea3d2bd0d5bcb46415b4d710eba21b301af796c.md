Police who are investigating a report of suspicious behaviour in a woodland near Headley are appealing for dog walkers, horse riders and other bridleway users to come forward as they may have information that could assist with their investigation.

At around 5.30pm on Thursday 12 March, a 13-year-girl left a stables close to the tunnel under the M25 where Headley Road joins Tilley Road. She made her way north along Headley Road before turning onto a bridleway that passes through woodland and eventually ends at Shepherds Walk. She returned at around 6.10pm and shared with her father concerns about two men that were along the route she'd taken. Officers attended but were unable to find the two men.

We are appealing for dog walkers, horse riders or other bridleway users that may have used the bridleway on Thursday evening between 5 and 7pm to come forward. In particular witnesses reported a black van being parked at the junction of Headley Road, Shepherds Walk, Farm Lane and Downs Road, and we are keen to trace anyone associated with this van as it is possible they may have seen something that could help our investigation without realising it.

We are also keen to speak to anyone who was driving in the immediate area between 5 and 7pm on Thursday, and may have dashcam or helmet cam footage of the roads and other road users.

Anyone with information that could help the investigation is asked to contact Surrey Police on 101, ref PR/45200028458.
