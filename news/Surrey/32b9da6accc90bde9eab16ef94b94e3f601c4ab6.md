We are appealing for witnesses after a man was assaulted and had his e-scooter stolen in Camberley.

The victim was riding his e-scooter along the A325 Portsmouth Road on Tuesday, 17 November around 11:30pm when a small dark Ford parked up in front of him. Three men got out of the car and hit the victim over the back of the head before stealing his e-scooter.
The suspects then drove off towards Frimley Park Hospital.

The victim received a minor head injury.
The suspects are described as white, between 18 and 22 years old and wearing light-coloured tracksuits.
PC Will Ellery, who is investigating, said: "We are appealing to anyone who may have been travelling in the area on the night and have any dashcam footage of the vehicle or suspects who match the description to get in touch."
