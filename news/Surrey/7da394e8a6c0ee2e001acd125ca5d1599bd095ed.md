As part of Surrey Police's ongoing work in partnership with the Metropolitan Police to disrupt the supply of class A drugs, Jesse Katende, 27, of De Brome Road in Feltham has been sentenced for dealing heroin and crack cocaine.

Katende was arrested following a vehicle stop check in Staines-upon-Thames on Tuesday 16 June 2020.

On the same day a warrant under s23 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 was also conducted at an address in Staines-upon-Thames associated to him.

Katende was charged with being concerned in the supply of heroin and crack cocaine.

He was sentenced to three years and eight months last week (6 August), after pleading guilty to supplying class A drugs at Kingston Crown Court.

PC Jordan, who investigated the case, said: "I'd like to remind people of the importance of providing information to us when they suspect drug dealing is taking place in their communities. You might not think it - but a little can really go a long way and we're grateful for every single call. I hope this sentence will make anyone involved with the supply of drugs think twice before they offend on the streets of Surrey."

Anyone with concerns about drug related crime in their area are urged to call us on 101 or 999 in an emergency. Alternatively, suspicions can be raised anonymously through independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

What are the signs of potential drug dealing?

\- Lots of visitors, who don't stay very long, arriving at all times of the day and night

\- People waiting in cars outside particular properties exchanging small packets or cash

\- Lots of visitors bringing items such as T.V's or bikes but leaving empty handed

\- Lone/vulnerable neighbours suddenly having groups of young men living at their address.

What we want to know:

\- Time, date and place

\- Vehicle registrations and the make, model and colour

\- Descriptions of people and details of what they were doing

\- Direction they travelling to and from

\- How many times you have seen them - is it always at the same time of day

Don't put yourself at risk while gathering this information. Please always pass the information to the police and do not confront or approach suspected drug dealers.
