We are appealing for witnesses after a man died following a collision on the A3 at Guildford earlier this evening (9 October).

The collision, involving two vehicles, took place around 5pm on the southbound carriageway near the cathedral slip road.

The driver of one of the vehicles was sadly pronounced dead at the scene shortly after the incident.

The road was closed for around three hours while emergency services dealt with the collision and we would like to thank motorists who were caught up in the delays for their patience.

If you witnessed the incident, or you have any dashcam footage which could assist our investigation, please contact us on 101 quoting incident reference PR/P19234039.
