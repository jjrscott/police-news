We are appealing for witnesses after three men broke into a house in Ewell on Tuesday night (3 November).

The burglary took place at around 5pm when the three men entered the house on Albury Avenue and stole jewellery and two mobile phones from the elderly occupants.

One suspect was not wearing a mask and has been described as a white male, around 6ft tall, of a large build with short blond hair and a local accent. He was wearing a light coloured jumper with writing on it. The other two men were wearing masks and were also white and over 6ft tall. They were also of a large build and both were wearing dark jackets with an emblem on. The suspects got away in a white vehicle.
