A set of promises demonstrating our commitment to local communities which will shape how we respond to policing challenges over the next five years has been launched this week by Surrey Police.

The Force Commitments, which were launched by Chief Constable Gavin Stephens today, promise that we will do our best for the people of Surrey to enable them to "be safe and feel safe".

The Commitments, which were being developed pre-pandemic, have recently been agreed following further consultation with our staff and partners.

In his promise to local communities, CC Stephens pledged to prevent crime by providing local officers to tackle local problems; being proactive in dealing with local issues and helping communities protect themselves from harm. He also pledged to protect local residents by responding effectively to help people in crisis and working with others to help the most vulnerable.

He also promised to target serious, harmful and persistent offenders, particularly those who prey on the vulnerable; and carrying out full and thorough investigations to bring more offenders to justice.

The Commitments ask the Force to play its part through prevention, by tackling the causes of crime and disorder, acting promptly to make a difference and avoiding quick fixes that don't last; partnership, by working with everyone who can help make our communities safer; and potential, by becoming a more diverse organisation, investing in technology and taking responsibility to protect the environment for future generations.

CC Stephens said that the Force will also play its part by meeting high standards of ethical behaviour; taking pride in its service to the public and respecting the differences in the communities we serve.

He explained: "Having policed Surrey since 1996, I have always believed that our strongest commitment should be to our communities. It is also important to me that the commitments guide how we respond to policing challenges over the next five years, as well as providing an insight into what it feels like to work for Surrey Police.

"A commitment is defined as a promise or firm decision to do something, and we will be working hard with our partners and local communities to ensure that we fulfil these promises over the next five years."
