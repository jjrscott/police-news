Residents in Leatherhead may notice an increased police presence locally after an incident at a property in The Fairway earlier today.

Officers were called at 8.30 this morning (13 December) to a report of a man with a wound to his head. We quickly attended and, supported by the National Police Air Service helicopter, located and arrested a man in a nearby garden who we believe was involved in the assault. A second man was arrested at a nearby address. Both men have been taken to custody.

Detective Inspector Jackie Brock said: "I understand how a police presence on this residential street could be disconcerting so early on a Sunday morning. I want to reassure local residents that I believe this was a contained incident, in a private house, between men who are known to each other. We have arrested two suspects and are not looking for anyone else. The injured man has been taken to hospital, but is not currently thought to be seriously injured."

"There will continue to be a police presence locally while officers carry out enquiries and speak with neighbours. I'd like to thank local residents for their patience and understanding this morning, and appeal for anyone who may have information that could help us understand what happened to come forward - I am keen to speak to anyone who may have driven or walked down the Fairway between 8 and 8.30 this morning, in case they saw anything that could assist the investigation."

Anyone who has information, or dashcam or helmet cam footage, is asked to contact Surrey Police urgently using the "live chat" function on the website, and quoting reference PR/P20287305.
