A man was jailed for 32 months after pleading guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to supply when he appeared at Guildford Crown Court.

Georgi Georgiev, 27, of Morden Court, Morden, also pleaded guilty to driving whilst disqualified and driving without third party insurance. He was sentenced to two months' imprisonment for driving whilst disqualified to be served concurrently. He was also banned from driving until May 2022.

Officers were on patrol in Kingston Road, Leatherhead, around 11.45pm on Saturday, 12 October when they spotted a blue Vauxhall Astra being driven in a suspicious manner. Further checks revealed that the registered keeper and insured party on the vehicle were showing as disqualified. Officers followed the car and stopped it in a side road.

Georgiev was driving the car and could not provide a sufficient explanation when officers asked where he was heading. Officers searched him and the car and found over Â£600 in cash on him. Throughout the search his phone was continuously ringing and receiving texts from unknown numbers.

Further enquiries showed he had been driving around Leatherhead and Epsom extensively throughout the day, and he was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs.

Georgiev was strip searched in custody and was found hiding multiple packages of white powder within a sock and a black drawstring bag in his trousers. He was further arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A drugs.

PC Joe Brown, who investigated the case, said: "The initial search did not uncover any drugs - it was only when he was strip searched that he was found to be hiding the cocaine in his trousers.

 "The sentence given to Georgiev shows that drug dealing will simply not be tolerated in our local communities and that we will do our utmost to ensure that those who supply drugs are brought to justice.

"Information from members of the public can be really valuable in tackling drug dealing in our county. If you suspect someone is dealing drugs, or involved in the supply of drugs, we want to hear from you."
