We are appealing for witnesses following a fatal collision on the A3 at Painshill earlier this evening (4 December).

Police were called to the multi-vehicle collision which took place just before 6pm on the southbound carriageway.

The driver of one of the vehicles, a man in his 50s, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene shortly afterwards.

No one else was injured as a result of the collision, which involved seven vehicles, including four cars and three vans.

The road was closed while emergency services, including fire and ambulance crews and the air ambulance, dealt with the incident. A diversion remains in place.

Anyone who witnessed the collision, or has any dashcam footage or any other information which could help, is asked to contact us straightaway via webchat on our website surrey.police.uk or by calling us on 101, quoting incident reference PR/P20280613.
