Police have arrested three men on suspicion of burglary following a pursuit in Wentworth last night (19 October).

Officers were made aware of a vehicle believed to be linked to burglaries in the Virginia Water area. The vehicle was stopped and a man was detained.

Following the arrest, officers became aware that there may be other suspects in the area.

The police helicopter was called to assist in the search and a man was arrested at a nearby property following a pursuit. Another man was arrested nearby.

The three men, aged 26, 35 and 43, were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit burglary.

Investigating Officer PC Mark Hennessey said: "Following a coordinated effort, including assistance from the police helicopter, we managed to arrest these three men in relation to burglary offences. They are in custody while we carry out further enquiries.

"We appreciate that the police activity last night may have caused concerns locally and we are grateful to the people of Runnymede for their understanding and support."
