We are appealing for information after receiving a number of reports about buses deliberately having their windows smashed in the Spelthorne area.

Officers believe that the people involved are using objects such as catapults or pellets to smash the bus windows and remain out of sight.

One such incident occurred on Thursday, 4 February, at around 5.50pm, on the railway bridge of Kingston Road, Staines-Upon-Thames. It appears a pellet was used to smash the window, and luckily the driver and passengers were unhurt.

Two other similar incidents involved a suspect firing what is believed to be a pellet from an air rifle, at two separate buses on Woodthorpe Road, Ashford, on Tuesday, 2 February, at around 9pm.

Inspector Maxine Cilia, Spelthorne Borough Commander, said: "This type of anti-social behaviour is unacceptable and could have fatal consequences. Fortunately no one has been hurt yet, but it could only be a matter of time before a driver or passenger is seriously injured by the pellet or smashing glass.

"We are taking this extremely seriously and if anyone has seen anything suspicious or knows anything about these incidents, please contact us."
