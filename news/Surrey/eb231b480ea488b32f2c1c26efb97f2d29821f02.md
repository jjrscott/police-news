Do you recognise this mountain bike?

Three of them were stolen from Frimley Bike Hub at Frimley Lodge Park at some point between 9:45pm on Sunday 5 July and 7am the following morning.

In total twenty mountain bikes were stolen after someone broke in through gates at the end of a track off Guildford Road. Seventeen of the mountain bikes were recovered by our colleagues at Hampshire Constabulary after they were found in woodland at Eversley on Monday evening.

Enquiries are ongoing to find out who broke in and recover the two remaining mountain bikes. They are described as:

 * Manufactured by Vitus.
 * Bike model: Mythique - full suspension.
 * 27.5" wheel size.
 * Grey in colour.

If you saw or have dashcam footage anyone acting suspiciously in the area that could assist our investigation, please contact us on 101, quoting crime reference PR/ 45200069790.

Alternatively, if you do not wish to leave your name, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
