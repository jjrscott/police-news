We are appealing for witnesses following an aggravated burglary in Ashford on Tuesday. (31 December)

We were called to a residential property on Orchard Way just before 9pm, following reports of two men with knives attempting to gain access to the house by forcing open the ground floor window.

The men then departed in an Audi, believed to be a A6 or A7.

We are appealing to anyone who may have seen anything, have further information, or have any dashcam footage, to come forward and help us with our investigation.

PC Timonthy Mcgonagle, who is investigating, has said "Although the men did not gain access to the property, we want to arrest those responsible to prevent them committing an offence like this again. We want to speak to anyone who is able to help us, particularly those in a Vauxhall Astra on Orchard Way around that time, who may have seen something."

If you are able to help us, please contact 101, quoting reference number PR/45190139989. You can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111; or through their anonymous online form: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/
