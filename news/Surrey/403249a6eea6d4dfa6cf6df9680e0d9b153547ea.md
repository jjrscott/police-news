An investigation has been launched after a man died in the early hours of Sunday morning (17 January). Police were called to reports of concern for safety near Redhill on the A25 between Nutfield and Bletchingley earlier today at around 6:30am.

On arrival, officers discovered a male on the M23. The man in his early 30s was sadly pronounced deceased shortly afterwards. His next of kin have been informed.

An investigation has been launched following this incident, at this stage we do not believe that there is any third party involvement or suspicious circumstances involved in his death.

The matter has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) due to previous contact between the man and Surrey Police.

Chief Inspector Fash Mohammadi said: "This is a tragic incident and our thoughts are with the male's family and friends at this difficult time. We'd like to extend our appreciation to the public for their patience as we dealt with the incident. We are asking anyone who may have information which could assist the investigation to get in touch with us".

This investigation remains ongoing and we cannot comment any further at this time.
