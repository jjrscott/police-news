We're appealing for witnesses after a 12-year-old boy had his electric scooter stolen in a robbery on Sunday (25 October).

The victim and his friend were playing with the scooter in the car park of Sheerwater Park just before 4pm when they were approached by two men in balaclavas.

The victims tried to ride off in the opposite direction of the men, but one of the suspects caught up with them on Blackmore Crescent. He pulled the victim off the scooter and stole it, fleeing back towards Sheerwater Park.

The suspects are described as around 16-17 years old and around 5ft and 8in tall. They were both wearing balaclavas and one of them was purple.

A 16-year-old boy and 19-year-old man were arrested nearby on suspicion of robbery and have been released under investigation.
