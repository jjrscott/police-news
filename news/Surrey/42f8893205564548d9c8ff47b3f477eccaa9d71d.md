Finding high risk missing people is all in a day's work for Police Dog (PD) Panza as he and his handler celebrated a job well done on Wednesday, September 1.

At 2.32am Dog handler, PC McBrown, was asked if he could help in the search for a high risk missing person in the grounds of a nursing home in Churt Road, Hindhead.

Concern was mounting as the person who had gone missing had severe autism and a disability meaning he couldn't walk very far without a frame. Staff from the nursing home and police officers had been out searching with no success as the home is surrounded by countryside making it hard to tell in which direction the he may have gone. They were pinning their hopes on the sharp nose of PD Panza.

PC McBrown said: "Considering the circumstances I felt there was little chance of identifying a track and I believed the only assistance I could offer was to conduct a more accurate search of the grounds. I was confident that it was safe to let Panza conduct an open land search. I sent Panza the 'find him' command and he ran directly into the bushes ahead of me. I could tell by his demeanour that he was on to something and I followed him into the woods."

There they found Panza stood over the missing person who was lying on the ground under a blanket. He was unharmed and thrilled to see the dog.
