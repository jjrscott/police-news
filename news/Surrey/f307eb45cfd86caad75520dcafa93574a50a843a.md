The man involved in the fatal collision on the A25 near Westcott on 28 October has been named as James Cunningham, 60, from Dorking.

The collision, involving a green Mercedes Sprinter van and a blue Ford Fusion, took place around 6.25am.

Mr Cunningham, who was the driver of the Fusion, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene shortly afterwards.

His next of kin have been informed and are receiving support from specially trained officers.

Mr Cunningham had strong links to the Coventry area.
