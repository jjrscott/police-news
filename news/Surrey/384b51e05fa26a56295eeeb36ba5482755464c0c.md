Officers investigating the death of 54 year old Phillip Bagwell in Leatherhead earlier this week have charged a man with his murder.

Daniel George Hopper (known locally as Daniel Styles), 32, of Clare Crescent in Leatherhead was charged in the early hours of this morning and will appear at Guildford magistrates court today (13 June).

A second man, also arrested in connection with the incident, was released yesterday without charge.

Officers remain in the local area to provide reassurance to the community.

Senior Investigating Officer Detective Chief Inspector Chris Friday said: "I am grateful to the local community for their cooperation and patience whilst we carry out this investigation.

"I also ask that you respect the privacy of Phillip Bagwell's family at this difficult time for them."
