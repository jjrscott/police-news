We are appealing for witnesses following a burglary in Ashford last Friday evening (17 January).

The burglary occurred at around 6.45pm at a property on Feltham Hill Road, when two men forced entry by smashing a rear patio door.

One of the men put his hand over the occupant's mouth and forced her to lie down on the floor.

The pair then fled empty handed when a neighbour came to the aid of the occupant.

The first man is described as white, approximately 5 ft 7 tall, and of proportionate build. He was wearing a hooded jumper with the hood up over his head, a black scarf over the bottom half of his face, and gloves which smelt of smoke.

The second man is described as white, approximately 5 ft 11 tall, of average build. He was wearing dark coloured clothing and a scarf covering his face.

Detective Constable Philip Haffenden, who is investigating the case, said: "We are appealing to anyone who might have information which could help us. If you were in the area and you saw something suspicious, please report it to us immediately.

"In addition, if you have any CCTV from the area, or if you were driving along this road at the time and have any dashcam footage, please contact us by calling 101, quoting crime reference PR/45200006864."

Alternatively, if you do not wish to leave your name, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
