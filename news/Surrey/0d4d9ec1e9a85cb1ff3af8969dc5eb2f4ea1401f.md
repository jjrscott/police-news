Do you recognise this man?

We have released images of a man we'd like to speak to in connection with a parcel theft in East Molesey on 11 March.

Police were called to an address at 3.10pm, following reports of a parcel which had been left on the victim's doorstep being taken.

He is described as a white male believed to be in his 40s and roughly 6ft in height, dressed in a high visibility jacket.

It is believed that parcel thieves may be masquerading as delivery couriers in a bid to cover up their crimes.

If you're expecting a home delivery, remember to keep an eye out for your parcel.

Have you got any information which might help us identify this man? Please call 101 and quote reference PR/45200028679.
