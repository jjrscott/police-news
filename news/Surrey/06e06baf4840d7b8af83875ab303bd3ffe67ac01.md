We're appealing for witnesses after a delivery driver was assaulted and had his van stolen yesterday evening.

The victim had left his vehicle in Clare Road in Stanwell to deliver a parcel at around 5.30pm when the suspect entered the vehicle and attempted to drive off. In doing so, he collided with the victim causing serious injuries.

The suspect then drove the stolen vehicle erratically, colliding with two cars, before decamping and leaving the vehicle on Frobisher Crescent. Members of the public managed to detain the suspect until officers arrived at the scene.

A 45-year-old man from Stanwell was arrested on suspicion of robbery, causing serious injury by dangerous driving, driving without a license or insurance, aggravated vehicle taking and possession of methadone.

Neighbourhood Inspector Maxine Cilia said: "We'd like to thank the members of the public who, thanks to their quick thinking, detained the suspect which meant he was swiftly apprehended by us. We always encourage the public not to put themselves in danger and only to intervene when it is absolutely safe for them to do so. Although we have arrested a man in connection with this incident, we need witnesses to come forward and let us know if they saw anything or have any dashcam footage of the stolen vehicle. If you do, please contact us as soon as you can."
