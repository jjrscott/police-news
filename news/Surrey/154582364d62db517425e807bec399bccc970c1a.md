Three people have been arrested in connection with a serious assault which took place in Nobles Way in Egham yesterday afternoon (9 February).

Officers were called by St Peter's Hospital around 3pm after a man in his 20s arrived at hospital with serious injuries.

He remains in a critical but stable condition.

The three people arrested in connection with the incident are:

 * A 22-year-old man from Hayes arrested on suspicion of attempt murder;
 * A 20-year-old man from Englefield Green on suspicion of affray;
 * A 19-year-old man from Didcot on suspicion of attempted GBH.

All three suspects remain in custody at this time.

Acting Detective Chief Inspector Andy Greaves said: "We would like to reassure the local community that we are carrying out a thorough investigation into this incident and there remains a strong police presence in the area while we try to establish exactly what has happened. Our initial enquiries have led us to believe that this assault was an isolated incident and that there is no risk to the wider public.

"Although we have made a number of arrests, we are still appealing for witnesses who could assist our enquiries. Anyone who has any information and has not yet spoken to the police, is asked to call us on 101 (999 in an emergency), quoting reference PR/P21028088."
