We are appealing for witnesses after four masked men attacked a 16-year-old boy in West Molesey on 1 July.

The victim was in the Grovelands Recreation Ground car park off Walton Road with two friends at around 9pm when a black saloon car pulled up next to them.

Four masked men got out of the car and approached the boys and began asking them questions.

Shortly after, they attacked the victim, punching and kicking him as well as hitting him in the head with a hammer, before driving off.

The victim sustained serious injuries and required hospital treatment.

Detective Constable Sarah Shaw who is investigating the incident, said: "This was a senseless, violent and sustained attack on a teenage boy which has left him with serious injuries. I urge anyone with information about who was involved in this attack to contact police today so we can identify those responsible."

Anyone who saw anything, including a black vehicle acting suspiciously in the area, or has any dashcam or CCTV footage of the area, please call us on 101 straightaway and quote ref PR/45200069001. Alternatively, if you prefer to remain anonymous, you can call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
