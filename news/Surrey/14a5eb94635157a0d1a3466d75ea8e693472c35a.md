Thank you for sharing our appeal earlier today relating to our search for a man who was reported to have entered the River Thames in Sunbury-on-Thames shortly before 7pm last night (Tuesday 16 June).

We are now cancelling this appeal and ask that you don't share it any further.

The body of a man has been recovered from the River Thames at Sunbury and while formal identification procedures have not yet been completed the family of the missing 30 year-old man has been informed.

We are providing support to them at this time and ask that you respect their privacy

As always thank you for sharing our appeals and getting the word out to others in the local community..
