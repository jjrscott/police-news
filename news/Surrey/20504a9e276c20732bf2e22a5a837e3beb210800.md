We're trying to trace two men who helped a woman and a 14-year-old boy following a public order incident in the Old Dean area of Camberley.

They were involved in a verbal dispute with the driver of a black Mercedes at around 7.40am on Tuesday 21 January at the Kingston Road junction with Bracknell Road.

A 38-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of witness intimidation as part of our enquiries and has been released on conditional bail.

We'd like to speak to the two men as they may have seen what happened.

Anyone who knows who the men are, or who has information that could assist our enquiries is asked to call Surrey Police on 101 (999 in an emergency) quoting PR/ 45200008172.

You can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111; or through their anonymous online form: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/
