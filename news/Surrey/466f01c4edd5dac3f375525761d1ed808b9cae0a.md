A body, believed to be that of missing man Mark Maclay, was found in the river in Moor Park Lane, Farnham, around 10.45am today (12 May).

Although formal identification is yet to take place, Mr Maclay's family are aware and are being given the appropriate support. Our thoughts remain with them at this difficult time.

Mr Maclay, 62, was last seen around 9pm near the Lidl supermarket in Dogflud Way, Farnham, on 27 January.

Enquiries remain ongoing to establish the circumstances of the death, although it is not believed to be suspicious or that there is any third party involvement at this time.

We would like to thank everyone who shared our appeal and assisted with the search.
