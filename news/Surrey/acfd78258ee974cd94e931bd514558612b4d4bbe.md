A man is behind bars for three years after getting caught dealing class A drugs in Camberley.

Artinet Tusha, 21, of Ash Road, Aldershot, has been sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty to the charge of possession with intent to supply drugs of class A, at Guildford Crown Court on Thursday, 25 February.

Tusha was arrested on 16 September last year, after officers spotted him acting suspiciously in a car on London Road, Camberley. Officers then executed a search warrant under the Misuse of Drugs Act and found multiple bags of white powder in his underpants, and also stashed in the vehicle. Over Â£500 in cash, multiple mobile phones and a notebook used to record the deals, were also recovered.

Investigating Officer PC David Oliver, said: "The impact of drugs in our communities can be devastating and result in other associated criminal behaviour, including violence, burglaries and anti-social behaviour.

"This is a great result and hopefully this sentence will help deter other criminals from committing these offences. Class A drugs have a devastating impact on people and communities and they have no place in Surrey."

Anyone with concerns about drug related crime in their area is urged to call us on 101 or 999 in an emergency.

Alternatively, suspicions can be raised anonymously through independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

\- Lots of visitors bringing items such as T.V's or bikes but leaving empty handed

\- Lone/vulnerable neighbours suddenly having groups of young men living at their address.
