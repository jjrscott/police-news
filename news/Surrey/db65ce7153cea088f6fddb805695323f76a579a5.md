Updated News Post

Officers have today located the vehicle that we were seeking after a pedestrian died on the A22 at Whyteleafe on Thursday night (9 January) and a 25 year-old man was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving, failing to stop at the scene of a collision and failing to report a collision.

He has since been released under investigation and we continue to seek witnesses to help us complete our investigation.

We were called at 10:11pm on the 9 January to the A22 Godstone Road at the junction with Hillside Road where a pedestrian was found seriously injured. Sadly the pedestrian, a 30 year-old man from Warlingham, was pronounced dead at the scene. His family has been informed.

We continue to investigate the circumstances of how the man was injured, and ask that anyone with information or dashcam footage that could assist our enquiries is asked to call Surrey Police on 101 (999 in an emergency) quoting PR/ 45200003550.

You can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111; or through their anonymous online form: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/
