We are looking to speak to him in connection with a robbery, which occurred in Esher last week.

Officers were called to Weston Green Road in Esher shortly after 5PM on Thursday, 4 June following reports of a robbery. The victim was approached in her car by a man who assaulted her before demanding her jewellery.

This E-Fit image has been created to match the description of the suspect. He is described as a white man between 31-35 years of age.

Investigating Officer Stuart McNaughton said "If you recognise the man in this E-fit image, we urge you to get in touch with us.

The victim suffered minor injuries and left extremely shaken so we want to find whoever was responsible."

If you recognise this man or have any further information which could help us with this investigation, please contact 101, quoting reference number PR/45200057732. Alternatively, if you prefer to remain anonymous, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
