Two people in CCTV images released in connection with an incident in Staines have been identified.

Officers released the pictures in connection with a stabbing in High Street that took place on December 22.

Officers were called to an address in Stanwell at approximately 1.20am, following a report a man had received an injury consistent with a stab wound to the stomach.

It is believed the incident may have taken place between 00.50am and 1.15am outside Turtle Bay on High Street, Staines.

The victim, a man in his 20s, is still in hospital with serious and potentially life-changing injuries.

A 16 year-old has been arrested on suspicion of GBH and released under investigation.

A 15 year-old boy has been charged with attempted murder and appeared at Staines Magistrates Court today (January 1). He has been remanded in custody.

The 20-year-old man originally arrested remains under investigation.
