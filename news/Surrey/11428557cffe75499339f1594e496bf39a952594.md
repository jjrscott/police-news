We are releasing images of two men we would like to speak to following a burglary in Epsom.

At around 6:30pm on Monday 23 December two handbags were stolen from the kitchen of a house on Bannow Close.

A bank card from one of the handbags was later used at Costcutter, Vale Road, Epsom shortly before 6:45pm.

We would like to speak to two men who were seen in the store who may be able to help our investigation. Images of the men are attached to this appeal.

The first man is described as:

 * White.
 * Aged in his twenties.
 * Around 5ft 8ins tall.
 * Medium build.
 * He has short blond shaved hair with a beard.
 * He was wearing a black baseball cap with VLTN written on it (he had taken this off in the third image), a grey hooded jumper, and blue jeans.

The second man is described as:

 * White.
 * Aged in his twenties.
 * Around 6ft tall.
 * Medium build.
 * He was wearing a dark grey hooded jumper with the hood pulled up.

Anyone with information is asked to call Surrey Police on 101 (999 in an emergency) quoting PR/ 45190137734.
