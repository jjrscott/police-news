A 46 year old man from Basingstoke has been issued with the first Stalking Protection Order (SPO) in the county following a number of domestic stalking and harassment allegations.

The man was issued with the SPO on Monday, 27 January at Guildford Magistrates Court. The order prevents him from contacting the victim and members of their family. If he breaches this order he risks being arrested and facing up to five years imprisonment.

Stalking Protection Orders are a powerful new tool, giving police Forces the power to further protect victims of stalking and harassment. They were introduced on Monday, 20 January and aim to improve the safety of victims and those affected by stalking.

The number of reported stalking cases in Surrey is increasing and Surrey Police is ensuring that our officers are equipped with the expertise and training required to enforce these SPOs and help protect victims across the county. Stalking is a crime which can often go undetected due to victims being unaware of the signs. Stalking is described as a pattern of fixated, obsessive, unwanted and repeated behaviour.

If you are the victim of stalking, we encourage you to report to us by calling 101 and always calling 999 in an emergency. Surrey Police work with a number of partner agencies, who are available to provide support to victims and their families. These include:

 * The Suzy Lamplugh Trust
 * National Stalking Helpline
 * Paladin National Stalking Advocacy Service
