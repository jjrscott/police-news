We are appealing for help to identify two men involved in connection with a distraction theft in Dorking.

The incident took place in the EE phone store on Tuesday, February 4. Two men entered the store and, while one distracted a member of staff, a personal phone was stolen from a desk. The phone charging cables for the phones on display were disconnected and the top of the range phone had been twisted out of position.

The two male suspects are described as white, in their early 20's and unshaven. One was quite distinctive in that he was very tall and the other shorter male had blond hair.

If you have any information call Surrey Police on 101 and quote PR/45200014123.
