A 17-year-old girl who was involved in a collision in Caterham earlier this month has sadly died.

Leanne Taylor was a passenger in a blue BMW when it overturned in the Tupwood Scrubbs Road area just before 11.25pm on Saturday, 1 February.

She suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospital. Unfortunately, she passed away five days later (6 February), as a result of the injuries she sustained.

Paying tribute to Leanne this week, her family said:

"Our beautiful fun-loving Leanne, so caring with a heart of gold. Fly high with the angels, we will meet again baby girl."
