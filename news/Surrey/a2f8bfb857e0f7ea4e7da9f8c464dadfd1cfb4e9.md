A 47-year- old man has been found guilty of the murder of his mother in Woking at a trial which ended at the Central Criminal Court in London today (5 October).

Philip Christian Tarver, of Julian Close, Woking, was found guilty of the murder of Angela Tarver following a four week trial.

The body of Angela, who was 86, was found at their home in Woking after officers were called following a concern for safety on Thursday, 19 December 2019.

Her son was arrested at the scene and detained under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act. He was later charged with Angela's murder and threats to kill. He will be sentenced on Thursday, 8 October.

Detective Inspector Chris Rambour from the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team, who investigated the incident, said: "Our thoughts remain with Angela's friends and family at this time who have been left devastated by her death. I hope that the verdict reached today will bring them some form of closure and allow them to begin to move on with their lives."

Detective Inspector Rambour added: "I would like to thank all those who gave evidence, as well as the investigating team, whose contribution ensured that Philip Tarver has been brought to justice for Angela's death."
