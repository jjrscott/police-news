A man is due to appear at Staines Magistrates' Court on 24 February after being charged with two counts of causing/inciting prostitution for gain and one count of controlling prostitution for gain.

Christopher Cox, 52, of Guildford Road, Cranleigh, was served with a postal requisition in relation to all three offences, which are alleged to have taken place in 2019 and relate to three female victims.

The charges arose out of an investigation by ITV researchers into so-called "sex-for-rent" allegations, which Surrey Police was made aware of in March 2019.

These are believed to be the first charges brought for this type of allegation in England and Wales.
