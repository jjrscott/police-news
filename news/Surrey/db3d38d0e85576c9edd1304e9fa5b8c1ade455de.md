Thanks for sharing our appeal on Tuesday 14 January which included images of two men who we wanted to speak to after a 19 year-old woman was raped in Guildford.

The woman was assaulted after becoming separated from her friends during a night out on Friday 11 October 2019.

We are now recalling this appeal as an arrest has been made as part of our investigation. Please do not share the appeal or images any further.

A 26 year-old man from London has been arrested on suspicion of rape as part of our enquiries. He remains in custody at this time.
