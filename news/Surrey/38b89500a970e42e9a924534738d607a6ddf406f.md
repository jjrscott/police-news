Following the earlier appeal to find missing Victor Fakeye we are pleased to report he's been found.

The appeal had only been live on Facebook for a short period of time before a member of the public travelling on a bus in the Hammersmith area spotted Victor. We've had to wait to verify that it was definitely Victor, so thank you all for your patience.

Victor is now home safe and well. Thank you all for sharing the appeal and please can we ask that you delete any shares of the post on social media.
