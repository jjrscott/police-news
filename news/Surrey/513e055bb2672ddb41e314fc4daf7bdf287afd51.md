We have released CCTV of two men we would like to speak to in connection with an attempt robbery at Sainsbury's in Walton-on-Thames in October.

Two men went to the store on 23 October around 5.10pm and attempted to steal a purse from a handbag belonging to an elderly woman. She suffered an injury to her arm as a result.

The first man is described as in his 20s, tall, of a thin build, dark-skinned and clean shaven with dark eyes. The second man is described as around 40 years, of an Asian appearance and stocky.

If you can help us identify either of these men, or you have any other information, please call us on 101 quoting reference PR/45190112779. Alternatively, if you do not wish to leave your name, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please remain vigilant when out shopping. Keep your bags zipped shut; don't leave them unattended on a trolley or table; and think about attaching bells or something else that makes a noise so that you can hear when someone is interfering with them.
