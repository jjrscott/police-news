We are appealing for witnesses after a number of residential garages were broken into in Chertsey on Monday (15 February).

Officers were called to Hazelbank Close, Chertsey, at around 9.15pm, after a resident noticed that their garage had been broken into.

On arrival, officers noticed that a number of other garages had also been broken into, although it appears at this stage nothing has been taken.

Two suspects were seen by a witness fleeing the scene, one on a bicycle. They are described as two men, of slim build and wearing dark hooded tops.

We are now looking for further witnesses to assist with our investigation.

Investigating Officer PC Anthony Cabot, said: "Burglary is a concern for most of us and it will absolutely not be tolerated in Surrey. We are appealing to anyone who may have been in the area or seen anything suspicious, to get in touch with us. We would also like to speak to anyone who was driving in the vicinity of Hazelbank Close at around 9.15pm on 15 February who may have dashcam footage."
