We were called to reports of a person in the River Thames in Chertsey just before 8pm this evening (3 February).

Officers, along with Surrey Search and Rescue, National Police Air Service, the fire service and South East Coast Ambulance Service, conducted searches along the river towards Shepperton and in the surrounding areas.

Searches have been called off for the night and will recommence in the morning, which may result in road closures.

We'd like to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time who might have noticed someone behaving suspiciously or may have CCTV covering the area.

We would particularly like to speak to anyone who saw a man with dark hair, dressed in a khaki jacket with a black snood, baggy jeans and Timberland style boots near Chertsey Bridge earlier in the evening.
