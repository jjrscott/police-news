We are warning people to be vigilant after we have received a number of potential fraud reports in recent weeks.

Surrey Police has been made aware that cold callers from alleged security companies are targeting vulnerable people across the county. The callers claim the company is working alongside Surrey Police.

The victims are being asked questions about the level of security in their homes, including whether they have CCTV or alarms.

Surrey Police are not working in partnership with any security companies and advise anyone who is targeted to make a note of any calls received, and report by calling 101 or online at https://www.surrey.police.uk/ro/report/fo/fraud/?fbclid=IwAR3hyYO7KDVO9lD2nOYbEzE7lMYOn970YPvhRjEC9yG9ywnbFFYxi9xCIJU
