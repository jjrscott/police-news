We are appealing for witnesses following a knifepoint robbery in Woking last night (23 August).

Officers were called to Benner Lane in Woking shortly before 10PM following reports of a group of teenagers being robbed.

The victims were at West End Recreation Ground when they were approached by two men, who revealed a bladed item and demanded their possessions. The suspects stole items including headphones and a bike. The suspects were described as:

 * A black boy, around 16 years old and of a medium build
 * A white boy, around 16 years old with black hair and of a slim build.

Shortly after the robbery, officers stopped two boys on the A30 who matched the descriptions of the suspects. A 16 year old boy from Woking and a 16 year old boy from Camberley remain in custody.

Investigating Officer Richard Ashton said "We are appealing to anyone who may have seen the suspects yesterday before or after the robbery. If you were driving along the A30 around 10PM yesterday and may have any dashcam footage or further information then please get in touch."
