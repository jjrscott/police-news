Surrey Police is appealing for information that will help us find a vulnerable 17 year old missing from Staines-upon-Thames and who may be in the Tottenham, Woolwich, or Greenwich areas.

Osei Bonsu was last seen by his mother on January 2 after leaving home in Staines-upon-Thames, he also has links to the Tottenham, Woolwich and Greenwich areas. Officers are particularly concerned for Osei's welfare as he may be at risk of being exploited into criminal activity.

Osei is described as black, of medium build with short bushy black hair and around 6ft tall. He was last seen wearing a black tracksuit, black Nike trainers and a black and white baseball cap.

Officers are keen to speak to anyone who has seen Osei, or knows where he is; or knows anyone who may have had contact with him.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Surrey Police urgently on 999, reference PR/45200000807. If you do not wish to leave your name, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
