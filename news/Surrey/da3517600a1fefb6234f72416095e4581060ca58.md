We are appealing for witnesses after a woman and her husband were racially abused in Auriol Park in Epsom.

The couple were walking in the park at around 8.45pm on 9 June when they passed the suspect and another man who were sitting on a bench.

The suspect started shouting at the victims using racially abusive language. The couple tried to walk away but the suspect continued to harass them, threatening to punch the man and shouting at the woman.

The suspect stayed in the park but his friend cycled away on a push bike shortly after the incident. The suspect is described as a white man, in his early 20s , 5ft 9 tall, with short brown hair and was wearing a black tracksuit.

If you witnessed this incident or have any information which may help, including dashcam or CCTV footage, please call 101 and quote ref PR/45200059552. If you wish to remain anonymous, you can also call independent charity CrimeStoppers on 0800 555 111.

Hate crime will not be tolerated in Surrey. Surrey's profile of hate crime is constantly developing and we rely on those affected coming forward and making reports.

Victims having the confidence in both themselves and us to make reports is incredibly important if we are to know the true extent of hate crime in our county.

If you have been a victim of hate crime yourself, please make a report, either by calling 101 (999 in an emergency), call the Stop Hate UK helpline on 0800 138 1625 or download the Surrey Stop Hate UK app on the Apple and Google app stores.

Please don't suffer in silence.
