Were you in the Tupwood Scrubbs Road area of Caterham at just before 11:25pm last night (Saturday 1 February)?

We're currently investigating a serious injury collision involving an overturned blue BMW. A 17 year-old girl was treated for serious injuries and taken to hospital. Her condition is described as critical.

We have spoken to the drivers of the BMW and a silver Hyundai Coupe that was also in the area, but we're keen to hear from anyone who may be able to help us to establish what happened.

We are particularly interested in hearing from anyone who may have dashcam footage, or who witnessed the incident, to assist our enquiries.

Anyone with information should call 101 quoting 45200013011.

Alternatively, if you do not wish to leave your name, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
