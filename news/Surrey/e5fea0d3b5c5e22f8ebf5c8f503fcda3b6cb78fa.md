The family of a man who was murdered in Weybridge on 8 January have described him as "an absolute gentleman who loved his kids very much".

Glen Hopgood, 52, died at an address in Old Palace Road around 1.40am.

Paying tribute to his father this week, his son Glenny said:

"Dad was one of the funniest people you would meet. He loved his jokes and his one liners. He wore his heart on his sleeve and was always laughing with a smile on his face. He loved his family and his dog Archie was his best mate. He was also a huge Chelsea FC fan - football was really important to him.

"Dad really enjoyed his films and music. He always took the time to speak to people and always said hello to everyone. He was very generous would share his last pound. He was a true one of a kind."

The family are raising money to help pay for Glen's funeral. To donate, please go to https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/kerry-jury-1?utm_term=w8D2kVR7w
