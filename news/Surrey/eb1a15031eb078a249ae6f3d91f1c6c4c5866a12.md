We're appealing for witnesses after a man was assaulted outside the Aldi store in Gogmore Lane, Chertsey, on Saturday, 13 February.

The victim was walking to his car when he was approached by the suspect at around 1.55pm.

After a verbal altercation the suspect assaulted him. Fortunately members of the public intervened and the suspect fled the scene. The victim was left shaken but did not sustain any serious injuries.

The suspect is described as male, white, around 55 years, around 5ft 8 tall, with a large build and a pale complexion. He is also described as having medium length grey hair, and was wearing a grey coat, with a gold chain around his neck. He was seen driving a small dark grey hatchback car.
