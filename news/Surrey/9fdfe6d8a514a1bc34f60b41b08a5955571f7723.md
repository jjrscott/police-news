Six men are in custody after being arrested following a drugs warrant at a residential property in Avern Road, West Molesey last night (Monday, 18 May).

A large number of officers attended the address around 9pm, along with support from the police helicopter, dog units and armed response officers to carry out the warrant under Section 23 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.

Upon arrival, drug paraphernalia and evidence of drug supply was found. Six men between the ages of 16 and 43 years were arrested on suspicion of being concerned with the supply of class A drugs.

They are all still in custody and enquiries remain ongoing.

Elmbridge Borough Commander Inspector Bert Dean said: "This is a fantastic result and an impressive collaborative effort by a number of different teams.

"We hope that this reassures local residents in Elmbridge that we are doing everything possible to tackle drug-related crime.

"With crimes like these, we rely heavily on information we receive from the public to help us build a bigger picture of the problem, so would urge local residents to contact us if they suspect that drugs offences are taking place."

**What are the signs of potential drug dealing?**

 * Lots of visitors, who don't stay very long, arriving at all times of the day and night
 * People waiting in cars outside particular properties exchanging small packets or cash
 * Lots of visitors bringing items such as T.V's or bikes but leaving empty handed
 * Lone/vulnerable neighbours suddenly having groups of young men living at their address.

**What we want to know**

 * Time, date and place
 * Vehicle registrations and the make, model and colour
 * Descriptions of people and details of what they were doing
 * Direction they travelling to and from
 * How many times you have seen them - is it always at the same time of day?

Don't put yourself at risk while gathering this information. Please always pass the information to the police and do not confront or approach suspected drug dealers.
