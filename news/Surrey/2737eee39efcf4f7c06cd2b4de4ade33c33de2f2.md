A 16-year-old boy has been detained under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act after he was arrested yesterday (12 November) on suspicion of harassment following an incident at a Camberley school.

Officers promptly attended Ravenscote Junior School at 11.41am following reports that the teenager had gained access to private grounds outside of the school site. The suspect was arrested at the scene and at no point did he make contact with the pupils and they were not at risk at any point.

The same teenager was previously released under investigation after his arrest last week following reports of a boy offering his vape to pupils at another school in Camberley.

Investigating Officer PC Dan Lomas said: "This type of behaviour will no doubt be a cause of concern for all the school children, parents and teachers involved.

"The individual has been detained under Section 2 of the mental health act and we would like to reassure the public that he will be closely monitored and supervised by both the police and our partner agencies.

"We want to reassure everyone that incidents such as this are extremely rare but we are grateful to the school for their prompt action that allowed us to act swiftly in order to identify and detain this individual."
