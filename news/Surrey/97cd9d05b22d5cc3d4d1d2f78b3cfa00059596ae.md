We are appealing for witnesses after a minor collision in a Farnham Sainsbury's car park led to a person needing hospital treatment.

We are appealing for witnesses after a minor collision in a Farnham Sainsbury's car park led to a person needing hospital treatment.

The incident took place on February 7 at 9.40am in Sainsbury's South Street, Farnham car park when there was a slight collision between a small red car and a van. The driver of the van and the passenger of the car had a verbal altercation. At this point another man came over, grabbed the passenger of the car, threw him against the wall and hit him in the face. During the attack the victim's girlfriend was also punched in the stomach. The male suspect was dragged off the victim and then walked away towards Sainsbury's.

The victim was left requiring hospital treatment as two of his teeth were knocked out.

PC Nicola Ansell said: "This was a vicious, unprovoked attack that left the victim requiring urgent hospital treatment and ongoing hospital treatment. We are appealing to anyone who saw what happened, or anyone with any information or dashcam footage, to call us straightaway."

The suspect is described as a white male, aged between 25 - 35 years, about 6' - 6'3" tall, of stocky build with cropped blond or light brown hair. He was wearing a hi-viz with 'Carpentry Co' written on it, with a pink/red hoody underneath. He left the scene in a silver VW Transporter panel van.

If you have any information, please call Surrey Police on 101 quoting reference number PR/45200015289. Alternatively, if you prefer not to leave your name, please call independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
