We have released CCTV images of a man we would like to speak to in connection with an assault which took place at a Sainsbury's supermarket on Friday (11 October).

We were called at approximately 5pm to reports of a suspected theft at Sainsbury's Local. It is reported that there was an altercation between a colleague, a customer in the store who tried to confront a man suspected of shoplifting, and the suspect.

It is understood that the confrontation between the customer trying to confront the suspect, and the suspect got physical, with the suspect allegedly punching the customer.

The man we would like to speak to and identify is described as white, of slim build, 6ft. inches tall, with dark hair. He was wearing a dark coloured jacket, black bottoms, and carrying an Asda shopping bag and a rucksack on his back.

If you can help, please contact us on 101, quoting incident reference PR/45190107855.

You can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111; or through their anonymous online form: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/
