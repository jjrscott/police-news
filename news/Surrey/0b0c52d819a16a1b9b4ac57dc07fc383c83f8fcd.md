We're appealing for help to find the owners of some jewellery that was found following a burglary in Chertsey at the weekend.

The jewellery includes earrings, rings, broaches, a watch and bracelets and may belong to someone in the Shepperton or Chertsey areas.

The burglary in Chertsey took place overnight from December 13-14 and also involved a car being taken. The jewellery mentioned does not relate to that property.

Anyone with any information should contact Surrey Police on 101 and quote the reference number PR/45190134141.

Two boys, aged 13 and 14, have been arrested on suspicion of burglary and theft of a motor vehicle and have been released on conditional bail.
