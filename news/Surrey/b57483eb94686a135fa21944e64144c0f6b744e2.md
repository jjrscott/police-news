A teenager was left with a broken jaw after he was assaulted following a private 18th birthday party in Guildford on Saturday night (22 February).

The victim had left the party, which took place at a residential address in Onslow Village, around 11pm when he was struck with a bottle. He walked away and fell to the ground, hitting his jaw on the kerb.

He suffered cuts and bruises as well as a fracture to his jaw and was taken to hospital for surgery.

It is believed that a large-scale disturbance had broken out prior to the assault in the street near where the party was taking place.
