We are appealing for witnesses following a collision between a van and two pedestrians on Chessington Road, Ewell this afternoon.

The incident took place at 4.20pm and a 70 year old woman has been taken to hospital suffering with serious injuries.

Police Sergeant Geoff Longstaff said: "One of the pedestrians was taken to hospital after she received serious head injuries so we're appealing for anyone who saw what happened to come forward. Any information, no matter how small, could be of great significance to us."

If you saw anything or have any dashcam footage of the incident, please call Surrey Police on 101 quoting PR/P20093179.
