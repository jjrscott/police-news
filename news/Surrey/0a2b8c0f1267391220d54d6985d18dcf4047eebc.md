We are appealing for witnesses after a 24 year old man was killed when his motorbike collided with a gate in Cobham this morning.

We were called to Pointers Road, Cobham, at 11:30 this morning, shortly after the collision happened. Despite the best efforts of the ambulance and air ambulance crews, the man riding the motorbike sadly died at the scene. His next of kin and the coroner have been informed.

The motorcycle, a yellow and white motocross bike, is believed to have been with a small group of motorbikes prior to the collision. The group are helping police with our enquiries.

Police are appealing to anyone who saw or heard the collision, or saw the motorcycle being ridden before the collision. We believe that the road is frequently used by walkers, cyclists and horse riders who may have seen something this morning that could be important to the investigation.

Anyone with any information that they believe could assist the investigation into the man's death is asked to call Surrey Police on 101, quoting reference PR/P20137361.
