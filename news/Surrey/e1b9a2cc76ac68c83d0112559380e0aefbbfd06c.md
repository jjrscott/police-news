Two people are behind bars after being found guilty of a burglary and two attempt burglaries in Farnham earlier this year.

Liam Cooper, 43, of Manor Farm Road, Southampton, and Jessica Rowsell, 40, of no fixed address were found guilty on all three counts last Wednesday (6 November), following a seven-day trial at Guildford Crown Court.

Cooper was sentenced to five and a half years in prison, while Rowsell was jailed for 26 months.

Police were called around 10.55am on 8 May reporting that a property in Waverley Lane, Farnham, had been broken into. The occupants had also discovered that a rear kitchen window had been smashed and that computer and photographic equipment, as well as cash, had been stolen.

Shortly before this call, police received another call from a resident in Waverley Lane, reporting a man and a woman behaving suspiciously in the area.

Police attended the address and stopped the pair nearby shortly afterwards. They were arrested on suspicion of burglary after stolen property from the first address was found in bags they were carrying.

The pair were also charged with a second attempt burglary.

Waverley Neighbourhood Specialist Officer PC Will Davies said: "The investigating officer worked tirelessly to piece together clues in order to build up enough evidence to pursue a prosecution against the pair.

"I hope the sentences given to Cooper and Rowsell have provided some form of closure for their victims and has reassured the local community that we do take these offences seriously and will do everything we can to ensure that those committing burglary are identified and brought to justice.

"I also hope that the sentences given to them will act as a deterrent to anyone else who is thinking they can come into Surrey and commit burglary, and sends a strong message that we will pursue them and they will be dealt with robustly."

Follow our guidance below to help protect your home and belongings from burglars:

 * Lock all doors and windows every time you leave the house, even when you're just out in the garden, remembering to double-lock UPVC doors
 * Hide all keys, including car keys, out of sight and away from the letterbox (remember a device could be used to hook and remove keys through the letterbox) if possible keep them in a metal container
 * Remove valuables from view of ground floor windows
 * Store any high value items (i.e. jewellery, passports) in a correctly installed safe
 * Install an intruder alarm - If it is to be monitored, ensure it is NSI or SIA registered
 * Install dusk to dawn outside lighting around your property
 * Get a trusted neighbour to keep an eye on your property if you are out for long periods or away on holiday
 * Leave lights and a radio/TV on in your house or on a timer to make the property appear occupied
 * Make sure the fences around your garden are in good condition and ensure side gates are locked to prevent access to the rear of the property
 * Secure bikes at home by locking them to an immoveable object inside a locked shed or garage
 * Keep ladders and tools stored away; don't leave them outside where they could be used to break into your home
 * Make it hard for thieves to hide by keeping foliage and bushes trimmed and neat around the edges of your property
 * Mark your property with a forensic marking product such as SelectaDNA and register your property with Immobilise
 * Consider joining or forming a Neighbourhood Watch scheme
