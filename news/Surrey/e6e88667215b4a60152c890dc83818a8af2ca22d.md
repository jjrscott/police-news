We are appealing for witnesses following the assault and robbery of two 15 year old boys in Watchetts Recreation Ground, near Camberley Rugby Club, Camberley on Wednesday (August 26).

The incident occurred at around 5:15pm as the victims were walking past the toilets. Two older teenagers demanded the bag that one of the victims was carrying. One of the suspects then punched one of the victims in the face. We believe that the suspects were on foot - though they may have had bicycles nearby.

The first suspect is described as a white male of skinny but muscular build, around 6 foot tall, about 18 years old, with a stubbly beard and wearing a grey jumper with purple jogging bottoms.

The second suspect is described as a mixed race male of muscular build, around 5 foot 11 inches tall, about 18 years old with a goatee beard and was wearing a full grey tracksuit, possibly with a blue tracksuit underneath it.

Surrey Heath Borough Commander, Detective Inspector Alick James, said: "The Surrey Heath Safer Neighbourhood Team and Neighbourhood Policing Team worked together swiftly to identify and arrest the suspects for this robbery. Robbery in Surrey Heath is rare, but it has a significant impact on the victims, their families and the community. The suspects remain in custody and Surrey Police will work tirelessly to ensure they are held to account for their actions and to keep Surrey Heath safe."

Police are appealing for witnesses and if you have any information or dashcam footage of the incident please contact us via LiveChat or by calling 101 quoting incident reference PR/45200090556.

You can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111; or through their anonymous online form: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/

Following our initial enquiries three males are in custody arrested on suspicion of robbery.
