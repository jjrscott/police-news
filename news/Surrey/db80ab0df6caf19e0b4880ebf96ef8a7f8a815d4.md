We are appealing for witnesses following an attempted robbery in Mytchett.

The victim was walking along Coleford Bridge Road towards Blackwater Valley Path at around 1pm on 2 June when he was approached by the suspects.

The victim was punched and kicked as the suspects attempted to steal his bag. The victim managed to fight them off and the suspects subsequently ran away without stealing anything.

The suspects are described as two white men in their early 20s believed to be wearing dark clothing. One had a black mountain bike and the other had a blue mountain bike.

If you witnessed anything or have any CCTV footage of the area which might assist the investigation, please call 101 and quote ref PR/45200057444. Alternatively, if you prefer to remain anonymous, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
