A teenager was arrested following a robbery at a shop in Redhill on Sunday evening (15 December).

Police were called to the Co-Op in Station Road around 7pm.

The 15-year-old male from Redhill was detained nearby shortly after the robbery. A Taser was aimed at the teenager as a warning ("red-dotted") prior to his arrest.

Officers attended after staff reported that the suspect threatened them with a knife before making off with a quantity of cigarettes.

The teenager was interviewed and released on conditional bail until 4 January 2020.
