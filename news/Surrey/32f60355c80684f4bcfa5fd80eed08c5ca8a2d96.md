A police dog who has only recently qualified demonstrated her unparalleled skills after she was sent to search for a high risk missing person in Leatherhead on Friday (20 November).

The missing man had left his car abandoned on Forty Foot Road, and there were concerns for his safety.

PC Hunt and PD Zena were sent to assist with a search of the area, and Zena soon picked up on his scent. They followed it down a track a short distance from the car, where the man was found safe and well.

Zena has recently completed her training in being able to trace people, drugs and weapons and has proved how invaluable she is already.

PC Hunt said: "The officers at the scene were extremely helpful and provided us with all the information regarding the missing man as well as making sure they had secured his vehicle prior to our arrival.

"Zena picked up a track and led me a short distance from the car and directly to the man, where we found him safe and well.

"After recently qualifying, we are both new to the dog unit and can't wait to continue working and learning together as a team!"
