We are appealing for witnesses after a 20-year-old man was injured during an altercation in Guildford.

Officers were called to reports of a man with a machete on Kings Road at around 12.30am this morning (21 July).

It is believed that the suspect chased two men onto the street whilst threatening them with the weapon. One victim received an injury to his face during the altercation.

A 24-year-old man from Guildford has been arrested on suspicion of GBH and affray and remains in custody. Our enquiries remain ongoing.

Detective Constable Mike Stanley said "I would like to reassure the community that we believe this is an isolated incident and that there is no wider risk to the public. A man has received serious injuries as a result of this and it's really important that if you think you know anything about this incident that you get in contact with us. The information you have may be what we need to assist with our investigation."
