We are appealing for witnesses after a man was robbed in Farnham yesterday afternoon.

Police were called to Sandy Hill Road near Brougham Place around 12:40pm yesterday (Monday, 11 November) following reports of a robbery. The victim was getting off the bus when they were approached by two men on a motorbike. They pushed him and kicked him against a brick wall before making off with a Macbook, iPad and a large amount of cash.

We are appealing to anyone who may have seen anything, with dashcam footage or any further information, to call us on 101 quoting reference number PR/45190120976.

Alternatively, you can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111; or through their anonymous online form: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/
