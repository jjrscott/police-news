We have released CCTV of three men we would like to speak to in connection with a burglary at a residential property in Hersham on Friday (20 December).

At approximately 7pm, three men approached a property in Onslow Road, armed with tools. The suspects had their faces covered as they entered the property, by smashing the front door.

PC Rachael Jordan, of the Elmbridge Neighbourhood Policing Team said: "If you think you have any information about who the three suspects could be, please contact us.

"They arrived in a BMW, which we have now recovered, but we are keen to identify who the men are, two of which appear to be white, with dark hair.

"The property owners had really good CCTV installed, which will hopefully help us identify who entered their home.

"I would encourage the public to follow our safety advice on how you can keep your home safe and help prevent burglars entering your home and taking your belongings. For more advice, please visit our website https://www.surrey.police.uk/burglary ."

Marking your property also means that if it is taken, it is easier to recover:
• Register your property at www.immobilise.com
• Mark your property with a forensic marking product such as Selecta DNA www.selectadna.co.uk

If you recognise either of the men in the footage, or you have any other information which could assist our investigation, please contact us on 101, quoting crime reference number PR/45190136639. Alternatively, if you do not wish to leave your name, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
