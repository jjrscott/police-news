Police have launched an investigation after a fight in Camberley this afternoon left a number of women injured.

We were called at 16:30 this afternoon (Saturday October 3rd) to Obelisk Way, close to the Atrium Shopping Centre, where the fight had spilled out of a bar. Emergency services, including ambulance, police and firearms officers, responded and found a number of women with laceration injuries that are believed to have been caused by broken bottles.

A number of victims received treatment at the scene and one woman was taken to hospital with more serious injuries. Two women have been arrested on suspicion of assault; with one also taken to hospital for treatment to her injuries.

Detective Inspector Jo Smith, who is leading the investigation said:
"This would have been a frightening incident for anyone to witness, and we are keen to understand what caused these groups to clash and inflict these horrible injuries. I want to speak to everyone who was in the local area between 4:15 and 4:45 - and in particular I want to see any photos or video from mobile phones, dashcams or helmet cams that may have captured the fight or the moments leading up to it.

"It is also possible that there were other people involved who left the scene, possibly with injuries, before officers arrived. If that is you, or someone you love, please make contact with the emergency services so we can ensure that you are properly looked after."

She continued:
"Anyone who can provide information to assist us with the investigation can contact us through the "Live Chat" function on the Surrey Police website, via direct message on Twitter or Facebook, or by calling 101 quoting ref: PR/P20231325.

"If you'd prefer to provide information anonymously, please visit the Crimestoppers website https://crimestoppers-uk.org/ or call 0800 555 111

"Finally I'd like to thank the people of Camberley who rushed to assist the victims, and helped police at the scene. Officers will remain in the area while the investigation continues."
