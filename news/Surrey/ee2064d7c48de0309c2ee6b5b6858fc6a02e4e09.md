Officers had to take enforcement action as a last resort in Addlestone on Sunday, 5 April following a house party which ignored the government's social distancing guidelines to slow the spread of Covid-19.

Officers were called to Middlesex Court at around 9pm following reports of the party. Officers attended and followed the College of Policing guidance to engage, explain, and encourage those people at the address to disperse. The party had caused a significant amount of anti-social behaviour and it was established that a number of people at the property did not live there and had travelled from outside of the county to attend.

Four people who initially refused to leave were issued with fines under the powers given to police officers in the Coronavirus Act. They were also removed from the property.

In addition, Israel Young, 44 of Twickenham was charged with a public order offence, common assault and drunk and disorderly.
