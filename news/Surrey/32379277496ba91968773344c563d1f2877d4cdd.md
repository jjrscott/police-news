We are looking for a man in connection with a hate crime that took place in Epsom on Friday, 22 January and was repeated on Saturday, 23 January.

A man approached a member of staff at the Co-operative store on Station Approach in the town and used racist and offensive language towards the staff member.

The man was wearing dark blue ripped jeans, black trainers and a dark blue hooded gilet. He carried a grey backpack and his clothing was dirty as if it was work wear.

Investigating officer PC Chloe Cook says: "This really unpleasant event saw a man become the target of a hate crime on two consecutive days as he tried to go about his work. We will not stand for a member of our community being subjected to this, and would like your help to identify the perpetrator."

If you can help us to identify this man, please get in touch through the live chat function on the Surrey Police website (surrey.police.uk) or through a direct message on Facebook or Twitter which will put you in direct contact with a call handler, quoting reference number PR/ 45210007423. If you don't want to leave your name, you can call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
