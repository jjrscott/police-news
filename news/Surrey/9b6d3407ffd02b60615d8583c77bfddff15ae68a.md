A man was left unconscious following a disturbance outside a restaurant in Staines-upon-Thames in the early hours yesterday (9 February).

The victim was knocked unconscious after being pushed to the floor and suffered a broken jaw, two broken teeth and a deep cut to his chin which required stitches as a result of the incident.

An investigation is underway and officers are appealing to anyone who was near the restaurant at the time of the incident to come forward with any information which might assist their enquiries.
