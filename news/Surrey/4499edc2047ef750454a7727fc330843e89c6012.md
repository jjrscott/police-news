A man's body was recovered from the River Thames in Walton-on-Thames on Sunday (27 February).

Officers were called to reports that body had been found at Weir lock around 12.15pm. The man's body was recovered later the same day with assistance from Surrey Search and Rescue and ambulance and fire crews.

Although formal identification is yet to take place, officers believe the body is that of the man who was seen jumping into the River Thames in Chertsey on 3 February.

His next of kin has been informed and our thoughts remain with his family, who are receiving support from officers, at this difficult time.

The man's death is being treated as unexplained at this time and there are not believed to be any suspicious circumstances or third party involvement.
