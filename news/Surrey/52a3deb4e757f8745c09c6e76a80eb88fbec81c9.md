We are appealing for help to trace a missing man from Woking who has not been seen since Wednesday morning (Feb 5).

Patrick Guinard, aged 66, has not been seen since he left his home at 9am leaving officers to be concerned for his welfare as his lack of contact is out of character.

He was expected home at 5pm but didn't arrive and has not answered his phone. He was last seen wearing his cycling clothing which was possibly pale blue and grey and black trousers, and travelled on his road bike.

He is described as white, 5ft 5inches tall, of slim build, has dark hair that is starting to grey and has a French accent.

Officers are carrying out enquiries that he may have boarded a train from Woking at around 9.10am and travelled to Southampton and are asking for anyone who possibly saw him on this journey to come forward.

Anyone with information on his whereabouts should contact Surrey Police on 101 or report online via www.surrey.police.uk and quote the reference number PR/45200014608.
