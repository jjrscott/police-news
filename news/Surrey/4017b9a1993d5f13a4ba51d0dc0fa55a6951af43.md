We are appealing for witnesses following an aggravated burglary in Guildford in the early hours of Monday, 22 June.

Officers were called to a residential property in Kestrel Close in Merrow Park shortly after midnight following reports of a group of men jumping the fence and entering a house. Upon arrival, a dark coloured Audi outside the property was identified which drove off at speed.

Efforts were made to trace the vehicle which was last seen driving towards the A3 at around 1AM this morning (23 June).

The victims of the aggravated burglary were taken to hospital with injuries and are expected to make a full recovery.

Detective Constable Anne Simpson said "We are keen to speak to anyone who may have been in the area around that time and seen anything suspicious.

"During the efforts to stop the dark coloured Audi at the scene, officers smashed the rear window which could have made it distinctive for anyone who possibly saw it."

If you witnessed anything or have any further information or dashcam footage which could help this investigation please call 101, quoting reference number PR/45200064413. Alternatively, if you do not wish to leave your name, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
