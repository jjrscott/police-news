We have released a CCTV image of a man we would like to speak to after an elderly woman was robbed of her gold necklace in Epsom on Tuesday afternoon (4 August).

The woman was walking along Firswood Avenue with a friend around 1.55pm when she noticed a man sitting on the roundabout nearby. After the woman and her friend had parted ways, the man approached her and snatched the gold chain from her neck. He ran off towards Kingston Road.

Fortunately the woman was not injured during the incident.

The suspect is described as Asian, in his 20s, between 5ft 4 and 5ft 6 tall, of a slim build, and was wearing a light grey long-sleeved top.

The necklace which was stolen is described as a gold small link necklace with a square sacred heart medal and a plain gold ring.

Further enquiries have established that the woman had also lost her purse between 11.30am and 12 noon that day when she was out shopping in Epsom town centre.

Epsom and Ewell Borough Commander Inspector Jon Vale said: "Thankfully, the victim escaped uninjured on this occasion. We would like to reassure the local community that we are doing everything we can to identify the suspect and ensure he is brought to justice. We will be increasing patrols in the area to provide additional reassurance to local residents.

"If you can help us identify the man in this image, or you were in the area at the time and noticed anything suspicious, please get in touch with us straightaway."
