We have released an image of two men we would like to speak to in connection with a sexual assault in Epsom.

The incident happened at around 00.53am on Sunday morning (23 February) at Be At One in Derby Square.

A member of the public was dancing with a friend near the bar when an unknown man came up behind her and sexually assaulted her.

The man is described as black, in his 30s, around 5'9" tall, and of medium build. He has long dreadlocked hair tied back in a ponytail and a goatee beard.

He was described as wearing dark coloured trousers, a white vest with an unbuttoned light-coloured shirt over the top, and glasses.

An investigation is currently underway and we are keen to speak to the two men pictured, as they may have information which can assist with our enquiries.

If you know who these men are, or you have any other information that could help our investigation, please contact Surrey Police on 101 (999 in an emergency) quoting reference PR/45200021319.

You can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111; or through their anonymous online form:https://crimestoppers-uk.org/.
