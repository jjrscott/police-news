We're appealing for witnesses after a series of hate crime offences involving damage to a property in Caterham.

The house in Stafford Road has been targeted several times since April this year. The property is usually targeted with projectiles which on occasion have caused damage to the property, including breaking a window.

The last incident happened on 12 August at 11.35am and again at 7.40pm.

Tandridge Borough Commander Inspector Karen Hughes said: "We believe that this property is being deliberately targeted because of the occupants' sexuality and this is utterly unacceptable. It is upsetting that this type of prejudice exists in Surrey where there is no place for it. We are working hard to identify whoever is responsible for these incidents to ensure they are brought to justice and we are urging anyone with any information to get in touch with us."
