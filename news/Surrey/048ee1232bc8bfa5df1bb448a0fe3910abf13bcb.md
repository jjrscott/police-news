We are appealing for witnesses after The Bourne Mill Antiques was burgled in Farnham last night (7 March).

Police were called to reports of five males wearing balaclavas putting items into a white 15 plate BMW 1 Series at Bourne Buildings on Guildford Road just before 1am.

The suspects have broken into and raided the antique shop, stealing numerous items.

Anyone with information should call 101 and quote ref PR/45200036458.

Surrey Police is seeing business premises and retail units more at risk of being targeted for organised burglaries as criminals take advantage of lockdown measures to profit from the Covid-19 pandemic.

If you can remotely, please check that your security systems are in place and working correctly by doing an assessment of security cameras and making sure that any service doors are locked and secured. We are also urging business owners not to store large quantities of cash or high-value items in their premises whilst they are closed.
