We have made an arrest after a fraud incident in Camberley on Tuesday 26 November.

A 76 year-old man was contacted by a suspicious caller who asked him to withdraw Â£5,000 and a further sum of money from his bank account.

The caller claimed to be a police officer.

A 20 year-old man from London was subsequently arrested on Iberian Way on suspicion of an offence of fraud by false representation. He remains in custody at this time and enquiries are ongoing.

**We 'd like to take this opportunity to remind you of the following crime prevention advice. Please share this with elderly relatives and neighbours wherever possible.**

 * Your bank or the police will not ask you to withdraw money from your account

 * Your bank or the police will not ask you to hand money to a courier or anyone purporting to be a courier.

 * If you receive a call from someone purporting to be from your bank or the police and you want to be sure they are who they say they are, use a different phone if you can to call a recognised number for your bank and 101 for the police. If you don't have another phone hang up and check that you have a clear dial tone (a tactic used by offenders is to stay on the phone, so even if you hang up a landline phone the line could still be connected to the caller unless there is a dial tone).

 * Never give your PIN number to someone you do not trust (the police will never require this).

 * Never agree to handing your card to a courier.

 * Criminals will make you believe there has been an emergency or put you in some kind of fear (usually financial loss) if you recognise the danger signs you are better prepared to defending yourself from these criminals.
