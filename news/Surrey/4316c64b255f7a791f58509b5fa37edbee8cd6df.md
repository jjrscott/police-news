We are appealing for witnesses following a burglary in Warlingham in the late hours yesterday (06 March).

Officers were called to a residential address in Shelton Avenue at around 7:30pm following reports of an aggravated burglary which had occurred shortly after 7pm. The elderly victim was in her bedroom when two persons forced entry into her home. The two men confronted the victim and proceeded to raid through her belongings.

A number of items have been taken including jewellery, bank cards, cash and a phone.

The victim was uninjured but left shaken.

The suspects are described as two black men 20 years of age, of slim build around 5 foot 8.

We are appealing for your help in identifying and tracing the suspects involved.

Do you live in Warlingham? Would your CCTV cameras or dashboard cameras have captured any part of these offences? Were you travelling during this time, perhaps on the way to or from work?
