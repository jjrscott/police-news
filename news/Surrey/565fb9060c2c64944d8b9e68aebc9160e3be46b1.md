We are appealing for the public's help in finding two missing teenage boys.

Devonte Graham, 15 from Carlisle and Ryan Kouame, 15 from Littlehampton haven't been seen since Thursday, 30 July and we are growing increasingly concerned for their welfare.

It is thought that the two boys may be in the Redhill area and are likely to be together. They may to be travelling by train. The boys were last seen in Croydon and have connections in that area.

Devonte is described as:

 * Black and of a slim build
 * Black hair which is styled in cornrows

Ryan is described as:

 * Black and of a slim build
 * Brown hair and brown eyes

If you have seen either of them, please get in contact on 101, quoting reference number PR/45200089688.
