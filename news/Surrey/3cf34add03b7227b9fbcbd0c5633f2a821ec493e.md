We're investigating the circumstances after a 16-year-old girl was found in Reigate with potentially life-changing injuries on Friday (20 November).

Officers were called after the injured girl was found in Reigate Road at the junction with Chart Lane at around 8pm. The girl was treated at the scene and taken to hospital where she remains in a serious condition.

We believe the girl was involved in a collision with a dark 4x4 car which failed to stop at the scene.

A 60-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol, failure to stop and causing serious injury by dangerous driving. A 64-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of failure to stop and causing serious injury by dangerous driving.
