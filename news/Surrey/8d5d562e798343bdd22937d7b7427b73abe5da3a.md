We're appealing for witnesses after two horse riders fell off their horses whilst out riding in the Dorking Road and New Road area of Tadworth at around 12.40pm today (28 February).

Two women were taken to hospital where they continue to receive treatment for serious injuries.

An investigation to establish the circumstances which led to the women's injuries remains ongoing.

We believe someone may have witnessed the incident as the area is popular with dog walkers.
