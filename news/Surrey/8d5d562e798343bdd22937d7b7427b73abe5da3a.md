We're appealing for witnesses after two horse riders fell off their horses whilst out riding in the Dorking Road and New Road area of Tadworth at around 12.40pm today (28 February).

We're appealing for witnesses after two horse riders fell off their horses whilst out riding in the Dorking Road and New Road area at around 12.40pm today (28 February).

Both women have since been released from hospital and continue to recover.

An investigation to establish the circumstances which led to the women's injuries remains ongoing.

We believe someone may have witnessed the incident as the area is popular with dog walkers.

Officers would like to speak to a female dog walker they believe may have been in the area at the time. The woman is described as white, 5 ft 5 and 60 years of age with straight, shoulder length silvery grey hair. She was last seen wearing a mid-sized purple/ blue jacket, walking a black spaniel dog with a shiny long coat.
