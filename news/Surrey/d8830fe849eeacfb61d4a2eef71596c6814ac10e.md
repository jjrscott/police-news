We are releasing an image of a man we would like to speak to after a 43 year-old man was threatened with a knife in Sunbury-on-Thames on Monday morning.

We are releasing an image of a man we would like to speak to after a 43 year-old man was threatened with a knife in Sunbury-on-Thames on Monday morning.

The victim was walking his dog between 8.10 and 9am on 15 June, when he was involved in a verbal dispute with a teenager in Groveley Park.

A few minutes later, the victim was approached by a man who threatened him with a knife, which he pulled from his trouser pocket. The suspect then walked off, but returned a few minutes later.

The victim left the park when he saw the suspect return. He was not hurt.

We are releasing an image of a man who was seen in the area at the time who may be able to help us with our enquiries.

He is described as:

 * Asian.
 * Aged between 35 and 45 years-old.
 * Around 6ft 1ins tall.
 * Muscular build.
 * He had blue eyes, short black hair and facial stubble.
 * He was wearing dark blue baggy tracksuit bottoms with three white stripes on the side of the leg, a plain blue t-shirt and trainers.

If you recognise this man or saw anything which could help our investigation, please call 101 and quote ref PR/45200061415.
