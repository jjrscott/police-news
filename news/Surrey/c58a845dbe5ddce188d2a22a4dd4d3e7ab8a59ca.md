Two men have both been jailed after Class A drugs were located during a vehicle stop in Guildford back in June.

At 4pm on June 10 officers stopped a vehicle on Southway, Guildford. They searched the car and found a sock in the front passenger door pocket containing two grip seal bags containing white powder. There were also four phones in the vehicle and a small amount of cash.

Benard Axhani, 23, and Kurtish Axhani, 30, both of no fixed address, were arrested for possession with intent to supply class A drugs.

A later search of the room in the B&B where Kurtish Axhami was staying found 30 more bags of suspected Cocaine, Â£5,000 in cash and drug paraphernalia.

The two were jailed when they appeared at Guildford Crown Court yesterday (December 10). Kurtish Axhami received a total of 43 months for possession with intent to supply Cocaine, concerned in the supply of Cocaine and money laundering. Benard Axhami was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment for possession with intent to supply Cocaine.
