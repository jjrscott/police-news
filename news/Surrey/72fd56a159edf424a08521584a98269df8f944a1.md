**_We are appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Addlestone on Monday, 28 December 2020._**

**_The incident occurred between midnight and 1am on Woodham Park Road, near to the Bourne Valley Garden Centre, when the victim was approached by two men on a dark coloured moped._**

**_The two men then stopped him and after behaving in a threatening manner, demanded he hand over his mobile phone, bank card and pin number._**

**_The two suspects then travelled to a cash machine on Ongar Parade and withdrew money._**
