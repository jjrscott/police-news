Motorists across Surrey and Sussex are being urged to check their insurance policies as Police Officers clamp down on uninsured drivers during a national week of action.

Operation Drive Insured is running during the week 26th October - 1st November with the aim of educating motorists on the consequences of uninsured driving or riding.

The week of action is part of a nationwide operation in partnership with the Motor Insurers' Bureau (MIB).

Chief Inspector Michael Hodder from Surrey and Sussex Police said: 'Unfortunately there are a small number of people who believe it is acceptable to drive without vehicle insurance, or fail to maintain up-to-date documentation."

Driving without insurance is a serious offence which can result in disqualification from driving, a minimum of six penalty points on your licence and a fine of up to Â£5,000.

Drivers who are caught driving without insurance may face the prospect of having their vehicle seized at the roadside.

"We want to send out a clear message to everyone that there is simply no excuse for driving without insurance. We have a variety of tools which allow us to quickly identify whether a vehicle is insured or not, and will ensure those who do not have insurance are kept off the roads."

Surrey and Sussex Police, along with Road Safety Partnerships Drive Smart and Sussex Safer Roads Partnership, are taking part in the national Operation Drive Insured campaign taking place throughout October.
