Surrey Police has launched a murder investigation following the discovery of a man's body at an address in Godstone earlier today (27 April).

The body of an 88-year-old man was found at a residential address in Bletchingley Road just before 11am.

The man has not yet been formally identified and a post mortem to establish the cause of death will take place in due course.

One lane of the A25 is currently closed while searches are carried out. House to house enquiries are also underway.

Detective Chief Inspector Colin Pirie from the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team said: "The investigation is still in the early stages but we would like to reassure the local community that we are doing everything we can to establish the circumstances of this man's death. Our thoughts remain with his family and friends at this time who are being supported by specialist officers.
