We're appealing for witnesses after catalytic converters were stolen from three different cars in Sainsbury's car park in Epsom yesterday (14 September).

At around 11am, three men were seen to remove the converters with a jack and electric saw. When a member of the public tried to intervene, the suspects threatened them with a metal pole.

The suspects are described as white, in their mid-thirties and of stocky build. One man was wearing a navy blue top and the other two were wearing white t-shirts. They arrived and left the car park in a dark grey Honda CR-V.

The car park was busy at the time of the incident and we believe that there will be multiple witnesses. If you saw anything suspicious, or recognise the car and suspects described, please contact us quoting PR/45200097499 via:
