Refusing to provide a blood sample on religious grounds is not a lawful excuse, as one driver recently discovered when he was caught by police in Sunbury for drug driving.

At 2.55am on December 31, 2019, Cameron Robinson, 24, from Brentford, Hounslow, was driving his BMW round the Sunbury Cross roundabout when he lost control of his car and collided with railings.

Officers who had been sat at traffic lights witnessed the collision and after checking on Robinson, they carried out a routine drugs test which showed that he was positive for cannabis.

He was arrested and taken to hospital as he had been involved in a collision. On arrival at St Peter's Hospital in Chertsey, officers began drug driving procedures. However, on being required to provide a specimen of blood for analysis Robinson refused to do so, claiming it was against his religion.

At Staines Magistrates' Court last Tuesday (March 3) Robinson pleaded guilty to failing to provide. He was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison (suspended for 12 months), disqualified from driving for 29 months and ordered to pay £120 victim surcharge and £85 in costs.
