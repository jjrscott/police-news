We're releasing footage of three men we would like to speak to following an attempted burglary in Egham on Friday 10 January.

The attempt break-in occurred at a property near the Egham Hill area at approximately 8.15pm.

The first man is described as wearing pale-coloured jeans, a light grey zip-up hooded jacket, trainers with a white trim and black soles, a blue cap and a scarf across his face.

The second man is described as wearing tight fit jeans with the back pockets hanging out and a fitted grey zip-up jacket. He has short hair, baseball cap and scarf across his face.

The third man is described as wearing light-coloured trousers, a navy blue zip-up jacket, blue gloves, white trainers, a dark grey baseball cap and scarf across his face.

All three have short hair and spoke with southern Irish accents. They are thought to have been driving a dark-coloured saloon car or hatchback.

If you know who they are, or you have any information, please call Surrey Police on 101 (999 in an emergency), quoting the reference number PR/45200004082.

You can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111; or through their anonymous online form: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/

We recognise the footage doesn't clearly show the men's faces, but hope the footage, combined with the description of their clothing, will identify them to anyone who was in the area at the time and might have seen them.

The footage was provided by home security company Ring.

It should not be used after the person has been found. Surrey Police/the owner of the photograph retains the copyright.
