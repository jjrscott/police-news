Michael Casey, 19, of Thurcaston Road, Leicester, and Martin Geordie Mcdonagh, 19, of Queen Victoria Street, Blackburn, have been charged with multiple offences.

The offences that the two have been charged for are:

• Four counts of theft from a motor vehicle;

• One count of going equipped for theft;

• One count of conspiracy to steal from a motor vehicle

Both men appeared in at Guildford Crown Court this afternoon (17 August), and have been remanded in custody until Monday, 14 September.

A 22-year-old man from Leicester was also arrested in connection with the incident and remains under investigation whilst he is in hospital recovering from minor injuries.

Police are still investigating after they received a number of reports of catalytic converter thefts from cars parked at Woking Leisure Centre and the Spectrum Leisure Centre in Guildford on 14 August.
