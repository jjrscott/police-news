We are pleased to confirm we have found a missing 44-year-old woman from Caterham.

The woman was reported missing yesterday (27 April) and has been found safe and well.

We are grateful for the help of the public and media in sharing our appeal, but we now ask that you help us to restore her privacy by removing the appeal from your publications, and from social media.
