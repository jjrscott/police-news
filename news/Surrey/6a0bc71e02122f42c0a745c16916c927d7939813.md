The family of Dmitry Obretetskiy, who died following a collision in Oxshott last week, has paid tribute to a "most amazing person who filled our lives".

Speaking about him this week, his family said: "Dmitry was a quiet and private man. We have lost a most amazing person who filled our lives. We thank everyone for their support at this awful time and take courage and strength from the sympathy expressed.

"We would ask people not to speculate on the circumstances of the incident, as this may impact the ongoing investigation, and it causes us additional anxiety and pain at this most difficult time.

"We would appreciate any witnesses to the collision to come forward and make contact with Surrey Police.

"We ask that you respect our privacy at this painful time as we are trying to cope with this horrendous incident and the loss of our father and best friend."

The collision, involving three vehicles, took place in Warren Lane around 4.45pm on Monday, 25 November, while Dmitry, 49, from Oxshott, was out walking his dog. He was taken to hospital where he sadly died a few days later (30 November). All parties were known and spoken to, no arrests have been made and enquiries remain ongoing with our Collision Investigation Unit.

We are appealing for anyone with information which could assist with our enquiries, or has dashcam footage, to contact the Serious Collision Investigation Unit on 101, quoting incident reference PR/P19274056. Alternatively, you can report information online at: https://www.surrey.police.uk/ro/report/ocr/af/how-to-report-a-crime/

The family does not wish to release a photo of Dmitry.
