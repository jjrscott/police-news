We're appealing for witnesses following an aggravated burglary in Woking on Friday evening (November 8).

Four men broke into a property in West End at around 6pm.

The victim, a teenage boy, was threatened with an unknown instrument by one of the suspects, who then forced him to lie down on the sofa.

The suspects demanded that the victim hand over property before stealing a mobile phone and jewellery. The mobile phone was since found at the address.

The victim was not injured following the incident.

All four men were wearing dark clothing, gloves and had their faces covered.

One of the men has been described as of a large build, with a British accent and wearing black boots.

One of the men has been described as of a slim build.

It is thought the men may have left the area in a dark-coloured vehicle.

Detective Inspector Peter Howgate said: "This was a frightening experience for the victim, who thankfully has not been physically harmed.

I would like to reassure the wider community in this area that we are taking this very seriously. We are following up on a number of lines of enquiry and carrying out additional patrols in the area.

If you were in the area at the time and saw anything suspicious, please get in touch with us. Alternatively, if you have any dashcam footage taken in the area, please call us on 101 or report it online ( www.surrey.police.uk/ro/report/ ) quoting crime reference number PR/45190119844."

You can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form: www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
