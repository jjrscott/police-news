We are appealing for witnesses following a serious collision in Virginia Water yesterday evening (17 December).

The two vehicle collision, involving a white Mercedes Sprinter and a Ford Focus, took place in Callow Hill around 6.40pm.

The driver of the Focus was taken to hospital with serious injuries.

The driver of the Sprinter failed to stop at the scene and was later arrested at his home address on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving, failing to stop at the scene of a collision, driving under the influence of drugs and drink driving.

The 39-year-old man from Virginia Water has been released under investigation. Enquiries remain ongoing.

The road was closed in both direction while emergency services, including ambulance and fire crews and the air ambulance, dealt with the incident.

Anyone who witnessed the collision, or either of the vehicles being driven prior to it taking place, or anyone with any dashcam footage, is asked to contact us on 101, quoting incident reference PR/P19292551.
