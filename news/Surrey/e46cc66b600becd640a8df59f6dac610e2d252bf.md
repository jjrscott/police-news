Seven men with connections to the Red Devils and Hells Angels Motorcycle Clubs have been sentenced for their involvement in a bloody attack on members of a rival motorcycle club in Blindley Heath in November last year.

The attack happened on 7 November 2018 in an outbuilding at the Forman Club and Institute in Blindley Heath, where members of the Warg Brotherhood were joined by members of the Vikings Motorcycle Club for their weekly meeting.

During sentencing, his honour Judge John described how "this was part of a turf war by prospects or probationers to earn their spurs for their club".

Just before 19:30 on 7 November, thirteen figures dressed in balaclavas and dark clothing were seen on CCTV walking along the A22 towards the Forman institute. Moments later they entered the outbuilding and attacked the people inside with various weapons. At 19:32 Surrey Police received a 999 call reporting the attack, and immediately deployed.

Police arrived at the scene to find seven men with serious stab wounds and blunt force injuries, and the officers started first aid. One man had been stabbed through his right arm, another had lacerations to his stomach which required bowel surgery and 29 staples, while others had bruising and stab wounds on their heads, legs and buttocks.

Surrey Police immediately started an intensive investigation, and within 24 hours Przemyslaw Piwonia had been arrested in Slough by Thames Valley Police after a witness gave officers a description of the vehicle he used.

From that one arrest, officers painstakingly identified the other individuals involved by ploughing through Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) information, CCTV footage and mobile phone data (call data, social media messages and cell tower mast data). Over the coming weeks another six men were identified and arrested, and evidence recovered linking the men to each other, to the attack, and to their status as members or prospective members of the Red Devils MC club and Hells Angels MC club.

Despite protesting their innocence during the eight week trial, in July, the seven men were found guilty of their involvement, and today they were sentenced to a combined tariff of over 150 years.

Each of the men was sentenced to 14 years for six counts of grievous bodily harm with intent (section 18) with further sentences for lesser charges that will run concurrently.

Detective Chief Inspector Chris Friday, who led the investigation said:

"The horrific nature of this crime, and the meticulous planning that went into this unprovoked attack, has led to lengthy sentences for all seven men, who knew full-well what they were getting involved with that evening.

"In his summing up the judge highlighted how none of the men admitted their role in the events of that evening, and none of them showed any remorse.

"I hope they will take time in prison to contemplate the impact their gratuitous criminal violence had on their victims that night and since - one of whom is suffering from PTSD, and another of whom has a metal plate in his arm.

"I am immensely proud of my officers and the work they did to bring these dangerous men to justice. Two of my officers were highlighted for their dedication in cataloguing and disclosing over 1500 exhibits and thousands of documents.

"These convictions should serve as a warning to anyone who believes their loyalties to any group or gang justifies criminality or violence that we will do everything we can to disrupt and detect their activities.

"They hid their faces and made every effort to hide their tracks and destroy evidence, but through single-minded detective work we were able to identify, charge and convict these seven men.

"I want to close by saying we know a further six individuals were involved that night. Our investigation is still open, and we will continue to pursue them. Anyone who knows anything about who those six men are should get in contact with CrimeStoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111"
