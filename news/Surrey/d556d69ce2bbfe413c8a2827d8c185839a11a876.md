Did you see an assault involving two teenage boys outside Dorking Deepdene station on Tuesday evening (17 March)?

We're appealing for witnesses after a teenager was assaulted in London Road, Dorking around 6.20pm.
Detective Constable Kristian Baker said "The pair were involved in an altercation just outside Dorking Deepdene Station prior to the assault.
"The incident took place during rush hour and we believe there may have been commuters who saw what happened and may be able to provide more information.
"I also want to reassure the public that we believe the suspect and victim are known to each other and that this was an isolated incident."
A 16-year-old boy from Redhill has been arrested on suspicion of attempt GBH. He has been released from custody on conditional bail.
Anyone who was in the area at the time and has information that could assist our enquiries is asked to call Surrey Police on 101 (999 in an emergency) quoting PR/45200030224.
You can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111; or through their anonymous online form: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/
