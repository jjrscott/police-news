Andre Newman, 23, of Whielden Heights, Amersham, Buckinghamshire was sentenced on 17 March to three years at Guildford Crown Court for the supply of drugs.

At lunchtime on Tuesday, 31 March 2020, officers from the Force's Western Proactive Team were on patrol in Guildford. A man caught their attention so they tracked his movements to a cul de sac, where they observed a second man who they strongly suspected was a drug user.

The second man went into a house and was there for no more than two minutes. Officers stopped him nearby and he admitted to having bought crack cocaine from the house, which he quickly disposed of when he saw the police officers.

On attending the house the officers found Newman and the man who had initially led them to the house. The man appeared to be a drug user whom Newman was supplying in return for the use of the property.

Newman admitted that he had something concealed within his underwear and when he was subsequently strip searched a small white bag that contained around 250 dark and white coloured wraps, suspected to be class A drugs was found.

Officer in charge PC Rory Brooks-Kent said: "Our message to dealers is that we are very often out there patrolling proactively so there's every chance we will catch up with you.

"To members of the public, if you see frequent visitors to a property who don't stay for long, like in this case, that could indicate drug dealing. Please note as much detail as you can, without endangering yourself, and tell us what it happening."
