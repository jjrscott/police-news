We are appealing for witnesses following a dangerous driving incident in Wonersh on Wednesday, 3 March.

Officers were called to Cranleigh Road at around 1.55pm following reports that a black Audi A4 convertible had collided with a white van. The Audi then conducted a three point turn before heading off in the opposite direction. After half a mile the driver then lost control of the car, hitting the nearside curb before colliding head on with an oncoming vehicle. The driver then got out of his car and attempted to flee the scene.

The suspect has been described as a white male, in his early 50s, of medium build. He was wearing a blue hooded top, blue jeans, a grey beanie hat and a black face mask.

We are appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the incident or have any dashcam footage to get in touch.
