A man who used a pitchfork to break into an office to steal computer equipment, was sentenced at Guildford Crown Court last week (18 December) to four years and six months in prison.

Mark Worley, 51, of Oriental Road, Woking, pleaded guilty to one count of burglary relating to an incident that occurred at a residential address on Park Road, Woking, on Tuesday, 10 November.

Officers were called to the scene after Worley used a pitchfork to force the lock off of the door to an external office at the address. He then stole a laptop and external hard drive.

The incident occurred at approx. 1am and was caught on CCTV.

After reviewing the CCTV footage, officers were able to identify Worley and he was later arrested and charged with the offence.

Investigating Officer, PC Kathryn Sandys said, "This sentence is a real achievement for the team whose hard work and dedication has resulted in another burglar being put behind bars. Burglary is a concern for most of us who want to feel safe in our homes and it will not be tolerated in Surrey."
