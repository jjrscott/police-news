Surrey Police is appealing for the public's help to locate a woman missing from Hersham, near Walton on Thames.

Beth Sharp, 22, was last seen at around 4.30pm on Sunday 27 December after she told her family she was going out for a walk. She has not been in contact since.

We are growing increasingly concerned as it is out of character for her to be out of contact for this long, and she does not have vital medication with her.

Beth is described as white, around 5'6" and of slim to average build. She has long blonde hair with darker roots, and a tattoo behind her left heel of the letter "J". When she went missing she was wearing a blue puffer jacket, blue jeans, a grey jumper and boots, and is not believed to have many clothes with her. She does not have access to a car so is likely to be using trains or buses. She is believed to have connections to the Croydon, Epsom and Redhill areas.

Anyone who has been in contact with Beth, or believes they have seen someone matching her photo and description since last Sunday, is asked to make contact with Surrey Police on 101 or using the "live Chat" function on the Surrey Police website (surrey.police.uk) which will connect you direct to a call handler. Quote reference PR/45200136732.

Anyone who knows where Beth currently is, should call 999 so that officers can attend and ensure she is safe.
