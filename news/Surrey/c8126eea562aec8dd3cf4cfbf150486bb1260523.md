We're releasing an image of a teenager who may be able to help us after a 30 year-old man was verbally harassed and had water thrown over him at Gogmore Farm Park in Chertsey.

The man was sitting in the main field area of the park on the afternoon of Monday 15 June.

The teenagers are described as white.

One was described as of large build with short brown hair and was wearing grey shorts and no top. One of the other boys was wearing neon pink shorts.
