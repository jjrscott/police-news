Thank you to everyone who shared our appeal on Sunday, 19 April which included CCTV images of three people we wanted to speak to as part of a burglary investigation at Frimley Park Hospital.

Officers were called after PPE and cleaning equipment were stolen from the hospital on Tuesday, 31 March.

We are now recalling this appeal as arrests have been made. Please do not share the appeal or images any further.

A 46 year old woman from High Street, Bagshot, a 44 year old woman from Grove Cross Road, Frimley and a 42 year old man of no fixed address were arrested yesterday on suspicion of burglary and remain in custody.

Please remove any CCTV images in relation to this investigation.
