We are appealing for witnesses following a serious collision in Ashford earlier today (Thursday, 4 June).

Officers were called to the A308 just after 10AM this morning following reports of a collision between a Vauxhall Astra and a single decker bus.

Police were in attendance along with Surrey Fire and Rescue and the ambulance service. The driver of the Astra, a man in his 50s sadly passed away at the scene.

We are appealing for witnesses or anyone with any dashcam footage to get in contact with any information by calling 101, quoting reference number PR/P20128911.

The A308 remained closed in both directions whilst emergency services were at the scene but the eastbound carriageway has since reopened.
