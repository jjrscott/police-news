Officers working to identify the suspects involved in a recent spate of high-value burglaries on the Crown Estate in Oxshott have arrested three men.

A silver Toyota Prius, believed to be involved in the burglaries, had been acting suspiciously in the area and was later stopped by officers in Egham yesterday afternoon.

Officers searched the vehicle and found a backpack containing a torch, baseball caps, face coverings and gloves, as well as two crowbars and a large can of pepper spray.

All three men, aged 37, 32 and 17, believed to be from Manchester and London were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to burgle and possession of a section 5 firearm.

They remain in custody and the investigation is ongoing.
