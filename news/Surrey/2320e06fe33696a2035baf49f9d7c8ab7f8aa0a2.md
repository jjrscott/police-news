Officers were called to an address in St. Mary's Close, Epsom following an incident on Sunday 9 August at around 8pm.

The victim was in her garden when a male climbed over the fence. When she challenged him and asked why he was in her garden, he was verbally and racially abusive towards her, and threatened to kill her.
