We are appealing for witnesses after three teenagers were robbed in Camberley on Saturday evening (8 February).

The teenagers, aged between 16 and 17 years, were sat in the bus stop in Pembroke Broadway between 9.50 and 10pm when they were approached by two people on a black moped.

The passenger got off the moped and pushed and slapped the victims before taking a number of items of property belonging to them. The moped has then left at speed towards Park Street. A knife was seen in the waistband of the suspect's trousers.

The moped rider was described as wearing a black helmet and dark-coloured tracksuit bottoms while the passenger had a tanned complexion and was wearing a dark-coloured tracksuit.

The moped was black with red writing and "L" plates.

Police are appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident, or anyone with any information which could help us to identify the offenders, to come forward. If you can help, please call us on 101, quoting crime reference number PR/45200015841. Alternatively, if you prefer not to leave your name, call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
