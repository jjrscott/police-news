Surrey Police's 'Policing your Community events' are set to return but this year they will be held virtually!

Over the last two years, Chief Constable Gavin Stephens and PCC David Munro have travelled around the county meeting local residents, joined by the local Borough Commander. These events are an opportunity to hear what the Force is doing to support local residents and it is a chance for communities to ask questions.

below are the videos from each event - the introductory content from the Chief and PCC is the same in each video, you may wish to skip this once you've watch the first part.
