Surrey Police's 'Policing your Community events' are set to return but this year they will be held virtually!

Over the last two years, Chief Constable Gavin Stephens and PCC David Munro have travelled around the county meeting local residents, joined by the local Borough Commander. These events are an opportunity to hear what the Force is doing to support local residents and it is a chance for communities to ask questions.

Interested in attending? The details for the eleven events are below:

 * Mon 18 Jan - Runnymede Borough: 5:30pm - 6:30pm
