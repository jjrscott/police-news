We are continuing to appeal for the public's help in locating wanted man Daniel Andrews.

Andrews, 29, of Crestway, Wandsworth, is wanted for breaching a community order imposed by Guildford Crown Court. We would also like to speak to him in relation to a theft investigation.

He is described as white, approximately 6ft 1 tall and of a large build. He has short, light brown hair and was last seen with a beard.

Andrews has links to the Epsom, West Molesey and Worcester Park areas of Surrey and the Wandsworth area in London.

If you know where he is, or you have any information which could help us find him, please call 101, quoting PR/45190078865. Alternatively, if you do not wish to leave your name, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
