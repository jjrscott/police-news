Putting her skills to good use, it was all in a day's work for Police Dog (PD) Reno when she was congratulated for finding a high risk domestic abuse suspect.

Handler, PC Beesley, was called to Wildcroft Drive in North Holmwood, Dorking on Sunday, September 11 by the Mole Valley team to help them find and arrest their suspect.

Officers had managed to get the victim to safety and went back to arrest the suspect. As soon as the suspect turned up at around 11.15pm and saw the police he made off in his vehicle before getting out and running away a short distance from the address.

Reno was asked to track the suspect from where he was last seen. She managed to follow the trial from the address along a footpath, through a housing estate and right on to Inholms Lane. Reno tracked along the main road and then indicated to a hedge on the right. She went through the undergrowth and found the suspect about 10 metres away from the main road. She stayed barking at the suspect until officers had him handcuffed and led away.

PC Beesley said: "I'm really proud of Reno especially as she's quite a young dog. She did a brilliant job, as hard surface tracking is really challenging, and helped us catch the suspect who was attempting to evade us."
