We are appealing for witnesses following a robbery and stabbing in Guildford Park Road in the early hours of Wednesday 18 March.

We received a report that at approximately half past midnight, two men attacked the 27-year-old victim with a knife whilst he was sat in his car. The suspects then demanded the victim hand over his valuables.

The two men are described as:

 * White.
 * Aged in their 20s.
 * Slim build, with one of them believed to have fair-coloured hair.
 * Both suspects were wearing black tracksuits with the hoods pulled up.

A-27 year-old man from Guildford was arrested on suspicion of possession of a bladed article as part of our enquiries. He has been released from custody without charge, but remains under investigation.

The victim is now recovering at home.

Did you see anything suspicious in the area? Or did you notice two men matching the description of the suspects? If so, please call 101 and quote reference PR/45200030286.
