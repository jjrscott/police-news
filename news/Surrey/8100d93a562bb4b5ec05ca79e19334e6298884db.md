We are asking for the public's help in tracing a man who ran away from officers following a pursuit in Addlestone last night (28 November). Officers would also like to identify the owner of a watch which was found as a result of the pursuit.

At approximately 8.05pm officers were near Chertsey Bridge Road when they spotted a silver Audi A3 parked up half on the pavement outside Bridge Court facing the direction of Chertsey acting suspiciously.

Officers turned around to stop the vehicle, but it made off which then triggered a pursuit. The pursuit headed towards New Haw Road, where the Audi then collided with two vehicles. The driver of the vehicle made off from police, and officers would like to appeal for anyone who has any information on who he is, or anyone who may have seen him, to come forward.

The man is described as white, approximately 5ft. 10 inches tall, of slim build, with short light brown hair which is shorter on the sides. He was wearing a black puffa jacket, navy hoodie underneath puffa, Puma navy tracksuit bottoms and black trainers.

Officers found a men's silver Tag Heuer watch and would like to identify who the watch belongs to. If you believe the watch is yours, please contact us.

Two 18-year-old women from Shepperton were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit burglary, and remain under investigation.
