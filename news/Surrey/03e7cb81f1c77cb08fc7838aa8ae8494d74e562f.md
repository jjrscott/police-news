We're appealing for help to find 15-year-old Nguyen Vanhung after he was reported missing from his home in Caterham yesterday evening (19 March).

Nguyen was last seen leaving his home at around 5.30pm and may have travelled to the Southampton area. He is described as Asian, 5ft 6inch tall with black medium length hair and was last seen wearing grey tracksuit bottoms and a black hoodie.

We're concerned for his safety and want to get him home safe and well.
