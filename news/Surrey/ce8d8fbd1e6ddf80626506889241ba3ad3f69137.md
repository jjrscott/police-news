We're continuing to investigate an attempted robbery at Pinewood Stores and Post Office on Guildford Road in Ash that happened over the weekend.

Shortly after 2:30pm on Sunday 21 June a man who had his face covered threatened staff with a knife and demanded money. The man caused damage to the shop on Guildford Road, but nothing was taken and no-one was hurt. The man left on a bicycle.

Officers have been carrying out enquiries in the area to locate a suspect and reviewing CCTV, but are keen to hear from anyone who saw anyone acting suspiciously in the area.

If you have any information which could assist our investigation, please contact us on 101, quoting crime reference PR/ 45200063776.

Alternatively, if you do not wish to leave your name, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
