We are pleased to share that we have located a missing 14 year old boy from Caterham who had not been seen since Wednesday 18 March.

We are grateful for the help of the public and media in sharing our appeal, but we now ask that you help us to restore his privacy by removing the appeal from your publications, and from social media.
