A 55-year-old woman has been charged in connection with the ongoing murder investigation in Horley.

Jennifer Gwen Lloyd of Hyperion Walk in Horley was charged with murder after being arrested on Monday (9 November).

She appeared at Guildford Magistrates' Court earlier today (12 November), and was remanded in custody to appear at Guildford Crown Court on 10 December.

The victim, who has been named locally as 62-year-old Nigel Chapman, was found dead at an address in Upfield Close in Horley around 8am the same day. Formal identification is expected to take place in due course.

Senior Investigating Officer Temporary Detective Chief Inspector Chris Friday said: "Mr Chapman's family is going through an extremely difficult time and we would ask that their privacy is respected to allow them to grieve and begin to come to terms with what has happened."
