A 38 year-old man from Camberley has been sentenced to 40 months in prison for offences including possession with intent to supply cocaine and cannabis.

Officers from Surrey Police carried out warrants at two addresses in Camberley on 5 September and seized Class A, B, and C drugs with a street value of more than Â£100,000.

Aaron Peters of Saddleback Road was arrested, charged, and subsequently found guilty at Guildford Crown Court. On 14 November he was sentenced to a total of 40 months in prison for offences including possession with intent to supply Class A, B, and C drugs.

Borough Commander for Surrey Heath, Inspector Bob Darkens said: "These warrants were part of our ongoing response to information about the supply of drugs in the Surrey Heath area. The amount of drugs, including Cocaine and Cannabis, seized in September makes a significant contribution towards protecting the public and some of the most vulnerable people in our communities. Ultimately our local communities are safer as these drugs are not on the streets being sold.

"This sentence sends a clear message that the courts take these kind of offences very seriously and the result of Peters actions should serve as a warning to anyone involved in the supply or distribution of illegal drugs".
