We are appealing for witnesses following a serious collision involving a van and a cyclist on the A3.

The collision happened between Milford and Thursley at 9.11pm today (April 12) and has left the man who was riding the bike in a serious condition. The van stopped at the scene.

The southbound carriage is currently shut and is likely to be so for several hours while the investigation is carried out.

Officers are appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the collision or who may have dashcam footage to get in touch.

Anyone with any information should contact Surrey Police on 101 and quote the reference number PR/P20083413.
