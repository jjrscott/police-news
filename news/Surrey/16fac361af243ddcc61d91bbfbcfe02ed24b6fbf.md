A 26-year-old man from Lambeth has been sentenced to 11 months in prison after pleading guilty to affray following a stabbing at Thorpe Park last year.

Craig Harakh, 26, of Jeffery's Road, Lambeth, was arrested on Saturday, 18 July after officers received reports of a stabbing at the theme park in Chertsey at around 4:30pm.

The victim, a 27-year-old man, was stabbed in the stomach following a confrontation which occurred close to the front entrance. He was taken to hospital with serious injuries and discharged a few days later following surgery.

The park remained temporarily closed whilst enquiries were underway and the suspects were located.

Harakh was arrested and charged with causing grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent and possession of an offensive weapon. A second man was arrested and later released with no further action.

Harakh appeared at Kingston Crown Court yesterday (Monday 11 January), where he pleaded guilty to a further count of affray. However, he was found not guilty of wounding with intent and possession of a bladed article.

He was sentenced to seven months in prison for the affray and four months for breaching a previous suspended sentence, resulting in a total sentence of 11 months.

Investigating Officer, Detective Constable Nathan Dunstan, said: "We would like to thank the visitors to the park that day, who were delayed in leaving as a result of our enquiries. We would also like to thank the team at Thorpe Park for their assistance during this investigation."

"We will continue to work hard to tackle knife crime in Surrey, which simply cannot be tolerated in our local communities."
