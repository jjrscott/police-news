We are releasing images of two men we would like to speak to after racial abuse was shouted at a woman in Camberley.

At around midnight on the morning of Wednesday 11 December racial abuse was shouted at a 50 year-old woman on Charles Street

A group of two men and a woman, aged in their twenties, was seen in the area at the time. The woman was wearing an olive coloured coat. We would like to speak to them to establish what happened.

Images of the two men are attached to this appeal.
