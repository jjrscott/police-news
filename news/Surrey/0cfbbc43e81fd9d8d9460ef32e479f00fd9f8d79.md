We are continuing to appeal for witnesses after a man was stabbed in Farnham on Saturday (14 November).

The victim, a 19-year-old man, was walking close to the footbridge in Weydon Lane around 5.20pm when he was approached by the suspect and stabbed in the stomach. The suspect, who was wearing dark clothing, then walked off.

The victim was taken to hospital with injuries not described as life-threatening or life-changing and has since been discharged.

Inspector Sam Adcock, Borough Commander for Waverley said:

"We understand that this is extremely concerning for local residents but we believe this to be an isolated incident and detectives are working tirelessly to ensure the person responsible is brought to account.

 "Local residents may notice a heightened police presence in the area over the next couple of days, however this is nothing to be concerned about."
