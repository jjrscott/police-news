Is this yours?

We're trying to locate the owners of these items that we believe may have been stolen and a number of tools seized on Sunday 3 May in Witley and Godalming as part of an ongoing burglary investigation.

A 46 year-old man arrested on suspicion of burglary and handling stolen goods has been released from custody, but remains under investigation.

The items seized include:

 * Assorted red, orange, blue, yellow, and green hard hats.
