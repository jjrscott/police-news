We're currently investigating a serious injury collision involving two vans on the B2032 Pebble Hill Road in Betchworth.

Road closures are expected to be in place for some time this evening to allow an investigation to take place..

At around 5:10pm a white Peugeot van was involved in a collision with a Ford Transit Tipper van around a quarter mile south of Headley Common Road.

The man driving the Peugeot has been taken to hospital with serious injuries. The man driving the Ford is in a serious, but stable condition at hospital. His passenger received less serious injuries.

We are appealing for anyone who saw what happened or who has dashcam footage to contact us.

Anyone with information should call 101 quoting P20080056.

Alternatively, if you do not wish to leave your name, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
