Surrey Police is continuing to appeal for the public's help in identifying the man in these CCTV images, a year after a suspected arson in Staines-upon-Thames.

Officers were called to a printers on the A30 in Staines-upon- Thames at around 3am on Thursday, 15 August 2019 following reports of a large fire. Witnesses claimed to see someone throw a firebomb before making off on foot towards the Crooked Billet roundabout.

We would like to speak to the man in these images in connection with this incident and are appealing for the public's help to find out who he is.

Detective Constable Rhian Roberts said "It's been a year since this incident took place and someone out there must know who this man is.

"The fire had a devastating impact on a family-run business that was established in 1957 and we want to bring whoever is responsible to justice.

"We are urging anyone who may remember seeing anything, recognises this man or has any further information to come forward."
