We are currently working together with Surrey Fire & Rescue services at a serious house fire in Horsell which started at around 0155 on Monday morning - 10 August.

Officers had been on scene following a 999 call at around midnight raising concerns for the safety of two individuals.

After a period of about 90 minutes, including the involvement of negotiators, a fire has started in the loft-space of the semi-detached property, which has quickly spread.

It is understood that the fire took hold of two properties - the two within the semi-detached - and a third home has also been evacuated as a precautionary measure. The flames were extinguished around 30 minutes after being first seen and fire crews are dampening and making the properties safe.

A 26 year old male has been arrested on suspicion of:

 * arson with intent to endanger life;
 * making threats to kill;
 * and assaulting an emergency worker.

He will be attending custody at Guildford police station.
