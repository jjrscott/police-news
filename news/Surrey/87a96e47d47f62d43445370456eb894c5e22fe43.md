We are appealing for witnesses after a property in Weybridge was broken into and vandalised.

The break-in occurred at an address in D'Oyly Carte Island yesterday (1 June), at around 2.55pm, resulting in windows and doors inside the property being smashed and graffiti being written on the walls.

A group of around 14 youths were seen to leave the property around the time of the incident, by jumping into the river and swimming in the direction of Desborough Island. Witnesses reported hearing sounds of a disturbance inside the address prior to this.

A description of five of the youths can be found below.

Black male, 16 - 19 years old, skinny build, short brown hair, wearing green luminous shorts with a black stripe on the side.

White male, 15 - 16 years old, skinny build, brown short hair, wearing black shorts and black socks.

Black male, 15 - 16 years old, skinny build, brown afro hair shaved at the side, wearing black shorts and grey stripy socks.
