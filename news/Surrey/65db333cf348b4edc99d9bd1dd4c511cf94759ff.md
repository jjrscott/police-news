Our search is continuing for missing Farnham man Mark Maclay, 62, who has not been seen since last Monday (27 January).

As part of our enquiries, we would like to identify the man in the CCTV image Mark was speaking to at the Lidl supermarket in Dogflud Way on the day he disappeared.

A dive team from Specialist Group International was called in to assist with the search last week after some of Mark's belongings were found near the bank of the River Wey near Farnham Maltings. Surrey Search and Rescue are also helping out with the search.

Detective Inspector Errol Chetty from Surrey Police said: "Piecing together Mark's movements before he went missing is crucial to our enquiries. We would like to speak to the man in the CCTV at Lidl to find out what Mark was talking to him about.

"If this is you, or you know who it is, please contact us as soon as possible on 101 and quote the reference number PR/45200011059."

Mark is described as white, around 6ft tall, well-built and balding with white hair. He was wearing a green jacket, jeans and a beige baseball cap and had a backpack with him.
