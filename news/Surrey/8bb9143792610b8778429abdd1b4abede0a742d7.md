We are appealing for witnesses following a suspicious incident in Woking yesterday (10th December).

A member of the public called us to report what appeared to be an altercation between a man and a woman on College Road at around 9pm last night.

It was reported that both parties then drove off in a black saloon-style taxi towards Old Woking Road.

L/DS Chris Potts said: "Due to the concerning nature of the call, we need to hear from anyone who may have seen the incident, or may have any dashcam footage that could help our enquiries.

"Were you in or around this area near College Road last night? If you were, and you saw something which didn't seem quite right, please report it to us.

"Similarly, if you believe it was yourself involved in this incident then please come forward. We wish to confirm all parties involved are OK."

Anyone with information is asked to call Surrey Police on 101 (999 in an emergency) quoting PR/45190132620.

You can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111; or through their anonymous online form: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/
