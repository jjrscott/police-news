We have released CCTV images of a man we would like to speak to in connection with a residential burglary in St Johns on September 14 at 11pm.

Credit cards were stolen from the property and used at two garages in Woking and Chobham.

The suspect has been described as a large built white male wearing a hoody, tracksuit bottoms and a face mask. He appears to approach the petrol stations on foot.

PC Luke Lightburn, of the West Surrey Proactive Team, said: "We are keen to identify the man pictured in these CCTV images.

"If you recognise the person pictured, or you were in the area at the time and saw anything suspicious, please get in touch."
