We are appealing for witnesses following an unprovoked attack on a man and woman in Redhill.

On Sunday, 1 December, at approximately 1.40am, a man and woman were walking into the Sainsbury's underground car park, off Princess Way, when they were approached by a man from behind.

The male victim was knocked unconscious by the suspect, before the woman was also knocked to the ground. They were both seen by paramedics at the scene and treated for minor injuries.

The suspect is described as a white man, approximately 6ft. 3 inches tall, broad build, with short brown hair.

Officers are keen to identify a second man, who can be seen in the CCTV image from behind, as they believe he may have information that will help the case. He is described as white, approximately 5ft. 8 inches tall, with brown hair, early to mid-20s, of medium build, wearing a black t-shirt with a white pattern, and black trousers.

Detective Constable Scott Moore, who is investigating the incident said: "If you were near the car park around the time the attack took place, please contact us as you may have information that will help our investigation.

"We do not believe that the suspect was known to the man and woman, and this attack was completely unprovoked. If you recognise the suspect, or the man in the image from behind, please come forward. I understand that the image we have supplied only shows the back of the man, but hopefully someone will recognise him, or if you believe it is you, please call us."

A 30-year-old man from Reigate was arrested and released under investigation while enquiries remain ongoing.

Anyone with information is asked to call Surrey Police on 101 (999 in an emergency) quoting PR/45190128931.

You can also give information, 100% anonymously, to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111; or through their anonymous online form: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/
