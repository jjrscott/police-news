House parties, social gatherings and over 100 people sunbathing at Box Hill are just some of what our officers have been dealing with in the last few days. Thankfully, almost everyone has listened to the advice given and only as a last resort have we had to enforce the restrictions with a fine or arrest for those that have simply ignored us.

In the last five days, we've received over 278 reports of anti-social behaviour (ASB) and people not respecting the restrictions currently in place.

With the good weather, we understand that these restrictions are making it even more frustrating and entertaining the kids even more difficult, but please ask yourself:

 * Is that journey really essential?
 * Should I be inviting my friends/family over?
 * If your child is heading out for a 'walk' or some 'exercise', who are they meeting?
 * What impact are my actions having on my neighbours who are also having to stay inside?

Dealing with these incidents means we could be taking valuable resources away from those that really need our help.
