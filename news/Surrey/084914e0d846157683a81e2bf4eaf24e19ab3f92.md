Police investigating the sexual assault of a woman in Priory Park, Reigate, last Tuesday are keen to speak to a man and a woman who may have been in the park at the time the incident took place, and could have vital information that could help.

The people we are looking to trace are described as a couple, both between 30 and 38 years old. The man is described as white, skinny build and 185cm (6 feet) tall. He was wearing a white top with lines on it and blue jeans shorts. The woman is described as white with black hair. She was wearing a blue dress.

It is believed they may have spoken to the victim and the suspect in the park at around the time of the assault.

As a matter of urgency, police want to speak to anyone who feels that they could match that description and was in Priory Park between 4:30 and 6:30pm on Tuesday afternoon. We would also ask anyone who may have photos or video footage from the park between those times to check and see if they may have captured an image of this couple.

DI Vicki Preston said: "I want to be clear that we need to trace these witnesses urgently, as we believe they may have seen something that could assist our investigation.".

Anyone with information that they feel could help is asked to call Surrey Police on 101, quoting reference PR/45200059749.

A man remains in custody following his arrest in connection with the incident yesterday.
