A man has been sentenced to nine years in prison after being found guilty of manslaughter following the death of Glen Hopgood in Weybridge earlier this year.

Ralph Carter, 60, was found guilty yesterday (22 July), of the manslaughter of 52-year-old Glen Hopgood at an address in Old Palace Road in the early hours on 8 January following an eight-day trial at Isleworth Crown Court.

The court heard that the two men had been socialising and drinking together during the day, but at 00:25am on 8 January 2020, police received a 999 call from Carter's mobile phone reporting that he had killed someone.

Carter claimed Mr Hopgood had attacked him and that he was only acting in self-defence.

Detective Chief Inspector Charlotte Rimmer from the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team, who investigated the incident, said: "Our thoughts remain with of Mr Hopgood at this time, who have been left devastated by his death. I hope the prison sentence given to Carter today will bring them some form of closure and allow them to begin to move on with their lives."

DCI Rimmer added: "I would like to thank all those who gave evidence, as well as the investigating team, whose contribution ensured that Carter has been brought to justice for Mr Hopgood's death."
