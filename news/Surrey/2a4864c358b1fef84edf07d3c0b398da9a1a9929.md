Surrey Police officers investigating a high value burglary in Woking are asking the public to help them identify the previous owners of some distinctive Japanese ivory okimono (decorative ornaments).

Detective Constable Kerry Plumb, who is investigating the burglary, said:

"These distinctive Japanese antique ivory pieces were sold at an auction in 2019 by an antiques dealer who we are now investigating in connection with the burglary. Although these items were not from the Woking burglary, we have some suspicions about these pieces that we'd like to clear up.

I am keen to understand how the antiques dealer came to be in possession of these distinctive items - did he buy them? inherit them? was he given them? were they stolen?

The pieces probably all belonged to the same collector, and I feel sure that someone will recognise them. If you do recognise any of these pieces please make contact so we can understand if the dealer was legitimately allowed to sell them.

I want to stress that the auction house, original owner and current owner are not believed to have done anything wrong - I am just keen to understand the previous history of these items to help my investigation into the antiques dealer."

If you recognise the items and know anything about their ownership or whereabouts in, or before, 2018; or if you have any information which could help, please contact us quoting crime reference number PR/45190014823 via
