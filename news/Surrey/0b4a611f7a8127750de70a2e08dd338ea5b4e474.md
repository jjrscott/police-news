We are appealing for witnesses after a man exposed his genitals to two teenage girls in Guildford on Monday afternoon (15 February).

The incident took place near Castle Arch, Guildford, at around 2.50pm, whilst the two victims were out walking. The suspect then exposed himself to the girls, before they ran from the scene.

We have released an image of a man we would like to speak to, as we believe he may be able to assist with our investigation. If you have any information about who he is, please call us.

Investigating Officer PC Jazz Smith, said: "This incident took place in broad daylight in central Guildford, so we are appealing for further witnesses who may have been in the area at the time to help us with our investigation. Fortunately incidents like this are rare, but we want to put a stop to such obscene behaviour as quickly as possible."
