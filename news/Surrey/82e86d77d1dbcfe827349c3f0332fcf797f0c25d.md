A man has been arrested following a police pursuit which took place around 10am today (7 January).

The pursuit, involving a grey Ford Focus, began on the A3 at Guildford following a routine stop check which established that the driver did not hold a valid driving licence. As officers approached the car, it made off.

Following a short pursuit, the driver ran off after abandoning the car on the carriageway on the A3. Officers used an incapacitant spray to try and stop the man but he continued running, eventually ending up in a wooded area in Stoke Road.

He was located shortly afterwards in the River Wey and was pulled from the water by officers.

Ambulance crews attended as a precaution but no one was injured during the incident.

Minor damage was caused to three other vehicles during the pursuit by the suspect's vehicle.

The man is currently in custody and the investigation remains ongoing.
