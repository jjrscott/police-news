A wanted man, who was last seen in Walton-On-Thames on May 27, has been arrested and recalled to prison.

Officers searching for 43 year old Lee Douglas Wall, who was wanted on recall to prison following a breach of his probation conditions, have arrested him in Walton on Thames. He will be recalled to prison.

We'd like to thank the media and public for their assistance in sharing our appeal.
