Surrey Police is investigating after a woman was sexually assaulted at a park in Haslemere.

The incident happened at some point between 4:20pm and 4:50pm today, at Lion Green, Haslemere.

The victim, who had been sitting on the green with friends, took a short walk into nearby woodland where a man approached her and groped her. She shouted at him and ran back to her friends, before calling police. We immediately flooded the area with officers, but were unable to find the man responsible.

Officers investigating the assault believe that the suspect may have been hanging around Lion Green for some time, and are keen to speak to anyone who was at Lion Green between 1pm and 5pm today and saw someone acting suspiciously. They are also keen to see any photos or video taken at Lion Green that includes people unknown to you (in the background), as you may have inadvertently captured a photo of the suspect.

Anyone who has information that they believe could assist the investigation is asked to call Surrey Police on 101, or use the "tell us about an existing case" function on the Surrey Police website, quoting reference PR/P20127535.

The public may notice an increased presence in the local area as officers continue their investigations.
