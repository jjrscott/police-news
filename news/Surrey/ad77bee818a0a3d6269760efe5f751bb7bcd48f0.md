Could we steal an hour of your time this December?

On 14, 15, 16 December, we're running three events on Facebook Live calles _Burglary Matters: A Conversation_. These will focus on the issue of burglary in Surrey - at a time of year where we know houses, businesses and communities are more vulnerable due to the longer periods of darkness, and the preparations for Christmas.

Our local policing teams and Designing Out Crime officers will be on hand from 18:00 - 19:00 to answer your questions around burglary and provide crime prevention advice. Help us to help you protect your homes and family.
