Did you see a hit and run on Farnborough Road yesterday evening (6 November)?

We are appealing for witnesses after a 52-year-old man was involved in a hit and run with a dark grey Mercedes (previously reported as white), where the car failed to stop on the scene.

The man was taken to hospital by Air ambulance where he is being treated for significant, life-threatening injuries.

Officers are continuing to carry out CCTV to identify where the vehicle may now be, and the route it took from the scene. The vehicle is believed to have significant damage to the windscreen.

If you have seen a Mercedes with recent damage to the windscreen or may have been asked to replace a damaged windscreen in the last 12 hours, or are suspicious of a person with access to a car matching the description and is behaving strangely, please contact us quoting incident number PR/P20258507 via:
