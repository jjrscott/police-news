We are appealing for witnesses following a robbery on the A30 London Road, Camberley in the early hours of Saturday, 15 February.

After leaving Tru Nightclub in Camberley the victim and three friends headed for McDonalds on the A30. At around 3.15am they were approached by the three suspects. One of them pushed the victim in the torso and told him to kneel on the floor and take off his shoes and watch. The suspects also assaulted the victim's friend causing him a suspected fracture on his little finger and a cut to his head. The items stolen are valued at between £1,400 and £1,500.

The three suspects are described as:

 * A white male, aged between 18 to 20, with black hair wearing a black North Face jacket and black jeans, on his jaw he had a 'beard' of spots. He has been described as 'very aggressive'.
 * The second suspect was a white male with round glasses wearing a black hoodie and dark blue jeans.
 * The third suspect was a white male with curly black hair. He was wearing a grey North Face jacket and black jeans.
