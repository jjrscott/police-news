A body, believed to be that of missing woman Karen King was found in a lake at Brickworks Newdigate earlier today.

Karen, 50 was reported missing yesterday evening. The discovery was made at around 3:30PM.

Although formal identification is yet to take place, Karen's family are aware and being given the appropriate support from specially trained officers. Our thoughts remain with them at this difficult time.

Enquiries are ongoing to establish the circumstances of the death, although it is not believed to be suspicious and there is no evidence of any third party involvement at this time.

We would like to thank everyone who shared our appeal and assisted with the search.
