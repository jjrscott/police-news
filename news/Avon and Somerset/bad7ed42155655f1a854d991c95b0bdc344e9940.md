Do you know these men?

We're asking for help to trace these two men as part of our investigation into a robbery in Castle Park, Bristol.

It happened at about 12.20am on Monday 22 July. The victim, a 25-year-old Chinese man, was walking alone through the park when four men surrounded him, knocking him to the ground.

They stole his wallet. His bank card was used later in a shop in Old Market and a number of other transactions.

The victim describes all four as slim black men aged between 18 and 20. One was riding a bicycle. Two were about 5ft 8ins tall while the other two were shorter.

The victim's nose and eye socket were fractured in the incident and he returned home over the summer.
