We’re appealing for information as to how a man sustained significant facial injuries in a Bridgwater car park.

A 73-year-old man was found injured on the floor of the Angel Place Shopping Centre car park shortly after 10am on 10 May.

He spent nearly two weeks in hospital receiving treatment for a fractures to his left eye socket and left cheek bone and extensive bruising to his face, left shoulder and right wrist.

PC Ryan Burr said: “We need help to establish what happened to this man as he can’t remember and unfortunately there’s no CCTV in the car park.

“Were you in the car park on the morning of 10 May?

“Did you see how the man came to be on the floor?

“Or did you see anyone acting suspiciously in the area at the time?”

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5219106104 **
