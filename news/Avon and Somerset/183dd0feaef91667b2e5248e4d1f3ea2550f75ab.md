We need help identifying the three men circled in the bottom left of the image

We’re releasing a CCTV image of three men we’d like to identify following an assault in Bath.

A 23-year-old man was attacked on Stall Street during the early hours of Friday, 12 April.

The victim was taken to hospital following the incident but thankfully only sustained bruising.

We’d like to speak to the men in the image as we believe they may have information which could help our inquiry.

We appreciate the image isn't great but we’re hoping someone may still be able to recognise one or all of those pictured.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5219079435 **
