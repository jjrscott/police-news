We're asking for help to trace a man called Anthony (Tony) Ford as part of an ongoing investigation.

Mr Ford lived in the Oldland Common area in the late 1970s and 1980s.

We believe he was well known in the area and worked in a clothes shop in Bath at that time.

If you know Anthony and can put officers in touch with him, or have any information which could help us contact him, get in touch quoting reference 5218213467.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5218213467 **

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
