Can you help?

We’re issuing CCTV images of a group of men who we’d like to speak in connection with a theft of gold ring of sentimental value on Anchor Road, Bristol.

The incident occurred on Sunday 7 July at around 2.30am the day after St Pauls Carnival (Saturday 6 July).

The victim made his way from a night club onto Anchor Road when he suffered a fit. A group of men (pictured) approached him and when he recovered the ring was missing.

If you recognise the people in the CCTV images or have any information which can help our investigation, please call 101 and quote the call handler reference number 5219153854.

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
