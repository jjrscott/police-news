We’re appealing for information and footage after a car was driven at a man in Bristol.

The incident happened sometime between 11am and 12pm yesterday on Hillside Road in St George.

A man driving a silver Vauxhall Insignia drove towards another motorist on three occasions, colliding with him twice, before driving away from the scene at speed on Air Balloon Road.

The victim attended hospital before later being discharged.

Detective Inspector Kristina Windsor said: “This incident could have been much worse and the victim was extremely lucky to escape with the injuries he did.

“It appears the offender has driven his vehicle deliberately at the victim after he got out of his car.

“If you witnessed the incident, or have any dashcam footage of it, please get in touch.”

A 22-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the incident and remains in police custody while enquiries continue.

Anyone who can help is asked to call 101 and provide the call handler with the reference 5219229697.

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
