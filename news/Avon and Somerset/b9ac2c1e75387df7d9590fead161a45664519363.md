A man from Wellington has been jailed for 10 years for child sexual offences.

Philip Hawkes, aged 55, who previously lived in Wellington, was handed the sentence at Bristol Crown Court on Tuesday (July 2) after pleading guilty at a first hearing. Hawkes will also be placed on the sexual offender register for life and be required to abide by Sexual Harm Prevention Order conditions.

Hawkes was charged with 32 offences relating to online grooming of teenage girls and inciting them to commit sexual acts and send him indecent images. He was also found in possession of numerous indecent images of children on his media devices.

Detective Sergeant Chris Jay said: â€œWe are committed to hunting down any person who uses the internet as a way to abuse children, or view or share indecent images of children.

"This conviction and sentence demonstrates that the police and courts will not tolerate this kind of behaviour."
