Weâ€™re appealing for help to trace two items of jewellery taken from Glastonbury.

The gold chain necklace and a diamond ring were taken from property in the Bove Town area on 21 June.

It happened during the daytime - between 11.50am-6pm.

The two items of jewellery and an iPad were taken during the burglary.

We are urging jewellers and second-hand shops to be vigilant.

We would also like to hear from anyone who is offered either to the items of jewellery.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5219139746 **

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
