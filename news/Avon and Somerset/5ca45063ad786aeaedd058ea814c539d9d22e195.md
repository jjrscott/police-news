Officers arrested three men on suspicion of theft and recovered two suspected stolen motorbikes in Bristol last night (Friday 18 October).

A member of the public called in to report a group of men loading two motorbikes onto a white Transit van in St Werburgh’s at about 8.30pm.

Officers located the van on Eastville roundabout and followed it onto the M32, where it drove the wrong way down the carriageway and left via the St Paul’s roundabout and into Pennywell Road, where it was abandoned. The occupants ran off and officers gave chase, detaining three people.

Three men, aged 27, 23 and 22, have been arrested on suspicion of theft and remain in custody. The van and two motorbikes were recovered.

We’d like to thank the member of the public who initially reported this incident to us. If anyone has information about the initial theft, or if anyone witnessed a white van driving along the M32 and Easton Way as described above, please call us on 101 and give the call handler the reference number 5219241836.
