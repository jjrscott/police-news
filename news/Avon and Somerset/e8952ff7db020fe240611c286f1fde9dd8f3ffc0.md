Lawrence Kemp

We're increasingly concerned for the welfare of Lawrence Kemp from Glastonbury who was reported missing on Monday night, 3 August.

He hasn't been in touch with family members since late on Saturday night, 1 August, and hasn't been into work, which is out of character.

Lawrence is 32 years old, white, about 170cm (5ft 8ins) tall and slim with a shaven head and a bushy brown beard. He has a tattoo on his right forearm and a tongue piercing.

The last confirmed sighting of him is in the early hours of Sunday 2 August in Chilkwell Street, Glastonbury, when he was wearing a blue checked shirt similar to that in the photo, over a pale blue T-shirt.

He has left home without his wallet, bank cards or cash.

He is believed to be using a red and black road bike which has a slim frame and tyres and curved handlebars. He is known to cycle to local wooded areas and beauty spots including Glastonbury Tor and Coombe Hill Woods near Street.

> Lawrence, if you see this, please call your family, or ring 101. We just want to know that you are safe.

If you know where Lawrence is now, call 999 quoting reference 5220174041, or ring 101 with any other information and the same reference number.
