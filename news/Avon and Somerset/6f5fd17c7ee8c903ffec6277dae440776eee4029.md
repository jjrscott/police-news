**Adam Cribben appeared at Taunton Crown Court earlier today (Thursday 5 September) and** **received a two-year community order.**

He is required to attend a 12 month drugs rehabilitation course, undertake 150 hours of unpaid work and has been placed on a 12 month GPS location tag.

Cribben, 38, from Taunton was charged with eight counts of burglary, five counts of fraud and possession of Class A drugs.

Cribben was arrested on 22 May after forensics linked him to a number of recent crimes.

He appeared at Taunton Magistrates Court on 26 July where he pleaded guilty to the 13 offences whilst admitting a significant number of other offences, which were considered in Court during sentencing yesterday.
