We'd like to reunite a Paslode Impulse Im350+ nail gun in an orange case with its rightful owner

A number of power tools recovered from a vehicle stopped by officers in Stoke Gifford have been returned to their rightful owners.

A blue Citroen Picasso using false registration plates was stopped on Coldharbour Lane on Sunday, 19 April.

The occupants of the vehicle initially fled the scene before a 30-year-old man from Newport was arrested on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle and theft from a motor vehicle.

He has since been released under investigation while further enquiries take place.

Enquiries to locate the other occupants are ongoing.

PC Ross Calderwood said: “We had a significant response from the public following this incident and I’m really pleased we’ve been able to return some of the tools to their owners.

“We do however still have one item which we’d like to return, a Paslode Impulse Im350+ nail gun in an orange case.

“Anyone who believes this may be theirs is asked to call 101 and provide the call handler with the reference 5219085288.”
