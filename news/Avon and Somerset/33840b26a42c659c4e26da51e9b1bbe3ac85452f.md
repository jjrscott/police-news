**We are asking members of the public for their help in identifying the man pictured in this CCTV image.**

We would like to identify and speak to this man who is wanted in connection with a burglary of a property in Bristol at around 6.30am on 7 July.

The man is suspected of stealing two credit cards and using them in a number of businesses in Bristol later that morning, specifically Tesco Metro on Marlborough Street, Sainsbury’s Local on Union Street, Sainsbury’s Local on Penn Street, and Shell on Newfoundland Street.

Anyone who recognises the man in the image is asked to call 101 and provide the call handler with the reference 5219153858.
