We believe we've identified a man we wanted to trace as part of an investigation into a hate crime, following a public CCTV appeal.

A man is due to be interviewed in connection with the incident, which happened at a supermarket in Coalpit Heath on Tuesday 20 October.

We'd like to thank everyone who got in touch with information or shared our appeal.
