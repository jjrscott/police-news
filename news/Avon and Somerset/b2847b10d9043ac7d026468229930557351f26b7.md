Appeal for witnesses

We’re appealing for witnesses following a fatal road traffic collision by Sampford Brett, Taunton on the A358. It occurred on Tuesday 9 July at 4.35pm.

A Mercedes Sprinter and a Honda Hornet 600c motorcycle were travelling in the same direction along the A358 when they were involved in a collision. The motorcyclist sadly died later in hospital.

We’re keen to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time of the incident who may have information to help our enquiries. If you can help, please contact us, quoting reference number 5219156175.

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
