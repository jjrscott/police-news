We’re releasing CCTV images of a number of men we’d like to speak to in connection with a GBH in Bristol.

A 21-year-old man was found unconscious by the ambulance service by the entrance to Bristol Aquarium on Anchor Square at 4am on Sunday, 1 September.

The victim was taken to Bristol Royal Infirmary where he was treated for a fractured skull and a bleed on the brain.

Investigating officer PC James Evans said: “We believe the victim may have been involved in a disagreement with a number of people prior to being assaulted.

“Whatever happened, there’s absolutely no justification for the violence used.

“We’re keen to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident who we haven’t yet spoken to as well as anyone who can tell us who the men in the CCTV images are.

“If you can help, please call us on 101 and give the call handler the reference 5219201194.”

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.
