We’re appealing for information after a man indecently exposed himself to a woman in Chard.

A 20-year-old woman was walking along a footpath near Tesco in Crewkerne Road at about 12.30pm on Friday (October 4), when she saw a man on a bike.

The man stopped and indecently exposed himself to the victim. He followed her for a short distance before riding off.

He’s described as white, with short black hair, mid-twenties, around 5ft 6ins, and was wearing a zip-up hooded top and blue jeans.

If you recognise this description, or have information which would help us identify this man, please call us on 101 and give the call handler the reference number 5219230102. You can also report information on our website here
