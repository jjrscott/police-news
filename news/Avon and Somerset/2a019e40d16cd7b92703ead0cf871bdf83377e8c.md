We’ve charged a 17-year-old boy in connection with the stabbing of a Bristol newsagent.

The teenager handed himself in at a police station in Cardiff late on Friday night following a nationwide appeal for information. He was then transferred to our custody yesterday.

He has been charged with Section 18 - attempted wounding with intent and possessing an offensive weapon in a public place.

Selthavas Murugesu, 49, was attacked at Bobbys Newsagents on Gloucester Road on Sunday, 18 August.

Detective Inspector Ben Lavender said: “I’d like to thank our colleagues at other police forces and the National Crime Agency for sharing our appeal far and wide.

“I’d also like to thank those members of the public who shared our appeal online and specifically those who called in with information, as well as the media who helped publicise it.”

The 17-year-old boy has been remanded in custody to appear before Bristol Magistrates’ Court tomorrow (Monday, 9 Sept).
