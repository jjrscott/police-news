We’re appealing for witnesses to come forward following an assault in Nailsea.

The incident happened outside Kebab Kitchen, Crown Glass Place on Saturday 5 September at around 12.10am.

The victim, a 19-year-old man, was eating his food when he was approached by a man described as white, in his late 40s to early 50s, who was bald, and wearing a pink or red shirt.

The offender punched him to the right cheek in an unprovoked attack, knocking him briefly unconscious and leaving him with facial injuries.

We’d like to hear from anyone who witnessed the attack. If you can help, call 101 quoting reference 5220203043 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5220203043 **

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
