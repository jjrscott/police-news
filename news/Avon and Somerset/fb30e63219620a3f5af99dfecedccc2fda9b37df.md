We have been granted a closure order for a property in Penel Orlieu in Bridgwater following numerous complaints from the community.

The flat, in Green Dragon Court, has had its occupant evicted and will remain sealed for at least the next three months thanks to the closure application made at North Somerset Magistrates' Court on Friday (May 10).

Residents in the area have reported that the property was being used by drug dealers and users as a base and that drug taking and supplying had spilled out into the stairwells and local area.

The community suffered multiple and frequent visitors to the property some only staying a short time, persons loitering outside the address and sometimes even disturbances involving shouting and screaming within the property and communal building.

We received reports of suspicious activity in and around the property, criminal damage at the premises and communal building, people leaving the address believed to be under the influence of drugs/alcohol, assaults on neighbours and even reports of weapons at the property

Cerwyn Pritchard, Somerset ASB Coordinator, said: “We welcome the court’s decision to grant this closure orders. Drug dealing and taking, and all the associated anti-social behaviour, significantly impacts people’s quality of life.

“Working very closely with the landlord Sanctuary Housing, the operators Sanctuary Supported living and rethink who all supported our closure application, we sought possession of this property in order to prevent any further anti-social behaviour in this neighbourhood.

“The conduct of this resident has had a detrimental effect on the health and wellbeing of his neighbours, to the point where some felt too afraid to continue living in the area. Many neighbours were often too afraid of reprisals to come forward as witnesses, so we would like to convey our gratitude to the anonymous witnesses who bravely came forward to take a stand against the anti-social behaviour where they live. Their statements were vital in allowing us to take action against this resident.

“The use and supply of drugs from an address can have a huge negative impact on those living nearby due to the anti-social behaviour that invariably comes with this type of criminality. The closure sets a clear reminder to members of the community that if they tell us about issues they will be dealt with to improve their quality of life and the area they live and work in.

“This will hopefully send a message to people that are allowing county lines drug dealers to operate or use their address that it will not be tolerated and action will be taken against them."
