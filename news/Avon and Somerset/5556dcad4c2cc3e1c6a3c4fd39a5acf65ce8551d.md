We're seeking witnesses after a car's tyres were slashed in the Redcliffe area of Bristol.

The incident happened between 11pm on Tuesday 2 March and 6am the following morning in Mede Close, leaving a white Nissan damaged.

However, we're still hoping to speak with anyone who saw somebody acting suspiciously in the area or may have relevant dashcam footage.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5221045437 **
