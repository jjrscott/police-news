We've made three arrests following a burglary at a doughnut stand in Burnham-on-Sea which happened at around 1.15am on Thursday 1 October.

Officers responded to a call from a member of the public who witnessed three men smashing the window of The Donut Kiosk on South Esplanade and stealing the till, before leaving the scene in a black Honda.

The car was later located by officers on Taunton Road, Bridgwater and the stolen property was recovered.

Three men aged 26, 42 and 50 have been arrested on suspicion of burglary and released under investigation. Enquiries are ongoing.

Investigating officer Suzanne Costello said: “We’d like to thank the member of the public who alerted us to the burglary, enabling us to take swift action and recover the stolen property."
