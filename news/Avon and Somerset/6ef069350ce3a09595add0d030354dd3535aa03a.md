Appeal for witnesses

Weâ€™re appealing for witnesses following a disorder in Yeovil.

A man on crutches was verbally abusive towards a woman and a man on Monday, 8 July at around 3.15pm at Milford School, Yeovil.

The verbal abuse continued as the group walked down Chelston Avenue onto St Georges Avenue.

During the incident a young girl was struck on the head.

A 46-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the incident and has since been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

If you were in the area at the time and saw anything, or you think you may have information that can help our investigation, please call 101 and quote reference number 5219155081.

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
