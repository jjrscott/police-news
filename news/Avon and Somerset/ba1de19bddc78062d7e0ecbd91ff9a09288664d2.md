A man wanted by Avon and Somerset Police in connection with an aggravated burglary in Bath was arrested in London yesterday, Monday 9 November.

We issued a public appeal to trace Kyle Purnell, 27, last month. He remains in police custody at the time of writing.

We'd like to thank everyone who got in touch with information or shared the appeal.
