Appeal for witnesses

We’re asking for the public’s help after a 51-year-old woman was robbed in Chard.

The incident happened in Henson Park between 10pm and 10.10pm on Thursday 13 June.

The victim was walking in a field and park near to the block of flats in Henson Park when two men started following her. She was punched in the face by one of the men, while the second man stole her bag before they both ran off. The woman suffered cuts and bruises to her face, neck and arm.

The bag was a brown suede shoulder bag with a black purse inside containing £20 in cash, bank cards and a driver’s licence.

Both men are described as being around 5ft 9ins and they were wearing black hoodies and blue jeans.

If you can help with this inquiry, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number 5219132659.

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
