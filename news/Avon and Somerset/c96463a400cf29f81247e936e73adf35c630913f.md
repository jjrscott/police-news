Weâ€™re appealing for witnesses and information following an assault that took place at the Newbridge Fuel Express Site on Newbridge Road, Bath on 22 February 2021 at around 15.50pm.

The victim, a woman in her 50s, was spat at three times and verbally abused after confronting a male driver who allegedly cut her up at the petrol station.

The offender is described as a white male in his 20s or 30s, wearing a green hat with short blonde hair. He arrived at the scene in a grey VW Golf.

We would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident or who can help identify the offender.
