We’re releasing CCTV images of a man we’d like to speak to following a GBH in Bristol.

A man in his 40s sustained a broken jaw after he was punched in the face by a man outside the Wackum Inn on Whitehall Road.

The incident happened at around 11pm on 11 August.

We appreciate the images aren’t great but hope the man, or anyone who thinks they might know him, contacts us.

Anyone who can help is asked to call 101 and provide the call handler with the reference 5219184793.

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
