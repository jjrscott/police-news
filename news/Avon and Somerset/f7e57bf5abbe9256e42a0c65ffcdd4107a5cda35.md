North Wales Police have arrested a prisoner who absconded from HMP Leyhill.

Ronan Korby failed to return to the open prison in South Gloucestershire from a work placement in Bristol on Friday 31 May.

He was sighted in Rhyl on Sunday 2 June and was arrested in Bangor on Monday 3 June.

We'd like to thank everyone who shared our appeal to trace him.
