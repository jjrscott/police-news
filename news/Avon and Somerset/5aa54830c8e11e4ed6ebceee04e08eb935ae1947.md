Do you know this man?

We’re issuing an E-fit of a man we want to identify following a distraction burglary in Stoke-sub-Hamdon.

The victim, a woman in her 70s, was distracted by a man who stopped outside her address in a grey coloured car while she was gardening sometime between 2pm and 3pm on Wednesday, 1 May.

At the same time, a second person has entered her home through a back door and stolen black handbag containing a purse and a number of sentimental items.

The man who spoke to the victim is described as white, approximately 5ft 9ins tall, of medium build with brown eyes and short brown hair.

**There are two main tactics used by distraction burglars:**

• Distracting a householder on the doorstep or in the garden, while an accomplice enters the house to steal
• Claiming to be from a utility company needing to urgently check water supply or electrics to get into a house

**Our doorstep crime prevention tips include:**

• Never open the door to an unexpected caller until you’ve checked their identification – use a door chain or viewer. Genuine callers expect it
• If you’re not sure, don’t open the door
• If you’re suspicious of a caller tell us straight away - ring 999 if you feel threatened or intimidated, otherwise call 101
• Keep your cash in the bank, not at home
• Keep windows and doors secured if you’re not in the room
• If you see someone calling door-to-door, but only on frail or elderly neighbours, call 999 straight away
• Join Neighbourhood Watch

If you recognise the man in the E-fit, please call us on 101 and give the call handler the reference number **5219095382**.
