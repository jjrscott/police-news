A teenager from South Petherton has been safely found.

Olivia Henry was met by Avon and Somerset Police officers at Bristol Temple Meads station this morning (Thursday 30 July).

We'd like to thank everyone who assisted with our appeal this week and provided information as part of the investigation.
