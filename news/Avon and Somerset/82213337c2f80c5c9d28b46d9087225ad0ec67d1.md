We’ve charged a 33-year-old man following an incident in which alleged homophobic abuse was directed at people taking part in the first Yeovil Pride.

Stefan Vasile, of Higher Kingston, has been charged with a public order offence relating to the use of homophobic language.

He’s also been charged with assaulting an emergency worker after an officer was struck in the face while dealing with the incident.

Vasile has been released on bail to appear before Yeovil Magistrates’ Court on 17 September.
