We’re appealing for witnesses following a collision in Chilcompton in which a pedestrian died.

A car was in collision with a woman in her 70s at around 2.50pm on Friday on the B3139 Wells Road, close to the junction with Stockhill Road. The car had left the road and went onto a pavement.

The victim was taken to Southmead Hospital with serious injuries but sadly died overnight.

We’re specifically appealing for the driver of a silver/grey Vauxhall Astra who was travelling behind the vehicle involved, to come forward, as well as any other witnesses.

If you have information, please call the Collision Investigation Unit on 101 and give the call handler the reference number 5219115288
