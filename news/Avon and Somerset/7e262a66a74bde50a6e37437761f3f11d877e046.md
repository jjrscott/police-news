We're investigating a reported public order offence where a customer made off from a phone shop in Taunton without paying.

The incident happened at about 4.45pm on Friday 14 February at a store in Fore Street.

Two customers entered the shop and asked for a phone to be repaired. When one of the males returned to pick up the repaired item, he left without paying.

A 45-year-old man has attended a voluntarily interview in connection with our enquiries.

CCTV enquiries have been carried out and reveal an image of a male we wish to speak to in connection with our ongoing investigation.

He is described as young with dark clothing and wearing a distinctive orange baseball cap.

Anyone with information about who the man is, should get in touch by calling 101 and giving reference number 5220037235.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5220037235 **
