We're appealing for witnesses and information after a cyclist was injured in a collision on Harp Road, Brent Knoll at around 9.40am on Friday 31 July.

The driver of the vehicle, which is described as a silver / grey Honda, failed to stop following the collision.

The vehicleâ€™s door mirror was broken off in the impact and the woman suffered injuries which were treated by paramedics at the scene.
