Jane Robertson from Stoke Gifford, who went missing after being dropped off in Bristol on Tuesday 30 July, has been found.

Thankfully, family members found her and flagged down officers on Thursday afternoon, 1 August. She went to hospital for assessment.

We'd like to thank everyone who shared our appeal.
