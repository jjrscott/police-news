We’re appealing for witnesses and information after a woman was found injured in a Bristol park.

A member of the public found the woman, aged in her 50s, with a head injury in St George’s Park at about 7.30pm on Friday (6 September).

It’s believed she had been assaulted.

The woman was taken to hospital where she received treatment.

It’s thought a number of people may have filmed the incident and we’re particularly keen to speak to them and view their footage.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5219206024 **

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
