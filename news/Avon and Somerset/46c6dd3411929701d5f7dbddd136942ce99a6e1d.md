Stock image of bag snatch

We're appealing for witnesses and information after a vulnerable woman had her handbag snatched in Weston-Super-Mare.

It happened between 12.40 and 12.50pm on Saturday 21 September in a lane between Locking Road and Sandford Road.

A man cycled up behind the woman, who walks with a stick. He grabbed her bag and rode off towards Mendip Road. He was black, of large build and wore a white baseball cap.

There may have been a second cyclist in the area at the time. We'd like to hear from that person.

If you have any information which could help get in touch quoting reference 5219218618.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5219218618 **

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
