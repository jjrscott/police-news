**A woman and a teenage boy have been charged with drugs supply offences in Bath.**

Kelly Dowding, 37, from Bath has been charged with possession with intent to supply Class A drugs whilst a 16 year old boy from London has been charged with two counts of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs and possession of Class B drugs.

Both individuals were arrested on Monday by officers who had observed a suspicious incident at Griffin Court in Trinity Close, Bath.

Miss Dowding appeared at Bath Magistrates Court yesterday (Tuesday 6 August) where she pleaded not guilty. She has been released on conditional bail and is next due to appear at Bristol Crown Court on 30 August.

The 16 year old boy is due to appear at Bath Magistrates Court later today.
