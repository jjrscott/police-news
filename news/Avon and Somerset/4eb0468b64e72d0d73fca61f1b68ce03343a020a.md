**We’d like the public to help us identify the man in this E-fit image who we want to speak to about a burglary at a house on Tylers Lane in Staple Hill, Bristol.**

On Saturday (19 Oct) evening between 8pm-8.30pm, an elderly woman has answered her door to an unknown man who has then pushed his way into the victim’s hallway. A second man also entered the property, stealing a wallet from a male victim before searching upstairs and leaving with the female victim’s handbag and jewellery box.

Whilst the second man was searching the property, the first man remained with the female victim including restraining her from leaving and smashing her mobile phone on the floor.

The Efit is of the first man who can be described as white, between 5’8 – 5’9 tall, aged between 30 and 40, of slight build with light brown hair and of scruffy appearance wearing a beige anorak.

The second man, not pictured, can be described as white, around 6’ tall, of similar age to the first man, of solid/strong build with light brown hair and was wearing a black quilted coat and black hat pulled down to his eyes and.

If you know the identity of the man in the Efit or recognise the description of both men, please call us on 101 and give the call handler the reference number 5219242460, or report information online via our Force website.
