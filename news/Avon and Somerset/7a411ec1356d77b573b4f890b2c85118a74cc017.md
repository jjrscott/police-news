Officers investigating after a woman's moped was stolen and crashed in Clevedon, want to thank everyone who got in touch following a public appeal to identify two people they were hoping to trace.

We believe we have now identified two teenagers who were in Tesco car park at around the time the stolen moped was seen there.

The woman used the blue Lex Moto moped to travel to work as a carer. It was stolen overnight Monday 20 to Tuesday 21 July from Sunnyside Road, Clevedon.

At 3.45am on Tuesday the vehicle was seen being ridden in the car park of Tesco, Clevedon. Just under an hour later a witness called to report it crashed in Corner Croft, damaging a fence.

Attending officers found two injured teenage boys nearby. The boys, both aged under 17, required hospital treatment to fractures not believed life-threatening or life-changing. They are due to be interviewed by officers.

The investigation continues. If you have any information which could help, call 101 quoting reference 5220161660.

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
