We’re releasing CCTV images of 10 people we would like to identify as part of an investigation into a serious assault.

At just after 3am on Saturday 23 March, two people were assaulted in the Halls Road area of Kingswood.

The victims had just left Chasers nightclub in Regent Street when they were followed and attacked.

A 22-year-old man was punched in the face several times and kicked in the head after falling to the floor. He suffered injuries including a fractured jaw.

A 21-year-old woman was punched in the face during the same incident and suffered facial injuries.

We’re trying to trace 10 people who may have information about this incident.

An 18-year-old man has already been arrested on suspicion of wounding with intent and has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

If you are any of the people in the CCTV images, or if you know who they are, please call PC Tamsin Carter on 101 and give the call handler the reference number 5219068552.
