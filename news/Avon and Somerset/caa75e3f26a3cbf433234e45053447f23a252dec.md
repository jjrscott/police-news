A man's come forward after our CCTV appeal for information about a robbery in Bristol.

The offence happened between 11.30pm and midnight on Sunday 26 May in an alleyway off College Green.

A 23-year-old man was robbed of his wallet, watch and chain, suffering cuts and bruising. His bank cards were later used in shops in Broad Quay and Old Market. The robbery suspects are both black, in their early 20s, about 6ft 1ins tall and wearing dark-coloured clothing.

We're grateful to everyone who shared the appeal and will be arranging to speak with the man who voluntarily came forward.
