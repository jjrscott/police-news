**We have arrested a 26 year old man from Weston-super-Mare on suspicion of burglary.**

It follows an incident on 12th July in which a number of motor cross helmets, trousers and body armour were reported to have been stolen from a property on Birnbeck Road in Weston-super-Mare and were being advertised on Facebook.

The man has since been released under investigation and the stolen items are being returned to the original owners.
