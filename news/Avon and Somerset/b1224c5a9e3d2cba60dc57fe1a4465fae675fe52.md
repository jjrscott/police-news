We’re appealing for dash cam footage of a road traffic collision in the Bath area.

The two vehicle collision happened on the A367 at Dunkerton Hill at about 10.50am on 2 October.

A black Mazda MX5 was travelling up Dunkerton Hill towards Peasedown St John when it was in collision with a black Mitsubishi L200, which was travelling in the opposite direction and down the hill towards Bath.

The driver of the Mazda suffered life changing injuries in the incident and remains in Southmead Hospital.

The two occupants of the Mitsubishi were treated for cuts and bruises at the RUH in Bath.

We’re keen to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time of the incident, especially anyone who may have dash cam footage of the incident.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5219227735 **
