Can you help?

**We are appealing for help identifying three men in connection with an incident in the Kingswood area of Bristol.**

We want to speak to the men in the CCTV image following an affray in Regent Street in Kingswood earlier today (Friday 12 July), at about 3.15am.

The victim, aged 33, suffered a fractured cheek bone and four fractures to his upper jaw.

The three males are white and believed to be in their late teens to early twenties.

If you can help identify the three males in the CCTV image or you were in the area at the time and saw anything which can help with our investigation, please call 101 and quote reference number 5219104706.

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
