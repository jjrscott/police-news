Weâ€™re appealing for information following a robbery in Taunton.

The incident happened on a path between Lisieux Way and Calvados Road at around 11pm on Friday, 5 July.

A 31-year-old man was approached by two men, who asked him for a lighter before punching him in the face, knocking him unconscious. When he awoke, he found his phone had been stolen.

The two men were aged in their 20s or early 30s. One of them is said to have been wearing a white hoody.

If you witnessed anything suspicious in the area at the time, or have any other information which could help our inquiry, please phone 101 and provide the call handler with the reference 5219152980.

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
