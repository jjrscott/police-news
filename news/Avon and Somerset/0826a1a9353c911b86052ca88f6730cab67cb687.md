Yesterday (Tuesday, 8 December), we issued an appeal after a man was seen being dragged into a vehicle in the Staple Hill area of Bristol on Sunday.

We’ve since established he circumstances of the incident and no longer need the public’s assistance.

We’d like to thank all those who shared our appeal and who called us with information.
