We’re appealing for dash cam or mobile phone footage following two road traffic incidents in Somerset.

The first incident happened on 30 April on the A371 in Westbury-sub-Mendip. A black Vauxhall Vectra swerved onto the opposite side of the road into the path of a black Toyota Rav4 at about 8.340am. The vehicles did not actually collide.

On 7 May the same vehicles were parked in Station Road in Cheddar (opposite the Tesco store).

An argument occurred between the passenger in the Toyota and the driver of the Vauxhall.

It is alleged that the Vectra then tailgated the Toyota, which left Cheddar, travelling along the A371 into Wells, via the villages of Draycott, Rodney Stoke, Westbury-sub-Mendip and Easton. Reports suggest that the Vectra was speeding up behind the Toyota and beeping its horn during the course of the journey.

We’re keen to hear from anyone who may have seen either of the incidents above and captured either of them on a car dash cam or on a mobile phone.
