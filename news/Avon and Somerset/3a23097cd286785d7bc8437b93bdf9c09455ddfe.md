**Kevin Hutton, 43, of no fixed address is due at South Somerset Magistrates Court later today (Tuesday 22 October) charged with drugs supply and knife possession offences.**

Hutton is charged with two counts of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs, possession of a knife, possession of Class A drugs, and failing to comply with a Community Protection Notice.

Hutton was arrested yesterday (Monday 21 October) and charged in connection with an incident in which officers detained and searched a man having identified him acting suspiciously on Newton Road in Yeovil.

Following a search, a man was found in possession of a number of wraps of Class A drugs suspected to be heroin and crack cocaine, and a lock knife.
