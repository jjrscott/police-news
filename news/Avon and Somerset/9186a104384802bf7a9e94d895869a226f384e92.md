 * 01 Aug 2020: Two arrested in Bristol racially aggravated assault inquiry

A fourth man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder in connection with an incident in Bristol in which a man suffered serious injuries after being struck by a car.

The 23-year-old was detained yesterday (Monday, 3 August) and has since been released under investigation.

The arrest comes as two 18-year-old men and a 22-year-old man were also released under investigation after being arrested during the weekend.

All four were arrested in connection with an incident involving a 21-year-old man on Monks Park Avenue, Horfield on 22 July.

The incident is being treated as a racially-aggravated attack due to the racist language used by the occupants of the car.

Supt Andy Bennett said: “The dedicated team investigating this incident are committed to carrying out a thorough investigation and I hope this arrest provides further reassurance to the victim and the wider community about how seriously we’re treating this incident.”
