We’re appealing for your help to find the man pictured.

We believe he may be able to help us with our enquiries into a sexual assault in Weston-super-Mare on the morning of 22 September.

The incident happened between 6.15-6.30am. It is possible that an incident may have happened earlier that morning when another woman was approached in the Meadow Street area.

We’re keen to speak to the man pictured, who we believe was in the resort at the time the incidents happened and who may have information to help our enquiries.

We’d like the man or anyone recognising him to contact us.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5219220464 **

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
