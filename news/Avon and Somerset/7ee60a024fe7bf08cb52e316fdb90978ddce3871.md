We arrested a wanted man on Monday night, 16 November, following a public appeal to trace him.

Mantas Strole was wanted in connection with an aggravated burglary in Radstock in August.

He was arrested from an address in Whiteway, Bath, and remains in police custody at the time of writing.

We'd like to thank everyone who shared our appeal or contacted us with information.
