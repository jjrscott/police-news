Two men are due in court today, Monday 5 October, charged with drug offences.

Carlington Richards, 38 of Stockwood, Bristol, and Nathan Rollock, 39, of Lambeth, London, are both due before Bristol Magistrates charged with possession with intent to supply cocaine and possessing criminal property, namely cash. Carlington Richards is also charged with possessing an offensive weapon, a baton, in public.

Both men were arrested in an intelligence-led police operation in Bristol and on the M4 in Wiltshire on Saturday 3 October.

Officers have seized 350g of cocaine and a significant amount of cash.
