Do you know the man in this E-fit image?

Weâ€™d like the public to help us identify the man in this E-fit image who we want to speak to about a burglary at a church in Bristol.

A man broke into Tyndale Baptist Church, in Whiteladies Road, between 8pm and 8.30pm on Tuesday (September 3) while slimming class was taking place.

The man stole a handbag belonging to a woman taking part in the class but he was challenged by the victim and made off before he could steal any more items.

The man in the E-fit is described as white, between 6ft 2ins and 6ft 3ins, somewhere between 45 and 60 years old, of slight build, with mousey brown hair which was curly at the sides. He was wearing navy work overalls.

If you know who this man is, please call us on 101 and give the call handler the reference number 5219203442, or report information online here
