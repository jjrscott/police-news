We're carrying out an investigation after a woman died in a two-vehicle collision on the A370 near Lympsham last night.

The collision, between a car and a lorry, happened at about 5.30pm near the Ferry Lane junction with the A370, close to Hobbs Boat Inn.

The occupant of the car – a woman in her 40s – was seriously injured in the collision and sadly died shortly afterwards.

The road was closed while collision investigators examined the scene but re-opened at around 7am today.

If you witnessed this collision, or have information which could help us, please call the Collision Investigation Unit on 101 and give the call handler the reference number 5219105250.
