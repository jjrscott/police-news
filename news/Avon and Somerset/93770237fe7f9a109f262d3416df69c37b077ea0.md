We're asking for information after lighted packages were thrown onto the roof of a wooden bungalow in Glenmore Road, Minehead.
​
It happened at about 11.45pm on Friday 31 May. Thankfully the householders heard the objects land on the roof and the fire went out before any damage was caused.

We think the items were thrown from a lane behind the property.
​
Officers have carried out house-to-house enquiries in the area and the householders are being given home security advice.
​
If you saw anything suspicious in the area or have any other information which could help, get in touch, quoting reference 5219121255.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5219121255 **

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
