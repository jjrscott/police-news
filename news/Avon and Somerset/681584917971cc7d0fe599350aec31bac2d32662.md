Our neighbourhood officers have reported a 15-year-old boy for summons over damage at a Bristol community centre.

Ten windows and a CCTV camera were smashed at the Greenway Centre, Doncaster Road, Southmead, over the weekend Saturday 27 to Monday 29 June.

The teenager has also been referred to the Youth Offending Panel.
