Picture of forklifts stolen

We’re appealing for witnesses following the theft of forklift trucks from a company premises in Patchway.

The incident happened overnight between 6pm on 26 July and 9am on 27 July.

Entry was forced into the premises in Britannia Road and six forklift trucks were taken.

It is likely that the transport, such as a low loader, is likely to have been used to transport the forklift trucks from the area.

We’re keen to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time of the incident or anyone who may have seen forklift trucks being moved overnight in the area.

If you are able to help or have any information which could help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number 5219171725

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
