**Mark Anthony Glover has been sentenced to three years in prison for burglary.**

Glover, 41 of Specklemead in Paulton, Bristol was sentenced earlier today (16 September) at Taunton Crown Court where he admitted a burgling a hotel in Somerset.

He was charged with and admitted a burglary at Ston Easton Park Hotel in Ston Easton on 4 July where photographic and computer equipment to the value of around £10,000 were stolen.

Glover also admitted two further burglaries; a burglary at Charlton House on 7 July in which two handbags were stolen from a room and one of the stolen bank cards was used to withdraw £500 from an ATM in Midsomer Norton; and a burglary at Babington House in 2018 in which two laptops and a handbag were stolen. These were taken into consideration during sentencing.

Glover was arrested on 15 August after a DNA match found at the Ston Easton crime scene linked him to the offence. He appeared at Yeovil Magistrates Court on 16 August charged with a burglary at Ston Easton and was remanded in custody until his appearance at Taunton Crown Court earlier today.
