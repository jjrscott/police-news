We need your help to contact the man pictured.

We believe he may have valuable information to help our enquiries into a stranger rape in Bristol. It happened on 6 September in the Kingsdown area of the city.

The victim had been with her friends on a night out when she became separated from them.

She decided to make her way home when she met a man and they went for a drink at the Lola Lo Bar. The assault happened afterwards.

Weâ€™re keen to trace the man pictured, who we believe, may have information to help our enquiries.

Anyone able to help is asked to contact us quoting reference 5219205383

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5219205383 **

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
