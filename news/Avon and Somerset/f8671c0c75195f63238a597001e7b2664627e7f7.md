We’re appealing for witnesses following the death of a woman following a road traffic collision in Wells.

The collision happened at about 11.55am at the junction of B3139 and B3135 at Hendon on 25 August.

A Skoda Fabia was being driven southbound on the B3139 and a Mercedes was travelling in the opposite direction.

As the Skoda was turning right towards the westbound junction of the B3135, the Mercedes was in collision with the Skoda.

The woman passenger in the Skoda was taken to Southmead Hospital with life threatening spinal injuries.

Sadly she died three days later.

We’re appealing for witnesses who may have been in the area at the time, particularly anyone who may have Dash Cam footage of the incident.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5219195919 **
