Can you help?

We’re investigating a burglary at the Co-op in Fore Street, Wellington, which happened just after 1am today.

A 4×4 vehicle pulled up to the store and around five offenders got out and smashed the front windows, before attempting to steal the cashpoint by attaching it to the vehicle. This failed and the vehicle was left embedded in the store. The offenders then ran off along South Street by foot.

A police helicopter was involved in a search of the area for the offenders but they were not located.

The scene has been cordoned off to allow for further enquiries today.

If anyone has information which could help our investigation, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number 5219151047.
