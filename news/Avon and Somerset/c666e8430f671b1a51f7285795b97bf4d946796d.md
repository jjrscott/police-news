The family of Hassan Hagi have released a tribute following the conviction of Mahamud Osman for his murder.

The tribute reads: “We are still at a loss and deeply saddened by the loss of Hassan.

“This trial may be over today, but our pain and the nightmare of losing Hassan to this horrific murder is far from over.

“We cannot imagine the pain and the suffering of this loss has caused to our parents and indeed, we cannot and will never comprehend the amount violence and physical trauma that Hassan suffered in the hands of this evil man.

“Hassan was a very kind, gentle and extremely generous soul. He had a tremendous impact on our lives, especially in the lives of his much beloved younger cousins, whom he had spent a great deal of time and care.

“His life was taken away from us and nothing will ever fill the void that it has left behind.

“We love Hassan and he was very much loved by everyone. We pray that when justice is served, it will prevent this evil man from committing another heinous crime again.

“Hassan was an honest, respectful and very charismatic person. We will miss him more than words can ever express.”
