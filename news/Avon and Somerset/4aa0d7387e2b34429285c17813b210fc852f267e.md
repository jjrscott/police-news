We’re seeking witnesses to a collision between a car and a motorbike yesterday morning (Tuesday 30 June).

It happened at about 9.45am on the A37 Dorchester Road, close to Netherton Lane, near Yeovil.

A black Yamaha motorcycle and a white Fiat Panda were involved.

The motorcyclist, a man in his 20s, was taken to hospital. He is said to be in a critical, but stable, condition.

The road was closed while emergency services treated him and collision investigators carried out enquiries at the scene. It reopened at 4.15pm yesterday.

PC Owen Davies said: “We’re keen to speak to anyone who saw what happened or was travelling in the area and may have dashcam footage that could assist us with our enquiries.

“We’d like to thank everyone for their patience while we were on the scene.”

Anyone with information can call 101 and give reference 5220143316.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5220143316 **
