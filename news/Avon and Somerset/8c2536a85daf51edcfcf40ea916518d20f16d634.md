We’ve charged two people with the murder of a five-week-old boy in 2018.

James Dean Clark, 31, of Warmley and Helen Jeremy, 26, of Kingswood, have also been charged with causing or allowing the death of a child.

They remain in police custody and will appear at Bristol Magistrates’ Court later today (Tuesday, 17 November).

The charges relate to the death of Sean Clark who died at an address in Warmley on 14 January 2018.
