Do you know this woman?

We're keen to speak to this woman as part of our enquiries into an incident involving theft, dangerous driving and failing to stop.

It happened just before 6.30pm on Friday 20 September at Lidl in Whitchurch Lane, Bishopsworth. A store security guard and a special constable were trying to speak to three people about the theft of alcohol from the shop.

Officers detained a woman on suspicion of theft and assaulting an emergency worker. She was released under investigation. Two other people left the scene in a car. The security guard was knocked to the ground as they drove off. Thankfully he did not need hospital treatment.

If you recognise the woman or saw the incident, get in touch quoting reference 5219218097.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5219218097 **

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
