Police are keen to hear from anyone who witnessed a collision which happened on the northbound carriageway of the M5 yesterday evening (Thursday 10 September) involving two vehicles.

At about 7.37pm a burgundy Ford Fiesta approaching the Junction 18a Avonmouth offslip for the M49 crossed a number of lanes and collided with a Ford Transit campervan before hitting the hard shoulder bridge barrier.

The driver of the Fiesta, a 33-year-old man from Bristol was taken to Southmead Hospital with serious injuries. A 16-year-old female passenger was treated for minor injuries.

The northbound carriageway was closed while officers carried out enquiries at the scene. The road was fully re-opened by 3.40am.

Weâ€™d like to hear from anyone who saw the collision or who witnessed the driving of the Ford Fiesta leading up to the incident.
