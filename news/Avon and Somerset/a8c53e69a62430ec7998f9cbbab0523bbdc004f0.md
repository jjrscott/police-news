We're appealing for independent witnesses to an altercation between two men in Lower Queens Road, Clevedon.

It happened between about 3.30 and 4pm on Monday 21 September and involved a man who uses a mobility scooter and another man who was unloading boxes from a car.

The street, near the Jet Shoes shop, was busy with people at the time.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5220221311 **
