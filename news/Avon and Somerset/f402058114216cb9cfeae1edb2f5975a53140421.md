CCTV still

We’re releasing CCTV footage and images (below) of men we’d like to identify in connection to an incident in which a 37-year-old man was seriously injured in Bristol.

The victim was found unconscious in an archway off College Green at about 1.30am on Sunday 9 June. His mobile phone and wallet had been stolen and his bank card later used fraudulently in stores in Bristol city centre and Stokes Croft.

He was taken to hospital after suffering a fractured skull and a bleed on the brain, but has since been discharged.

One man has been voluntarily interviewed about this incident and enquiries are ongoing.

If you know any of the men in the footage or the images, please call us on 101 and give the call handler the reference number 5219128233.
