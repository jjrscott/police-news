We're asking the public to contact us if they see Alan, 57

Can you help us trace Alan, missing from his home in Bedminster Down, Bristol?
Alan, 57, is described as white, about 5ft 10ins tall and stocky with short grey hair and a goatee beard.

We're concerned for Alan's welfare. He hasn't responded to messages from friends since 19 January. When they called on his home they found he had left without his personal property and reported him missing yesterday, Saturday 23 January.

Alan may be using public transport and has possibly travelled to the Glastonbury area.

If you know where Alan is now, please call 999 quoting reference 5221016375.

If you have any other information about his whereabouts, call 101 and give the same reference.

Alan, if you see this, people care about you and are worried. Please get in touch.
