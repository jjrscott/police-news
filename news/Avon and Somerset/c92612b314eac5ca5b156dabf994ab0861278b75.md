We’re appealing for witnesses to come forward following an assault that happened outside Snob on High Street, Wellington on Monday 28 September at around 6.25pm.

The victim, a man in his 30s, was pushed from his bike by a man who then tried repeatedly to punch him in the face.

It’s thought that the suspect may have been in a nearby pub on North Street shortly prior to the incident.

The suspect is described as a man aged around 40 years old and we believe this was an isolated incident. Local CCTV is being reviewed as part of our enquiries.
