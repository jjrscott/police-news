We’re keen to hear from motorists who may have seen an incident on the M5 motorway in North Somerset.

It happened on 12 August at about 1.20pm on the southbound carriageway, between junctions 19-20 (the split-level section between Gordano and Clevedon).

A silver coloured VW Passat taxi was in collision with the rear of a grey Audi Q3 in lane three in heavy traffic.

The taxi driver said that he was distracted, causing him to collide with the other vehicle.

We’re keen to hear from anyone who was travelling southbound who may have captured the incident on a dash-cam camera, or may have seen the incident and have information to help our enquiries.
