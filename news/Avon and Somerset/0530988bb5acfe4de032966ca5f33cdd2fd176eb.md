We're calling for witnesses, CCTV and dashcam footage from Lake Road, Southmead, after several vehicles were deliberately set on fire at around 3am on Saturday 05 September.

Several cars and an unoccupied caravan were set alight, with the flames spreading to cause extensive damage to the front of a nearby house. Thankfully no one was hurt, but given the time of night this act endangered the lives of the householders.

If you saw anyone behaving suspiciously in the area, have anything captured on CCTV or dashcam or have any other information, police want to hear from you.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5220201303 **

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
