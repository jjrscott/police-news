A third man has been arrested by officers investigating the murder of 29-year-old Andre Gayle in Bristol on Bank Holiday Monday.

Andre Gayle died in hospital on Wednesday after being injured during an incident near Easton Community Centre at about 3.15am on Monday 31 August. A forensic post-mortem examination concluded he’d suffered multiple stab wounds which led to his death.
