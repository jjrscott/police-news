We’re appealing for witnesses following a fatal collision on the A38 near Wellington yesterday.

The incident happened shortly before 1pm on the hill near to the Beambridge Inn and involved a car and a lorry. The car appears to have gone underneath the lorry.

The driver of the car – a man - suffered serious injuries and sadly died shortly afterwards.

The lorry driver was taken to the Musgrove Park Hospital – his injuries are not believed to be life changing or life threatening.

The road was closed to allow an examination by collision investigators.

We’re keen to hear from anyone who was travelling along the A38 around the time of the incident who may have information to help our enquiries.

We would also like to hear from anyone who may have had a dash cam working at the time.
