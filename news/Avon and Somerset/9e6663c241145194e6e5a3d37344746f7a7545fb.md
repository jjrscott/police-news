We’re appealing for witnesses after a woman was assaulted in Bristol.

The victim, aged in her 30s, was attacked by three women on Mowcroft Road, near to Hartcliffe Methodist Church, at around 4.30pm on Wednesday, 28 August.

She suffered significant facial injuries for which she required 14 stitches at hospital.

The offenders travelled to and from the incident in a black car.

Three women aged 21, 33 and 35 respectively have been arrested on suspicion of GBH and have since been released on police bail.

Investigating officer, PC Gabriela Hatter, said: “This was a violent assault in which three women deliberately targeted their victim.

“They left her with some quite nasty injuries and we’re keen to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident who we haven’t yet spoken with.

“It’s believed a number of people filmed the incident on their phones and we’d also be particularly interested in viewing their footage.”
