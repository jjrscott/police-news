Overturned lorry on the M32

The M32 outbound has been closed overnight after a livestock transporter overturned.

Officers were called to the scene at the junction with the M4 just after 12.10am on Wednesday 19 June. The lorry driver was injured and 190 pigs were trapped in the vehicle. A vet came to the scene as soon as possible. They were consulted to ensure the animals' welfare at all times.

The lorry driver was freed from the cab and taken to hospital at about 1am with injuries which are not believed life-threatening or life-changing. The M4 was closed with a rolling roadblock while the lorry was righted, using specialist lifting equipment, at 4am. The damaged vehicle was then moved off the motorway so that the livestock could be safely released, treated and transferred to another transporter. This is still ongoing and sadly some of the animals have died.

This has been a distressing incident for everyone involved. Throughout, decisions have been made to prevent further incident or injury to members of the travelling public and with animal welfare in mind.

The M32 outbound has one lane closed pending repairs.
