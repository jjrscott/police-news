We've arrested a man wanted on recall to prison.

Officers arrested Lee Gardner, 37, of no fixed abode, in Jamaica Street, Bristol at 6.30pm on Sunday 22 September. He has now been transferred to the prison service.

We'd like to thank everyone who called with information or shared our appeal to trace him.
