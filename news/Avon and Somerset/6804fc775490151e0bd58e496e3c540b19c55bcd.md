 * 15 Jul 2019: Man arrested for indecency offences following series of incidents in Claverham/ Yatton area

We’ve arrested a second man in connection with a series of incidents in the Claverham/ Yatton area.

Since November last year, we’ve received 14 reports of a man approaching people while wearing disguises, one of which was a black body suit.

In some of the incidents the offender is said to have performed indecent acts.

The man, aged in his 30s, was arrested this afternoon on suspicion of indecency offences and he is currently in police custody.

The arrest comes after a man in his 20s arrested yesterday was earlier released on police bail.

Inquiries into the incidents are ongoing.
