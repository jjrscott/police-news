Two men who were arrested on suspicion of causing an explosion following an incident in Worle on Tuesday morning have been released on bail.

The men, aged 20 and 21, have been bailed to allow us time to carry out further enquiries and to liaise with the Crown Prosecution Service

We would like to reiterate there is no ongoing risk to the public. We have made this assessment following an in-depth review of the circumstances and evidence.

A device was recovered by the Armyâ€™s EOD unit in a lane in Appletree Court on Tuesday and made safe. We do not believe there are any further devices.

Investigations like this can only be undertaken with the assistance and support of the local community.

We fully appreciate this can sometimes be inconvenient and genuinely appreciate the understanding and support of those directly affected by it.
