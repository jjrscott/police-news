We’re appealing for witnesses following a collision involving a pedestrian in the Lawrence Weston area.

The incident happened at about 9pm on Friday (18 October) in Kings Weston Lane.

A woman in her 60s who was lying in the road was struck by a van.

The woman had been walking to work on the nearside pavement along Kings Weston Lane, having just crossed over the motorway over bridge.

For no apparent reason she has ended up in the road, where she has been struck by the van, sustaining a serious leg injury.

She remains in hospital.

We’re keen to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time of the incident.

If you are able to help, please contact us.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5219241959 **
