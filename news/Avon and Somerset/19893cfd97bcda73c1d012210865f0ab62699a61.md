A man is due in court today after being charged with the murder of 40-year-old Louis Bednall.

It follows an incident in Hendford Hill in the early hours of Saturday in which Mr Bednall suffered fatal injuries.

Matthew Sheridan, 29, of Long Ashton, will appear before Yeovil Magistratesâ€™ Court this morning (Tuesday 15 December).

A 23-year-old man, also arrested on suspicion of murder, has been released on conditional bail.
