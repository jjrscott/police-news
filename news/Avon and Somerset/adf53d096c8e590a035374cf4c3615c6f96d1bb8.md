We're appealing for witnesses and information after a woman was knocked to the ground in an attempted robbery.

It happened between 5pm and 6pm on Saturday 10 August. A 55-year-old woman was walking along an alley off East Street Bedminster. A man on a push bike rode up behind her tried to grab her bag, hitting her on the head. She fell to the ground and he tried to take her bag before making off on the bike.

The woman suffered concussion but did not need hospital treatment.
