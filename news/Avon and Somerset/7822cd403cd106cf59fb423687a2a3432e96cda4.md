We’re appealing for witnesses and dashcam footage following a collision in Yeovil yesterday (Friday 4 Oct).

A car collided with a number of pedestrians on Hendford Hill at approximately 6.25pm.

A teenage boy sustained a minor head injury and was taken hospital for treatment while thankfully, the other pedestrians only sustained cuts and bruises.

The driver of the vehicle, a man in his 70s, initially failed to stop at the scene before returning later when he was then arrested. He remains in police custody.

We’re keen to speak to anyone who saw the incident or the manner in which the car, a dark coloured 4×4 vehicle, was driven beforehand who hasn’t yet spoken to police.

We’d also like to view any dashcam footage from anyone in the area at the time.

If you can help, please phone 101 and provide the call handler with the reference 5219230092.
