We’re releasing CCTV images of two men we’d like to speak to following a GBH in Bristol.

A 30-year-old man was assaulted outside Pata Negra on Clare Street at approximately 11pm on Saturday, 28 September.

The victim sustained a fractured eye socket and cheekbone.

We’d like to speak to the men in the CCTV images as we think they might have information which could help our inquiry.

If you recognise either of them, please call 101 and provide the call handler with the reference **5219224822**.

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
