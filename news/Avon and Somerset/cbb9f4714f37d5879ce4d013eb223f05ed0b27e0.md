Paul Easby

We’re appealing for the public’s help to find an absconder from HMP Leyhill.

Paul Easby, 42, was last seen at the South Gloucestershire prison at around 6pm yesterday (Sunday, 15 September).

He is currently serving a custodial sentence for GBH.

Easby is described as white, 6ft 1ins tall with short brown hair. While he has facial hair in the photo we’re releasing he is currently clean shaven.

He is believed to be wearing a white t-shirt and black Adidas tracksuit bottoms which have three white stripes down the legs.

He is thought to have travelled to the Plymouth area where he has links.

If anyone sees Easby or knows of his whereabouts, we’d ask you not to approach him but to call us immediately on 999, providing the call handler with the reference 5219213466.

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
