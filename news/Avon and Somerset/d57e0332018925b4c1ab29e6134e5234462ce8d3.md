We’re appealing for your help following an incident in Bristol city centre.

It happened on Friday 27 September in The Galleries in Broadmead, at about 3pm.

We were called to a disturbance involving a group of people. During the incident a mobile phone was thrown at a group of people and a fight broke out.

Security guards attended and detained a suspect who was subsequently arrested on suspicion of affray and criminal damage – he had also thrown a mug at a glass window which shattered.

The teenager, aged 17 has been released under investigation while police enquiries into the incident continue.

We understand there were a number of people in the area at the time of the incident who may have filmed the event on their mobile phones.

We are keen to obtain the footage and would like them to contact us.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5219223862 **

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
