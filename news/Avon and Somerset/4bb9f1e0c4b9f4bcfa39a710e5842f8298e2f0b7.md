A man has contacted us following an appeal as part of our enquiries into an incident in Taunton.

Officers were investigating a sexual assault by touching which happened overnight Saturday 22 to Sunday 23 March.

We issued CCTV images from Zinc bar and club asking for help to trace a man we wanted to speak to.

A man is now due to be interviewed voluntarily.

Weâ€™d like to thank him for coming forward and are grateful to everyone who responded to or shared our appeal.
