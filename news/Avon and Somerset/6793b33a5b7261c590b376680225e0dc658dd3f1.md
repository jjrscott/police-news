**A number of items have been seized following the arrest of a man and a woman in Yeovil town centre.**

Last Friday (12 July), CCTV captured a man and a woman appearing to be making a drug deal in Yeovil town centre.

Plain clothes officers were deployed and arrested the man, 22, of no fixed address and woman, 20, from London, on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs. The man was also arrested on suspicion of possession of a bladed article.

Following the arrest, a search carried out found over Â£300 in cash, a six-inch lock knife, and a range of drugs including quantities of cannabis, crack cocaine and a white powder believed to be cocaine.
