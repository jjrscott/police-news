The man's injuries

We're seeking witnesses to an unprovoked and apparently motiveless assault on a 61-year-old man in Fishponds.

The man was walking home at about 7.45pm on Tuesday 18 June. Three younger men on bicycles approached him near the junction of Fishponds Road and Grove Road. They pushed him to the ground, leaving him with facial injuries (see image).

The offenders made off towards the city centre. Passers-by came to help the victim and called an ambulance.

PC 4504 Brett Stinchcombe said: "This was an unprovoked attack on a man in his sixties. I'd urge anyone who saw the incident or who has any other information which could help to get in touch quoting reference 5219136783."

Alternatively ring the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. They never ask your name or trace your call.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5219136783 **

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
