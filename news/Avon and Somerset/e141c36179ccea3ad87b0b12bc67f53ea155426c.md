Weâ€™re appealing for help to locate a ring which was stolen in a burglary in Axbridge.

It is believed the suspect is from the Weston-super-Mare area and may have presented the ring for sale in the surrounding area.

We are particularly interested to hear from jewellers and second-hand shops who may have been offered the ring.

Anyone with information to help with our investigation is asked to call 101, quoting reference 5219160301

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
