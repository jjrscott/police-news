An investigation is taking place after a brick was thrown through a window of a property in Weston-super-Mare.

A man was seen to damage a window in the Palmer Street area at about 9.20pm on Friday 23 October. Nobody was reported to have been injured.

Enquiries into what happened are ongoing.

We've since obtained video footage showing a man we'd like to speak to in connection with our investigation.

PC John Medley said: "We appreciate the time of night affects the quality of the image, but we hope someone may recall seeing the man captured on the video and be able to assist with our enquiries.

"The man is described as white, 20-30 years old and having brown hair. He was wearing a dark coloured coat and dark trousers along with black and white trainers.

"He was also reportedly seen in a silver Vauxhall Astra on the same night."
