Can you help?

Do you recognise this man?

The incident happened on Thursday 6 June, between 3.00am – 4.00am which is being treated as a homophobic hate crime.

The two victims were walking home from a night out when they were confronted by two men who were using offence language. They were then assaulted and a gold chain was stolen from one of the victims.

If you recognise the man pictured, or have any information which can with our investigation, please call 101 quoting reference number 5219126566
