A murder enquiry has been launched after the death of a man in the St Paulâ€™s area of Bristol today.

We were called at around 5.50pm to reports of a serious assault at the junction of Ashley Road and City Road.

On arrival a man was found in critical condition after suffering stab wounds. The air ambulance and paramedics attended but sadly the man was pronounced dead just before 6.30pm.

A man in his 20s has been arrested in connection with the incident.

The area is closed from Lower Ashley Road and traffic diverted while forensic examiners investigate.

Neighbourhood officers are doing additional patrols in the area to reassure residents.

Anyone who was in the area and witnessed the incident or has any information that could help please call us on 101 and quote reference number 5219139586.
