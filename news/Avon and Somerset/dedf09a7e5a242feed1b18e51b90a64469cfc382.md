We'd like to thank everyone who contacted us following our appeal into a racially aggravated assault on a man in his 50s.

It happened in Taunton at about 9pm on 12 April. A car was also damaged in the incident.

We believe we have now identified both the individuals we were hoping to trace. One teenage boy came forward himself. He has arranged to speak to officers voluntarily.

Our enquiries continue, and anyone with any more information which could help can get in touch quoting reference 5219080152.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5219080152 **

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
