CCTV image from inside Subway

Weâ€™re issuing a CCTV image of a man we want to trace following a robbery at the Subway store in Fishponds Road, Bristol.

At about 7.55pm on Friday 26 April, an employee was threatened by a man who came into the store. The victim handed the man a quantity of cash from the till and their phone was also taken.

The man in the image is described as white, between 20 and 30 years old, about 5ft 10ins, slim, with short light brown hair, with red highlights. He was wearing a black jacket and a baseball cap.

If you have any information which could help us ID the man in this image, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number 5219091470.
