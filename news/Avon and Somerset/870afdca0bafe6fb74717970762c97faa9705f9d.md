The A38 northbound near junction 22 of the M5 at Brent Knoll is closed following a fatal collision overnight.

We were called at 5am Tuesday 17 September to a collision involving a pedestrian and a car.

Sadly the male pedestrian died at the scene. While formal identification is yet to take place, we've informed his next of kin.

The A38 is closed in both directions. Traffic is being diverted. We expect collision investigators will be examining the scene until at least midday. Please follow @HighwaysSWest for travel updates.

If you have any information which could help our investigation - especially if you saw someone walking in the area in the early hours get in touch quoting reference 5219214529

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5219214529 **
