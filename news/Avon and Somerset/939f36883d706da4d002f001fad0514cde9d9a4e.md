We’re appealing for witnesses after a car collided with a woman on the M5 between junctions 26 and 27 at around 10.18pm on Friday 25 December.

Both carriageways were closed for several hours as specialist collision investigators examined the scene.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5220288243 **
