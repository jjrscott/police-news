**Daniel Mulholland has been charged with a dwelling burglary in Bath.**

Mulholland, 25, of Haycombe Drive in Southdown, Bath, appeared at Bath Magistrates Court earlier today (11 October) charged with dwelling burglary.

He was arrested yesterday (10 October) and has been charged in connection with an incident on 28 September in which a property on Victoria Road in Oldfield, Bath, was burgled where numerous items including cash, electrical equipment, bank cards, a smart watch and identification documentation were taken.

Mulholland did not enter a plea, has been remanded in custody and will appear at Bristol Crown Court on a date yet to be set.
