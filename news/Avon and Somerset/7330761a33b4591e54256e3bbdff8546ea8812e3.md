Three large tubs of cannabis believed to be worth around £5,000 were found during a search of a property in Lawrence Hill.

**Two men from Lawrence Hill have been arrested for drugs supply offences.**

Earlier today officers were notified of a package intercepted by UK Border Force containing what was believed to be approximately 4,100 tabs of the LSD drug estimated to have a street value of £41,000, concealed inside a magazine.

Officers attended the intended delivery address of the suspected recipient in which a 35 year old man was arrested on suspicion of the importation of Class A drugs.

A search of the property also found three large tubs of cannabis believed to be worth around £5,000. A man was subsequently also arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class B drugs.

Another 39 year old man was also detained and found to be carrying a large amount of cannabis resin.

A search found further drugs paraphernalia including a large amount of cannabis oil, magic mushrooms and cannabis resin with a believed further street value in excess of £10,000, resulting in a man being arrested on suspicion of intent to supply Class B drugs.

Both men remain in police custody.
