The man is described as white, aged in his 20s, of medium build with brown hair and a short beard. He wore a grey hooded top.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or who recognises the description of the man is asked to call 101 and provide the call handler with the reference **5220270531**.

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.
