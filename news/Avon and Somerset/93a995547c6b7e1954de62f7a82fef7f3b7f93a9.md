We're asking for your help with an investigation into a two-car collision. It happened at about 12.15am on Friday 2 August at Colliters Way, Bristol.

A Ford Focus, travelling downhill from Lime Kiln roundabout, was involved in a head-on collision with a Volkswagen Polo heading in the opposite direction from the A370. Emergency services attended and the road reopened shortly before 6am.

There were three people in the Ford and two people in the Polo. All five had hospital treatment.

Two people remain in hospital with serious, but not life-threatening, injuries. They are a woman passenger from the Polo and a male passenger from the Focus.

If you saw the collision or have any footage which could help the investigation get in touch, quoting reference 5219176732
