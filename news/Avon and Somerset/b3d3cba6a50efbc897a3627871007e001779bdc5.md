Can you tell us who this is?

We’re releasing a CCTV image as part of an investigation into an assault in Keynsham.

A man in his 40s was punched twice in the face by a teenage boy on High Street at about 6.15pm on Tuesday, 3 September.

We’d like to speak to the individual in the CCTV image as we believe they may have information which could help our inquiry.

We appreciate the CCTV still isn’t great quality but we hope someone might recognise the distinctive clothing.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5219203341 **

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
