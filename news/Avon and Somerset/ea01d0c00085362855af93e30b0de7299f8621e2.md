The family of a motorcyclist who died in a fatal collision on the A378 near Taunton last weekend have issued a tribute.

The collision, which involved a Mitsubishi Fuso lorry and a Ducati M1200 motorbike, happened at Stonehead Hill at around 11.40am on Saturday 12 December.

Motorcyclist Adam Ledger, who lived in the Taunton area, died at the scene.

Adam, 33, leaves behind his wife Samantha and their two children Evie and Jack.

His family said: "Our hearts are truly broken and he will live on through his family.

"He touched the lives of so many, he was a loving husband, son, brother, friend and golfer but mostly the worldâ€™s best daddy who can never be replaced.

"He will never be forgotten by anyone lucky enough to know him."
