At around 1.30am this morning (Thursday, 17 October), we were called to reports of a car, which was believed to have been stolen, driving erratically on the A38 near to Wellington in the direction of Taunton.

It failed to stop for officers and shortly afterwards, after driving with a deflated tyre, stopped outside the former Taunton police station in Shuttern and the driver was arrested on suspicion of theft of a vehicle.

At about 2.30am officers saw a second vehicle which was also believed to have been stolen. This vehicle also failed to stop for officers who followed it.

Shortly afterwards, the vehicle crashed near to the railway station in Cheddon Road (opposite Kilkenny Court), ending up on its roof and setting fire. Fire and ambulance services attended the scene.

The driver was taken to Musgrove Park Hospital with serious injuries but has since sadly died.

Two other occupants who were seriously injured were taken to Southmead Hospital.

Police investigations at the site concluded and the roads were reopened by 5.30pm.

The forceâ€™s professional standards department have been advised and the incident has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.
