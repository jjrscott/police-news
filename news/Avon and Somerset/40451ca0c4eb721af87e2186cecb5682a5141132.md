David Moore

We're working with HM Coastguard to try to find the owner of a yacht which has run aground at Berrow.

A witness reported seeing the "Egoist" apparently abandoned at about 6.30am today, Monday 3 June.

Witnesses saw the vessel leaving Watchet Marina on the afternoon of Saturday 1 June.

We're treating this as a missing person enquiry. Officers are concerned for the welfare of the owner, David Moore, aged 43, _pictured_.

Have you seen David Moore?
