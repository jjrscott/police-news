CCTV images

We’re issuing CCTV images of two men we want to identify as part of a hate crime investigation in Bristol.

A 26-year-old man was assaulted in Corn Street at around 7.15pm on Thursday 28 March. He suffered injuries to his face as a result of being punched.

We’re treating it as a hate crime due to the words used by the offenders towards the victim.

One of the men we’re trying to trace is described as white, aged between 24 and 28 years old, of slim build, with a hooked nose. He was wearing a dark beany hat and dark clothing.

The second is described as white, aged between 24 and 28 years old, around 5ft 8ins/5ft 9ins, of slim build, with short ginger hair and beard. He was wearing a green padded jacket with a white t-shirt underneath.

We know the images are not of the best quality, but if you can help identify either of the men, or have information about this incident, please call us on 101 and give the call handler the reference number 5219067444.

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
