We’re appealing for witnesses following a fatal road traffic collision in Longwell Green.

The incident happened at 3.10am yesterday (Sunday) in Craven Way near to ASDA.

A Vauxhall Corsa was travelling in a south westerly direction towards a mini roundabout, where there is an option to turn left towards Marsham Way or right into ASDA.

The car however, carried straight on and was in collision with a brick wall.

The driver – a man - received attention at the scene but sadly died shortly afterwards.

The road was closed to allow collision investigators to examine the scene.

It was re-opened at about 9am.

We’re keen to hear from anyone who may have been in the area at the time of the incident who may have information to help our enquiries.

Anyone able to help is asked to call us, quoting reference 5219184177

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5219184177 **
