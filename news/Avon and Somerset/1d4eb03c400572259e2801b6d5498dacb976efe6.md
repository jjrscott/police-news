Cash and sat nav systems taken in Wells break-in

Weâ€™re appealing for witnesses following a burglary at a car and bike accessories store in Wells.

It happened yesterday morning (Tuesday 23 April) between 12-12.15am at the store in Westfield Road.

Entry was forced and a number of satellite navigation systems and cash taken.

Two suspects were spotted leaving the area on foot, possibly going in the direction of the Burcott Road/Barley Close area.

We would like to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time of the incident particularly any motorists who may have been driving in the area.

We would also appeal to second-hand shops and members of the public to remain vigilant and let us know if they have been offered a satellite navigation system.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5219087731 **
