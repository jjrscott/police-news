An amount of what was believed to be crack cocaine estimated to be worth a street value of £500, and a large quantity of cash.

**We have arrested two men from Yeovil for drugs supply offences.**

On Saturday (27 July) officers received reports of suspected drug dealing in the Memorial Gardens within Ninesprings Country Park in Yeovil.

Upon attending, officers located two men acting suspiciously. A search of the men located an amount of what was believed to be crack cocaine estimated to be worth a street value of £500, and a large quantity of cash.

A 43 year old man from North Devon was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs and a 37 year old man from London was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs.

Both men have been released under investigation for further enquiries to be completed.
