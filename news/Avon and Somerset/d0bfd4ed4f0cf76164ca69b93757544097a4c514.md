Weâ€™re appealing for witnesses following a fatal collision in South Gloucestershire yesterday (4 October).

A concrete mixer collided with a wall on the A38 near Tytherington Quarry at about 3.45pm.

The driver, a man in his 30s, sadly died at the scene. His next of kin have been informed and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time.

Collision investigators have examined the road which continues to remain closed while the vehicle is recovered.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 and provide the call handler with the reference 5219229938.
