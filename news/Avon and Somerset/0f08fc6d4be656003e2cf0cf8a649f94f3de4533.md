We're seeking witnesses and CCTV footage after a burglary in the early hours of this morning (Monday 8 February).

At approximately 2am this morning we were called to a supermarket in Thornbury after entry had been forced to Aldi's store, in Horseshoe Lane.

Officers discovered the ATM had been attacked and a quantity of cash stolen.

A crime scene remains in place at the present time and enquiries are ongoing.

Weâ€™re keen to hear from anyone with CCTV in the area.

Anyone who saw what happened, or can assist our investigation, is asked to call 101 and give the call-handler reference **5221027464**.

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
