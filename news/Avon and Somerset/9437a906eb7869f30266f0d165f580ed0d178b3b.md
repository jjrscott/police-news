We're seeking witnesses and information after an attempted robbery in Yeovil.

It happened at about 5pm on Wednesday 28 August in the area of Lower Wraxhill Road and Sandhurst Road. A teenager approached a 25-year-old woman as she walked along the pavement. He asked if there were any toilets nearby. She stopped to speak to him and he grabbed for her jacket.

She pulled away from him and he ran off down Sandhurst Road towards West Coker Road.

The would-be thief is described as white, aged between 15 and 18, about 5ft 8ins tall and of "skinny" build with short light-coloured hair. He wore dark-coloured clothing: shorts, a hooded top, baseball cap and trainers.
