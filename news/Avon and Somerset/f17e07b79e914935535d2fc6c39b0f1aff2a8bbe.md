Jamie Ward has been sentenced to a total of 33 months in prison.

**A man from Bristol has been jailed for a number of burglary offences.**

Jamie Ward, 36 of no fixed address in Bristol was yesterday (Tuesday 3 September) sentenced at Bristol Crown Court to two years and nine months in prison having admitted a spate of burglaries across Bristol.

Ward was first arrested and charged for an attempted burglary in August 2018 but failed to attend court. Evidence taken from his trainers linked him to an additional five burglaries.

Further investigations linked Ward to a number of other burglaries and he was due at Bristol Crown Court for sentencing on 27 June. However, during May and June preceding his Court appearance, Ward went on a crime spree including twice assaulting officers.

On 30 June, Ward was charged with burglary and two counts of assaulting an emergency worker. He admitted to a number of other burglaries which were considered in Court yesterday during sentencing.
