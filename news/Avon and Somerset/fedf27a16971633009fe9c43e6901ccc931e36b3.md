Weâ€™re appealing for witnesses following a fatal road traffic collision in Weston-super-Mare.

The incident happened yesterday afternoon (Sunday 1 September) on the A370 Somerset Avenue at about 3.25pm.

Two vehicles - a Mercedes car and an Aprilla motorcycle were travelling in the same direction, outbound from Weston-super-Mare towards the M5. The motorcycle was in collision with the rear of the Mercedes and the rider seriously injured.

Despite receiving treatment at the scene, sadly the motorcyclist died shortly afterwards.

The road remained closed until shortly before 10pm to allow collision investigators to examine the scene.

We would like to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time of the incident, who may have information to help our enquiries.
