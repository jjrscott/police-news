 * 06 Sep 2019: Witness appeal following fatal collision in Easton-in-Gordano

The family of a cyclist who died in a collision on the A369 at Easton-in-Gordano have released a tribute to him.

Simon Gregory, 43, from Bristol, died after his bicycle was involved in a collision with a Ford Fiesta at around 9.30pm on Wednesday 4 September.

The tribute reads: "No words can express how devastated we are by the loss of Simon, a wonderful son, brother and uncle. His death has left a hole in our hearts that can never be filled; he was loving and caring, never having a bad word to say about anyone and a true friend to everyone that knew him. We are struggling to cope at this sad time and we would ask kindly that our privacy is respected whilst we come to terms with our loss."
