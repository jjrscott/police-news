We're appealing for witnesses after a cyclist was found with serious injuries on Marsh Lane, near Portbury Docks. It happened at about 11.30am on Tuesday 17 September.

Officers are grateful to members of the public who quickly came to her aid. The woman remains in a critical condition in hospital. Her injuries are consistent with a collision or fall. She is not missing any of her personal items.

We're particularly keen to speak with a motorcyclist believed to have been using the path at the time. He may have witnessed the incident.

He is described as a white man in his late fifties or early sixties, of stocky build, with grey hair and a grey beard. The motorbike was described as "old" and possibly light grey.

If you were on Marsh Lane on Tuesday morning or have any other information which could help the investigation get in touch quoting reference 5219217316.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5219217316 **
