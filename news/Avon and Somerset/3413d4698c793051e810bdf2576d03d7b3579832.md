We’re seeking the public’s help following a burglary at an address near Wells, in which a number of high value mountain bikes were stolen.

The bikes, which were stored in a garage attached to the address, were taken overnight between the hours of 8pm on Monday 3 August and 8am on Tuesday 4 August.

The offender(s) removed roof tiles from the garage in order to gain access and open the door from the inside.

Six high value mountain bikes were taken in what is believed to be a targeted attack. A chainsaw was also stolen.

We’re issuing images of the bikes stolen – a LOOK 785 Huez, a specialized P3, a Deviate Guide Mountain Bike, a Canyon Neuron CF5L 9.0, A Canyon Stitch 20, and a POLE Stamina 180.
