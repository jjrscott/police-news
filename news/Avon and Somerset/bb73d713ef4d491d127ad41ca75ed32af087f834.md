**Nicky Jefferies has been jailed for two years and four months for two dwelling burglary offences.**

Jefferies, 39, of Creswicke Road in Knowle was sentenced yesterday (Monday 22 July) at Bristol Crown Court having pleaded guilty to the charges.

On 14th June, Jefferies was arrested following stealing a number of garden maintenance tools from a property in Rodfords Mead, Hengrove and two large packs of Fanta from a property in Griggfield Walk, Hengrove.

Officers were called after an individual was reported selling the suspected stolen items to other residents in nearby roads including attempting to sell the Fanta to the original owner.

Jefferies was detained by local residents and upon the arrival of the police officers, was arrested on suspicion of burglary.
