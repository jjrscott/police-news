We're appealing for witnesses after two incidents of disorder in Burnham-on-Sea.

We were initially called to reports of an altercation involving a large group of people on Marine Drive at approximately 3.30am on Sunday 14 July. When officers arrived at the scene, several of the group made off.

Soon afterwards, we attended a further disturbance in the car park of the nearby Lighthouse Inn.

Two men needed hospital treatment for injuries sustained during the incidents.

A 27-year-old man had a broken finger and nose as well as a fractured skull. A 29-year-old man had minor head injuries including needing stitches to a cut to his ear.

If you saw any part of this disorder and have not yet spoken to us get in touch, quoting reference 5219160239

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5219160239 **

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
