**Officers from Avon and Somerset Police’s Topaz Child Exploitation Team contributed to highly successful ‘Somerset Day of Action’ in partnership with the NSPCC and O2 after hundreds of people from across the county took the opportunity to brush up on their online safety knowledge.**

The event, which took place on Wednesday, was hosted in a number of O2 stores across Somerset namely in Taunton, Street, Yeovil, Bridgwater and Weston super-Mare.

In the shops, parents were given online safety talks throughout the afternoon, as well as having access to an O2 online safety guru, available to answer questions during the day.

Avon and Somerset Police’s Topaz Child Exploitation Team held talks and were also on hand to give out advice, while NSPCC volunteers gave out stickers, balloons and leaflets.

Community Fundraising Manager Anna Keir said: “It was great to see people from all over Somerset engage in the event, as keeping up with online safety is hugely important as a parent.

“We had online safety gurus in each store to help parents with any questions or queries they may have about the internet, and we are really thankful for their support as well as the police who came out on the day.

“We are now hoping that people across Somerset are feeling slightly more confident about how to keep their children safe online.”

APC Rachel Hobbs from Avon and Somerset Police’s Topaz Child Exploitation Team, said: “It has been great to partner with the NSPCC and O2 to inform and educate parents and children in online safety and child exploitation.

“We know that 70% of 8-17 year olds have viewed content not appropriate for their age group.

“In order to protect children from this sort of abuse and exploitation, it is imperative we are able to advise parents and children on how to safeguard themselves.

“We were delighted to have been able to speak to so many people and hope this event proved useful to parents and their children alike.”
