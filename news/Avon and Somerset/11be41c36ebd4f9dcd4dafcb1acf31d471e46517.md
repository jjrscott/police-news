Two teenagers have appeared in court charged with drug offences following an investigation.

Zubiar Hassan Hamdi, 19, of Warneford Road, Bristol, and a 17-year-old boy, of Lockleaze, appeared at Bristol Magistrates' Court yesterday each charged with two counts of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs.

The charges follow a search of a property in the Fishponds area of Bristol in which large quantities of what is believed to be heroin and cocaine were seized.

Both were remanded in custody until a hearing at Bristol Crown Court on 4 January.
