Officers working to trace missing Daniel found a body in the Worlebury area of Weston-super-Mare on Tuesday 23 March.

While formal identification has yet to be completed, Daniel's family has been informed, and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time.

We continue to make enquiries on behalf of the coroner.
