We're asking the public to contact us if they see Alan, 57

Police are continuing to investigate the disappearance of Alan, 57, from the Bedminster Down area of Bristol and we're asking the public to contact us if they see him.

He was reported missing on Saturday, 23 January by friends who became worried heâ€™d left home without his personal property. It is thought he may be wild camping in the Wells/Glastonbury area.

Alan is described as white, about 5ft 10ins tall and stocky with short grey hair and a goatee beard.

A friend has provided us with a photo of Alan which we think shows the clothing he may be wearing.

CCTV enquiries carried out in Wells also suggest he may be carrying a ruck sack and wearing a black woolly hat.

If you know where Alan is now, please call 999 quoting reference 5221016375.

If you have any other information about his whereabouts, call 101 and give the same reference.

Alan, if you see this, people care about you and are worried. Please get in touch.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5221016375 **
