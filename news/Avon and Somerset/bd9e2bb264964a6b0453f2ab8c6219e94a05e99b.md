 * 09 Oct 2019: Modern slavery arrests in Bristol as part of National Crime Agency inquiry

A Bristol man has been charged as part of a National Crime Agency (NCA) investigation into human trafficking.

43-year-old Slovakian national Maros Tancos, of Thingwall Park, Fishponds, is due to appear before Bristol Magistrates' Court today (Thursday 10 October).

He will face 12 charges under the Modern Slavery Act 2015, six of holding someone in servitude, and a further six counts of subjecting someone to forced or compulsory labour.

A 44-year-old Polish woman who was also arrested on Tuesday has been released on bail.

The arrests follow a two year NCA investigation, supported by Avon and Somerset Police, into the suspected exploitation of dozens of predominantly Slovak migrants, who would be transported to the UK and then put to work in labouring jobs or car washes.
