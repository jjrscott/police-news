A pedestrian who died following a collision on the M32 in Bristol last Saturday has been named.

Nicholas Lea, 43, from Bristol, died following the collision which involved two vehicles on the M32 southbound, between junctions 1 and 2, at around 11.55pm.

His family are being supported by trained liaison officers and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time.
