**Three men and two women have been charged with being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs.**

Lee Meredith, 52, and Miles Meredith, 21, both of Avon Crescent in Hotwells, Bristol; Mark Taylor, 58, of Northcote Close in Anfield, Liverpool; Katie Hamblin, 20, of Greenhill Road in Radstock; and Chevonne Meredith, 29, of Charlton Hayes in Bristol, have all been charged in connection with an incident on Wednesday 28 August in which five people were arrested following a planned police operation targeting the supply of drugs in the Bristol area.

As part of the operation two vehicles and two properties were searched in which officers found a substantial amount of Class A drugs along with a significant quantity of cash seized.

Katie Hamblin, Lee Meredith and Mark Taylor have also been charged with an offence under the Proceeds of Crime Act.

They remain in custody and are due to appear at Bristol Magistrates Court later today.
