We’re releasing a CCTV image of a potential witness who we think might be able to help to help our investigation into an attempted sexual assault in Bristol.

A 19-year-old woman was attacked in the toilets of Mbargo nightclub, on Triangle West, during the early hours of Thursday, 11 July.

We’re keen to speak to the man in the image who we believe may have been in the vicinity of the incident around the time it took place.

A 20-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the incident and has been released under investigation.

Anyone who recognises the man in the image is asked to call 101 and provide the call handler with the reference 5219157430.

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
