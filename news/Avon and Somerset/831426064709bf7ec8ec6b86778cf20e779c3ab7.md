The family of a young woman who died in a fatal collision on 31 July at North Meade Road in Midsomer Norton, have released a photo and tribute.

Jennifer Rose Sell, aged 20 from Clutton, died at the scene of the collision. "Jenny" was driving a Honda Jazz.

Her father Colin Sell, mother Janice and brother Sam are devastated.

They said: "Our beautiful daughter was taken away from us suddenly, tragically and far too soon. She was beautiful inside and out and was loved by many. She has left a massive gap in our lives. We will love and miss her forever."
