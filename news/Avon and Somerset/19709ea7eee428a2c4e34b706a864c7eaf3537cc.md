We’re appealing for witnesses after a robbery in Frome.

The incident happened near Frome Community Hospital on Enos Way on 30 July just before 9.45pm.

The 18-year-old victim was riding his bike when a man approached him with a black bladed knife. The victim’s bike was stolen and money was demanded.

The suspect then entered a black Renault Clio parked nearby and put the bike inside before leaving the scene.

The offender is described as being a white male, quite tall, heavy build, with a light-coloured beard and wearing a camouflage hoodie with red or pink shorts.

If you can help with this inquiry, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number 5219174809

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
