We wish to identify male 1 (left) and male 2 (right) as part of our investigation.

Officers investigating a distraction theft at a jewellers in Bristol last month are releasing CCTV images of two people they wish to speak to.

A gold chain was taken from the shop, in St Marks Road in Easton, between 3-4pm on Wednesday 16 December.

The two men we wish to speak to in connection with the investigation are believed to have travelled in a grey Audi A4.

The pair are described as:

 * Male 1 - in his 30s, approximately 6ft tall, of a large build with black hair and short dark facial hair.
 * Male 2 - aged 35-45, about 5ft 9ins, of medium build with dark facial hair.

Anyone who witnessed what happened, or can help us identify the two men, should call 101 and give reference number **5220284214**.
