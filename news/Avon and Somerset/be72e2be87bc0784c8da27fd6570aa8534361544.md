We’re appealing for witnesses following an incident in Weston-super-Mare.

On Thursday afternoon 23 May, at about 1.10pm a man took hold of a toddler in the Summer Lane ponds area.

The boy was with his mother at the time.

The man is described as a white man of slim build, about 5ft 10ins tall, wearing blue jeans and a distinctive light blue hooded top with white patches, similar to a tie-dye effect.

He is thought to have left and headed in the direction of the car park at the entrance to the ponds area near Summer Lane.

We’re keen to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time of the incident who may be able to help us with our enquiries or who recognises the man.

Officers have been patrolling the area to provide reassurance and receive any information on the incident in order to piece together what happened.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5219114866 **

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
