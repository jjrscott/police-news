Can you help us identify this man?

We’re releasing a CCTV image of a man we’d like to identify following a knifepoint robbery in Bristol.

The incident happened on the Bristol to Bath cycle path off Easton Road between 1am and 1.15am on Friday, 7 June.

The victim, a man in his 20s, was walking along the path having recently left the Plough pub when he was hit from behind, causing him to fall to the floor.

A number of people then hit him several times around the face while one of the offenders threatened him with a knife.

The victim’s phone, wallet and keys were then stolen by his attackers.

Anyone who recognises the man in the CCTV image is asked to call 101 and provide the call handler with the reference 5219126676.

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
