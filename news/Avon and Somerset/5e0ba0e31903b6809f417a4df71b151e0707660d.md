Householder and vehicle owners warned to be vigilant following break-ins

We’re appealing for information after a 27-year-old woman was assaulted while out jogging in Thornbury.

The incident happened in Gloucester Road at about 5.40am on Wednesday (September 11) close to the junction with Stafford Crescent.

A white Transit style van, possibly a 61 plate, pulled up next to the woman after passing her a couple of times. A man got out of the driver's seat and ran around the front of the van. Without saying anything, he punched her in the face and grabbed her.

The victim managed to break free from the man’s grip and she ran towards High Street to safety.

The suspect is described as white, between 30 and 35 years old, slim, around 5ft 11ins to 6ft, with mousey brown hair, shaved on the sides and spikey on top. He was wearing dark trousers and a hooded top - possibly two-tone in colour.

We’re appealing for anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious around the time of the incident to come forward, especially as further sightings or a more detailed description of the van may help us to identify the offender.

If you can help, please call Sgt Sean Underwood via 101 and give the call handler the reference number **5219209432.**
