Wanted man Luke Baker

We’re appealing for information on the whereabouts of a wanted man from the Kingswood area of South Gloucestershire.

Luke Baker, aged 46, is wanted on a recall to prison for breaching the terms of his licence. He’d previously served a prison sentence for robbery and affray.

He’s described as white, 5ft 10ins, medium build, with brown eyes and has a number of tattoos including on his head, neck and hands.

If you see him, please do not approach him, but call 999 and give the call handler the reference number 5220259390.

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
