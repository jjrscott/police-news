We seized drugs, cash and an unlawful knife following a search of a rural property near Banwell last week.

Officers from the Operation Remedy team set up to target burglary, drug and knife crime searched the address on Wednesday afternoon, 3 February.

They seized cannabis plants and dried cannabis, growing equipment, a flick knife, cash and also substances believed to be cocaine and heroin.

A man is due to be interviewed in connection with the seizures at a later date.
