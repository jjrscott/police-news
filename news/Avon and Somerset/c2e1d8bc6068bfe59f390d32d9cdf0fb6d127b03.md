Taunton Crown Court has sentenced a 24 year old man to three years and four months in prison after he pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply Class A drugs in Yeovil.

Justin Wright was arrested in October 2018 on the A303 in Somerset travelling from London towards Yeovil, after a significant quantity of heroin and crack were recovered from his car.

Wright was identified as working for a County Lines syndicate known as the NOVA line in Yeovil between April and October 2018, during which time he was making regular trips from London to the Somerset town to supply heroin and cocaine.

Thames Valley Police assisted in our investigation by stopping Wright and seizing the vehicle he was driving, which provided valuable evidence for our investigation.

PC Jim Card from Investigations comments:

_“Tackling County Lines and the serious issues they cause is a priority for Avon and Somerset Police. The sentencing of Wright is an extremely positive result that highlights the actions being taken to address a complex problem that is affecting the whole country._

_“We are determined to crack down on County Lines, to put a stop to the violence that goes hand-in-hand with the supply of drugs, and to protect the vulnerable adults and children being exploited by the drug gangs operating the lines”._
