**** The following as been issued by the Crown Prosecution Service ****

Four people have been charged with criminal damage after a statue of Edward Colston was damaged in Bristol City Centre on 7 June 2020.

Rhian Graham, 29, Milo Ponsford, 25, Jake Skuse, 32, and Sage Willoughby, 21, will appear at Bristol Magistratesâ€™ Court on 25 January 2021 for their first hearing.

The CPS authorised the charges following a review of a file of evidence received from Avon and Somerset Police on 1 October 2020.

The Crown Prosecution Service reminds all concerned that criminal proceedings against all four are now active and that they have the right to a fair trial. It is extremely important there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.
