Help us to find missing motorcycles

Have you seen any of these motorcycles which have been stolen from a property in a village in North Somerset ?

They were taken overnight between Sunday 14 April and Monday 15 April.

The owner had been out riding the bikes and when he returned to his home in Winford he secured them in his garage.

However overnight entry has been forced into the garage and four machines taken – a green Kawasaki 1982 KX 125; a blue Yamaha YZ 250F; a red Honda CRF 250; and white Honda 450cc.

Reports suggest that two bikes were being ridden along Dundry Lane shortly after 4am.

We‘re appealing for people to be vigilant for the motorcycles and we would also like anyone who may be offered one – or all – of the bikes to contact us.

We would also like to hear from anyone who may have CCTV or phone footage of anyone riding a motorcycle like those described above.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5219081946 **
