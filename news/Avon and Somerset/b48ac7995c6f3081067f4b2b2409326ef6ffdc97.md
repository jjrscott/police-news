We're asking any witnesses to a burglary in Glastonbury to come forward.

At some point between noon on Wednesday 11 November and the early hours of the following morning, an unknown offender broke into a caravan in Beckery Old Road.

A Dewalt drill, black portable DVD player and a metallic red electronic inverter were stolen.

CCTV enquiries are ongoing.

We'd ask anyone to get in touch who saw what happened, may have been driving in the area and have dashcam footage, or has been offered items matching those descriptions by a seller.

Police can be contacted online, or on 101, giving reference number **5220255418**.

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
