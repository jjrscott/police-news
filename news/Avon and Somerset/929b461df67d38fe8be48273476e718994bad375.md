Joseph Hale & Thomas Bell

Two men have been sentenced for their role in a smash and grab robbery of a jewellers in Wellington.

Joseph Hale, aged 23, of Rappart Road, Merseyside and Thomas Bell, aged 26, of Park Street, Liverpool both pleaded guilty to charges of robbery.

The incident occurred on South Street on August 11 2018 when Hale and Bell used a pick axe and a metal pole to smash a jeweller’s shop window and steal watches to a value of £11,000.

At Taunton Crown Court, Hale (pictured left) was handed a 16 month prison sentence.

Bell (pictured right) received a two year prison sentence, suspended for two years, 240 hours of community service and a five month tagged curfew.

DC David Cousins said: “We welcome the custodial sentence given to Hale and restrictions in place for Bell which reflects the seriousness of the offence they committed.”
