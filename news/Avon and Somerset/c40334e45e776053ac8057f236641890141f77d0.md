Weâ€™re seeking witnesses after an incident occurred in Yeovil where a woman was approached by two men where one attempted to grab her.

The incident occurred in The Avenue, Yeovil sometime between 12.30pm and 12.50pm on Tuesday 5 June.

The men, who were driving a blue Peugeot, pulled up alongside an 18-year-old woman and one of them got out and spoke to her before grabbing her hand. The female defended herself and managed to escape.

One of the offenders is described as being around 5ft 8ins, unshaven and of a medium build who was wearing a black Nike hooded sweatshirt with the hood up and dark grey trousers. The second man did not leave the vehicle.

Anyone who witnessed the incident, or who has information which could help our inquiry, is asked to call 101 and provide the call handler with the reference 5219125468.
