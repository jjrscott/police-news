We’re appealing for witnesses to a number of incidents involving a white car in Frome.

At about 10.30am on Friday 28 June a witness reported seeing a driver assault a man in Whittox Lane.

The caller said a pedestrian gesticulated at a car he believed was going too fast past a child in a push chair.

The driver of the white Toyota Aygo got out of the car. He pushed the 60-year-old man to the ground before driving off at speed. The victim has a fractured wrist and bruising.

We had more calls about a white car being driven erratically in Badcox at 11am and of a car colliding with vehicles in Eggford Hill at about 12.30pm. Officers searched the area but found no trace of the man.

Enquiries continue and we’d like to hear from you if you:

 * Witnessed the incident on Whittox Lane
 * Saw a car, registration WV63 BKY, being driven in Frome on Friday 28 June
 * Saw who was driving it
 * Know where the car is now

If you can help, get in touch, quoting reference 5219145637.
