We’re appealing for help following a robbery of a vulnerable man in Chard.

The incident happened between 7.45-8pm on Monday 29 April in Jocelyn Park. The victim – am an in his 40s - was riding his red Carrera mountain bike – through the park when a group of four youths called him over.

They asked for a cigarette which the victim gave them and then one of them asked for a 50p piece. While the victim was looking for the money, one of the group grabbed notes from the wallet.

The same suspect that took the cash then grabbed the bike from the victim and rode off in the direction of Millfield.

We believe there may have been a number of people in the park at the time of the incident, who may have information to help our enquiries. We would like them or any of the males in the group who called the victim over to contact us.
