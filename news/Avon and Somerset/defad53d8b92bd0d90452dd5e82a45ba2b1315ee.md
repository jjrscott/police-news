Witness appeal after vehicle destroyed and house damaged by fire

Weâ€™re appealing for information following a car and property fire in Filton.

The incident happened on Friday 3 May shortly after 10pm.

Two men were reported to be carrying a large cube-shaped white canister, which they carried into Sixth Avenue.

They poured, what was believed to be an accelerant over a vehicle parked on a driveway of house, which they set fire to. The vehicle was destroyed and extensive damage caused to the house. Occupants in the property managed to escape without injury.

The suspects then left and walked to Filton Avenue before turning left towards Horfield.

We are keen to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time of the incident or has information to help our enquiries. We would particularly like to hear from anyone who may have sold or loaned a large white cube-shaped canister around this time.

Two men who were arrested on suspicion of arson have been released under investigation.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5219097437 **
