 * 11 Jul 2020: Investigation launched after man seriously assaulted on M5 slip road

Weâ€™re issuing a further appeal for information about a stabbing incident which happened on the southbound slip road of the M5 at junction 21 (Weston-super-Mare) a week ago.

A 26-year-old man suffered injuries following a dispute with another man at about 10pm on Friday 10 July.

The stabbing followed an incident on the southbound M5 from junction 19 to 21 involving three cars - a black Volvo V40, a black Volkswagen Golf and a grey Mercedes A class.

We want to speak to anyone who saw these vehicles being driven between junctions 19 and 21, especially those with Dash Cam footage from this stretch of the motorway between 9.40pm and 10pm on Friday 10 July.

A 42-year-old man has previously been arrested on suspicion of wounding with intent and remains released under investigation so further enquiries can be carried out.
