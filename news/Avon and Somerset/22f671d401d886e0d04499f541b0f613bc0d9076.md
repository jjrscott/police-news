**A woman and a man have been arrested for drugs supply offences in Bridgwater as well as drugs with an estimated £2000 in street value seized.**

On Friday (9 August), officers received intelligence that drug dealing activity was taking place in a property at St Matthews Green in Bridgwater.

Upon gaining entry to the property, officers found large amounts of drugs paraphernalia and evidence of suspected drug dealing.

Inside the property a 17 year old woman from London was searched and found in possession of a large amount of suspected Class A drugs believed to be crack cocaine and heroin including approximately 200 wraps, and approximately £600-£800 in cash.

The woman was subsequently arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs whilst a 40 year old man from Bridgwater inside the property was also arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs.

The man has agreed to voluntarily attend at a later date and the woman has been released under investigation.
