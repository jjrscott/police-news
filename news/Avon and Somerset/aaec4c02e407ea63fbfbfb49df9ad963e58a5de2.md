Independent charity Crimestoppers is now offering a £5,000 reward for information given to them which leads to a conviction over a racially-aggravated attack on an NHS worker in Bristol in July.

The 21-year-old man was left with serious injuries after being knocked down by a dark blue Honda Accord car on Monks Park Avenue, Horfield at 4.30pm on Wednesday 22 July.

Officers have since arrested four men on suspicion of attempted murder. They remain released under investigation as enquiries continue.

The NHS worker who was knocked down and racially abused continues to receive medical treatment for serious facial injuries and a broken leg.

Now the charity is offering the reward of up to £5,000 for information given directly to Crimestoppers which leads to the conviction of those responsible.
