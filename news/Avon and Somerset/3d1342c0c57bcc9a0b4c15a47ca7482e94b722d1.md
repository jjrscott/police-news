We're appealing for witnesses and information after an incident in Middle Street, Yeovil, at about 8.45pm on Saturday 31 October.

Patrolling officers came across a group of people involved in an altercation in the street shortly after a vehicle was damaged.

There were a number of people in the area at the time and investigating officers want to hear from anyone who saw the incident or who has dashcam or phone footage which could help the investigation.

A man arrested on suspicion of criminal damage at the time was later released under investigation while enquiries continue.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5220246912 **

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
