We want to hear from anyone who can help us with our enquiries into a burglary in Street earlier this month.

A residential address was broken into in the Green Lane area at some point between Friday 15 January and Monday 18 January.

A number of items, including building materials and personal documents, have been reported stolen.

House-to-house enquiries are being undertaken as part of our investigation.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5221012459 **
