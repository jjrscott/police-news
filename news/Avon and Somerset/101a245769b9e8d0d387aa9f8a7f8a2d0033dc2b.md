We’re investigating an incident in which a car was struck by a van during a burglary in East Pennard.

At about 9.45pm on Friday 30 August, two people were disturbed while breaking into outbuildings near The Lodge off the A37.

The offenders got into a white high-top Transit van, which was parked in Ditcheat Road, and drove into the victim’s BMW to make their escape, pushing it into the A37.

The van has then been driven through Ditcheat and was later abandoned at a barn in Alhampton and set on fire.

We’re appealing to anyone who saw any part of this incident to come forward with information and if anyone was driving in these areas at the time, please check to see if you have Dash Cam footage which may be of use to us.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5219200402 **
