Bristol Magistrates' Court

John Charles Beebe, of no fixed abode, has appeared at Bristol Magistrates’ Court charged with burglary and fraud by false representation.

Beebe, aged 40, appeared in court yesterday (Tuesday, September 24) in connection with a burglary of a pub in the Henleaze area of Bristol on Sunday (22 September) in which over £600 worth of cash and two credit cards were stolen.

No plea was entered and Beebe has been remanded in custody to appear at Bristol Crown Court at a later date.
