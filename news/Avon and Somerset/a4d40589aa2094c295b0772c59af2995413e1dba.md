We’re appealing for information following an assault on a motorist that took place at around 8.15am on Thursday 1 October in Bath.

The victim was sitting in his car at traffic lights at the junction of Newbridge Road as it joins the A4 dual carriageway towards Bristol when an unknown man started banging on the driver door window and shouting and swearing at him. He then caused damage to the driver door wing mirror.

When the victim got out of his car to inspect the damage, the offender returned and assaulted him.

The offender is described as white, just shorter than 6ft, aged in his late 40s to early 50s, with greying receding hair. He was driving a silver van.

We’d like to hear from anyone who saw what happened or may have dash cam footage of the incident. If you can help, contact police on 101 and give the call handler the reference 5220222597.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5220222597 **

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
