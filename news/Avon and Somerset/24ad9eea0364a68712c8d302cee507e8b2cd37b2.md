We're appealing for help to trace these two people as part of our investigation into an assault.

It happened in the smoking area outside the Plough Inn, Station Road, Taunton, between 12.45am and 1.15am on Sunday 12 May.

A 36-year-old man was headbutted. He is having ongoing dental work on a chipped tooth. The victim had other facial injuries treated at Musgrove Park Hospital.

He describes his attacker as a white man, more than 6 feet tall and stocky, with short blond hair. The suspect wore a blue polo shirt with red and white stripes and chino trousers or shorts.

We'd like to speak to this man and woman who were in the pub at around the time.

If you have any information which could help, get in touch, quoting reference 5219104188.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5219104188 **

You can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100 per cent anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.
