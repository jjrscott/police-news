Weâ€™re appealing for witnesses following a serious road traffic collision in Bath last night.

The incident involving a pedestrian and a car happened shortly before 10pm in Pulteney Road, near its junction with Bathwick Hill.

A man in his 20s suffered life threatening head injuries and remains in hospital in a critical condition.

The road remained closed until 5.50am today to allow collision investigators to make a detailed examination of the scene.

They are appealing for witnesses to the collision.
