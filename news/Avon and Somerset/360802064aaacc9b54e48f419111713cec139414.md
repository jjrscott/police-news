 * 29 Sep 2020: Man charged with the murder of Andre Gayle in Bristol

Three people are due in court tomorrow, Friday 2 October, charged with the murder of Andre Gayle in Bristol.

A 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named due to his age, and two men, Rico Corbin and Tyan Finlayson, both aged 27 and of Speedwell, were charged today, Thursday 1 October. They all remain in custody pending their appearance at Bristol Magistratesâ€™ Court.

Andre, 29, died in hospital two days after suffering stab wounds during an incident in Easton in the early hours of Monday 31 August.

Four people in total have now been charged over his death.

Jerome Lewis, 24, from London, appeared before magistrates on Tuesday 29 September and was remanded in custody pending his appearance before the Crown Court later this month.

Ten other people, aged between 16 and 40, have been arrested in connection with the investigation.
