We’re releasing CCTV images of several men we’d like to identify in connection with a disorder at a Bristol pub.

The incident happened at the Luckwell Hotel on Luckwell Road at approximately 6.20pm on 1 December last year.

No one was seriously injured but significant damage was caused to the pub.

It’s believed those involved had planned to attend Bristol City’s match against Millwall which took place the following day.

Four men were arrested from a hotel in the city the morning after the disorder and remain released under investigation while enquiries continue.

If you recognise anyone in the CCTV images, or have information about the disorder, please phone 101 and provide the call handler with the reference 5218266710.
