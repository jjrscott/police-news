We’re appealing for witnesses after a female driver failed to stop at the scene of a two-vehicle collision in Bath Road, Frome, at around 7am on Tuesday 28 May.

The collision involved a silver Vauxhall Corsa and a Nissan Qashqai. The driver of the Corsa left the scene and got into another vehicle a short distance away. It’s possible she may have suffered injuries.
