A 20-year-old man suffered a fractured skull and a bleed on the brain after being stamped on during an unprovoked assault in Bath.

The victim was on the Bristol to Bath cycle path, by the bridge near to the Lidl store, when he was assaulted by another man at around 4.45pm on Wednesday 2 October.

The offender is described as white, 6ft, of stocky build, with short dark hair, and he was with a woman, also white and wearing a padded jacket. The victim said the woman appeared to be upset prior to the assault taking place.

After the assault, both the man and woman ran off towards the city centre.

The cycle path was busy at the time and we’re appealing for any cyclists or pedestrians who saw any part of this incident, or who saw a couple matching the descriptions given in the area at the time. We’d particularly like to identify any cyclists with head cam footage which could help our investigation.
