We’re appealing for information following a burglary that took place on Wednesday 11 November at a farm shop in Somerset.

An unknown offender forced entry to the premises in North Perrot at 9.35pm by smashing a window, and proceeded to steal two tills containing cash.

The offender is described as a white man of stocky/large build, wearing a long sleeved top, a gilet with a hood, and dark tracksuit trousers with white stripes.

Following the incident a car was heard driving away at speed, thought to be heading in the direction of Dorset.

We’re releasing CCTV footage of a man police are keen to speak to in connection with this incident.
