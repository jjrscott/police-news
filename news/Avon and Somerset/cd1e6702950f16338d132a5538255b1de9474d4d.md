 * 08 Feb 2021: Update on investigation into man's death in Kingswood

An investigation is under way into the death of a man in Kingswood.

We were called at 3am today (Sunday 7 February) to a house in Kennard Road by the ambulance service to a report a man in his twenties had suffered a serious injury. He was sadly pronounced dead a short time later.

DCI Darren Hannant, of the Major Crime Investigation Team, said: “At this stage we’re treating the death as suspicious and a 25-year-old man has been arrested.

“A forensic post-mortem examination will now be carried out to determine the cause of the man’s death and the property has been cordoned off so further enquiries can take place.

“The victim’s family are aware will be supported by a specialist liaison officer.

“We know this incident will cause concern to those living in the local area so there will be additional patrols of the area over the coming days.”

If you have information about this incident and haven’t yet spoken with the police, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number 5221026964.
