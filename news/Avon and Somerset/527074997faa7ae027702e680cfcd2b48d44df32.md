Appeal for witnesses

Weâ€™re appealing for witnesses to a robbery in Frome.

A 17-year-old boy was approached by three men aged in their late teens or early 20s in Victoria Park on Saturday night (7 Sept).

The offenders initially asked the boy for money before searching him, prompting him to call out for help. He was then punched in the face by one of the men multiple times.

The incident happened sometime between 11.30pm and 11.45pm.

The offender who assaulted the victim is described as being approximately 5ft 9ins tall with blonde hair. He was wearing tracksuit trousers and a long-sleeved top.

Another was said to be 6ft tall and wearing a puffa-style jacket.

A lighter, a set of keys and an ID card were stolen in the incident.

Anyone who witnessed the incident, or who has information which could help our inquiry, is asked to call 101 and provide the call handler with the reference 5219206854.
