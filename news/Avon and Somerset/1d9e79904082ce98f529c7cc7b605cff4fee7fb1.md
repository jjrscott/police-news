 * 11 Sep 2019: Appeal for information following road traffic collision

We’re renewing our appeal for witnesses following a serious collision on the A37 Wells Road, Bristol.

The incident involved a dark-coloured VW car and a bicyclist and occurred at approximately 8.15pm on Friday (6 September) around the Petherton Road junction on the inbound carriageway.

The cyclist, a 37-year-old man, sustained serious head injuries and remains in hospital in a critical condition.

As part of our investigation we’ve reviewed CCTV from the area and have identified two vehicles that were in the area at the time.

We believe the occupants of a dark-coloured convertible BMW and a white panelled van may have seen the collision and as such, we’re now keen to speak to them.

If you were in the area at the time or have any other information which could help, get in touch quoting reference 5219206114.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5219206114 **
