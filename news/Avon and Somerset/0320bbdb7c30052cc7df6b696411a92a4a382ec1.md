Two men have been arrested in connection with a stabbing in the Fishponds area of Bristol on New Year’s Day.

The men, aged 22 and 28, remain in custody after being arrested on suspicion of wounding with intent following a 15-year-old being injured in Downend Road at about 12.20pm.

The teenager is continuing to recover from the incident in hospital.
