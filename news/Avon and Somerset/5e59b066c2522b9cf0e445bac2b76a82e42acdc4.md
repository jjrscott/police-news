The festive season has arrived. For many this is a time for happy reunions and celebrations, however the reality for others is quite different. This year will be particularly difficult for a lot of people. COVID-19 restrictions, the prospect of not being able to see loved ones as usual, increases in unemployment, as well as financial hardship could lead to a rise in abuse taking place at home.

Last December, we logged a total of 3,063 cases of domestic abuse – 10.9% higher than the average of the total number of domestic abuse cases recorded between January and November (2,762 cases). Also logged were a total of 132 child abuse, child sexual exploitation, and child sexual abuse cases - 8.5% higher than the average total number of cases recorded between January and November (122 cases).

More than ever, we’re urging communities to look out for one another, to learn to identify the signs of someone being abused, and to know the steps to take if they suspect someone is being abused.

It can be difficult to spot the signs of abuse. However, trust your instincts, if you sense something isn’t quite right with a friend, family member, or colleague, they could be a victim of abuse. Remember abuse thrives on silence and so starting a conversation is vital. If you think someone is a victim, be curious and talk to them. Ask and ask again, and provide support where possible.
