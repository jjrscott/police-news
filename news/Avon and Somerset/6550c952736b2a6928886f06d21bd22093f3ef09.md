More than 7000 people came along to our annual Emergency Services Open Day at Police & Fire HQ in Portishead yesterday (Sunday 15 September).

It was an action packed day, with stands and exhibitions located across the site as well as number of exciting demonstrations including displays from the Police Dogs and Horses, Firearms and a Public Order display.

As well as showcasing the vital work that the Emergency Services carry out every day it was also an opportunity to highlight how we work with partner organisations in our local communities.

Our visitors enjoyed the sunshine as they explored the site, taking part in the many activities that were on offer. One of the most popular was our Junior Detectives workshop which gave our younger visitors the chance to work alongside our Major Crime Investigations Team to solve a crime.

Here are some of favourite moments from the Open Day. If you were there weâ€™d love to see your photographs, please share them via Facebook or Twitter
