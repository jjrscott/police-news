**Three people have been arrested in Bath in relation to drugs supply offences.**

**** A 39 year old man from Bath has been arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs whilst a 35 year old woman from Bath has been arrested on suspicion of possession of Class A drugs.

Yesterday (Wednesday 7 August) in Bath city centre at around midday, plain clothes officers observed two individuals suspected to be engaging in drug dealing activity. Officers detained both individuals in which a suspected wrap of heroin was recovered.

A search of an address the arrested man had been observed coming from – a flat in Norfolk Buildings, Bath – located three further individuals inside the flat alongside various items of drugs paraphernalia.

Following a search of the individuals a 55 year old man from Bath was found to be carrying a package of approximately 20 wraps of suspected heroin and crack, and was subsequently arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A.

The woman has admitted the possession offence and has been referred onto a drugs education programme. Enquiries continue regarding the two men arrested.
