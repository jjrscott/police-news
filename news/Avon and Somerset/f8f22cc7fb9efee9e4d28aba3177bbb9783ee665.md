Anyone who sees Gary Cavill should call 999.

We're asking the public to call the police if they see Gary Cavill or know where he may be.

A warrant was issued after Cavill failed to attend Yeovil Magistrates Court in March having being charged with driving and drug possession offences.

The 47-year-old is described as white, about 5ft 8ins to 5ft 11 ins and of a slim build.

Cavill does not have a permanent address but is known to have links with the Glastonbury and Wells areas.

Anyone who sees him is asked to call 999 immediately and give the call-handler reference number **5220058069**. Or, anybody who knows where he is likely to be, should call 101.
