**We are appealing for information to help recover a number of items stolen from a wedding near Chard in Somerset.**

The items include a personalised wooden post box containing numerous cards and monetary gifts, two grey milk churns without lids and with Boldon Dairy Milk on them, and a distinctive Dutch bottle of Genever.

The items are believed to have been stolen between the hours of 2:45am and 5:10am on 7 July from a farm in Otterford, Chard.

Detective Sergeant Scott Chadwick commented: “We’re appealing for anyone near the Chard area to please keep a look out for any of these stolen items. The milk churns are fairly sizeable and are quite distinctive with Boldon Dairy Milk written on them.

“We are working closely with the victims to identify any other notable items that have been stolen and encourage anyone with any information - however small or insignificant it may seem - to please get in touch.”

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5219153887 **
