We're seeking witness to a reported assault in a Taunton pub last month.

The incident occurred at the Black Horse Inn, in Bridge Street, at about 8.10pm on Sunday 6 September.

A woman in her 50s reported being pushed to the floor by a woman of roughly the same age. She injured her hip and required hospital treatment.

Enquiries are ongoing.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5220202467 **
