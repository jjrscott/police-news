A 17-year-old boy was attacked by a group of teenage boys on Fishponds Road, near to Eastville Park at around 11.45pm on Sunday, 26 May.

One of the offenders stole the victim’s phone during the assault before entering a nearby shop.

The victim then tried to retrieve his phone but was attacked a second time inside the shop.

During this incident, the victim was wounded when he was struck over the head with a glass bottle.

Three boys, aged 15, 16 and 17 have been arrested in connection with the incident. The 15-year-old was released on police bail while the others have been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

If anyone was witness to the incident, recorded footage of the incident or can help with the CCTV images. If so, please contact 101 and give the call handler the reference number 5219116993.
