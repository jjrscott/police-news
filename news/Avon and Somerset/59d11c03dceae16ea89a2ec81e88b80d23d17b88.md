Can you help us with information about an attempted robbery on a teenage boy in Bristol?

The incident happened between 9pm and 9.30pm on Sunday May 26 in Riverside Park near to the M32 between St Pauls and Easton.

PC 282 Bainbridge, who is investigating the attack, said: "This was a nasty attempted robbery on a 16-year-old boy who was on his own and set on by a group of six people who tried to steal his bag from him.

"He managed to fight the group off but the attack was so severe that he lost a tooth and consciousness after he got away."

There were six offenders in total three who appeared to be under 16 and three who looked over the age of 16.

If you were in the area at the time and saw anything that you think might help, or you have any information about this incident, please call 101 and quote reference number 5219116901.
