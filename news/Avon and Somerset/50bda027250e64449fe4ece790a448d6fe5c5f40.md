On Friday 30 August, officers from Avon and Somerset Police will be offering free bike security marking at Morrison’s in Weston Super Mare as part of efforts to crack down on bicycle theft in the area. We will be located on in the car park of the Morrison’s on Highlands Lane from 9am until 6.30pm.

Our bike marking security scheme started as a single unit and has now been rolled out force-wide, and with over 1,000 bikes being marked every month, is one of the largest in the country. The initiative aims to encourage bike owners to consider the security of their bikes by getting them visibly security marked and registered to deter thieves from stealing them.

We will be joined by Be Home Safe who will be available to offer crime prevention advice for homes, Crime Prevention Shed who will be present to show individuals how to secure their sheds, and Bristol Bike Theft Awareness, a non-profit that works with us to reduce motorbike crime in Bristol and its surrounding areas.

There will also be a free prize draw for local residents who will have the opportunity to win security products for their home. There will also be the opportunity to win a free home crime prevention assessment.

PC Gina Knight from Nailsea Police Station comments:
“Our force is leading the way in preventing bike theft thanks to the bike marking security scheme, which is helping us return stolen bikes to their owners. The initiative is available to anyone who owns a bike and is completely free of charge. Those interested in getting their bikes marked and registered can easily sign up to the scheme online, or come and talk to our neighbourhood policing teams at one of our bike marking stalls that are regularly set up in local communities.

“The scheme has proven to be extremely successful and has been key in deterring thieves from stealing bicycles. We encourage any bike owners to come and talk to us about how they can keep them safe and to get their bikes registered as soon as they can”.
