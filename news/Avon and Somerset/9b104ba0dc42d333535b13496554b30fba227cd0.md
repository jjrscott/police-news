Two men have been charged in relation to a number of commercial burglaries reported in Bristol over recent months.

He is charged with:
• Two burglaries at Tesco in Staple Hill in May where cigarettes and a quantity of cash were stolen
• Attempted burglary of the same store and a shop burglary on 1 June.
