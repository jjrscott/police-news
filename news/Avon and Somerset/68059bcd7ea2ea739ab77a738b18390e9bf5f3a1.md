Police are appealing for witnesses and information after a woman had her car stolen on West Coker Road in Yeovil.

It happened at about 10.30pm on Friday 13 September.

A man dragged the woman from her car near the Quicksilver Mail, leaving her shaken and distressed. He then drove off in the white Honda CR-V. Officers later found it crashed and abandoned in Pig Hill, Hardington Moor.

A 27-year-old man of no fixed abode has been arrested in connection with the incident. He is released under investigation and enquiries continue.

Officers are appealing for witnesses and information about the incident. Police are especially keen to trace any motorists who had to take evasive action due to a man walking in the road along Henford Hill a little earlier that night.
