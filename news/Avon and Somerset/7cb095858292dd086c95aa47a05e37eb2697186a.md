**We are appealing for any information to help identify this man pictured in the CCTV images.**

**** Just before 6pm on 30 March, a 49 year old man was hit on the back of the head by an unknown man causing him to fall to the floor unconscious. The victim had been walking from the Drawbridge Public House towards Baldwin Street when the incident occurred at the junction of Baldwin Street.

Weâ€™re keen to identify a man seen entering the Drawbridge Public House following the incident. He can be described as white, medium build with dark hair and a beard, and was wearing a grey jacket with dark blue jeans and blue and white trainers.

The man left the pub shortly after with a white female with dark hair and wearing a bright gold glittery jacket, a second white female in dark clothing and two boys believed to be between 12-15 years old. The group then got into a blue taxi outside of the Hippodrome.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5219068933 **
