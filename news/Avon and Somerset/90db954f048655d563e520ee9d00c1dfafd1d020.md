Tim Birt

The family of a man who died in a collision in Weston-super-Mare have issued a tribute.

Timothy Birt, 59, of Weston, leaves two children and his wife Jennie, who said: "Tim will be greatly missed. He was a loving family man, with a heart of gold. He was so passionate about so many things in life. His love of airplanes, motorbikes, family and of course cricket!

"With his wonderful sense of humour, infectious laugh, and joy for living, he will be forever in our thoughts. Rest in peace my Darling, from all your family and friends who loved you very much."

We continue to call for witnesses and anyone with dashcam footage which could help our investigation into the collision to come forward.

It happened at about 3.25pm on Sunday 1 September on the A370 Somerset Avenue. Mr Birt was riding his Aprilla motorcycle when he was involved in a collision with a Mercedes car. Both vehicles were travelling in the same direction, outbound from Weston-super-Mare towards the M5.

If you have any information which could help, get in touch, quoting reference 5219201549.

If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number ** 5219201549 **
