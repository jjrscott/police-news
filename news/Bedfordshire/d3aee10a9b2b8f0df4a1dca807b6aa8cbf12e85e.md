**We are supporting Safer Internet Day on Tuesday 5 February - an international event aiming to raise awareness of cyber crime, cyber bullying, data security and online personal safety.**

Safer Internet Day is the world's biggest event of this kind and is supported by hundreds of schools, community centres and police forces across the UK.

Ahead of Safer Internet Day, officers and staff will attend numerous events educating parents and children about online safety. Additionally the force will conduct awareness workshops with young volunteers from the police cadets.

With ever present digital technology, younger children now have access to the internet and online apps which makes them an easy target for criminals.

The UK Safer Internet Centre has developed educations packs for children as young as three years old, as well as materials for parents and carers on how to teach children to stay safe online.

Detective Inspector Richard Tilling, the force lead for Safer Internet Day, said: "We support Safer Internet Day every year as its impact is tremendous and it helps to spread the message about online safety worldwide.

"But I would also like to remind our communities that we should think about our own and our children's online activity every day of the year. I cannot stress enough how important it is to talk to your children about what they are up to online.

"It's crucial to teach young people that not everyone is who they say they are online and people can use fake identifies. It is important to teach children that they should never disclose any personal information to anyone they don't know in real life."

We are encouraging everyone who wishes to learn more about Safer Internet Day to visit its website to find out more about how to keep yourself safe online.
