**We are investigating a robbery at knifepoint in the early hours of Wednesday morning (14 August) in Thricknell Close, Luton. **

At approximately 1am, a group of friends was walking in the alley between Tricknell Close and Thrales Close when they were approached by a large group of men, who told one victim to give them everything he had.

One of the offenders put a knife to the victim's throat. The offenders then took the victim's wallet, watch, ring, bracelet and car keys and asked him where his car was. Four of the offenders then got into the victim's car and drove away towards Bramingham Road.

The group comprised approximately 12 to 15 young men, believed to be around 18 years of age. The group were described as being a mix of white and black men, all wearing balaclavas and dark clothes.

Anyone with information is asked to contact IO Cook-Smith through the force's online reporting centre or by calling 101 and quoting reference number 40/46757/19.
