**Police are appealing for information after a teenage boy was robbed. **

The 16-year-old was walking home when he was pushed to the ground from behind in Riddy Lane, Luton at around 1.30pm on Friday, 10 January.

One offender stood over him, pinned him to the ground by his throat and demanded his mobile, whilst another man stood close by.

The victim initially resisted, but when the offender threatened him verbally, and fearing the offender had a weapon, he handed over his phone.

The offender then asked the boy how much he would pay to get his phone back, and when he didn't answer, they made off.

The offenders are described as Asian, in their late teens and dressed in all black, wearing balaclavas.

PC Georgie Scott, investigating, said: "The victim was left shaken by this incident, which took place at lunchtime in a Luton street.

"If anyone was in the area at the time and saw the incident, or has any CCTV or dashcam footage which could help our investigation, please get in contact."

Anyone with any information can contact police on 101 or visit the online reporting centre on the force website, quoting reference 40/1875/20.

You can also contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
