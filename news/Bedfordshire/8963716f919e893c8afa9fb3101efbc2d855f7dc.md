Officers are appealing for information after a branch of Betfred in High Street North, Dunstable, was robbed yesterday (Sunday).

Police were called just after 9am to reports that two men with knives had entered the shop and demanded the code to the safe. They took around Â£4,000 and then left the shop and ran down Albion Street, towards the A5.

The offenders are described as having their faces, one wearing a bandana with a skull design on the front. The other man is described as wearing blue trainers and it is believed one may have been carrying a black rucksack.

Anyone with any information is asked to call DC Hannam on 101 quoting reference number 126 of 15 October. Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
