**Targeting speeding drivers in support of a European campaign will be a focus for the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit over the next two weeks.**

Sergeant Ian Manley, of the BCH RPU, said: "We know speed is one of the main contributing factors of collisions in our counties and I would urge people to stick to the speed limits, which are there to keep us all safe."

When not responding to emergencies, officers will be carrying out checks as well as engaging with, and educating, drivers at key locations across Beds, Cambs and Herts where the most killed and seriously injured collisions occur. It is in support of a campaign by TISPOL; Europe's traffic police network.

The number of notices of intended prosecution given for speeding in each county during the first six months of 2019 are as follows:

 * Bedfordshire - 36,541
 * Cambridgeshire - 26,755
 * Hertfordshire - 35,751

The majority of these offences occur on 30mph roads.

Sgt Manley continued: "There are around 90 fatal collisions across the three counties each year and speed is a factor in a number of these. For me the message is simple: slow down to save lives."
