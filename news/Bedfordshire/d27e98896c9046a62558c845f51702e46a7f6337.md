**We have arrested three men and two women on suspicion of drugs, theft and burglary offences, and seized a number of items, during an early morning operation in Potton, following reports of criminal activity.**

Yesterday (Thursday) at dawn, around 80 officers, including support from the dog section, officers on off-road bikes, community officers, the criminal investigation team, specialist search officers and the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Operational Support Unit, executed a search warrant at the Potton traveller site.

Chief Inspector Rachael Glendenning, leading the operation, said: "We have made five arrests following reports of criminality linked to this location, and an investigation is ongoing.

"We have a duty of care to the other residents, and to the wider local community, to ensure people can live safely, peacefully and lawfully.

"Criminality of any kind will not be tolerated within Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire, and wrongdoers must expect to face the consequences."

Two men have been bailed, and a man and two women have been released under investigation.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting Op Wasdale, or call independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111.
