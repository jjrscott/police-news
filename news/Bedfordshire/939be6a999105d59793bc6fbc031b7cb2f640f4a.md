**A man has been arrested following an incident in Luton in the early hours of this morning (Sunday).**

Just before 1am, a man was stabbed in Dallow Road. Police have arrested a man in connection with the incident, and he remains in police custody for questioning.

The victim was taken to hospital, where he remains in a stable condition.

Detective Sergeant Ben Stone from the force's Crime Investigation Team said: "Firstly I hope to offer some reassurance to our communities; we believe this incident this morning was targeted, and we don't believe there is any threat to the wider community.

"Following the incident, residents may have seen an increased police presence in the Dallow Road area while we have been carrying out enquiries. This will continue over the coming days, with our Luton Community Policing Teams remaining in the area to provide providing a visible presence.

"There has been some speculation about the condition of the victim, so I would like to take this opportunity to confirm he remains in hospital in a stable condition. Although his injuries are serious, at this time they are not believed to be life-threatening."

An investigation continues.
