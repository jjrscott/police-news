**Our Assistant Chief Constable, Jackie Sebire, has been appointed to the board of directors of the Sport and Recreation Alliance.**

ACC Sebire has more than 25 years' of policing experience and holds the national portfolio for serious youth violence for the National Police Chiefs Council.

She said: "The work of the Sport and Recreation Alliance is incredibly important, and I am thrilled to now have joined the board.

"Using the power of sport to connect with young people, through grassroots initiatives, is absolutely vital to the work that I'm doing to tackle serious youth violence and exploitation.

"We have already done lots of work with young people involved with the alliance, and I look forward to continuing to work with them on exciting projects going forward."

The Sport and Recreation Alliance brings together organisations from across both sectors to speak with one voice to Government, policy makers and the media.

Andrew Moss, chair of the alliance, said: "I am delighted with the appointment of Jackie Sebire to our board at the alliance.

"She brings a significant wealth of knowledge around working with young people, particularly given her role as lead for the National Police Chiefs Council on serious violent crime and her safeguarding background.

"Her desire to help and support the most vulnerable young people ties directly into our work to ensure every child has the right to be active.

"Many of our members will have heard Jackie speak recently at our annual conference; her passion, drive and experience is very much welcomed."
