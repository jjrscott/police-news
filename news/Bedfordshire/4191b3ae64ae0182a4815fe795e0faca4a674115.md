**Hoteliers from across Bedfordshire attended a training conference on Friday (16 March) to learn about the signs of Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE).**

More than 20 hotels were represented at the free event hosted by Bedfordshire Police, Luton Borough Council, Central Bedfordshire Council and Bedford Borough Council at The Chiltern Hotel in Luton.

The event was specifically designed for hotel employees in public facing roles, and attendees ranged from management to receptionists. Attendees heard from speakers from Bedfordshire Police, YouTurn Futures and CYP First, and the event aimed to increase their awareness of understanding of CSE, and outline how to report concerns.

Pete Gomm, Bedfordshire Police's CSE Co-ordinator said: "Hotels can be used as locations to meet and groom children, so it's vital that we work with Bedfordshire's hoteliers to ensure they are aware of the signs of CSE and know how to report any concerns. I was pleased to see so many people attend the conference, supportive of our work and our messaging and I look forward to continuing to work with other hotels in the future."

Lisa Robinson, Bedfordshire's CSE Coordinator, said "Across Bedfordshire we are tackling CSE together; the support, awareness and response of hoteliers is key to preventing CSE from happening within their settings. We will continue to raise awareness and safeguard children together."
