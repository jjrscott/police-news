**People who go above and beyond to help their local communities were celebrated on Friday (16 February) at the annual Bedfordshire Police Community Cohesion awards**.

The force's Community Cohesion team hosted the awards evening, now in its fourth year, to thank all the community members whose support has been vital in maintaining harmony of communities across the county over the year.

The event was a great success, with more than 400 people from across the county joining the force to celebrate achievements in 15 different award categories.

Chief Inspector Hob Hoque, who leads community policing in the south and central areas of the county, and who organised the awards evening, said: "This really was a fantastic evening and it was great to see so many people from different communities come together to celebrate the achievements of our award winners. Each person who was nominated really does make a huge difference to the people of Bedfordshire, so I'd like to say a big well done to them all.

"I would also like to take the opportunity to say thank you to all our sponsors, without whom this event wouldn't be possible, and of course to the community cohesion team for all their hard work in creating such a spectacular event."

More than Â£7,000 was also raised during the evening for the Community Cohesion team's charity of choice, Sienna's Footsteps. Visit the Just Giving page to find out more.
