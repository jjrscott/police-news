**We are appealing for witnesses following a break in a post office in Arlesey in the early hours of this morning (Thursday).**

Just before 4am, two men wearing balaclavas entered the property by damaging the lock on the front door.

They then attempted to remove the cash point using an angle grinder and a blow torch but were unsuccessful.

They left the premises and made off in a silver Audi TT in the direction of the train station.

Anyone with any information can contact us through our online reporting centre or by calling 101, quoting reference 40/10489/19.

Alternatively, call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
