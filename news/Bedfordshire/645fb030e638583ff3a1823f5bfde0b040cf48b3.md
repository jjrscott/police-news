**We are appealing for witnesses after a pedestrian was seriously injured after a road traffic collision in Bedford on Friday (30 November.)**

At approximately 10.50am, officers were called to a collision between the pedestrian and a black Audi at the junction of Marlborough Road and Winifred Road.

Emergency services attended and the woman, who is in her 30s, was taken to hospital with injuries to one of her legs, where she remains in a serious but stable condition.

PC Chris Leah, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit, investigating, said: "We are appealing for anyone who was at the junction of Marlborough Road and Winifred Road and may have seen the black Audi in the area prior to the collision to contact us so we can establish what happened."

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101 or via our online reporting tool, quoting reference 124 of 30 November.
