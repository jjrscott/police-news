We are appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Bedford on Monday (12 February).

At around 5.30pm, an 18-year-old man was cycling in the High Street, at the junction with Silver Street, near to The Cross Keys public house, when he was stopped by three men and a woman. Threats were made to harm him and his silver Carrera "Axle" bike was stolen.

Anyone with information is asked to contact us via our online reporting centre or call 101 quoting JH/6990/2018. You can also give information to Crimestoppers, anonymously, by calling 0800 555 111.
