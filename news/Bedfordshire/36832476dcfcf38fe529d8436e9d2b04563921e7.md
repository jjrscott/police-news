**We are supporting a national week-long operation as part of our ongoing efforts to tackle knife crime.**

Operation Sceptre starts on Monday (16 September) and sees forces across the country run activity to support the operation.

As part of the week-long operation, the force will be running operational activity including weapons sweeps, to recover weapons that have been hidden for future use or discarded, and patrols in knife crime hotspot areas.

On Monday, the first day of the operation, Police Community Support Officers and community police officers will be out across the county speaking to the public about knife crime and encouraging them to report information about knife crime in their area.

It comes amidst a wave of new initiatives to tackle serious violence by the county's police force and their partners, including the new Â£880,000 Violence and Exploitation Reduction Unit.

Superintendent Jaki Whittred, the force's lead for knife crime, said: "Operation Sceptre forms a vital part of our approach to tackling knife crime, ensuring we remove knives from the streets and tackling those who use weapons to cause fear or harm to others.

"However it's not all we do - we continue to work with schools to educate young people about the dangers of carrying weapons. It's also important for us to continue to work with our communities, as we need their support to tackle knife crime."

Anyone with any information about knife crime in their area is asked to call 101, or 999 in an emergency.
