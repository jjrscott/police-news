**We are appealing for witnesses after a generator was stolen from a vehicle parked in Leighton Buzzard.**

At around 1pm on Thursday (11 October), the vehicle - a large mobile showroom - was parked on Duncombe Drive, near to the fire station.

A car parked up nearby, and four men got out and approached the showroom. One of the men went straight to the driver's door and pushed against it, not allowing the driver to leave.

While he was doing this, the other men approached a power generator next to the vehicle, picked it up and put it in their car. By the time the victim and his colleagues had been able to get out of the vehicle the four men had driven away.

Anyone with any information is asked to call 101 quoting reference number 40/30504/18. Alternatively, report information online by visiting our reporting centre or by calling independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
