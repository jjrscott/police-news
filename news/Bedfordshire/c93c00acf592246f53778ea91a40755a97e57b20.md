**We are appealing for information after an aggravated burglary in Luton this morning (Tuesday).**

At approximately 3.50am, three men entered a property on Dale Road and went up the stairs.

A man heard the intruders and got out of bed, at which point the three men fled the scene, leaving behind an item of clothing, a saw and a metal rod.

The offenders are described as wearing masks. It's not known in which direction they left the property.

Detective Inspector Lee Martin, from our Crime Investigation Team, said: "This incident has left the occupants of the house shaken.

"I am keen to hear from anyone who saw three men in the area around the time of the offence, or saw anyone who was acting suspiciously."

Anyone with any information is asked to report using our reporting tool at www.bedfordshire.police.uk/report, quoting reference number 57 of 4 August.

Alternatively, you can call independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
