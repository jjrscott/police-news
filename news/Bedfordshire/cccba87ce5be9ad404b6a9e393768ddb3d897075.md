**We are appealing for information after more than Â£100,000 worth of Asian jewellery was stolen from a house in Luton. **

Between 12.30pm and 6.45pm on Wednesday 7 February, burglars broke into a property in Blenheim Crescent and stole a substantial amount of jewellery along with cash.

Officers are appealing for anyone who witnessed suspicious activity in the area, or who has been offered the items for sale, to get in touch.

Detective Constable Tracey Joyce said: "This is a high value burglary which we are taking very seriously and I would urge anyone with information to come forward.

"We are issuing images of some the stolen items in the hope that if anyone has been offered them for sale, they may recognise them and come forward.

"If you are ever in doubt over the legitimacy of items being sold to you, please take as many details as possible and contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact DC Joyce on 101 quoting reference number C/6260/18 or visit the our online reporting centre. You can also give information anonymously, via Crimestoppers, on 0800 555 111.
