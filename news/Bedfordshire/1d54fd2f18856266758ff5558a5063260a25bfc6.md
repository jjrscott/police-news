**After a car was stolen during a burglary in Luton, we're appealing for information from the public.**

At some point between 10.30pm on Monday (25 March) and 4.30am on Tuesday (26 March), a house in Trimley Close was burgled.

During the burglary a set of car keys, and subsequently the car, were taken.

The car is a 'chrome copper' Ford Fiesta, with the registration number LT18 VEB.

PC Alexandra Harpin is investigating and said: "The car is a limited edition colour and there aren't many of the same colour around. We're keen to ensure the car can be returned to its rightful owner so it would be useful to hear from any members of the public who spot a copper coloured Ford Fiesta in the area, so we can establish whether it is the same car that has been taken."

Anyone with any information is asked to call 101 quoting reference number 40/17475/19. You can also report information by visiting www.bedfordshire.police.uk/report or by calling independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
