**Our officers have successfully obtained a three month closure order for two properties in Luton, following a hearing at Luton Magistrates ' Court on Friday 20 April.**

The two properties in Ruthin Close, Luton were initially served with 24 hour closure notices on Thursday 19 April, following reports of drug criminality in the area.

PC Michael Trinder, from the Luton Community Team, said: "We are satisfied with the court's decision to close these two addresses as they were a source of nuisance and criminal behaviour in the area."

"If you suffer from any issues in your neighbourhood, hopefully this result will serve as an example that we take all reports of crime seriously. We are dedicated to keeping our town a peaceful and safe place to live and work in."
