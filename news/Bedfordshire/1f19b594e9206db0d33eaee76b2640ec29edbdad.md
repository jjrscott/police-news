A total of 36 weapons and over 500 rounds of ammunition were handed into Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire police forces as a result of a national firearms surrender campaign that ran between Saturday 20 July and Sunday 4 August.

Of these, three air rifles, two war trophy handguns and a toy replica were surrendered in Bedfordshire, along with over 50 rounds of live shotgun and rifle ammunition.

Chief Supt Catherine Akehurst, Firearms Surrender Campaign Lead for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire police forces said: "As a result of the surrender campaign a number of illegally held, lethal firearms from across the three forces are now safely off the streets and away from criminal hands.

"Although the campaign has now ended the three forces will continue to work closely with partners and local communities to proactively tackle gun crime."

Detective Superintendent Duncan Young said: "Initiatives like this are really important, and we were pleased to support the campaign. I am particularly pleased that so much ammunition from Bedfordshire has been surrendered; it now can't be used by anyone intending to cause harm to our communities. Our work to tackle serious violence, which includes the use of weapons, continues year-round and we are committing to apprehending those involved in this kind of activity."

If anyone knows someone who illegally owns a weapon, they should call 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
