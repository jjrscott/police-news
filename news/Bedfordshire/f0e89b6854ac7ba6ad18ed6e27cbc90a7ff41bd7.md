**We are investigating a break in that took place in Julius Gardens in Luton last Tuesday (5 March) and we are appealing for witnesses.**

At approximately 3.50am, a man was woken up by noise on the ground floor of his property. He walked down to check and saw a man standing in his living room before he was hit on the head by the second offender. He fell to the floor and when he came around the offenders were gone.

Nothing appears to have been taken.

DC Kevin Howes, investigating, said: "This was a disturbing robbery which left the victim understandably shaken. Burglary is an upsetting crime as everyone deserves to feel safe in their own home.

"We are keen to speak to anyone who have witnessed anything suspicious in this neighbourhood."

Anyone with information about this break in is asked to contact DC Howes by calling 101 or through online reporting centre and quoting reference number 40/12959/19.

Alternatively you contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
