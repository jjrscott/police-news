**We are appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Luton on Monday (11 February) where an elderly victim was targeted. **

Between approximately 9.50am and 10.50am, the victim was walking along Leamington Road with her dog when a car that was being driven by a man stopped next to her. Two women got out and one approached the victim and tried to put a necklace around her neck. The victim resisted and there was a short altercation.

The women then got back into the car and it drove away. Later that day the victim realised that the actual necklace she had been wearing had been stolen. The women were described as Asian, one in her 40s and the other around 16-years-old.

Anyone with information is asked to call Bedfordshire Police on 101 or report information online by visiting www.bedfordshire.police.uk/report and quote reference number 40/8572/19.

Alternatively, call independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
