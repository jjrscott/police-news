We are appealing for information following an incident in which a motorbike was damaged with a chainsaw.

At approximately 11am on Monday (25 May) a man was riding an off-road bike in a public field when he was approached by a man who was holding a chainsaw.

The victim got off the bike and ran away. The offender has subsequently used the chainsaw to damage the bike.

The suspect is described as a white man in his 40s, approximately six feet tall, clean shaven and bald with a tattoo across his chest. At the time of the incident he was not wearing a shirt and was carrying an orange chainsaw.

PC Shauna Brown, who is investigating, said: "This appears to be an isolated but nonetheless disturbing incident which left the victim understandably shaken.

"This has happened in broad daylight and we are keen to speak to anyone with any information about it.

"If you were in that park at the time and noticed anything suspicious, please get in touch."

Anyone with information about this crime is asked to contact PC Brown on 101 or online by quoting reference number 40/28105/20.

Alternatively you can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
