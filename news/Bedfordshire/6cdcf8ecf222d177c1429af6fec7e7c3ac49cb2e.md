We are seeking witnesses to come forward following a robbery at a bookmakers in Bedford on Saturday (6 January).

At approximately 8.15pm, two men entered Betfred on Cardington Road and demanded money. After threatening staff with a crowbar, the suspects made off with a quantity of cash.

We would like to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time who may have information that could assist their investigation. In particular officers are keen to speak to anyone who saw a white car, thought to be a Vauxhall Mokka, acting suspiciously in and around the area.

Anyone with information is asked to contact DC Nandre on 101 quoting reference JH/839/2018, or contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
