### Detectives from our force are appealing for information, after a woman in her late 80s was the victim of a burglary in Bedford yesterday (Wednesday).

At around 9am, a man forced his way into the property on Waveney Avenue, and knocked the woman to the floor, before leaving the house with her purse, which contained a quantity of cash and her bank cards.

The victim required assistance from the ambulance service, but was not injured.

The offender is described as a white man, tall and slim, with a pale complexion and dishevelled clothing.

Detective Constable David Pawelek, from our Crime Investigation Team, said: "Targeting our community's most vulnerable is appalling.

"We are doing all we can to investigate this incident and safeguard the victim, who was left badly shocked.

"If you were in the area and saw this man, or have found a small black purse discarded, please do get in touch."

People with information are asked to contact us via our online reporting centre, quoting reference 40/40706/20.

Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 55 111.
