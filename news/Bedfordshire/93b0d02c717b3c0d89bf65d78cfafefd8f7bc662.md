We are appealing for information following a road traffic collision on the A505 Leighton Buzzard Bypass.

On Wednesday (24 February) at around 8.20pm, a silver Corsa, a white Mercedes and a blue Nissan were involved in a collision along the A505 towards the M1.

Emergency services attended and the road was closed to deal with the incident. Two people were taken to hospital with injuries, and one person remains in hospital but in a stable condition.

Sergeant Sam Cordingley, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Roads Policing Unit, said: "We would like to speak to anyone who witnessed the collision, saw the vehicles in the time leading up to it, or has dashcam footage as this would really help with our enquiries.

"We believe a person with a fire extinguisher assisted those involved and we are keen to speak to them as we believe they may have information vital to our investigation."

Any witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage can get in contact through the Bedfordshire Police online reporting centre.

Alternatively, you can call 101 and quote Operation Carndonagh.
