We are appealing for information about a car-jacking robbery in Luton.

Shortly after 7.30am on Saturday (15 February), the victim was parked outside Lewsey Park swimming pool in Pastures Way when a man approached his car to ask for directions.

The offender then tried to force entry to the car and take the keys from the ignition, before a second man got into the passenger side and dragged the victim out of the car, before assaulting him.

The two men then drove off in the victim's car. The victim was left with facial injuries, but was able to track his mobile phone within the car and located the vehicle in Coverdale Road

Detective Constable Catherine Layton said: "This brazen attack took place in broad daylight, in an area that is popular with dog walkers and has a lot of through-traffic at that time.

"I would appeal for anyone who was in the area at the time and saw anything suspicious, or may have any dashcam footage of the offence, to please get in contact with us so that we can find the people responsible and prevent further similar incidents."

Please call Bedfordshire Police on 101 quoting the reference 40/9696/20 with any information, or get in touch via our online reporting centre.
