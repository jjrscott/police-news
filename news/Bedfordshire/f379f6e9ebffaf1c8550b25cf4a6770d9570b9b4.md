**We are appealing for witnesses to a road traffic collision which took place on Friday (18 December), in which one man died.**

The incident occurred on the westbound carriageway of the A6001, between the A1 roundabout and the Sainsbury's roundabout, at around 2.10pm, involving a red Renault Kadjar and a white Vauxhall Zafira.

Emergency services attended, and a man in his 70s was pronounced dead at the scene.

An investigation has now been launched and officers are appealing for witnesses.

Sergeant James Thorne, of our Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Roads Policing Unit, said: "We are investigating the circumstances of the collision and are asking for anyone with information, and in particular dash cam footage, to get in touch.

"If you saw the red Renault or the white Vauxhall before the incident, you may be able to assist with our enquiries."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Bedfordshire Police via the force's website, quoting reference Operation Charles.
