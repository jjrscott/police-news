In case you missed it - you can watch the Sky News documentary on our funding challenges.

Our funding issues are no secret - being financed as a small, rural force but dealing with complex crime challenges more usually seen in large metropolitan areas.

Tackling guns, gangs, knife crime - plus doing all we can to keep people safe.
