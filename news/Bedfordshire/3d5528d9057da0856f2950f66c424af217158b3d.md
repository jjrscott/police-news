**We are appealing for information after two men attacked another man and stole his bike.**

The incident took place at around 10pm on Friday (22 March), at the junction of Austin Road and Lucerne Road, Luton.

The victim was riding a Specialised Crosstrail bike along Austin Road and stopped at the side of the road to roll up a cigarette.

Two men then approached the victim and knocked him off the bike before stealing it.

The suspects were unsuccessful in also stealing the victim's bag, but did manage to steal some items from within it, including some medication.

They left the scene on foot along Lucerne Road in the direction of Moat Lane.

The attackers are described as two Asian men, who were both wearing dark clothing with their hoods up.

Detective Constable Mandy Godfree, investigating, said: "This was an unprovoked and nasty attack and we would like to hear from anyone in the area who may have seen or heard something.

"We would particularly like to hear from someone in a red Volkswagen Golf, who tried to help the victim."

Anyone with any information is asked to contact police on 101 or through our online reporting centre, quoting reference 40/16794/19.

You can also contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
