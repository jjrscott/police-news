**Officers from Bedfordshire Police were in Bedford on Wednesday (17 January) in a drive to combat speeding motorists and keep people safe on the county 's roads.**

Following discussions with local residents, speeding was highlighted as a key concern in Kempston and the Kingsbrook/Cauldwell area and, in response, speed guns were deployed to catch offending motorists.

Over the course of the day, 203 vehicles were checked, seven tickets were issued and 11 drivers were reprimanded.

Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs) also undertook door-to-door research to find out from local residents what issues affect them and what their policing priorities are. In addition, a mobile police station was set up to promote and recruit more volunteers to the Community Speed Watch scheme.

PCSO Emily Hurst, who organised the day of action, said: "Speeding remains one of the most common causes of injury and deaths on our roads so it's important that we take action to combat the 'need to speed' and keep everyone safe.

"By holding days like this, we can work with the local community to find out where the most common places motorists are likely to speed and to raise awareness of the dangers of speeding. We are committed to tacking issues that matter to our communities."
