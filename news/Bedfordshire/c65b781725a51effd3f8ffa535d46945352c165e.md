**Our detectives have launched an investigation following a violent disorder in the Lewsey Park area of Luton on Wednesday (15 July). **

Just before 10.30pm, police were called to reports of a large group of people fighting with weapons at the end of a car park in Pastures Way. Two men suffered minor injuries and two vehicles were damaged during the incident.

A/Detective Sergeant Ben Stone, from our Crime Investigation Team, said: "This was an unacceptable act of violence that took place in a public area. We are fortunate that nobody was seriously injured but innocent people had to witness such appalling viciousness.

"We have arrested five people in connection with this incident, who have been released under investigation, but there are more people who were involved in this disorder who we would like to identify.

"If you saw anything or have any information that could help our investigation, please get in touch with us."

Anyone with information can report it or by calling A/DS Ben Stone on 101, quoting reference 40/38125/20.

Alternatively, you can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
