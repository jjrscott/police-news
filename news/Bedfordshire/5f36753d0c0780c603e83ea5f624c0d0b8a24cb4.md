**We are asking witnesses to come forward, after a taxi driver was robbed by a customer at gunpoint in Bedford on Sunday evening, (16 September).**

At around 10.30pm, the taxi, a silver Mercedes Vito van, collected a man from Christie Road. After requesting to be taken to a fast food restaurant and back, the passenger waited until the taxi was travelling towards Faldo Road, before threatening the driver and demanding money.

The driver handed over a sum of money, before the offender then made off on foot.

The offender is described as a black man in his early 20s, and is thought to have been wearing a dark hoodie with the hood up, with his face also covered.

Julia Hinson, investigating, said: "This is clearly a very concerning incident and we are keen to speak with anyone who can help us with our enquiries.

"We are looking to track down this suspect as soon as possible, as he may look to re-offend or indeed have committed similar offences previously.

"I would urge anyone with information to get in touch with us, as is could be hugely helpful to solving this case."

Anyone with information is asked to contact police by calling 101, or visiting the force's online reporting centre, quoting crime reference 40/25044/18.
