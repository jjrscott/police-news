**We are investigating an aggravated burglary in Bedford that took place in the early hours of yesterday morning (Saturday) and are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.**

Just after midnight, three men wearing masks forced their way into a property in Queensbury Close demanding to know where the jewellery and the safe were. They then threatened the victim with machetes before tying her up, gagging her and covering her head with a pillow case.

They then carried out a search of the property and took several items of value, such as rings, phones and cash. All three men were described as dark skinned and were wearing white masks, white gloves, white hooded tops and black bottoms, possibly with patterns or logos on.

Anyone with any information can contact police through the force's online reporting centre or by calling 101, quoting reference 10 of 22 December.

Alternatively, call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
