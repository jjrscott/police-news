We are appealing for witnesses following an aggravated burglary in Luton on Thursday 29 March.

At approximately 6.30pm, three men broke into the back of a house on Bishopscote Road before confronting the occupant in his bedroom with what is described as a silver gun. They then stole three brief-case style boxes containing documents and cash from a wardrobe.

The offenders left the property via the front door and headed down St James Road and St Monicas Avenue before making off in a vehicle. The three men are all described as skinny, approximately six foot tall and were wearing dark hoodies.

Anyone with any information is asked to call 101 quoting crime reference number C/14400/18. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, or report information online via the force's online reporting system.
