**We are asking people to check their doors and windows, and report suspicious activity, following six burglaries and attempted burglaries in Bedford on Friday (8 February).**

The six offences all took place between 7.30am and around 10pm, and a variety of items were taken, including electrical items, watches, and rucksacks and their contents.

At three of the properties, the offenders had made attempts to get through the front door of the property, but thankfully at two of the properties were not successful.

Detective Sergeant Gemma Pugh said: "At one of the incidents, we found that a window on the ground floor didn't lock properly, which is why we're taking this opportunity to remind people to check that their doors and windows lock properly. To minimise the chances of a burglar gaining entry, keep them locked.

"Four of the six incidents look like they took place before 5pm. If you are at home during the day, please keep an eye out for suspicious activity on your street, and if you see someone behaving suspiciously, then contact police straight away."

Bedfordshire Police takes all reports of burglary seriously, and tackling offenders and bringing them to justice is a priority. Operation Fidelity is the force's dedicated response to burglary, and sees officers from across the force working together to tackle it. As part of that, officers continue to work to identify long-term crime hotspots, short-term spikes and key offending patterns, as well as investigating offences and carrying out disruptive tactics against known burglars.

Further advice from the force includes:

 * If you have a UPVC door at home, make sure it is double locked
 * Keep all valuables and keys safely out of sight from windows, both in your home and car. Close curtains with a light on indoors
 * Never leave garages or sheds unlocked - not only can valuable tools be appealing to thieves, they can also be used to force entry to your home
 * Don't hide your keys under a doormat or in a flowerpot - it's the first place a would-be offender will look
 * Property mark and register your property at www.immobilise.com
