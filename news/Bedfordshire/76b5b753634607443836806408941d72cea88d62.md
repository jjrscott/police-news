**We held our fifth Community Cohesion Awards evening on Friday (1 February), to celebrate and say thank you to those individuals and organisations who go above and beyond to support the communities of Bedfordshire, and our force.**

Hosted by our Community Cohesion team and sponsored by 12 supporting organisations, over 350 people from across the county attended the event at the Conservatory on the Luton Hoo estate, to celebrate achievements in 14 different award categories.

More than Â£8,500 was raised for Cancer Research and a very courageous member of the community, Rita James, who is fighting her own battle with cancer.

Chief Inspector Hob Hoque, who leads community policing in the south and central areas of the county, and who organised the awards evening, said: "The evening was a fantastic success and it was great to see so many different people attend from all over Bedfordshire and celebrate their successes together.

"Well done to each and every person who was nominated for an award, as they really do make a difference to our communities and we are proud to have such great ambassadors supporting us and the work we do.

"We would also like to take the opportunity to thank our sponsors as the evening wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for their generosity and support and of course the Community Cohesion team did a great job in organising such a fantastic event.

"These awards provide a great example of how the community and the police should work together to create a county we feel safe in and proud to be a part of. Well done everyone!"
