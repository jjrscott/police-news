**We are appealing for information following the robbery of an elderly woman in Bedford on Tuesday (30 January). **

At approximately 1.15pm, the woman was robbed by a man on a motorcycle in the alleyway between Church Lane and Pevensey Road.

The victim had just got off the number five bus from in Church Lane and turned into the alleyway. She heard the sound of a motorcycle coming up behind her, so stepped out of the way to let it pass. As she did so, the rider snatched her handbag and rode off towards Pevensey Road.

The offender is described as white, in his late teens to early 20s, approximately six feet tall, and of medium build. He was wearing a turquoise blue fleece hoodie with the hood up and dark coloured trousers.

Please contact us on 101 quoting the crime number BP-30012018-0173, or you can make a report using our online reporting tool.
