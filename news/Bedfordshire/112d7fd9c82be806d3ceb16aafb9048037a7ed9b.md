**We are reminding people to think twice before entering rivers or lakes to cool off from the warm weather currently gracing the county.**

After temperatures spiked this week, people are urged to be conscious of open, unguarded bodies of water which may contain dangerous currents, particularly in light of the recent intensive and prolonged rain which preceded the warm spell.

We would like to remind the public that even the strongest and experienced swimmers can get into difficulties due to undercurrents in deeper water.

Chief Superintendent Dave Boyle said: "It certainly seems like a long time ago since we had such great weather, and with it being so warm going for a swim can be tempting. We ask people to remember that recent wet weather has caused local rivers to swell above their normal levels, which has created a much more dangerous environment.

"If you are looking to cool off by going for a swim, please use safe areas such as leisure centres and lidos and stay safe while enjoying the glorious weather."
