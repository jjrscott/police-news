The most important change in data privacy regulation in 20 years is the subject of a free cyber security conference for businesses in Bedfordshire.

The conference, which takes place on 22 February at Kings House in Bedford, will help businesses understand current cyber threats, as well as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which is coming into law in May.

Sean O'Neil, Cyber Security Advisor for Bedfordshire Police and one of the speakers, said: "The programme for this event is really varied and covers everything from live hacking, hostile social engineering and finding out if your website is secure.

"There are a number of workshops in the afternoon giving you the choice of which to attend, depending on the needs of your business."

This is the second annual cyber conference, which Bedfordshire Police has co-organised as part of a group of county organisations who make up the Cyber Trust. There are GDPR experts giving the legal and practical perspectives on the new legislation, alongside a range of local and regional ICT companies.

Tickets are free and can be booked through Eventbrite.
