We're appealing for witnesses after a man sustained serious injuries as a result of an altercation outside a pub in Flitwick.

The incident happened at around 10.35pm yesterday (Thursday) outside The Blackbirds Inn in the High Street.

Emergency services attended and a man was taken to hospital with serious head injuries. Fortunately his condition is not believed to be life-threatening.

Investigation Officer Emily Partington said: "This was a nasty incident which has left a man in hospital, and I am appealing for anyone who has any information to get in touch. We're aware there were a number of people in the vicinity of the pub at this time and we would urge them to get in touch to help us find the person or people responsible."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Bedfordshire Police via 101 or its online reporting centre at www.bedfordshire.police.uk
