Louise Rump, 29, was found in her flat in Plewes Close on the afternoon of Friday, 16 October, by firefighters who had been called to reports of an alarm sounding.

Today (Wednesday), her family released an image of Louise, along with a statement which read: "Louise was a much-loved mother to her two beautiful daughters and will be greatly missed by all her friends and family."

Habib Jackson, 31, of Dunstable Road, Toddington, and Christopher Hayward, 31, of Fensome Drive, Houghton Regis, have been charged with murder and appeared at Luton Magistrates' Court last Monday (19 October). The next hearing is scheduled for 8 January.
