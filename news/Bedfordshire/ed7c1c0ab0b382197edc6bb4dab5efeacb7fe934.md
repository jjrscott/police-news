**We continue to drive down burglary offences across the county as statistics show that over the summer, the number of break-ins dropped by almost 35 percent compared the same period last summer.**

The number of burglary offences reported to police between June and August 2018 was 1,114, while only 726 were recorded during the same months for 2019.

This is due to the work that the force's dedicated team, Operation Maze, has carried out to identify which areas are frequently targeted, short-term spikes and key offending patterns.

Detective Inspector Janine Graham, said: "This summer, we have seen much lower offending figures, which is a great testament to all the hard work that the Operation Maze team do.

"So far this year, we have jailed one offender for five years after being caught on CCTV eating ice cream before breaking into a property. Another was sent to prison for more than three years after his forensics were found at the scene. A man was handed a 15-year sentence for his part in a burglary which left two men with life threatening injuries, and one burglar was sentenced to almost three years after being caught on a doorbell video.

"As always, the public's help is crucial is helping officers to tackle this type of crime and we would encourage people to report any suspicious activity to us by calling 101 or by using the online reporting tool on our website."

**What happens when a burglary is reported?**

 * When a call comes in, our call handlers go through a specially designed series of questions, so they can assess the incident and how it should be actioned in the most efficient and effective way.
 * All victims of burglary will be visited by a scenes of crime officer to thoroughly assess any forensic opportunities.
 * If a burglary occurs in a frequently targeted area, or involves vulnerable victims, or there were witnesses we can follow up with, it will be classed as a priority and an officer may attend to speak to the victim to gather more information.
