**A closure order has been granted at an address in Bedford following a police warrant.**

On Monday (16 April) officers carried out a warrant in Ashburnham Court after receiving reports of antisocial behaviour and drug related activity.

A three month closure order was granted on the property following a hearing at Luton Magistrates' Court yesterday (17 April).

We worked with Bedford Borough Council and Bedford Pilgrims Housing Association to obtain the closure order.

PC James Hunt said: "We remain committed to partnership working in order to disrupt antisocial behaviour within the county. We continue to encourage people to come forward with any information about crime or suspicious activity in their area."

To report any suspicious activity in your area call 101 or use the force's online reporting tool at www.bedfordshire.police.uk/report.
