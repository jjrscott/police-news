**We are continuing to investigate a stabbing in Luton on Monday (14 October) and have arrested three teenagers in connection with the incident.**

At approximately 4.50pm officers were called to a report of a stabbing in Riddy Lane in which a teenage boy sustained severe injuries.

The boy was transported to hospital for treatment where he remains in serious condition.

Three teenage boys have been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. They have since been released on bail.

The investigation is ongoing and police continue to urge witnesses to get in touch.

"I would strongly encourage anyone who has any information about this incident, no matter how small, or about the circumstances surrounding it, to get in touch."

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to contact DI Maxted on 101 or by visiting the force's online reporting centre and quote Operation Dales.
