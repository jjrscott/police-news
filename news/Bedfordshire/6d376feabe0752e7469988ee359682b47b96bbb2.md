Police officers, staff and volunteers were recognised at Bedfordshire Police's Long Service and Chief Commendations ceremony yesterday (Tuesday) at our headquarters in Kempston.

The event recognised the outstanding work undertaken by those who work for the force, and marked the long service of five police officers and five members of police staff who started their careers 20 years ago.

Two special constables, SC Dean Torr and SC John Power, received recognition as they celebrated 10 years of volunteering with our Special Constabulary. SC Power is the UK's first Special Constable dog handler, and works with police dog Skye.

Chief Constable Jon Boutcher also presented commendations to PC Matthew Altendorff and PC Leanne Pettigrew who were commended for saving the life of a suicidal woman in Luton, and PCSO Elliot Weedon who was commended for his approach to victim care, after supporting a victim of hate crime throughout their ordeal.

Chief Constable Jon Boutcher said: "It's a real honour to present these awards to members of Team Bedfordshire who have shown real loyalty to their county - either through long service or acts of kindness and bravery.

"I am also delighted to present these awards in front of the families of our officers, staff and volunteers, to show them the fantastic work they do to protect people and fight crime in Bedfordshire."
