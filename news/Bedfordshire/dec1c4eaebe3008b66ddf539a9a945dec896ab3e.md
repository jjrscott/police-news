**Nearly 150 people from Bedfordshire attended a packed conference at the start of National Hate Crime Awareness Week (NHCAW) on Saturday (13 October) to learn about the impact of hate crime.**

Entitled Take a Stand #NoPlaceForHate, the event at the University of Bedfordshire was organised by multi-faith network Bedford as One and Bedfordshire Police, in partnership with the Anne Frank Trust, Bedford Borough Council, Central Bedfordshire Council, Luton Borough Council, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and the Bedfordshire Police and Crime Commissioner Kathryn Holloway. The national awareness week runs from 13 to 20 October. It aims to bring people together, to stand with those affected by hate crime, support those who need ongoing support and encourage victims to come forward.

Speakers included:

 * Holocaust survivor Eva Clarke - she shared her moving story after being born in a Nazi concentration camp. She spoke about the horrors her family endured, to enable people to learn the lessons of the holocaust, to understand the impact of hate crime and to combat any forms of racism and prejudice.
 * Rehana Fiasal from the Luton Islamophobia Working Group spoke about the impact on the community to the 'Punish a Muslim' hate crime campaign, the hurt and isolation it caused not only to adults in the Muslim community, but to children as well who had viewed the letter.
 * Inder Kaur Singh of the CPS explained the importance of reporting hate crime so police can intervene, victims can get help and offenders can be brought to justice. The CPS especially encourage those with disabilities to come forward to report hate crime as it's an under reported area of hate crime.

 * Sgt Carl Perri and Val Ross from the Anne Frank Trust ran an interactive training session about 'What is hate crime?' It encompassed the different strands including disability, gender identity, race, religion and sexual orientation. Val also explained the important work the education charity carries out in schools in Bedfordshire to challenge hate, using Anne Frank's story as a starting point to challenge all forms of prejudice and discrimination.

Hate Crime Sergeant Carl Perri said: "We were really pleased with the turn out which included members of all different areas of our communities from across the county. We've received some fantastic feedback from the event. It's really good to see people are taking the issue of hate crime so seriously as we see the devastating affects it has on victims and their communities. Although the force has seen a rise in people reporting hate crime, we know it remains under reported and we urge victims not to suffer in silence. During the awareness week we will be engaging with members of the public across the county at various events, including at our third party reporting centres, to educate them about hate crimes."

Revd Cass Howes, Chair of Bedford as One, who hosted the event, added: "Our aim is to explore and share similarities in diversity. We were really proud to support the event and work with the community to tackle hate crime so the town where 121 different languages/dialects are spoken can live as one."

The event was closed by the first public showing of an innovative video Bedfordshire Police is sending to every secondary, middle and upper school in the county to stream to their pupils during the awareness week to teach students across the county about hate crime. The force's Community Cohesion Champions, who are aged between 13 and 15-years-old, have made the film entitled #WeHateHateCrime, in association with the force, the Anne Frank Trust and True Vision the online reporting tool for hate crime. It has been created to raise awareness of what is hate crime, how it affects victims and how to report it. It's made by young people, for young people.

Clare Kelly, Chief of Staff for the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner, which helped fund the event, added: "Education is key in eliminating hate from our society and it was so encouraging to see so many people on board at the event committed to tackling hate crime which has no place in our society."

If you or anyone you know has been affected by hate crime contact Bedfordshire Police on 101 or contact True Vision online at report-it.org.uk or via the third party reporting centres which can be found on the Bedfordshire Police website.
