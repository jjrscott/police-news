We are appealing for witnesses following an assault in the Quarry in Houghton Regis on Saturday (6 March).

At around 2pm, there was an altercation between two groups of teenagers, and as a result two teenage boys were assaulted and left with facial injuries requiring hospital treatment.

There were believed to be three teenagers, and they were described as white, aged between 15 and 18-years-old, and wearing dark coloured tracksuits.

PC Jenny Buckley, investigating, said: "I am keen to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time of this incident, or who may have seen the three offenders in and around the area before or after the incident.

"The incident has left the victims shaken up and we will not tolerate this kind of behaviour on the streets of Bedfordshire."

Anyone with information is asked to contact us via 101 or via our online reporting centre _https://www.bedfordshire.police.uk/report/Report#c1157068_ quoting reference numbers 40/11168/21 and 40/11172/21.
