**Throughout December, officers across the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit (RPU) will be conducting additional stop-checks to combat drink and drug drivers.**

Last year in December, RPU officers stopped more than 1,400 motorists across the three counties as part of a crackdown on people driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

Of those stopped, 649 people were given either breath or drugs tests. Of these, 45 were positive, refused or failed breath tests and 22 positive drugs tests.

Sgt Ian Manley of the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Herfordshire Road Policing Unit (RPU) said: "We are all aware of the risk we pose by getting behind the wheel after a drink, yet some people still choose to gamble with their lives.

"Even a small amount of alcohol can affect your driving ability. We advise if you're drinking, even one drink, that you arrange another way of getting home."
