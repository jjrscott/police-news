**We have received reports from a number of schools in the county that they have received malicious communications by email this morning (Monday).**

Currently the messages are not being treated as credible, but enquiries are ongoing.

Schools have been advised to follow their own local protocol with regard to evacuating, and that similar messages have been received by schools across the country today.
