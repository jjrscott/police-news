On Tuesday, 10 December, at around 11.50am, two court officers approached a property in Norman Road. When they knocked on the door a man ran out, chasing the victims with a large knife whilst threatening them.

The offender was described as Asian, of slim build, with dark hair and stubble.

PC Paul Mahon, investigating, said: "The victims have been left shaken, and were lucky they were able to get away.

"We are keen to speak to anyone who has witnessed this incident or saw a man fitting that description in the area at the time."

Anyone with information about this robbery is asked to contact police on 101 or through the force's online reporting centre, quoting reference number 40/71115/19.

Alternatively you can call independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
