We are appealing for information after disorder in Luton in the early hours of Friday (24 January).

Three vehicles were seen in Somerset Avenue at around 3am, knocking into parked cars and street furniture. A number of men, some carrying weapons, fled two of the vehicles towards Vauxhall Way.

The third car collided with a wall in Somerset Avenue and the other men returned the scene, using the weapons to damage the car.

Detective Constable Gary Hatton, investigating, said: "We have very few details about this incident and would really appreciate the public's help in trying to piece together what happened. If anyone saw or heard the disorder then we would really like to hear from you.

"Likewise, if anyone saw a group of men in Vauxhall Way, or the surrounding area, in the early hours of Friday, please get in touch."

Anyone with any information can contact police on 101 or online at www.bedfordshire.police.uk/report, quoting reference number 40/4849/20.

You can also leave information via Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
