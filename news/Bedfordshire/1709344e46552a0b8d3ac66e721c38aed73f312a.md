### We are appealing for witnesses after an aggravated robbery at a convenience store in Bedford.

At approximately 6.20pm on Wednesday (20 January) a man produced a knife and forced entry behind the counter area at the McColl's store in Avon Drive and took money from the till.

The suspect is described as a white man, around 30 years old and wearing a blue 'puffa' style jacket, grey trousers, black trainers and a pink bandana or hat.

DS Melissa Cunningham, investigating the case, said: "This incident has left the victim and colleagues very shaken and we are keen to catch those responsible.

"We would like to hear from anyone who may have been in the area at that time and has any information that could help us establish who the offender is."

If you have any information that could help investigators please use our online reporting tool or call 101 and quote reference number 40/3205/21.
