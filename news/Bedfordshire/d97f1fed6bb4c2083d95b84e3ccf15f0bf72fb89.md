We are appealing for information after two men in their 90s were victims of burglaries on Tuesday evening in Luton.

A man awoke to find two men in his home on Rutland Crescent at 6.45pm. The men assaulted him and stole his wallet.

The second incident took place at 6.50pm on St Michaels Road, where a man returned home to find two men in his kitchen, who were claiming to be looking for a cat. He later realised his wallet was missing.

Detective Constable Colin Knight, who is investigating, said: "This is a terrible crime and has left two elderly victims shaken in their own homes. We would urge anyone who noticed anything unusual in the area at those times to come forward."

Anyone with information, including if you have seen any suspicious vehicles in the area, is asked to call 101 quoting reference number 340 (Rutland Crescent) and 395 (St Michaels Road) of 21 November.
