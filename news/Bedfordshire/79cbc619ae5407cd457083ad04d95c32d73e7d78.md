**We are appealing for witnesses after a bronze statue was stolen from a churchyard.**

The figure was taken from the Church of St John the Baptist, in Eversholt, at some stage between 6pm on Monday, 17 June and 10am on Tuesday, 18 June.

Officers are following a number of lines of enquiry, including working with a specialist unit based in the Metropolitan Police.

Chief Inspector Andy Southam, from our community crime team, said: "This is a distinctive and unusual item which we hope people will recognise if they come across it.

"We appreciate the level of community concern there has been following this incident, and we are committed to thoroughly investigating this theft.

"I would ask anyone who was in the area at this time, or who may have seen anything suspicious or unusual, to contact us, regardless of how insignificant they may think it is.

"In particular, I would ask anyone with a dashcam who may have been driving in the area to review their footage to see if anything may have been captured on the nearby roads."

Anyone with any information about this incident is asked to contact us on 101, or via the online reporting centre, quoting reference number 40/34894/19 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
