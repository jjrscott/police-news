**We are appealing for information after an armed robbery in Leighton Buzzard.**

Officers were called at 5.37am this morning (Thursday) to reports of a robbery at the Stanbridge Road Post Office.

Two masked men entered the store and threatened staff with kitchen knives before making off with cigarettes from behind the counter and money from the till.

The two suspects left the location on foot and ran in the direction of Lywood Road. One of them was in possession of a blue sleeping bag, which was used to place the stolen goods in.

Anyone with any information should use the online reporting centre on our website or call 101, quoting reference 40/20087/18.
