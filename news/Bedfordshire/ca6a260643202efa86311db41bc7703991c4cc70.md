**We are appealing for information after an assault on a woman in a nightclub left her needing stitches.**

Between 1.30am and 2.30am on Sunday 10 March, the woman was stood in the doorway at Ruby's bar in Chapel Street, Luton.

A bottle or glass was thrown at her face by an unknown man, who ran off in the direction of George Street.

The victim needed a number of stitches to her eyebrow and under her eyelid.

The suspect is described as white, with dark hair and was wearing a blue shirt.

Detective Sergeant Ryan Barnes, investigating, said: "This appears to be a completely unprovoked attack which has left the victim with nasty injuries.

"This sort of behaviour is completely unacceptable and I hope anyone who was in the bar or the wider area at the time will contact us with any information they might have."

Anyone with any information is asked to contact DS Barnes through 101 or via our online reporting centre, quoting reference 40/14078/19.

Alternatively you can contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
