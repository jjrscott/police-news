Police are appealing for information after a motorcyclist was seriously injured following an incident on Beechwood Road, Luton on Wednesday (16 December).

At around 7.30pm, a road traffic collision occurred between a silver Honda motorcycle, a blue BMW and a black Vauxhall Corsa.

Emergency services attended the scene, and the motorcyclist, a man in his 20s, was taken to hospital with life changing injuries, where he remains stable.

Inspector Richard Barker, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit, said: "We are working to establish the circumstances of this collision, and would like to speak with witnesses who saw either of the cars, or the motorcycle, prior to the incident.

"We would especially like to hear from anyone who has dashcam footage of the area at the time.

"Please get in touch as you may be able to help with our investigation."

Anyone with any information can visit the Bedfordshire Police online reporting centre, quoting reference 399 of 16 December.
