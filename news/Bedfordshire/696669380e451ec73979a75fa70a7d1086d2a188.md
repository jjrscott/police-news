We are appealing for information after two teenagers were robbed and assaulted on Friday (22 December).

At around 10.10pm the teenagers were in Collie Road, Bedford, near the junction with Barford Avenue, when a silver Ford Focus pulled up near them and the occupants tried to engage them in conversation.

The victims began to walk away when the car drove past several times before stopping near them again. Four men got out of the car, searched them and took a number of items including a small black Nike bag, Apple headphones and an Apple iPhone 5 charger. The men then assaulted the two teenagers leaving them with serious injuries, before leaving in the car and heading towards Barford Avenue.

The four men are all described as Asian and around 18-years-old.

Anyone with any information is asked to call 101 quoting crime reference number JH/55777/2017. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
