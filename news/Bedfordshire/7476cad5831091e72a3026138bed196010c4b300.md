**Officers are investigating an incident in Turnpike Way, Bedford, when a woman was assaulted by a man who broke into her home.**

Between 12.05am and 12.15am on Wednesday 27 September, the victim was woken after a man forced his way into the property, shouted at her and assaulted her before leaving.

She was left with injuries that required further treatment, but that weren't life-threatening. The man left the property and ran towards The Spinney, and is described as wearing dark clothing and a balaclava.

PC Sajid Saddique, investigating, said: "The victim understandably feels intimidated after the incident, and I want to find whoever is responsible to secure some sense of justice for her and put a stop to such behaviour.

"I would like to speak to anyone who saw or heard anything in Turnpike Way between midnight and 12.20am on 27 September. If you saw a man in dark clothing heading in the direction of The Spinney please get in touch."

Anyone with any information is asked to call PC Saddique on 101 quoting crime reference number JH/41330/17. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously 0800 555 111.
