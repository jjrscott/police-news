**Our Community Cohesion Team were proud to support Luton Mela at the weekend, and have thanked organisers and members of the public for a 'fantastic' event.**

The annual festival was held in Wardown Park on Saturday and Sunday (4 and 5 August), and was an opportunity for people to come together and celebrate the music, art and culture of Bedfordshire's diverse communities.

The force's Community Cohesion team attends every year to meet residents and ensure that the public can make the most of the event and celebrate safely.

Community Cohesion Sergeant Stephen Mosley said: "Bedfordshire Police is proud to support the Luton Mela each year; this year was no exception and it was a fantastic two days. Thousands of people attended to celebrate the diversity of Luton and our county in a really positive environment.

"The Mela gives us a brilliant opportunity to meet with our communities, we had the chance to speak to lots of people, discuss local concerns, highlight the on-going work of our community teams and promote our recruitment campaign. The feedback we received from them about our presence was overwhelmingly positive.

"It was a pleasure to attend, and we'd like to thank the sponsors and partners for organising another incredible event, and the public for their support."
