**Our officers are asking for witnesses of a robbery outside Bedford 's Corn Exchange to come forward, after a man was threatened and his phone and bag taken last night (Sunday).**

At around 9.30pm, the victim was walking home past a bus stop at the Corn Exchange in St Paul's Square when he was approached by four men, who indicated they were carrying knives.

They demanded the man unlock and handover his phone and bag, before making off.

The men are described as black and Asian, and all are thought to have been wearing dark clothing.

Investigating officer Emily Partington said: "This is obviously a very concerning incident and was very traumatic for the victim involved.

"We understand there were a number of people in the area at the time, and would urge anyone who saw the incident or noticed the group of men thought to be involved to contact us."

Anyone with information is urged to contact police on 101 or via Bedfordshire Police's website, quoting reference 40/47344/18.
