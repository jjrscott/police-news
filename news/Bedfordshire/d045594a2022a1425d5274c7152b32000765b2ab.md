Officers believe the car had been stolen from a business address in Westbury Close, Houghton Regis, in the hours leading up to the ram raid.

It is thought offenders then left the scene and travelled in the car to carry out a burglary at a farm on Tring Road, Eaton Bray, where a green Kawasaki motorcycle and two Motorcross off-road bikes were stolen. A Mini Cooper matching the description was later found burned out in Houghton Regis at around 4.30am.

The offenders are described as three white men dressed in dark clothing with their faces covered.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact police on 101 quoting Operation Rain. Alternatively, you can contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
