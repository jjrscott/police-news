**We havee successfully applied for sponsorship to support local charityGroundwork Luton and Bedfordshire.**

The charity was awarded Â£100 by the national 'Force for Good' scheme, after crime reduction officer Lara Curtayne applied for the funding. The money will be used to support the establishment of the Luton Food Poverty Alliance and the development of community food hubs in Luton and Bedford, to help reduce food poverty for local residents.

Lara Curtayne: "I applied for this scheme as I believe it is important to invest in the wellbeing of our local communities. I am really happy that the application was successful and the money will help in building a support system for the people who need it the most."

Force for Good is a project led by Police Mutual and is a national community sponsorship scheme.

Groundwork Luton and Bedfordshire teaches communities how to use their local environment and green spaces as a place for learning, improving their skills and keeping active. Groundwork also helps businesses and communities to reduce their impact on their local environment by reducing waste and pollution.

PC Hayley Hunter from Bedfordshire Police's Community Cohesion team said: "We are dedicated to working closely with our partners and I am delighted that on this occasion we are able to support Groundwork in one of its projects, supporting our communities and addressing issues of vulnerability and poverty."

Phil Paulo, Development Manager for Groundwork said "We are grateful for the Force for Good funding and to Bedfordshire Police for assisting us. The sponsorship will enable us to stop more families from falling into food poverty and help us to help them lead healthy and fulfilling lives."
