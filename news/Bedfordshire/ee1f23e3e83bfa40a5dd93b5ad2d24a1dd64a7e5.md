### We are appealing for information in relation to a robbery that took place in Bedford last Wednesday (15 July).

At around 9.10pm, the victim was walking from Tavistock Street when he was stopped by four men in Boswell Place. They engaged him in conversation before assaulting him, which left him with several injuries.

Detective Constable Sajid Saddique, from our Crime Investigation Team, said: "This incident took place in the evening, but it still would have been light outside and it is a relatively busy area, so we are appealing for anyone who saw it happen or has any information to come forward.

"Luckily the victim's injuries aren't serious, but he was left shaken and we are determined to catch those responsible.

"So far, we have arrested two men in connection with the incident, who have now been bailed, but there are still outstanding suspects who were involved that we are keen to identify.

"If you saw anything or have any information that could help our investigation, please get in touch with us."

Anyone with information can report it or calling DC Saddique on 101, quoting reference 40/ 37997/20.

Alternatively, you can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
