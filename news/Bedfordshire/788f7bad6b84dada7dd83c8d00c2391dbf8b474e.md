**Police are appealing for information following after a woman was sexually assaulted in Leighton Buzzard as she was out for a run.**

At around 6pm on Tuesday (31 March) the runner was touched by two men on bikes as they passed her on the Grand Union canal towpath near Vimy Road.

A third man on a bike attempted to touch her, but she was able to move out of the way.

The three men then cycled off.

The offenders are described as wearing tracksuits, and all had their hoods up. One was wearing a grey tracksuit, another was wearing a black tracksuit. One had a scarf around his face. PC Christopher Buchanan said: "This behaviour is completely unacceptable and has left the victim shaken. We are committed to finding those responsible.

"If you were in the area and saw anything suspicious, or you have seen men matching this description, we'd like to hear from you." Please call PC Buchanan on 101, quoting reference 40/18800/20, or you can contact via the force's online reporting centre at www.bedfordshire.police.uk/report with any information.
