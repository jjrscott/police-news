**Detectives have launched an investigation following a violent disorder in Luton.**

At around 7.30pm on Monday (30 November) we were called to reports that a group of people were involved in an altercation in Dallow Road, which left two men requiring hospital treatment.

A man in his 20s from Luton was arrested on suspicion of assault and public order offences in connection to the incident, but has since been released on bail.

Detective Constable Richard Marshall, from our Crime Investigation Team, said: "This violent incident happened on a residential street, early in the evening.

"We are following up lines of enquiry and have arrested one man in connection with the incident, but there were more people involved and we would like to identify them.

"If you were in the area at the time and saw anything, or have any information that could help our investigation, please get in touch with us."

Anyone with information can report via our online reporting centre, quoting reference 377 of 30 November. Alternatively, you can contact independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
