**We have issued images from CCTV and are appealing for witnesses to an armed robbery in Shortstown, Bedford.**

At around 9.45pm on Tuesday 9 March a man entered a convenience shop in North Drive, and approached the counter and threatened staff members with a knife. He then locked them in a bathroom before accessing the shop's safe.

Officers who are investigating this incident would like to speak to the man pictured as they believe he might be able to assist them with their enquiries.

"We would like to speak to this man as we believe he has information which can help with the investigation.

"If you have information about the incident or know the person in the photo please get in touch."
