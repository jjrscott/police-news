We are appealing for witnesses following a knife point robbery that took place in Dunstable in the early hours of this morning (Tuesday).

At approximately 3.00am, two people were threatened by a man with a knife as they were sitting in a red Volkwagen Up, at Sainsbury's on Luton Road.

The man demanded they get out of the vehicle, which he then stole and drove off.

We were called and the vehicle was recovered abandoned in Strathmore Avenue, Luton.

The offender is described as white, approximately 5'10", aged in his mid to late 30s. He was bald, and was wearing a plain white t-shirt and grey jogging bottoms. He spoke with what is believed to be an eastern European accent

Anyone with information is asked to contact us via the online reporting centre, or by calling 101 and quoting reference 37 of 23 July.
