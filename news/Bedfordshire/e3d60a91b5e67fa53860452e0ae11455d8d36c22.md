**We are appealing for witnesses after an arson incident in Luton. **

At approximately 8pm yesterday (Wednesday 18 October) a lit piece of clothing was pushed through the letter box of a property in High Ridge. ****

Detective Constable Colin Knight, investigating the incident, said: "This was a nasty attack which endangered lives of the people inside the house. We will not tolerate this kind of behaviour in our county.

"We would like to speak to anyone with information about this incident. We are especially keen to speak to two young men on pushbikes seen in the area around the time of the arson as we believe they might have information important to our investigation."

Anyone with information about this attack is asked to contact Bedfordshire Police on 101 quoting incident 398 of 18 October. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
