**We are appealing for a victim to come forward who was verbally assaulted in a take away in Luton.**

On Monday, 16 April at around 6.55pm, a man used offensive language to another customer in Pepes Piri Piri, in Chapel Street, and officers would like to speak with the victim to establish further details on the incident. The offender is described as Asian, in his early 20s, wearing a black jacket and black trousers. He had a lanyard around his neck, short black hair and a little beard.

PC Rupert Carlile, investigating, said: "This incident has been reported to us and I am keen to talk the victim, not only to help us investigate the case, but to check on her welfare and see if we can offer any support to her. We will not tolerate hate crime which targets a person's disability, as everyone has the right to live free from fear or harassment."

If this was you or you know who the victim was, please contact PC Carlile on 101, or via our website, quoting reference C/ 18432/2018.
