**Bedfordshire Police and Bedfordshire Horsewatch, supported by the Police and Crime Commissioner, the force 's rural policing and the crime reduction team, have joined forces to launch a four-legged partnership that will provide extra eyes and ears around the county.**

Horsewatch will equip riders with training and distinctive branded clothing, provided by the British Horse Society, and organise equestrian patrols of areas where police find it difficult to access.

Horsewatch members patrolling in pairs, whilst out riding on country roads or tracks in the county, can keep a watching eye for any suspicious activity and assist in the fight against rural crime across the county.

The partnership will officially launch tomorrow, Saturday, 24 February, in Sutton, Bedfordshire. Please contact us for further information.
