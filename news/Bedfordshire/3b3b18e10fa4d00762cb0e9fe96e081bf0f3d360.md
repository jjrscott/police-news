**We are appealing for witnesses after a collision on the A507 at Stotfold on Sunday (26 April) which left a cyclist with serious injuries.**

At approximately 2.45pm a car collided with two cyclists between the roundabouts for Arlesey and Fairfield.

Emergency services attended and a man was taken to hospital, where he remains in a serious but stable condition.

Sergeant Tom Daly, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, and Hertfordshire Roads Policing Unit, said: "We're appealing for anyone who witnessed this collision between a black Ford Focus and two cyclists, or anyone who saw the car and cyclists on the A507 shortly before 2.45pm, to get in touch to help us establish what happened."

We would be particularly keen to hear from anyone with dash cam footage of Sunday's collision.

Anyone with information is asked to contact us on 101 quoting Operation Seven. You can also provide information online via Bedfordshire.police.uk/report
