**Police officers, staff and volunteers were recognised at our Long Service and Chief Commendations ceremony on Tuesday (20 February) at Headquarters in Kempston.**

The event recognised the outstanding work undertaken by those who work for the force, and marked the long service of five police officers and four members of police staff who started their careers 20 years ago.

Chief Constable Jon Boutcher also presented commendations to 13 officers and members of staff, including three members of security at The Mall Luton, who were commended for saving the life of a suicidal woman, and another member of the public was commended for helping to prevent a serious sexual assault.

Chief Constable Jon Boutcher said: "It's a real honour to present these awards to members of Team Bedfordshire who have shown real loyalty to their county - either through long service or acts of kindness and bravery. It is also an honour to commend members of the public who have shown real courage and have assisted us.

"I am also delighted to present these awards in front of the families of our officers, staff and volunteers, to show them the fantastic work they do to protect people and fight crime in Bedfordshire."
