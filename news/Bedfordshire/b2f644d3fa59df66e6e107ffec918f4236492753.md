**A large number of cannabis plants have been found in a house in Luton, following a report of suspicious activity. **

Our officers attended the property in Challney on Sunday (24 June), following reports of suspicious behaviour in the area.

During a search of the property the team discovered 130 mature cannabis plants and 100 smaller plants in what officers described as a 'sophisticated and well-run' operation. The plants were secured and removed from the address to be safely disposed of.

PC Jack Calow, from Bedfordshire Police's Luton community team, said: "This successful discovery led to the disposal of a large number of cannabis plants which now won't make it to streets of our neighbourhoods.

"We would like to reassure our residents that we are committed to keeping our communities safe and we are encouraging anyone with information about drug-related or suspicious activity to come forward."

Anyone with information about drug crime in their area can report it to the police by visiting the force's online reporting centre or calling by 101.

Alternatively you can report crime anonymously by calling Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
