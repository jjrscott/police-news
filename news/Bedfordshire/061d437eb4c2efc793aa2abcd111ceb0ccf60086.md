**We are appealing for information following a knifepoint robbery at a residence in Leighton Buzzard.**

At around 1.40pm on Tuesday 12 February, a man was at his home in Heath Road when two men, armed with knives, walked into his flat.

One offender held a knife to the victim's head, whilst the other searched the flat and took a quantity of cash.

Both men then left the scene, driving away in a silver, or grey, Vauxhall car.

The offenders are described as both being in their early 20s. One man was white, the other was tall and of mixed race, wearing blue jeans and a green jacket.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact us via our online reporting centre or by calling 101 and quoting reference number 40/8746/19.

Alternatively, call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
