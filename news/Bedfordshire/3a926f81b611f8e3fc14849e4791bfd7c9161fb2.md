**We are appealing for witnesses following a robbery at a post office in Luton on Thursday (28 November).**

At around 6.30am, a man entered the store in The Green, Hockwell Ring, and jumped over the counter towards the shop assistant. He forced open the till and took out cash.

He also took a box containing a large quantity of cigarettes, and left the store.

The man is described as white, and was wearing a mask made from black material, possibly a bin liner, and is believed to have had a knife in his sleeve.

He was wearing a brown fleecy jumper and light coloured trousers, and had an orange glove on his left hand and black glove on his right.

Detective Constable Richard Marshall, investigating, said: "This incident terrified the shop assistant as she began her shift.

"We are keen to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time, who may have seen this man, or who has information about this incident.

"Also, anyone who may have been offered cheap cigarettes for sale."

Anyone with information is asked to contact DC Marshall by calling 101, or through our online reporting centre, quoting reference number 40/68730/19.

Alternatively, please contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
