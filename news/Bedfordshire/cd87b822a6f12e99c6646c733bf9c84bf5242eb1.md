**We are appealing for information after a ram raid at a Waitrose store in Goldington Road, Bedford, yesterday (Monday). **

At around 11.50pm, offenders used a stolen black Audi Q5 during the raid, before leaving the scene with the supermarket's ATM machine in the boot of a dark coloured Audi A3. The car left in the direction of the A421 towards Great Barford.

We believe there were around five people involved in the ram raid, which caused structural damage to the premises. We are keen to trace the people responsible and so would urge anyone who may have any information about this incident, no matter how small, to get in touch.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact DC Andy Boston via 101 quoting Op Linhouse. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
