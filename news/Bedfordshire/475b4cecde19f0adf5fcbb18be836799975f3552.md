We are continuing to appeal for help in finding a teenage girl missing from Bedford.

Madison McKellar, 15, who was reported missing earlier this week, has been found safe and well. Thank you to everyone who shared our appeal.

Summer Southam, 16, remains missing and we are continuing to appeal for information to help us find her.

She was last seen in Bedford town centre on Monday (28 December) at around 3.25pm

She is described as 5' 4", slim and has shoulder-length red/purple hair. She was last seen wearing faded-grey skinny jeans, a grey top, black trainers and a peach coloured shoulder bag.

She has links to Southampton, Birmingham and London.

PC Sarah Barnes, who is leading our efforts to try and find Summer, said: "We are continuing to ask for the public's help in finding her.

"With the freezing weather we are currently experiencing, it's important we are able to bring Summer home as quickly as possible.

"If you think you may have seen them or know of her whereabouts please call us on 101."
