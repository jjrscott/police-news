**We are appealing for witnesses after a man was assaulted and robbed in Luton on Thursday (19 July).**

The victim was sitting at a bus stop in Chapel Street at approximately 5.00pm, with four other people, when one of them punched him in the face. This caused the victim to fall, hitting his head on the bus stop seat, and he required hospital treatment for a head injury. The offender then went through the victim's pockets as he lay on the ground, and took a quantity of cash.

Described as in his mid to late twenties, white, slim, 6 foot tall, with short brown hair, the offender also had a scar on his left cheek and spoke with an Irish accent. He made off along the alleyway beside the Matalan store, which leads to Castle Street.
