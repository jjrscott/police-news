**A Bedfordshire police officer has pleaded guilty to theft after money was reported missing from a safe.**

Detective Sergeant David Sharpe, 40, based within the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit at Hertfordshire Constabulary HQ, pleaded guilty to two counts of theft by employee when he appeared at Cambridge Magistrates' Court today (Tuesday).

In March 2019, it was discovered that a sum of money amounting to Â£9,080 was missing from a safe within the Major Crime Unit.

Sharpe admitted that he had taken the money and was subsequently suspended from his post while an investigation was carried out.

He will be sentenced at Cambridge Crown Court at a date to be confirmed.
