We are appealing for information following an aggravated burglary in Bedford.

At around 9.20pm on Sunday (11 October) three men entered a property in Ossory way, Bedford, after forcing their way in through the front door.

The offenders were wearing dark clothing and carrying weapons. They forced their way into the property threatening one of the victims. Another victim managed to push the intruders out of the property even after an unknown substance was sprayed in her face.

Detective Jason Wheeler, investigator on the case says: "This is a terrifying incident that has left the occupants of the house understandably shaken.

"I would like to hear from anyone who may have information about the three people responsible for this incident and I would ask any properties in Ossary way, Milbrook, Houghon Road and Walsingham Close who may have CCTV footage to get in touch as it might have captured vital information that could help our investigation"

If you have any information that could help our investigation please call 101 and quote the reference number 40/55456/20 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
