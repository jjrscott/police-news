**We are appealing for information after a number of disturbances in Ampthill Park.**

At around 12.30pm on Saturday (2 March), reports were made of a group of youths aged between 16 and 19 having set fire to a chair, drinking alcohol and being abusive to a member of the public. They were described as wearing dark clothing and hoodies.

PC Sam Evans, investigating, said: "It is unacceptable to abuse a public space in this way and make others feel victimised. We are keen to hear from anyone who witnessed this delinquent behaviour so that we can identify those responsible."

Anyone with information should contact PC Evans on 101 or report online at www.bedfordshire.police.uk/report, quoting reference 40/12586/19.
