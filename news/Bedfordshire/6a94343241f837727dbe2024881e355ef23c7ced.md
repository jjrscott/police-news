**We have moved the county's 11 weapons bins to new locations.**

Following research into the use and effectiveness of the bins in their previous locations, cross matched with intelligence about Bedfordshire's serious youth violence hotspots, the force selected new locations for the bins. The new locations are:

 * Mayne Avenue, Luton, LU4 9LB (south corner of park opposite community centre)
 * People's Park, Luton, LU2 7PP (on the corner of North Street and Havelock Road)
 * Just off St George's Street, Luton LU 1 2QX (between Don Miller's and Lloyds Bank)
 * Church Lane shops, Goldington, Bedford, MK41 0PW
 * Bedford Square, Houghton Regis, LU 5 5ES
 * Dunstable Police Station, LU6 1TA
 * Addison Howard Park, Kempston, MK42 8UU (near the tennis court)
 * Commercial Road/Costin Street, Bedford, MK40 1RB (near the basketball courts)
 * Jubilee Park, Bedford, MK42 0JD (Moulton Avenue opposite Mareth Road)
 * Morrisons, Shefford, SG17 5DZ

Superintendent Jaki Whittred said: "The new locations for our weapons bins have been selected based on where we have seen an increase in serious youth violence and knife crime, using information from our community policing teams and from our Boson team, who are dedicated to tackling gun and gang criminality. The bins have been placed into hotspot areas on purpose, and I hope that anyone carrying a weapon sees them and thinks twice about carrying or using it.

"There are consequences to carrying a weapon - you face time in prison, even if you don't use it. Our message to people across the county is always not to carry weapons. Using the bins is the safest way to dispose of weapons, and takes them off the streets so they can't be used to cause harm to anyone."

Anyone with any information about knife crime in their community should call police on 101, unless in case of an emergency, then call 999. You can also report information online at www.bedfordshire.police.uk/report.

Alternatively call independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
