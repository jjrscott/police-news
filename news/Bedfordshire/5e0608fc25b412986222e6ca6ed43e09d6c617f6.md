**We are appealing for witnesses following a collision between a car and a pedestrian in Clapham on Saturday (21 September).**

We were called just before 5pm to reports of a collision between a woman and a blue Mercedes B180 at a pedestrian crossing on the High Street.

The woman was taken to hospital with serious injuries.

Officers are appealing for anyone who witnessed the collision, or who saw the car prior to the collision, to come forward. In particular they are keen to speak to anyone who may have dashcam footage of the incident.

Anyone with any information is asked to call PC Jon Yaxley from the Roads Policing Unit on 101 quoting reference number 296 of 21 September.

Alternatively report information here, or call independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
