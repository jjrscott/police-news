The Community Cohesion team held a successful open event at Luton Police Station on Saturday (6 April), with around 350 members of the public turning up to see the different areas of policing and the partnership work the team carries out.

Officers from the firearms unit, traffic unit, dog unit, support unit, scenes of crime and rural crime were in attendance, alongside colleagues from other emergency services, including the Fire Service, Ambulance Service and Serco.

Partner agencies were also there, including Mind, Signpost, the Luton Samaritans, Luton in Harmony, Luton Town Football Club and Neighbourhood Watch.

PC Karanjit Sanghera from the Cohesion team said: "It was a very successful day in terms of showing people the various different departments within our force and how we engage with our communities and work with our partner agencies.

"We have had some very positive feedback about the event and people are already asking when the next open day will take place!"
