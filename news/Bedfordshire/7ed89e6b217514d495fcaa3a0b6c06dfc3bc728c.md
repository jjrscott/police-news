**We have launched an investigation after an incident in Leighton Buzzard on Monday (7 December).**

At around 7.30pm, we were called to reports that a group of people were involved in an altercation in South Street.

Up to five men were involved in a disorder and left the scene in a dark vehicle, possibly a Mazda, towards Albany Road.

Detective Inspector Nick Gardner, from our Crime Investigation Team, said: "This incident happened on a residential street, early in the evening.

"We are currently following a number of lines of enquiry, but would be keen to hear from anyone who saw this group of men, or saw a dark car leaving the South Street area at this time.

"If you have any information that could help our investigation, please get in touch."

Anyone with information can report via our online reporting centre or webchat, quoting reference 376 of 7 December.

Alternatively, you can contact independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
