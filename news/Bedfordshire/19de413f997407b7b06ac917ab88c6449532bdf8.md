Nine officers from the Bedfordshire Police Special Constabulary were awarded their Long Service medals and Chief Officer Commendations at a ceremony which was held at Police Headquarters in Kempston on Wednesday (28 August).

The special constables have been volunteering their time to fight crime and protect the public of Bedfordshire for nine years which marks their long service and is recognised with a medal. Amongst those receiving their Long Service awards was Special Constable Alexis Broadway ** ** who has been a volunteer police officer with Bedfordshire Police for 19 years and receiving an additional award for her further 10 years' service.

Special Constable Broadway said: "Being a Special Constable is a very rewarding way to spend my free time and I have enjoyed all 19 years of service Bedfordshire Police. It has given me a great insight into the policing world and I have managed to experience most areas of policing."

Chief Constable Garry Forsyth said: "I would like to say thank you to the officers for their dedicated service to the force. The Special Constabulary provides an immense support to us and last year contributed 46,385 hours to policing in Bedfordshire.

"These officers have continued to support the force for more than nine years, which is fantastic."
