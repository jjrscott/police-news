**We are appealing for information after several items of jewellery were stolen from a house in Clifton Road, Shefford on Saturday (14 April).**

A personalised Garrard watch was taken along with seven pairs of earrings. The offender smashed French doors at the back of the property to gain entry, between 8am and 6pm.

Natalie Peters, Investigating Officer, said: "This incident is very upsetting for the victims due to the unique and very personal items stolen. As it happened on a weekend in a busy residential street, we are hoping someone might have seen something that will help our investigation."

If you have any information, please call 101 or use the reporting tool on the Bedfordshire Police website, quoting reference JD/16977/2018. You can also call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
