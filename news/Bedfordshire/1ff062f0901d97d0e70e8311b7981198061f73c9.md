We would like to remind the public to ensure personal belongings are removed from their vehicles when they are left unattended and overnight.

Since Monday (26 October) we have seen an increase in thefts from motor vehicles across the county being reported to us, with a number of personal belongings being stolen such as sports equipment, laptops, wallets, phones, cash and cards. The cards have then been used to make further purchases.

Don't leave yourself vulnerable to becoming a victim to these opportunists.

We advise you to;

 * Ensure all doors, windows and sunroofs are closed and locked when leaving your vehicle unattended
 * Always take the keys out of the ignition, even if you're only leaving your car for a moment
 * Don't leave your keys lying around or visible on a windowsill at home or near a front door, where they could be hooked through the letterbox
 * Never leave valuables in your vehicle and keep any other possessions out of sight.
 * If you use a vehicle for maintenance purposes, it is advisable not to leave tools or other working materials in a vehicle unoccupied or overnight, as works vehicles such as vans are commonly targeted by criminals
 * Never leave items of clothing such as jackets on show, opportunists will break in, in the hope there is something valuable in the pockets
 * Never leave vehicle documents in your car, as this would make it easy for a thief to sell your car or provide a cover story if stopped by the police

Areas that have been targeted include:

Putnoe
Clapham
Elstow
Bedford
Luton
Houghton Regis
Dunstable

Please continue to report anything suspicious to us by calling 101 or via our online reporting centre https://www.bedfordshire.police.uk/report/Report
