**We are appealing for information after a fatal road traffic collision in Hockliffe at the weekend. **

Callum Williams, 16, of Redwood Glade, Leighton Buzzard, sustained fatal injuries after he was involved in a collision with a blue Vauxhall Zafira on Leighton Road, close to the junction with Hawthorne Farm, at around 11:42pm on Saturday night (13 April).

Emergency services attended, but Callum was pronounced dead at the scene.

Sergeant Keith Evans, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Roads Policing Unit, said: "We are asking for anyone who may have information about the collision, or drivers with dashcams who were in the area at the time of the incident, to help us establish what happened."

In a statement, Callum's family said: "We are saddened to announce the passing of Callum. He was the loving son of Caroline and Andy Williams; a young man just beginning his journey in life, tragically taken too soon. Callum was a brother, son and uncle. An intelligent, caring, considerate and loving young man, he will be dearly missed by many."

The family ask that they be given privacy in which to grieve at this time.
