**We are appealing for witnesses following an indecent exposure in Houghton Regis on Monday (4 March).**

At approximately 8am, a woman was followed into Houghton Hall Park, where the offender then indecently exposed himself to the victim.

The offender is described as Asian, in his mid-20s with black hair and a short black beard. At the time of the offence he was described as wearing a dark green tracksuit and trainers.

We are keen to speak to anyone who saw a man matching the description in the area at the time.

Anyone with information is asked to get in touch through our online reporting centre or by calling 101 and quoting reference number 40/12856/19.

Alternatively you can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
