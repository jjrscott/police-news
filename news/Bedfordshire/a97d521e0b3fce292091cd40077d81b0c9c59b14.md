### The family of a man killed in a traffic collision in Bedford have paid tribute to his "polite, helpful and considerate personality".

Harry Frost, 20, from Silsoe, died as a result of the collision in Ford End Road at around 2.30pm on Friday (17 July).

In a statement, Mr Frost's family said: "Harry was a much loved son, brother, grandson and nephew, popular and well-liked by his work colleagues, friends and neighbours.

"His kind, polite, helpful and considerate personality endeared him to those who met him.

"He was fresh-faced with an infectious smile, with a quirky nature and a sense of humour to match.

"A talented magician, charitable volunteer and hard working young man tragically taken from us far too soon."

Mr Frost was pronounced dead at the scene following the collision involving a heavy goods vehicle. No other vehicles or pedestrians were involved.

The investigation is ongoing around the circumstances of the incident and a man in his 40s is assisting police with their enquiries.

Any witnesses or anyone with any information about Friday's collision is asked to contact police to report it online or through 101.
