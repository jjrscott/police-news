We are appealing for information after a man was robbed in Stronnell Close, Luton on Monday (26 November).

Between around 7.20pm and 7.50pm, the victim was cycling along the road when he was approached by three men who got out of a vehicle, believed to be a black Audi, which then left the scene.

One of the men lifted his jacket, showing the victim a knife in his waist band, and another produced a baton. They told the victim to give them everything he had, and took his mobile phone, bank card and bicycle.

They then ran off up Stronnell Close, turning right onto Turners Road.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact DC Marshall by calling 101 and quoting reference number 40/40180/18.

Alternatively, report information online at www.bedfordshire.police.uk/report or call independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111.
