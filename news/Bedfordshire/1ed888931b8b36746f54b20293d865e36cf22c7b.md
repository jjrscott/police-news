**We are appealing for information following an aggravated burglary at a property in Dunstable Road, near the Byron Road junction in Luton, yesterday evening (Monday). **

At around 8.20pm, three men entered the property through the back door and claimed to be police officers before threatening the occupants with offensive weapons.

One of the men was carrying what is believed to be a knife, and the other two men were in possession of screwdrivers. The offenders searched the house and stole cash, jewellery and a red handbag.

The first offender is described as white, around 30 years old, with brown eyes. He was muscular, wearing a black hat and scarf covering his face. He was speaking with an English accent and was threatening the occupants with a long screwdriver.

The other two men, who went upstairs and searched the address, are described as white and were wearing dark clothing and face coverings.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact the police through their online reporting centre or by calling 101 and quoting reference number 40/32768/18.

Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
