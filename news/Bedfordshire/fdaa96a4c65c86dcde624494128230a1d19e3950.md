We're appealing for witnesses after a man was assaulted in Bedford.

On Sunday (13 January), at around 5.30pm, a man was found by police on Ampthill Road, Bedford, outside Coral Bookmakers. He told officers he'd been assaulted on Millbrook Road by two men, who had then run away.

The victim was able to get to Ampthill Road where he collapsed, and was seen by officers driving past. An ambulance attended and the man received further treatment, although his injuries were not thought to have been life threatening.

Anyone with any information is asked to call 101 quoting reference number 40/2594/19. Alternatively, report information online by visiting www.bedfordshire.police.uk/report or by calling independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
