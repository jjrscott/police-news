We are appealing for witnesses following an attempted robbery on Monday morning (27 November) in Moor Path, Luton.

At approximately 5.30am a woman was walking along the path when she was approached by a man walking in the opposite direction. The man demanded money from her but she refused.

The offender then assaulted the woman, causing her to sustain minor injuries, and repeated his demand. After a short conversation with the woman, the offender walked away towards Villa Road.

The offender is described as black, approximately 5'8'', around 20 years old and wearing dark clothing.

Detective Constable Colin Knight, investigating, said: "This was clearly a distressing incident for the victim who required hospital treatment for her injuries. We are following a number of lines of enquiry and we are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

"Additionally the brief conversation between the offender and the victim might suggest that he was feeling remorseful. Therefore we would like to appeal to his conscious and ask him to come forward to take responsibility for his actions."

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to call DC Knight on 101 quoting reference number C/52135/2017. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
