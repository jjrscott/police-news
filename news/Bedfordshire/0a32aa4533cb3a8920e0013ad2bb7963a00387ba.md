**We are appealing for witnesses following a robbery on Monday (22 January) in Dunstable. **

Between 3.30pm and 3.50pm, a man and woman were chased to Edward Street from a nearby supermarket following a verbal altercation with three people. A man and woman then assaulted both the victims, causing minor injuries, while demanding money.

The offenders made off with a quantity of cash in an unknown direction.

The woman was described as a white, approximately 5'8'', with dark hair and of medium build.

Detective Constable Daniel O'Mahoney, investigating, said: "This was clearly a distressing incident for both victims. If you have any information about the incident, or you were in the area at the time and saw anything, please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101 quoting reference JD/3411/2018. You can also give information online via the Bedfordshire Police website, or call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
