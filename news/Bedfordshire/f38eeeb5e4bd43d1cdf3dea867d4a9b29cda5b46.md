Officers are appealing for information following a distraction burglary in the Biscot area of Luton.

At approximately 12:30pm on Wednesday (17 March), a man knocked on the door of a property, and claimed to be a deliveryman asking the victim to sign for a neighbours package.

The man has claimed he didn't have a pen and when the victim has gone to find one, the man entered the property and followed the woman.

The victim attempted to leave and noticed two more men had forced their way into the property.

Neighbours were alerted to the incident and disturbed the men, who ran from the location.

The first man was described as black, of slim build and around 5'11'' and was believed to be wearing a black hooded top and bottoms, black face mask and a yellow florescent tabard, and was seen leaving the rear of the property, jumping the back fence.

The second and third men were described as black, of slim build and around 5'11", and were wearing dark clothing. Both men were seen leaving the location in a metallic gold Vauxhall Corsa. A fourth man wearing an orange florescent tabard with a black hooded top and grey jogging bottoms was also seen entering the vehicle before leaving the area.

PC Craig Cullum, investigating from the force's dedicated burglary unit, said: "We would like to speak to anyone that may have been contacted in a similar way, or anyone who was in the area around the time of this incident and who may have noticed anyone matching the description of the offenders.

"This incident has left the victim shaken up and officers are supporting her. These types of crimes have no place in Bedfordshire and we will work towards catching those responsible.

"In a time where many people are isolated and vulnerable at home during the Coronavirus pandemic, please take some time to talk to your elderly and vulnerable neighbours as they may not be aware of how to spot the signs of a distraction burglary."
