**We are investigating a stabbing in Luton on Friday (9 March) and we are appealing for witnesses to come forward.**

We were called just after 11pm to reports that a man had been stabbed in Dallow Road.

The offenders are described as four Asian men, around 18-years-old and wearing dark clothing.

Detective Constable Hasan Balic, investigating, said: "We don't believe this is a random attack, but we are keen to piece together the events leading up to the incident. The victim's injuries required hospital treatment and he remains in hospital. We will not tolerate knife crime in our county and we are keen to speak to anyone who have any information about this incident."

Anyone with information is asked to report it through the force's website or by calling 101 quoting reference number 445 of 9 March.

Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
