Officers are appealing for information after a woman in her 70s was robbed of her handbag by two offenders on a moped in Luton.

The incident took place last Monday (30 September) at around 11am on Midland Road, close to the train station entrance. The offenders have ridden on the pavement and approached the victim from behind grabbing the handles of her black handbag, pulling her forward, causing her to fall to the ground. The moped has been described as dark coloured.

DC Gary Hatton said: "This was a shocking robbery which took place in broad daylight, leaving the victim extremely shaken. It would have been a busy time of day at the train station and I am urging anyone who saw anything or has any information to come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact DC Hatton on 101 or through our online reporting centre quoting reference number 40/56315/19.

Alternatively you can call independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
