***SENT ON BEHALF OF HERTS POLICE ***

**Detectives investigating an aggravated burglary are appealing for witnesses and information.**

The burglary happened in the Dunlin area of Letchworth, Hertfordshire at around 2pm on Saturday (5 October).

A group of men forced entry to a property, one carrying a hammer. The victims, a woman and two children, were the only occupants inside the house at the time.

The offenders threatened the woman and searched the house, taking some valuables. The victims were unharmed.

They got into a small blue estate vehicle and drove off in the direction of Hitchin.

The vehicle was later stopped in Arlesey, Bedfordshire and a 42-year-old man from Arlesey was arrested on suspicion of burglary. Another man also in the vehicle escaped on foot.

Detective Sergeant Will Ainsworth, from the North Herts Local Crime Unit, said: "Thankfully none of the victims were harmed during this ordeal, but they remain very shaken and are being supported by specialist officers.

"We are following a number of lines of enquiry, however we would like to hear from anyone who has information that may assist in our investigation."
