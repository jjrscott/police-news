We are appealing for information after a robbery in Luton.

Yesterday (Monday), three men knocked on the door of a property in Wellington Street at around 5pm.

The men claimed to be from the water board before pushing past the elderly victim to gain access to the property. The men threatened the victim and forced her to hand over money to them.

One of the offenders was described as an Asian male wearing gloves with red patches, and the other two men were masked.

PC Leila Sadri-Hall, investigating, said: "This was a particularly nasty robbery that has left the elderly victim distressed.

"I urge anyone to come forward who witnessed the incident, or saw three men in the area acting suspiciously, or anyone with any information to please get in contact."

Anyone with information is asked to contact 101 or visit www.bedfordshire.police.uk/report quoting reference 40/7107/20. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.
