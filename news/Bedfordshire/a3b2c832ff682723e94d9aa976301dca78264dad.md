**We are appealing for witnesses, after a man died in road traffic collision near Marston Moretaine on Thursday (24 December).**

Emergency services were called just after 7.35pm on Christmas Eve to a report of a silver Ford Focus involved in a single vehicle collision on the eastbound carriageway of the A421.

Sadly, the passenger - a man in his 50s - was pronounced dead at the scene and the driver was taken to hospital for treatment to his injuries.

Sergeant Timothy Davies from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Roads Policing Unit said: "We have launched an investigation into the circumstances of this collision and are keen to hear from anyone who may have been in the area at the time and witnessed the incident.

"Our specially-trained liaison officers are supporting the family at this difficult time.

"If you think you saw the silver Ford Focus prior to the collision, or have any dash cam footage, then please get in touch."

Anyone with information should call on 101 quoting Operation Linen or use the online reporting centre.
