**We now have specialist trained officers across the county who are able to use stinger equipment.**

These devices help tackle nuisance motorcyclists who pose a risk to themselves and members of the public.

The ability for us to utilise a stinger device deters people from riding bikes illegally, helping to support the force's Operation Meteor which was set up to reduce the number of offenders.

Sergeant Sam Hunt said: "We are always looking at developing innovative ways to disrupt motorcyclists who ride illegally, as well as gathering evidence to identify and prosecute those responsible."

"We've already invested in off-road police motorcycles, training more riders ready for the summer months. I am hopeful the use of stinger equipment will help in our fight against those who cause all sorts of anti-social behaviour problems, as well as pose a danger to themselves, other road users and pedestrians."
