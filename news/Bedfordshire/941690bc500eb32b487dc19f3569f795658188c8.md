**We are holding our first county-wide charity football tournament and are looking to recruit teams of boys and girls for both the under 14 and under 16 tournaments.**

Taking place in aid of Embrace, a charity that supports young people whose lives have been impacted by serious crime, the seven-a-side tournament KickOff@3 kicks off on Sunday 28 April at Kempston Rovers FC in Hillgrounds Road, Kempston, with a maximum of 10 players in each team.

The winning team will then go onto to represent Bedfordshire in a national final which will take place in London in July.

The entry fee is Â£25 per team; part of which goes towards Embrace to support the work it does with young people in Bedfordshire.

Paul Griffiths, Schools Liaison Officer, said: "The aim of this tournament is to build and strengthen the relationships we currently have with our community partners and as such, we have had a lot of local companies offering to sponsor us.

"It is also a great opportunity to get children from across the county together to show off their football skills, as well as being a great excuse for bringing members of the community together with young people."

For more information on how to register a team, please contact Paul Griffiths on paul.griffiths@bedfordshire.pnn.police.uk

Please note that the deadline is Friday 29 March and places are filling fast **.**
