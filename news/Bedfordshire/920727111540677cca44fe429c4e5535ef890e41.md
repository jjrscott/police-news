Yesterday (Wednesday), at 6.30pm, the victim saw a man behaving suspiciously in Salisbury Street, and approached him.

The man left, but was seen a few minutes later, and continued to behave suspiciously.

Believing he may have been committing a theft, the victim approached the man, who pulled out a knife and stabbed him to the abdomen.

The offender is described as white, 5'10'', slim, with short brown hair and facial hair. He was wearing a dark blue bomber jacket, jeans and light-coloured trainers.

He made off in the direction of Hartington Street.

Detective Constable Luke Williams, investigating, said: "Luckily, the victim was not badly injured and is recovering.

"We would like to hear from anyone who was in the area at that time, and who may have seen someone acting strangely.

"We are determined to find the man responsible and will never tolerate such behaviour on our streets.

"If you notice anyone behaving suspiciously, or you think may be committing a crime, please do not approach them. If you believe a crime is in progress, please call 999."

Anyone with information can contact police through the force's online reporting centre, quoting reference number 40/66524/20.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
