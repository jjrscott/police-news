**A woman had her bag stolen in Pennine Road, Bedford on Monday (9 April) and we are now appealing for witnesses to the incident.**

At around midday, the woman was walking her dog when a person riding a bike grabbed the bag from her shoulder; she tried to keep hold of it, but lost her balance and fell over. The offender, who was wearing a dark hooded top with the hood up, rode off with the bag, which was a soft beige fabric shopper style with a sheep print. It contained a purse with bank cards, cash, a bus pass, and a black Nokia phone.

PC Billie Scholten, investigating, said: "This incident took place in the middle of the day on a residential street, so we are hoping there may have been witnesses who can help to find the person who did this. It has understandably left the victim shaken and upset."

Anyone with information is asked to contact us 101 quoting reference number 182 of 9 April, or by visiting our online reporting centre.
