**Officers from our North Rural Community Team carried out a drugs warrant in a property in St Peters Avenue, Arlesey on Tuesday (3 July).**

Following a search of the address, a quantity of what is believed to be a Class B drug and drugs paraphernalia were discovered.

The officers issued a 24-hour closure notice on the location, which was extended to a three-month Closure Order after a Magistrates' Court hearing yesterday, (Wednesday).

A 44-year-old man from Arlesey has been arrested on suspicion of possession of a controlled substance, and was later released under investigation.

A second person found in the location was safeguarded and offered appropriate support.
