**We have asked the county's schools and educational establishments to get arty and design and make this year's force Christmas tree decorations.**

We've asked teachers to set the challenge as a project to their classes, and ask the students to think about Christmas in Bedfordshire, or in their local community, and come up with a design.

The design will then need to be made into a bauble, and submitted for judging.

The winning class will be invited, as guests of honour, to attend the Christmas lights switch-on ceremony in December, at the our headquarters in Kempston. The winning bauble will take pride of place at the ceremony, and will be displayed with the other entries, on the tree.

If you're a teacher and you'd like to register your interest in the competition, please email our schools liaison team for an entry pack: SchoolsLiaison@bedfordshire.pnn.police.uk.

The closing date for receipt of entries is Wednesday 14 November 2018.
