As the start of the road cycling season approaches, we have joined forces with British Cycling to help ensure the safety of participants and other road users.

Throughout the coming months, drivers in Bedfordshire will see British Cycling-trained Accredited Marshals holding 'Stop - Cycle Race' signs, which allow the safe passage of the race.

Inspector Chris Huggins of Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Roads Policing, said: "The scheme, in conjunction with the professional risk assessments provided and the excellent pre-race briefings given by race organisers, makes each event much safer for both riders and road users.

"All road users should be aware that stop signs used under the Accredited Marshal Scheme must be treated in the same way that you would a red traffic light. Failure to comply with this sign is not only a traffic offence, which could lead to prosecution, but puts the safety of others at risk."
