**We are appealing for help to trace a driver who failed to stop following a collision in Bedford on Saturday (23 December).**

The collision took place at around 10.30pm on the roundabout of Harrowden Road and Eastcotts Road. The driver of one of the vehicles involved, a small dark car - possibly a Volkswagen Polo, failed to stop at the scene and drove off towards Lovell Road.

The other vehicle was quite badly damaged, however the occupant did not suffer any injuries.

Police now want to trace the vehicle and driver involved.

Anyone with information should contact PC Emma Tinkler on 101 quoting reference 446 of 23 December.
