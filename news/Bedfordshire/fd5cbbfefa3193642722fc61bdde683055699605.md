### On Friday (10 July) at approximately 2.30pm, there was a physical struggle between two men outside of Luton Magistrates' Court. The offender injured the victim before stealing his mobile phone and running away.

The offender is described as white, approximately 5'9'' and is of slim build. He is believed to have light brown hair with stubble on his face and a cross tattooed on the right side of his head. He was wearing a grey hoody and black trainers.

Trainee Detective Constable Kimberley Anderson, from our Crime Investigation Team, said: "This incident took place in the middle of the day in a busy area so we are urging for anyone who saw this to come forward. The offender has an obvious feature with a tattoo on his face, and I would like anyone who thinks they know someone matching this description to come forward.

"Crime has no place in our community and we do not tolerate this kind of behaviour on the streets of Bedfordshire."

Anyone with information can report it or by calling 101, quoting reference 240 of 10 July.

Alternatively, you can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
