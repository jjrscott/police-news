### We are appealing for help in locating a wanted man.

Jordan Carr, 20, of Palmerston Road, London is currently wanted in connection with an incident in Kempston on 29 January 2020 and on recall to prison.

Carr has links to the Bedford area.

He is described as approximately six-foot-tall, of medium build with short afro hair. He has the word 'Mum' tattooed on his hand and a small scar in the middle of his right hand.

Detective Constable David Gordon, investigating, said: "We are asking for the public's help in locating Carr, as we would like to speak to him in connection with an incident in Kempston.

"If anyone knows of his whereabouts and is assisting him in any way, you may be at risk of committing a criminal offence."

Members of the public are asked not to approach him and to instead call 101 immediately if they see him or have any information on his whereabouts quoting reference number 40/AD/15893/20.

You can also submit information via independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
