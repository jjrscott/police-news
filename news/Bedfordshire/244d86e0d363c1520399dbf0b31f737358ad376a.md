We are appealing for information after a large construction vehicle was stolen.

At around 11.05pm on Monday (1 July) the JCB 541-70 Telehandler with front forks was stolen from an address in Faldo Road, Barton-le-Clay.

The vehicle did have a tracker, which was removed from the vehicle on site.

Detective Sergeant Chris Hutton, from the force's intelligence team, said: "We are keen to hear from anyone who saw a JCB moving or on a transport in the area at that time.

"This is a very distinctive vehicle and would have stood out, especially at that time of night.

"We would be particularly keen to hear from anyone who may have CCTV in the area, or motorists with dashcams who were in the vicinity.

"Historically, offences like these tend to be linked to further criminality, so we are appealing for the public's help in order to prevent other offences."

Anyone with any information is asked to call DS Hutton on 101, quoting reference 40/37873/19.

You can also report information online using the force's online reporting centre, or by calling Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111.
