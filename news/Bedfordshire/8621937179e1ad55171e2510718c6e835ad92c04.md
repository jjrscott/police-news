We are appealing for witnesses after an altercation in Luton on Friday, 17 November.

Between 4.30pm and 6pm a car was damaged in Castle Street with what was believed to be an air weapon, while the occupants were inside.

The suspects, a group of three Asian men, then drove away from the scene in a grey Volkswagen Golf GTD.

Anyone who witnessed the incident is asked to contact PC Gibbs on 101 or call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
