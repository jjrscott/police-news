Shortly before 2pm, the victim, who was with three friends, was approached by three men, who assaulted him and made off with his watch.

Two of the suspects are described as south Asian, one tall and wearing a black hooded top, the second short, wearing a red jacket and hooded top. The third suspect is described as white and wearing a tracksuit.

All three suspects are thought to be between 17 and 18 years old.
