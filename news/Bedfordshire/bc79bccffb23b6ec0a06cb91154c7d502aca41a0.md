### A Birmingham man has been charged with 14 offences including a number of burglaries after an investigation led by our force.

Darren Levy, 38, of Parliament Street, Birmingham, has been charged over eight burglaries and four thefts of motor vehicles in Bromham in July.

Levy has also been charged in connection to offences in Northamptonshire and Milton Keynes as a result of the investigation by our Operation Maze burglary team.

He appeared at Birmingham Magistrates' Court yesterday (Thursday) where he was remanded in custody pending a future court appearance.
