**Police Dog Dexter got 2018 off to a flying a start after tracking down a substantial amount of cannabis.**

At around 1am on Tuesday (2 January 2018) a vehicle failed to stop when signalled to do so by our officers in Luton. After a pursuit, the driver pulled over and fled the scene.

The police helicopter and PD Dexter were called to join the search, and although unfortunately they were unable to trace the man, Dexter discovered a large amount of cannabis and some cash which was believed to have been hidden by the offender so that he could collect it at a later date.

PC Mark West, Dexter's handler, said: "Although unfortunately we couldn't find the offender, thanks to Dexter's great nose we were able to find both drugs and cash which are believed to have been dropped by him, which could well help identify the man involved.

"Dexter is very much looking forward to another year of sniffing out drugs and bad guys and has made it his new year resolution to help put as many offenders as possible behind bars."

Investigations to trace the driver of the vehicle are on-going and anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101 quoting reference number nine of 2 January.
