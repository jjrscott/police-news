**We are appealing for witnesses and information after a teenage boy was stabbed in Luton.**

Officers were called at around 1.45pm today (Wednesday) to reports of a stabbing in Park Street, close to the junction with Cumberland Street.

The 17-year-old victim suffered a single stab wound and was airlifted to hospital with potentially life threatening injuries.

Detective Inspector Grant Maxted, who is leading the investigation, said: "This is a serious act of violence against one of our young people.

"While our investigation is at an early stage, this is believed to be an isolated incident with no risk to the wider public.

"This all happened in a very central location, so if anyone saw anything or has any other information which could help with our enquiries, please get in contact.

"You can speak to us, or help us by speaking to Crimestoppers or Fearless anonymously and in confidence."

Anyone with information can contact us on 101 or via www.bedfordshire.police.uk/report, quoting reference number 206 of 4 December.

Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111, while anyone can report information through Fearless, the young people's crime charity, by visiting fearless.org
