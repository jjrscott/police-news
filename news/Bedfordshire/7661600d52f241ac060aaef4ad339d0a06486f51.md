**An investigation has been launched after three men who claimed to be police officers entered a house in Ampthill on Wednesday evening (17 January) and stole cash, jewellery, and bank cards from an elderly woman.**

At approximately 10.10pm the three men entered the victim's house in Grange Road using a key that they had stolen from a key box outside the property. When the woman challenged the men, they stated they were police officers and proceeded to carry out a search of her house.

They then took cash from the victim's handbag, stole jewellery, and also made off with two silver BT landline phones.

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting reference number 408 of 17 January. You can also call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
