**A man who broke into someone 's room and attacked them with a hammer has been jailed for 18 years.**

Marcin Jurkiewicz, 36, of Copenhagen Close, Luton, hit another man over the head with the hammer on multiple occasions during the attack in July 2018.

The victim also suffered broken ribs and injuries consistent with being strangled as a result of Jurkiewicz's assault.

Jurkiewicz was found guilty at trial of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. On Wednesday he was handed an 18-year prison sentence.

Detective Constable Rachel Lydon, who led the investigation, said: "This was a horrendous attack involving the most extreme use of violence.

"The fact Jurkiewicz attempted to plead his innocence, despite the overwhelming evidence against him, makes his actions appear even more callous.

"Given the severity of this crime, we are pleased the judge has responded with such a significant sentence.

"Offenders capable of this level of violence have no place on the streets of our county, and I hope this case sends a strong message to the public that such actions will not be tolerated."
