We are appealing for information after a robbery in the early hours of Christmas Day.

The victim was approached by a man on a bike at around 12.20am on Wednesday (25 December) in Manton Lane, Bedford.

The suspect got off his bike and threatened the victim with a knife, stealing a Rolex Submariner watch and cash before making off on his bike.

The offender is described as wearing a dark coloured hooded Puffa jacket, fastened with poppers and with the hood worn up, a dark scarf covering his face, dark Adidas tracksuit bottoms with three white stripes down the outside of each leg and dark coloured trainers.

He was riding a dark coloured mountain bike.

DC Helen Howson, investigating, said: "This sort of offending will not be tolerated and we would like to hear from anyone who can help with our investigation.

"Plus, if anyone has been given or bought a Rolex Submariner watch over the festive period, please get in touch with us as it may have been stolen."

Anyone with any information is asked to contact police on 101 or via bedfordshire.police.uk/report quoting reference 40/72751/19.

You can also report information via Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
