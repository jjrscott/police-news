**We are appealing for information after a man and a woman were racially abused in Dunstable last Monday (26 February). **

At approximately 5.50pm, the man and woman were walking along the High Street when a woman started using threatening language and shouting racial abuse at them.

The offender is described as a white, 5'6'' and of an average build.

PC Simon Day said: "We are urging anyone who witnessed this incident to come forward as we do not tolerate racial abuse. This was an unacceptable incident which was extremely distressing for both of the victims."

Anyone with information is asked to contact us using our online reporting centre or by calling us on 101 quoting reference number JD/9360/2018.
