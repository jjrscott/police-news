**We are appealing for witnesses to a motorway collision which took place in the early hours of Sunday (16 February), and left a man in a critical condition.**

The incident occurred on the southbound carriageway of the M1, just before junction 12 for Flitwick, at around 4.30am.

A silver Toyota Prius leaving Toddington services, entered the southbound carriageway and proceeded to drive north, then attempted to make a u-turn in the carriageway, where it was involved in a collision with a black Skoda Superb. A man suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospital.

An investigation has now been launched and officers are appealing for witnesses.

Sergeant Mark Atkins, of the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Roads Policing Unit, said: "We are asking for anyone with information, and in particular dash cam footage, to get in touch.

"If you saw the Toyota at the services, or on the southbound carriageway prior to the collision, we would like to hear from you."

Anyone with information is asked to contact the Roads Policing Unit on 101, quoting the reference Operation Banksia.
