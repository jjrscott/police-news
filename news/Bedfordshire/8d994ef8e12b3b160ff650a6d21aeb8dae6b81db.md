Police are appealing for information after three vehicles belonging to NHS staff had their tyres slashed.

Yesterday evening (Thursday), police were made aware of the damage, which occurred outside Gilbert Hitchcock House, Kimbolton Road, Bedford.

It is believed this happened a short time before Clap for Carers at 8pm, which was attended by members of the public, the police and ambulance service.

Dave Heaslip from the force's Crime Bureau said: "We are disappointed that this happened whilst people were giving thanks to NHS staff, and we will never tolerate criminal damage in Bedfordshire.

"This incident caused delays to the onward travel of staff who are working tirelessly to save lives during COVID-19, and we would urge the public to come forward if they saw anyone acting suspiciously in the area at the time."

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting reference number 40/26139/20
