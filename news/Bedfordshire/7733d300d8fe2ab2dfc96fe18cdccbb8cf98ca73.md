**Two people have been arrested in the latest phase of an operation targeting the supply of drugs in Bedford.**

Two men in their 20s from the Bedford area were arrested in a series of coordinated warrants yesterday morning (Tuesday).

Around 50 officers and staff took part in the operation, which was led by our Serious and Organised Crime Unit (SOCU).

Ten people have now been arrested as part of this wider operation over the past month, which has targeted three suspected drugs lines in the town.

Detective Inspector Graham McMillan, from SOCU, said: "Our message to anyone running a drugs line in Bedford is clear - we are coming after you.

"Drug dealing drives much of the most serious violence we deal with every day, with this organised crime often involving the exploitation of children and other vulnerable people.

"We are determined to take those peddling in this miserable industry off the streets, as well as signposting those with addiction issues to help and support services."

Multiple addresses in the Bedford area were subject to warrants on Tuesday morning, with follow-up enquiries taking place around the town.

The two men have subsequently been charged with conspiracy to supply Class A drugs and are due to appear at court on Wednesday morning.

If you have any information about drug dealing please report it to 101 or through the online reporting centre on our website.

All of this information is fed into our intelligence systems and can help us tackle organised crime.

People can also report information via Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
