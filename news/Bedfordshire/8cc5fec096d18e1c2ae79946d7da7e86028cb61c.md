**More than 60 hoteliers from across Bedfordshire attended a training conference on Thursday (21 March) to learn how to spot the signs of child sexual exploitation (CSE) and how to take action.**

The event was held at the Chiltern Hotel in Luton and was specifically designed for hotel employees in public facing roles, and attendees ranged from management to receptionists.

Hosted by us, along with Luton Council, Central Bedfordshire Council and Bedford Borough Council, delegates heard from speakers from the police and CYP First.

Hotels can be used as locations to meet and groom children, so the event was held to increase the hoteliers' awareness of understanding CSE, knowing the signs to look for and know how to report any concerns.

Operation Makesafe is a police initiative, supported by partners and the hotel industry, which aims to identify potential victims and the perpetrators of CSE in public places, such as hotels, licensed premises, fast food outlets and taxi services, and where necessary, deploy officers to intervene and safeguard children before any harm or abuse occurs.

Pete Gomm, our CSE Co-ordinator said: "This training, targeted for hoteliers, looks to give confidence to managers and other employees to be able to identify any concerns, and to advise them on how they can respond to such concerns with police support.

"This is the second event we have held, after we had such great feedback from last year's training."
