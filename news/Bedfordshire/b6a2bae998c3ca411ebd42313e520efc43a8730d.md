**Officers are appealing for witnesses, following a single vehicle road traffic collision on the A1.**

On Tuesday 9 February, at around 7pm, a blue Honda Accord was travelling southbound on the A1 when it collided with a lorry, then a street lamp and a telegraph pole at Seddington.

Two men were seen running across the A1 away from the Honda, and onto the northbound carriageway, where they continued running south.

PC Hannah Edmonds from our Crime Investigation team said "I am appealing for any witnesses who were in the area at this time and saw the vehicle collide with the lorry, or the street lamp and telegraph pole, or who may have seen two men running from the scene, or saw anyone acting suspiciously in the area.

"I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who may have dashcam footage of the blue Honda and the lorry prior to, or following, the incident."

Anyone with information is asked to call 101, or to report via our online reporting centre, quoting reference number 40/6960/21.
