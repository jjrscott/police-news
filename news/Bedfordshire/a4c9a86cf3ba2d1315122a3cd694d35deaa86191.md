### We are re-appealing for the public's help in locating a man wanted in connection to a serious assault.

Officers are looking for John Cole, 53, of no fixed address, and believe he could be in the Luton area.

Cole, who was featured recently on the "Wanted Faces" feature of BBC One's Crimewatch Roadshow, is described as six foot tall and of stocky build. He also has links to north London.

Detective Sergeant Victoria Willetts said: "Our investigation into a serious assault continues, and we would very much like to trace John Cole.

"Information from the public could be key to finding him in connection with a very nasty assault, and we're also interested to know what car he is using and any places he may have been seen.

"I would urge anyone who has seen him, or knows where he could be, to get in contact with us as soon as possible."

Anyone who has information about Cole's whereabouts, or who recognises the man pictured, is urged not to approach him, but to contact police immediately on 101 quoting Operation Again.

You can also submit information via the force's online reporting tool or by calling independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
