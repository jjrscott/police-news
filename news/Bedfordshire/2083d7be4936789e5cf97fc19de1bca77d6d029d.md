### We are appealing for information after a road traffic collision in Arlesey on Thursday (13 August) left a man with injuries.

At approximately 3.43am, police were called to a report of a man lying in the middle of Arlesey New Road.

Emergency services attended and the man was taken to hospital. An investigation into this incident has been launched.

PC Chris Dougherty from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit, said: "We are keen to hear from anyone who witnessed this incident to contact us so we can piece together what happened and how this man ended up in the road. We would also like to hear from anyone who may have seen a small, light-coloured hatchback vehicle with a dark roof near the area at around 3.24am."

Anyone with information or dash cam footage is asked to contact police via our website or by calling PC Dougherty on 101 quoting reference 70 of 13 August.
