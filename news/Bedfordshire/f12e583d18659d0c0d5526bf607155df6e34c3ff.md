**Three quad bikes, one off-road bike and a van were seized last week after our North Community Team executed a warrant in Bedford on Monday (5 February).**

Officers from the Bedford Urban community team executed warrants at three garages in Honeysuckle Way. The proactive operation was a result of close partnership working with Bedford Borough Community Safety Team and aims to crack down on nuisance biking.

Sergeant Luke Blackburn said: "We continue to clamp down on anti-social behaviour, which includes off road biking and are committed to keeping the residents of our town safe.

"I want to send a strong message to people who ride in dangerous and anti-social manner: we will find you and we will bring you to justice."

If you have concerns about nuisance and anti-social biking in your area you can report it through the force's online reporting centre or by calling 101.

Residents can also fill in our survey to tell us about the issues in their neighbourhood.
