A man has been served with a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) for prolific shoplifting in Leighton Buzzard.

Ashley Bird, 36, of no fixed abode, was served a two-year CBO at Luton Magistrates' Court yesterday (Tuesday), preventing him from visiting Leighton Buzzard town centre and any businesses in the area.

PCSO Elliot Weedon, from community policing, said: "We work in close partnership with the council and local business owners to make sure our town and High Street is a safe place for our residents.

"Ashley Bird has continuously targeted local shops, costing them money and causing distress to the owners and employees with his behaviour. We are happy with the court's decision to issue him with a CBO."
