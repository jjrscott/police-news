### We are appealing for witnesses after a man was assaulted on Biscot Road, Luton on Sunday (10 January).

At approximately 8pm, a man was walking along the road when he was chased by two men, one of which assaulted him.

At the junction of Dorrington Close, a vehicle pulled up alongside, and the second man attempted to drag the victim into the car, but failed.

Both men then got into the car, and the vehicle made off towards Luton town centre.

Detective Constable Catherine Layton, who is investigating the assault, said: "This incident took place on a busy residential road, and I would appeal to anyone who was in the area at the time, and witnessed anything however small, to come forward.

"I would also ask people to check any home CCTV, or dash cam footage, as it may assist our enquiries to establish the circumstances of the incident and identify the offenders."

If you have any information please call DC Layton on 101 and quote reference number 40/1596/21, or submit information online via our reporting tool.

You can also call independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
