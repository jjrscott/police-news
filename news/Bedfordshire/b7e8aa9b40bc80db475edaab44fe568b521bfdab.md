**The Digital Media Investigation Unit, a part of our Cyber Hub, was shortlisted in a prestigious national Cyber Security Award in Innovative Product of the Year category at an event yesterday (Thursday).**

The team came up with the idea of a mobile examination van, which can be used to triage devices from suspects' homes to examine if they have any evidential value. The team, which investigates crime in the digital world, has a great understanding of the environment needed to investigate the device thoroughly, but efficiently.

Through their tenacity and passion for the work they are doing, and with support from the Police and Crime Commissioner, this idea became reality in August last year. The team partnered up with digital forensics solutions Cellebrite to fit out the vehicle with state-of-the-art technology.

Since its launch the van has been deployed nearly a hundred times and, during these deployments, over 500 devices have been examined in the van. Of those devices, 148 were deemed to hold evidential value. Without the van all those devices would need to be seized and await forensic examination in the Cyber Hub's lab.

Chief Superintendent Mark Lay said: "I am proud of our team, as our force was the only one from the public sector to be shortlisted for this awards event. We wouldn't have been able to reach this level of success without support from our Police and Crime Commissioner Kathryn Holloway. I would also like to thank the event organisers for recognising our efforts in improving the way we investigate crime.

"Since its launch the van has greatly improved working conditions for our officers and sped up the process of returning devices of no evidential value to the household and family members.

"We are constantly exploring various opportunities we can use the van for, as more and more crimes now have a cyber element to them."

Detective Sergeant Pete Ward, from the Digital Media Investigation Team, said: "I am delighted that my team and I were nominated for this award.

"Our forensics van is the only one of its kind in the country and it is paving the way in the digital investigations world. Our force is always looking into improving our digital examination tactics to swiftly apprehend the offenders and bring them to justice.

"We received so much support since from our partners in Cellebrite and our PCC to make this idea happened and we would like to thank them for their help."
