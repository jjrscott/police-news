Bedfordshire Police's recruitment team was recognised during the National Black Police Association Annual General Meeting (NBPA AGM), for their ongoing work to encourage more people from Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) backgrounds to consider a career with the force. ****

A recent report by the Home Office showed that Bedfordshire Police is the second highest recruiter of officers from Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) backgrounds of all 43 police forces. As a result, at the AGM Inspector Mo Aziz and PC Ruth John-Chambers were presented with the Special Recognition Award.

The increase comes after an ongoing drive by the force to be more reflective of the communities it serves over the past two years. Through their work, around a third of the officers recruited have been from a BME background.

Inspector Mo Aziz said: "I am immensely proud of this achievement, as we are working tirelessly to recruit people from all ethnicities and walks of life. We will continue to work closely with our communities to engage all residents of Bedfordshire and encourage them to consider a career with the police."

Chief Constable Jon Boutcher said: "Our force's recruitment team is continuing to work hard in recruiting officers who better reflect Bedfordshire's communities. The team's incredible work and dedication puts Bedfordshire Police second only to the Met in terms of BME representation.

"This is a remarkable achievement by the small but well-formed team and something which should be recognised as a positive development in national policing."

Mo Aziz and Ruth John-Chambers
