**We seized around 300 cannabis plants from a property in Kensworth this morning (Tuesday).**

We received reports of suspicious behaviour at a property in Kensworth yesterday (Monday). Response officers initially attended at 11pm last night and found a large number of cannabis plants.

This morning officers from the Dunstable and Leighton Buzzard community policing teams attended to dismantle the factory, seize the plants and secure the property. Officers also seized a number of weapons.

No arrests have been made, but an investigation is ongoing.

Sergeant Ben Craven, from the community team, said: "We are pleased we have shut down this substantial operation, removing a significant quantity of drugs and weapons from our streets."

Anyone with any information about this incident is asked to call 101 quoting reference number 391 of 18 February.
