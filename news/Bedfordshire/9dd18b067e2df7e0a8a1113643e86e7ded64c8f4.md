**We are appealing for witnesses after a man was stabbed during an altercation in Park Street, Luton. **

Overnight on Saturday 1 June, the victim was with his friends at a pub in Castle Street, Luton. They had a verbal altercation with a group of people before leaving the pub.

The group followed the victim and his friend, and an altercation ensued in Park Street, during which the victim was stabbed.

One of the group is described as having a black beard and black hair, wearing a grey hooded jacket, dark trousers and a pair of light-coloured trainers.

Detective Constable Mandy Godfree, who is investigating, said: "We are committed to tackling knife crime \- carrying a knife isn't acceptable. We are keen to speak to anyone with information about this incident, whether they witnessed it, or simply noticed suspicious activity in the area around that time."
