**We are appealing for witnesses to an incident in which a man was robbed in Luton on Thursday (28 November).**

At approximately 8.30pm, the victim was walking along Linden Road and Filmer Road, when he was followed by a man who then shouted and screamed at him, threatening him and demanding money.

The victim gave the offender what cash he had, but the man continued to threaten him, and demanded more.

The victim then went with the man to a cash point within a store on Beechwood Road and withdrew more cash to hand over.

DC Richard Marshall, investigating, said: "This incident was very upsetting for the victim and we are hoping that people will come forward.

"We are keen to speak to anyone who may have witnessed anything, or who may have information."

Anyone with information is asked to contact DC Marshall by calling 101, or through the online reporting centre, quoting reference number 40/68925/19.

Alternatively, please contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
