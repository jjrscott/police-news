**We are appealing for witnesses after a man was wounded during an incident in Kempston.**

Emergency services were called at around 6pm on Friday (20 July) to reports of an altercation in the park near the One Stop shop in Hillgrounds Road, Kempston.

A man was standing talking with friends when an unknown offender hit him on the back of the head with a knife and he sustained a deep laceration.

He also suffered a stab wound to his abdomen, and required hospital treatment for his injuries.

The offender ran off down an alleyway into a nearby housing estate.

Anyone with any information can report it using our online reporting centre or contact us on 101, quoting reference number 358 of 20 July.
