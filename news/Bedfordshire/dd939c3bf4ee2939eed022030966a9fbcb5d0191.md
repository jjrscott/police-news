**Our Luton Community Policing Team have closed a cannabis factory after being called to reports of suspicious behaviour at a property in Tennyson Road, Luton, in the early hours of Tuesday morning (12 March).**

At around 2.03am, police were called to reports of a potential burglary at the property, reporting smashed windows and a suspicious vehicle in the area.

Two PCs on patrol nearby saw a vehicle that they believed could have been linked to activity at the property. The vehicle was stopped, and two men were arrested after officers recovered a large quantity of cash, an axe handle and a can of what is believed to be CS spray.

Officers later attended the property in Tennyson Road, where they found a cannabis factory.

The two men, aged 35 and 36, were arrested and have been released on bail while enquiries continue.

Sergeant John Killick said: "We take concerns reported by our communities very seriously, and we will continue to crack down on drug related criminality and activity. I would urge people to continue to report suspicious activity to us - thanks to this incident being reported to us as a burglary, we were able to swiftly find and destroy a large number of cannabis plants."
