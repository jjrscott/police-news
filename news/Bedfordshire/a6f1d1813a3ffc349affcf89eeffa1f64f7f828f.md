An operation lead by special constables at London Luton Airport in February engaged with 150 passengers from four different flights to support efforts to end the exploitation of vulnerable groups from organised crime.

During the operation on Saturday 29 February, special constables gave information to passengers about human trafficking and spoke to three passengers at length to establish their welfare before leaving the airport.

Bedfordshire Police's special constables worked alongside the forces regular officers to fulfil this operation. The special constabulary provides a valuable resource for the force and are highly useful to bolster numbers when carrying out large scale operations, including operations with London Luton Airport Police Unit.

A special constable who worked on the operation said: "Being part of this operation, run by Border Force, gives me the opportunity to make a difference to passengers and raise awareness about moving to a new country and thinking about their welfare.

"Speaking to people and giving them a better understanding of what is expected of them and their employers helps to prevent them from being trafficked."

Operation Aidant is co-ordinated by the National Crime Agency (NCA) and is run nationally every year, involving local police forces working alongside partner agencies to focus on combating Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking.

The key aim of the operation is to provide people with information so they can protect themselves from being exploited. Bedfordshire Police has seen positive outcomes from this operation where individuals have returned to their home country because they were at imminent risk of exploitation.
