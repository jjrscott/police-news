**We are appealing for information after a man died following a collision on the A5 northern bypass in Dunstable on Tuesday (17 April).**

At around 10.20pm, a collision occurred between a blue Mini Cooper and a black Range Rover, which were both travelling eastbound.

Emergency services attended but one man, the driver of the Mini Cooper, was pronounced dead at the scene. Next of kin have been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers.

Road closures were in place while officers dealt with the incident.

Ian Fraser, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Forensic Collision Investigation Unit, who is investigating, said: "I'm keen to speak to anyone who was travelling along the A5 at the same time as the collision. If you were in the area at the time, please contact us as you may be able to help with our investigation."

Anyone with any information is asked to call 101 quoting Operation Klemheist. Alternatively you can report information through our online reporting centre at www.bedfordshire.police.uk/report.
