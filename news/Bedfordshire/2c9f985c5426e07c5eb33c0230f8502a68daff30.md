**We have launched a murder investigation and are issuing a further appeal for information, following the death of a man who sustained serious head injuries yesterday (Wednesday).**

We were called to reports of an altercation between three men in Mangrove Road at approximately 6.15am. A man in his 50s was taken to hospital and has now succumbed to his injuries.

Officers from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit (MCU) have now launched a murder investigation.

Detective Inspector Jerry Waite, senior investigating officer, said: "The victim sustained serious head injuries during this incident which have tragically resulted in his death today. Our thoughts are with his family at this time."

Two men arrested following the incident remain in custody, and the investigation is ongoing.

Anyone with any information is asked to call DI Waite on 101 quoting Operation Pirelli.
