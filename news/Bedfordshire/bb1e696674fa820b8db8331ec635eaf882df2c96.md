Police are appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Houghton Regis.

On the 2 June (Tuesday), at 4:30am, a man was leaving Kirton Way in Houghton Regis when he was approached by two men. One man was on a pedal bike and stopped in front of the victim's vehicle and a second man was drinking a bottle of beer. The men threatened the victim and stole his car before driving off in the direction of Parkside Drive. The vehicle was later found on Poynters Road, Luton.

On 30 May, a man was getting into his car in Halleys Way, Houghton Regis, when two men approached him, threatened him with baseball bats and attempted to take his vehicle.

In both offences the offenders are described as white with brown hair, approximately 5' 5'', but one was stockier than the other.

Detective Constable Mandy Godfree, investigating, said: "We are asking anyone who may have seen anything to come forward, as these incidents have been terrifying for the victims involved.

"We are also asking residents in Houghton Regis to be extra vigilant and to report anything suspicious or if they see anyone matching the description of these men."

If you have any information, please contact 101 quoting reference number 40/29572/20.
