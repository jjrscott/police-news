**Our officers, staff and volunteers were recognised at a Long Service and Chief Commendations ceremony on Wednesday (20 June) at our Headquarters in Kempston.**

The event recognised the outstanding work undertaken by those who work for the force, and marked the long service of six officers who started their careers more than 20 years ago.

Chief Constable Jon Boutcher also presented commendations to 14 officers and members of staff, including six members who were praised for dismantling an organised crime group involved in the supply of Class A drugs and firearms, which resulted in 14 offenders being found guilty.

Chief Constable Boutcher said: "It's a real honour to present these awards to members of team Bedfordshire who have shown real loyalty to their county - either through long service or acts of kindness, professionalism and bravery. The commendations from this event show how officers and staff have thought outside the box and gone above and beyond to secure results they should be proud of.

"I am also delighted to present these awards in front of the families of our officers and staff, to show them the fantastic work carried out every day to protect people and fight crime in Bedfordshire."
