**Two men have been arrested following a warrant in Bedford this morning (Thursday).**

They were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in supply of a controlled drug when our officers raided the property in Harpur Street, as part of an on-going investigation into county drugs lines.

A quantity of cannabis, mobile phones, money, and drug related paraphernalia were seized during the search.

A 20-year-old man from London and a 33-year-old man from Bedford have been taken to police custody for questioning.

PC James West said: "Drugs underpin much of the most harmful and violent crime we see across the county, so we will continue to proactively target those who seek to bring this harm to our communities."
