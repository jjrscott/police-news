**Our community officers carried out a warrant at a business unit in the Market Hall within The Mall in Luton yesterday (Wednesday) following intelligence that suggested that it was being used to distribute drugs. **

Officers carried out a search during which, what is believed to be cannabis and synthetic cannabis also known as Spice, were discovered in the till area.

Additionally, drug paraphernalia and cash were also recovered.

The property was issued with a 24-hour closure notice yesterday, and has been issued with a full three-month closure order following a Luton Magistrates' hearing earlier today (Thursday).

Sergeant Simon Betts, who led the operation, said: "Spice is an extremely dangerous drug can be deadly to the user.

"We remain committed to protecting our communities from the danger of drugs. Thanks to our successful action, a large quantity of cannabis and Spice have been taken off the streets and won't make its way into our neighbourhoods."

One man has been arrested and bailed to a police station.
