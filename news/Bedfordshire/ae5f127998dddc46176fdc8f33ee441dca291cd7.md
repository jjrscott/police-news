**We are appealing for information following a burglary in Hurst Grove, Bedford.**

Between 11.30am and 2.45pm on Thursday (14 December), the offenders gained access to a property in the street and blocked the front door with a coffee table. They then closed the curtains and searched the whole house, including the loft space, before leaving with a number of items of gold jewellery.

Anyone with any information is asked to call 101 quoting reference number JH/54497/2017. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
