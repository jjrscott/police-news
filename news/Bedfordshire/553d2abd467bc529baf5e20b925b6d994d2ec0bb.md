### We are appealing for witnesses following an incident in Stotfold where a young man was believed to have been stabbed.

Police were called at 7.40pm yesterday (Tuesday), after a man on an electric scooter was believed to have been stabbed in Riverside Park. The male was white, slim build and wearing a black hooded top and shorts.

Officers attended and discovered blood, but the victim had left the scene.

Detective Constable Lisa Whitson said: "We are trying to establish the circumstances around this incident, and we would like to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time and may have seen or heard anything.

"Knife crime and serious violence will not be tolerated and we are doing all we can to find those responsible."

Anyone with any information is asked to report it or call 101, quoting reference 417of 7 June.

You can also speak to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
