### Detectives from our force are appealing for information after a blind man was robbed in Bedford.

At around 12.30pm on Wednesday (7 October) an offender approached the victim, a man in his 20s, in front of a parade of shops in Greyfriars, and demanded he hand over cash.

The man refused and as he tried to walk away, the suspect stopped him and forcibly took the money from his wallet.

PC Daniel O'Mahoney, from our Crime Investigation Team, said: "This is a horrible crime that has happened to a vulnerable man on his way home from volunteering at a local charity.

"We believe the victim was targeted because he was blind and that the suspect could have been on a bike.

"We are asking for the public's help to find the perpetrator. If you have any information or were in the area at the time, please do get in touch."

People with information are asked to contact via our online reporting centre, quoting reference 40/54616/20.

Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 55 111.
