**Following the publication of theIndependent Police Complaints Commission's (IPCC) report into a fatal collision in Luton last August, Bedfordshire Police has issued a statement.**

Deputy Chief Constable Garry Forsyth said: "This was a tragic incident in which a young girl lost her life. Specialist officers have supported the family throughout the investigation and our thoughts remain with them and her friends.

"We co-operated fully with the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) and support their findings that the actions of the officer involved were justified and proportionate. Our officers work incredibly hard to protect the public and fight crime often in very difficult and challenging circumstances.

"Michael Fludgate was given an eight-year jail sentence in September 2016 for causing death by dangerous driving . We hope his time spent behind bars will give him time to reflect on his actions which had such devastating consequences."
