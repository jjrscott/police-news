**The new series of 24 Hours in Police Custody continues tonight (Monday) and this week 's episode will focus on the work of the force's Internet Child Abuse Investigation Team (ICAIT). **

The programme shows how officers received information that an occupant of a house in Luton was accessing indecent images of children.

A warrant was carried out at that address and officers found a number of digital devices which turned out to contain a number of indecent images but also discovered a number of other illegal items - which added a new angle to the investigation.

Investigating Officer, Nicky Owen from ICAIT, said: "Online child sex abuse is not victimless. The viewing and sharing of indecent images is a crime which causes real harm and severe trauma to countless children.

"As with many cases, this took an unexpected turn as we uncovered a number of other offences which took the investigation in a completely different direction.

"I'm pleased that through this particular case we are being given a platform to showcase the work we do within our team and will hopefully send a strong message to any would-be offenders that we will do all we can do bring such perpetrators to justice."

The show will air on Channel 4 at 9pm.
