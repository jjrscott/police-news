**A man has died following a collision in Leighton Buzzard on Friday (31 August).**

Officers were called to reports of a collision between a pedestrian and a car in Leighton Road at around 10.30pm.

Emergency services attended the scene, but sadly the pedestrian died as a result of his injuries, after being conveyed to Addenbrooke's Hospital.

An 18-year-old man from Leighton Buzzard has been arrested in connection with this incident and has since been released under investigation.

Sergeant James Thorne, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Roads Policing Unit, said: "It is always a tragedy when someone loses their life on our roads and our thoughts are with the victim's family and friends.

"If anyone has any information relating to this incident, then I would urge them to come forward."

People can report any information to the force through our online reporting centre or on 101, quoting reference 435 of 31 August.
