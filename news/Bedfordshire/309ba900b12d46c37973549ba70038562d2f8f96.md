**We are appealing for witnesses after a man was robbed of his car at knifepoint.**

A man arrived home in Coltsfoot Corner, Ampthill, at around 8pm on Saturday (9 February), and parked on the driveway, when he was approached by three men.

One of the men then threatened the man with a knife and demanded his car keys. The three men then got into the car, a silver Audi, and drove away.

All three offenders are described as wearing balaclavas and gloves.
