**We are appealing for witnesses following a collision between a bus and a pedestrian on Ampthill Road, Bedford earlier today (Monday).**

We were called at 11.47am and attended, along with other emergency services and the air ambulance. The road remains closed between Lynton Grove and Maryville Road.

One woman has been taken to hospital with serious injuries, and an investigation is ongoing.

Sergeant Declan McDonagh, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, and Hertfordshire Roads Policing Unit, said: "We are keen to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident earlier on today, and would urge anyone who saw it or who stopped at the scene to come forward to help us establish the circumstances around the incident."

Anyone with any information is asked to call Sergeant McDonagh on 101 quoting reference number 156 of today's date.
