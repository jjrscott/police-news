**24 Hours in Police Custody returns tonight (Monday), with an hour-and-a-half special.**

The BAFTA-nominated Channel 4 series returns with more episodes delving into some of the most complex and challenging cases dealt with by the force. The series will feature investigations filmed during 2017, as The Garden Productions, the television company behind the programme, returned to the force for several weeks.

Episode one of the new series focuses on the force's investigation into the death of Sharon Fade, 45.

Sharon's body was found in undergrowth in Long Meadow, Houghton Regis in September 2017. Subsequently, the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit launched an investigation to establish the circumstances around her death.

Assistant Chief Constable Jackie Sebire said: "It's really important for us to allow the public to see the kind of work we do and the challenges we face in Bedfordshire. By letting cameras in to the force, I hope we are showing how hard our officers work and the challenges they face when dealing with complex investigations."

Tune in to Channel 4 for 24 Hours in Police Custody at 9pm tonight (21 May).
