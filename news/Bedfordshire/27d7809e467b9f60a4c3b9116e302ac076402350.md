Skeletal remains found in the grounds of a church in Luton in December have been identified as belonging to John McLellan, who was reported missing in 2017 aged 65.

The remains were discovered at the Church of Our Lady Help in Castle Street during landscaping works.

Detective Inspector Phil Moss, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: "Following a scientific investigation by a pathologist and an anthropologist, we have now identified Mr McLellan and his family have been informed.

"A post-mortem examination concluded there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death. "I'd like to thank the church and the local community, for its co-operation in the investigation, and hope we can now bring some closure to Mr McLellan's family."
