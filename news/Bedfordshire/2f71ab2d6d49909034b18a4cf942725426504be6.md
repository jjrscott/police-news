**A drug dealer who was arrested following a warrant where police found around £30,000 of cocaine has been jailed.**

The operation at Akif Mehmood's address in Lyndhurst Road, Luton in July 2018 also recovered around £5,000 in cannabis, £2,500 in cash and drug dealing paraphernalia such as deal bags, scales and mobile phones.

The 30-year-old was found guilty of possession with intent to supply both cannabis and cocaine.

At Luton Crown Court this week, Mehmood was jailed for two years and eight months.

Mehmood will also be subject to a hearing under the Proceeds of Crime Act.

Detective Inspector Mark Pugh, from our Boson guns and gangs team, said: "Mehmood had the audacity to flaunt the proceeds of his criminal enterprise, posting pictures on Facebook of designer clothes and expensive hire vehicles.

"Drugs are the catalyst for all manner of criminality. An awareness of county lines has helped shine a light on the violence and exploitation that is inherent in the supply of drugs and wider organised crime.

"We will continue to relentlessly pursue those involved in putting drugs onto the streets of Bedfordshire and ensure they are locked up."
