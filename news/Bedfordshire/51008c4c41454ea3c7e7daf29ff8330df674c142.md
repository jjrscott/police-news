**The family of a man who was killed in Luton have paid tribute to him.**

Meuric Roberts, 51, died after being attacked in his flat in Hitchin Road. Officers were called to reports of a body being found just before 3pm on Wednesday (24 April.)

In a statement, Mr Robert's family said: "Meuric was a much loved dad, granddad, brother and uncle. He was a proud man with a good heart who will be a missed every day by his whole family."
