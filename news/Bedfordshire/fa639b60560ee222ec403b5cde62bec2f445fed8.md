**Three men and one woman have been arrested following a search of a house on Spencer Road in Bedford on Monday (15 January) in relation to a drugs investigation.**

Bedfordshire Police carried out the warrant and officers seized a small quantity of what is believed to be Class A and Class B drugs, Â£300 of cash, a number of knives and several phones.

The three men were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply and the woman was arrested for permitting the premises to be used for drug related activity.

All four were interviewed and released under investigation and a Closure Order has now been granted on the property for three months.

Sergeant Luke Blackburn said: "Drugs and drug related crime can have a negative impact on our communities so we continue to encourage people to come forward with any information about crime or suspicious activity in their area."

Anyone with information about crime in their community should contact police on 101 or call independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
