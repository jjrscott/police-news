**Police officers, staff and volunteers were recognised at Bedfordshire Police 's Long Service and Chief Commendations ceremony yesterday (Wednesday) at Police Headquarters in Kempston.**

The event acknowledged the outstanding work undertaken by those who work for the force, and marked the long service of six officers who started their careers more than 20 years ago.

Chief Constable Jon Boutcher also presented commendations to 11 officers and members of staff including seven who were commended for Operation Kruse, the force's largest ever group sentencing, after nine men were jailed for a total of 170 years following a night of gang warfare in 2016.

Two special inspectors, Keith Jackson and Michael Rosato, received recognition as they celebrated 10 years of volunteering with Bedfordshire's Special Constabulary.

Four officers were awarded the Royal Humane Society Commendation Certificate for their contributions in saving the life of a man in mental health crisis, when they worked together to get the man to safety.

Chief Constable Boutcher said: "It's a real honour to present these awards to members of team Bedfordshire who have shown real loyalty to the communities of Bedfordshire and the Police service- either through long service or acts of kindness, professionalism and bravery.

"The commendations from this event show how officers and staff have thought outside the box and gone above and beyond to secure results they should be proud of. As well as officers working on big cases, the awards also recognised the vital behind the scenes work that takes place on a daily basis in all corners of the force.

"It was a pleasure to present these awards in front of the families of our officers and staff, to show them the fantastic work carried out every day to protect people and fight crime in Bedfordshire."
