**Our Luton community team officers have secured a three month extension of a closure order on a property in Villa Road.**

The extension was issued on Thursday, (6 December), following a hearing at Luton Magistrates' Court.

This property has been previously reported for being a source of drug criminality, nuisance and anti-social behaviour. The team has worked closely with partners and a closure order was obtained in September. As the order was due to expire, an application was made to extend it for a further three months.

Sergeant John Killick, from Luton Central community team, said: "We care about our residents and we are satisfied that the court saw fit to extend the closure order. This property is known to be used for illicit purposes and we won't tolerate it.

"We continue to remain dedicated to tackling anti-social behaviour in our town. We would also encourage people to come forward and report this kind of behaviour as it allows us to create a better intelligence picture and take action against criminals."

If you are affected by this kind of crime you can report it to the police by calling 101 or by visiting the online reporting centre.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
