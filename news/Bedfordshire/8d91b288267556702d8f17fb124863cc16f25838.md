**Officers and PCSOs from the Luton community team held an engagement day on Monday (9 April) to offer reassurance and crime prevention advice to Luton residents.**

The Community team was situated in the town centre and the Mall throughout the day addressing and discussing issues highlighted by the communities. Younger members of the community had a chance to meet and have a photo taken with Chase from Paw Patrol.

Additionally the team carried out increased patrols in the area to clamp down on anti-social behaviour, such as drug dealing, street drinking and nuisance behaviour.

Sergeant Simon Betts said: "We are dedicated to working closely with local authorities and communities to identify and tackle issues in the town centre. My team spent the day offering advice and support to Luton residents. It was a brilliant event and it was great to see so many people willing to speak to us about their concerns.

"The day was a great example of partnership working and we received excellent feedback from our residents."
