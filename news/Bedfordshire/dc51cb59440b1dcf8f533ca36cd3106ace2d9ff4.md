Bedfordshire Police is appealing for information following an aggravated burglary in Luton.

On Friday (8 November) at approximately 8.15pm, two men in balaclavas forced their way into a property on Handcross Road. The two masked men assaulted one of the occupants before searching the property.

The offenders are described as white males of a medium build. They were each wearing black clothing and a balaclava.

Detective Constable Jason Wheeler, investigating, said: "This was a nasty incident, which left the victim with minor injuries and visibly shaken up.

"I am keen to hear from anyone who saw two men in the area at the time of the offence who were acting suspiciously."

Anyone with any information is asked to call 101, quoting reference number 40/64762/19
