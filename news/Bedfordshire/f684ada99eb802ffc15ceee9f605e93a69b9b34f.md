**Two people have been arrested after a man was stabbed in Luton yesterday evening (Thursday).**

We were called at approximately 7.45pm to reports of disorder outside a barber's shop in Park Street.

Emergency services attended and a man was taken to hospital after suffering stab wounds.

His injuries are not thought to be serious. Shortly afterwards officers arrested two men on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. They have been taken into custody for further questions.

Detective Constable Wayne Bird said: "We believe that there were possibly a number of people involved in a dispute which resulted in this stabbing, and we're keen to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident."

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting reference number 375 of 27 June.

You can also report information on our reporting centre or call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
