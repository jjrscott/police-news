### Two men are due to appear in court this morning (Monday) charged with the murder of a woman in her Kensworth home.

Habib Jackson, 31, of Dunstable Road, Toddington, and Christopher Hayward, 30, of Fensome Drive, Houghton Regis, were arrested on Saturday following the discovery of a body in a flat in Plewes Close on Friday afternoon.

The fire service alerted our force to the death after being called to reports of an alarm sounding at the property.

Jackson and Hayward will appear at Luton Magistrates' Court today.

Detectives from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit are continuing to carry out enquiries in the village.

Anyone with any information should call 101 quoting Operation Propagate, or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111.
