**We welcomed 12 new Special Constables, also known as volunteer police constables, on Friday (17 August) where they swore an oath at Headquarters.**

The new Specials swore the oath after completing their initial training. Now they have attested, they will undergo further on-the-job training, receiving support from experienced colleagues, before they are able to work independently.

The new volunteer police officers will soon be on duty throughout the county, helping to police local events and supporting frontline policing by patrolling town centres on busy evenings. The Specials also plan and run their own operations, including Operation Himalia which cracks down on uninsured drivers in the county, aiming to reduce the risk to other drivers who have the correct insurance.

We also have a number of Specials who volunteer at London Luton Airport, supporting the Airport Policing Team.

The new Specials have joined with a variety of different skills and life experiences, and through the training and on-the-job tuition they receive, they will continue to develop new skills that they can use when volunteering, at work or at home.

The new intake is made up of people with a variety of backgrounds, including University students, and people working in sales and retail.

Chief Constable Jon Boutcher said: "It's a pleasure to welcome these new recruits to the force. Our Specials really are a fantastic group of people, they have the same powers as our regular officers but who choose to undertake these roles in their spare time in order to support the front line and make a real difference in Bedfordshire. I look forward to seeing what our new recruits achieve as part of Bedfordshire's Special Constabulary."

We are continuing to recruit Special Constables. To find out more about the Special Constabulary and how to join, visit www.bedfordshire.police.uk/specials. Alternatively, email _CIP@bedfordshire.pnn.police.uk_ or call 01234 842699.
