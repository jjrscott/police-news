**Bedfordshire Police has secured a three-month closure order at an address in The Ridings, Luton, after a large quantity of drugs were found and a man was arrested.**

Officers attended the address following reports of nuisance activity and anti-social behaviour in the property. The closure order was issued by Luton Magistrates' Court yesterday (Monday).

A 25-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class B and Class A drugs, and has been released on bail.

Sergeant John Killick said: "Tackling on and off street drug trade and related criminality is one of our priorities in Luton. The property was originally reported for noise and anti-social behaviour from members of the local community, and the team uncovered a large quantity of drugs and were able to arrest a man.

"This property has now been closed and the drugs seized and will no longer make way onto our streets."

To report suspicious activity, contact Bedfordshire Police via its online reporting tool, or by calling 101.
