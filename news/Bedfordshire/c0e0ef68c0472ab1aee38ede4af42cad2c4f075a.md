**A man who was fatally stabbed in Luton on Sunday (6 May) has been named.**

Emergency services were called at approximately 4.40pm to Bishopscote Road to reports that Waryam Hussain, 20, of Bristol Road, Luton, had sustained serious injuries.

Mr Hussain was pronounced dead at the scene of the incident, and a post mortem examination revealed he died as a result of a single stab wound.

Following his death, an investigation was launched by the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, and is ongoing.

Detective Inspector Phil Moss, of the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: "I'm appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the incident, or who saw Waryam in the area before the incident, to get in touch to help us establish what led to this terrible event.

"It is truly a tragedy when someone loses their life as a result of an incident such as this, and our thoughts are with the victim's family at this time.

"We will never tolerate knife crime, and we are doing all we can to investigate what happened."

Anyone with information is asked to use the Bedfordshire Police online reporting centre, or call on 101 quoting Operation Penybont.

Officers are particularly keen to hear from anyone who may have captured dash cam or aerial drone footage in the area.
