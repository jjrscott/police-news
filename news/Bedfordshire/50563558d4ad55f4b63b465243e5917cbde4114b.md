**The new series of 24 Hours in Police Custody returns on Monday evening (11 March) with the first episode focusing on a cold case double rape investigation from 2007.**

The BAFTA-nominated Channel 4 series is back for a five-week run with more episodes delving into some of the most complex and challenging cases, including rape, murder and fraud investigations. The series will feature a range of investigations filmed over recent years by The Garden Productions, the television company behind the programme.

To kick off the new series, the first episode focuses on two rape investigations; a Cambridgeshire stranger rape and sexual assault; and two cold case rapes that happened in Luton in late 2007.

The episode shows how a taxi driver from Luton was arrested for the 2007 rapes after DNA evidence linked him to the two unsolved cases that happened more than a decade ago.

Assistant Chief Constable Jackie Sebire said: "It's really important for us to allow the public to see the kind of work we do and the challenges we face in Bedfordshire. By letting cameras in to the force, we can show how hard our officers work and the challenges they face when dealing with complex investigations.

"Monday's episode shows how the fantastic advancements in DNA profiling and forensic science means that we now have the means to review cases, such as this one, and bring offenders to justice, no matter how many years ago the offence took place."

Tune in to Channel 4 for 24 Hours in Police Custody at 9pm on Monday (11 March) - and follow @bedspolice for live tweeting during the episodes.
