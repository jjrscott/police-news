**We are appealing for information after a teenager was assaulted and robbed by a group of men in Luton in the early hours yesterday (Wednesday).**

At around 2am, the boy was cycling through the car park near Matalan in Castle Street when he was hit over the head by an unknown object, causing him to fall off his bike. After being hit again several times, the offenders made off with a black Armani bag, two iPhones and some cash.

Detective Inspector Grant Maxted, from Bedfordshire Police's Crime Investigation Team, said: "We are appealing for anyone who may know anything about this incident to come forward with information to help us establish what happened.

"We are currently following several lines of enquiry, but this was a brutal attack on a teenage boy which left him needing hospital treatment. If anyone has any information, please tell us, and help us find these culprits."

Anyone with information is asked to contact DI Maxted by calling 101, or through the online reporting centre, quoting reference number 40/20932/20.

Alternatively, please contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
