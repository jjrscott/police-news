**We are appealing for witnesses after a motorcyclist died in a road traffic collision between Thurleigh and Ravensden near Bedford early this morning (Tuesday).**

At around 6.45am, a motorcycle travelling south on Thurleigh Road was involved in a collision with a Vauxhall Corsa, which was travelling in the opposite direction.

The 27-year-old motorcyclist sustained fatal injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene. While he has not been formally identified, his next of kin have been informed.

PC Neil Crosier, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit, said: "We are appealing for anyone who was driving along the Thurleigh Road this morning and saw the collision, or may have any dashcam footage, to get in touch to help us build a picture of what led to the two vehicles colliding."

Anyone with any information is asked to contact Sergeant Steve Andrews on 101 or submit information, including dashcam footage, online via our reporting tool.
