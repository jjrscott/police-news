**We are investigating an attempted armed robbery yesterday (Sunday 18 March) at the Fox and Hounds in Milton Road, Clapham and we are appealing for witnesses.**

Between 12.35am and 12.48am, an object was thrown at the door of the premises. When the victim went to look outside, he was confronted with a man holding what is believed to be a gun. The offender attempted to gain entry to the premises but was unsuccessful and left the scene.

The offender is described as black, over 5' 11", of slim build and wearing a black coat over a hoody.

Anyone with information is asked contact the force via the online reporting centre or by calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime number JH/12323/18. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 55 111.

• Ensure all windows and doors are locked when not in use, and all are secured at the end of the working day.

• Ensure that your alarm is in full working order.

• Ensure that your CCTV system is in full working order and that the camera lenses are not obscured by cobwebs or overgrown greenery.

• Make it obvious that CCTV is monitoring by displaying bright signage both internally and externally.

• Speak to any neighbouring properties; ensure they call the police if anything suspicious is seen.
