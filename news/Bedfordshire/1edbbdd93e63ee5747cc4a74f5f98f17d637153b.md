**We are appealing for witnesses after a woman was sexually assaulted in Luton.**

Between 1 and 2am on Friday (27 July) a woman was in Mill Street, when she was approached by a man who tried to start a conversation. He pulled her into an adjacent alleyway and began to sexually assault her.

The woman's phone then rang, which distracted the attacker, and the woman was able to run away and seek help.

The man is described as Asian, chubby, approximately 5'5", aged in his 30s, with mid-length straight black hair and some facial hair. He was wearing dark coloured cotton trousers.

Detective Constable Nicky Robinson said: "I'd like to reassure the public we are taking this shocking incident extremely seriously and we have a number of officers working hard to identify the man responsible, as well as providing the victim with support."

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101 quoting reference number 440 of 27 July or call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.

If you have been affected by crime, the Signpost Hub offers free and confidential support to victims in Bedfordshire, whether it has been reported to police or not and irrespective of where and when the crime occurred.
