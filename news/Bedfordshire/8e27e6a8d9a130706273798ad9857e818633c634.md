**We have carried out a successful drugs warrant in a property in Raleigh Street on Friday (6 July).**

Our officers carried out an intelligence led operation following a number of reports of drug dealing and anti-social behaviour in the area. Following a search, a quantity of what is believed to be Class A drugs and drugs paraphernalia were discovered.

The officers attended a hearing at Luton Magistrates' Court yesterday (10 July), during which a two month property closure order was issued.

PC Sharon Cummings said: "We remain committed to working with residents to tackle the most serious issues such as drug use, as these type of crimes have detrimental effects on the community.

"This successful warrant and subsequent closure of the property wouldn't be possible without the support from our partners. We will continue the multi-agency approach to keep our communities safe."
