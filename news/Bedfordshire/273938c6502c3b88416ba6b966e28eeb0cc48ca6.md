We are appealing for witnesses after a man was assaulted outside a restaurant in Luton on Friday night (15 February).

At approximately 11.40pm a man and a woman approached a man at Wamimichi Noodle Bar, in Park Street, and assaulted him before stealing his phone and cash.

It is believed the same man and woman also vandalised the restaurant by throwing eggs at it.
