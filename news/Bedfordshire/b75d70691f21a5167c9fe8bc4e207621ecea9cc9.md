We are appealing for information after four balaclava clad men robbed a betting shop in Bedford.

The incident took place on Sunday (15 December), at around 7.30pm, at Betfred, in Cardington Road. The offenders entered the store and hit a member of staff over the head with a baton-style object, causing minor injuries. The men stole money before making off from the scene in a green Ford Mondeo.

The four men are described as white and were wearing dark clothing. They are believed to have Irish accents.

Detective Sergeant Tammy Scrivens, investigating, said: "This was a clearly a very distressing incident for the member of staff involved and we do not tolerate this kind of violence in our county. We would like to speak to anyone who has any information about the incident or witnessed the men entering or leaving the store to come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to call Bedfordshire Police on 101 quoting reference 40/72175/19 or report via the online reporting tool at www.bedfordshire.police.uk/report or by calling Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
