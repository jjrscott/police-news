**Officers investigating an incident in Bedford in the early hours of Sunday are appealing for witnesses.**

Just after 4am, we received reports of an altercation between a group of people in Queen Street, Bedford. A group of white men are believed to have verbally assaulted a group of three black men, using offensive language. The three men were then assaulted; two received minor injuries but one man was taken to hospital where he remains in a serious condition.

Detective Sergeant Mark Stewart said: "I'd like to reassure the public that this kind of incident is rare, but in response we have deployed extra patrols to the area."

Anyone with any information is asked to call us 101 quoting reference number 53 of 22 October. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
