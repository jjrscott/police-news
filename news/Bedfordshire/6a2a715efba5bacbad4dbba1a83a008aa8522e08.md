**Five people were arrested and a firearm was recovered in Luton earlier today (Thursday) after proactive police patrols in the Lewsey Park area. **

At approximately 2.50pm officers from Bedfordshire Police's Boson team were carrying out patrols when they saw a man acting suspiciously.

The man disposed of a package and ran from the officers into a property in Beadlow Road. Four occupants were arrested in the vicinity and one man made off from the officers, but was detained shortly after.

The disposed package was secured and a firearm and ammunition were recovered from within.

Four men aged between 18 and 22 and a 17-year old boy, all from Luton, have been arrested on suspicion of possession of a firearm and currently remain in police custody for questioning.

Detective Inspector Mark Pugh, the force's operational lead for drugs, county lines and serious violence, said: "Our officers were carrying out proactive patrols in the area and as a result five people are now in custody.

"We would like to reassure our communities that we are dedicated to protecting the public and proactively pursuing anyone involved in criminal activities.

"Additionally, officer from the local community teams will be carrying out reassurance patrols, so our communities can expect increased police presence in the area."
