We are appealing for witnesses after a man was robbed and his car was stolen in a Luton street on Sunday (7 April).

At approximately 10pm, a man was sitting in his vehicle in Surrey Street, when five men with their faces covered approached the vehicle and threatened him.

The victim got out of his car and ran to his home nearby, leaving his key in the ignition. He was followed by two offenders and was physically assaulted before being threatened with what is described as a hunting-style knife.

The offenders all had their faces covered and were wearing coats with the hoods up. They made off in the victim's car, a silver Mercedes E Class with the Polish registration plate WS85739, in the direction of Surrey Street Primary School.

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to contact DC Godfree by calling 101 or through our online reporting centre and quoting reference number 40/20075/19.

Alternatively you contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
