**We are appealing for information after a robbery in Bedford in the early hours of Sunday morning (12 May). **

Between 2am and 3am, the victim was assaulted by a man at Castle Mound and threatened with what is believed to be a knife. He had Â£40 in cash stolen from him.

The offender is described as a white man in his 30s, of slim build, wearing a grey tracksuit with a black coat and a black backpack. It is thought he may have had a Manchester accent.

Detective Constable Tracey Litchfield, investigating, said: "Although this took place in the early hours of the morning, the victim remembers a number of people being on Castle Mound, as he shouted to try and get their attention. Therefore, I'm keen to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time who saw the assault take place, and can give me any information about who is responsible."

Anyone with any information is asked to call DC Litchfield on 101 quoting reference number 40/26882/19.

Alternatively, you can report information online by visiting our online reporting centre or by calling independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
