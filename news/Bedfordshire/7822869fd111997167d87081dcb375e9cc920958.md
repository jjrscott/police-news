**We are appealing for a van driver to come forward following an incident in which a man was assaulted in a layby on the A422.**

The incident happened between 5.30pm and 6.15pm on Tuesday (2 March) off the A422 near Stagsden.

PC Shauna Brown, investigating the case, said: "We believe a van was parked in the layby at the time of the incident so are really keen to speak to the driver.

"The incident happened on a public road at a time when people may have been returning home from work.

"If you were in the area at the time or have any information, please get in touch with us. We would also ask people to check their dashcam footage in case there is anything that may help our enquiries."

A man in his 30s has been arrested in connection with the incident and released on bail.

Anyone with information can get in touch via the Bedfordshire Police online reporting centre, webchat, or by calling 101, quoting reference 40/10514/21.
