**We are appealing for witnesses after a woman sustained serious injuries following a collision in Luton on Saturday (25 November).**

At around 11am, a collision occurred between a pedestrian and a motorcycle on a footpath next to the Luton to Dunstable Busway, near Skimpot Road.

Following the collision, the motorcycle left the scene. The pedestrian was later taken to hospital with serious injuries.

The motorcycle is described as having three riders, who all had their heads covered either with helmets or with hoodies. The driver may have been wearing a blue or green hoody.

PC Jez Hutton, investigating, said: "We would like to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time and who saw the incident, as well as anyone who may have seen a bike with three riders in the area just after 11am."

Anyone with any information is asked to call PC Hutton on 101 quoting reference number 125 of 25 November. Alternatively, call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
