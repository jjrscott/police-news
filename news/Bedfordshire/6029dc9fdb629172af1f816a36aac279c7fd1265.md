The force is dedicated to tackle dangerous off-road biking, which often involves riders without insurance on stolen bikes.

Operation Meteor is police's initiative to detect, disrupt and detain the perpetrators of this kind of anti-social behaviour.

Luton Community Sergeant Samantha Hunt, whose team carried out the operation, said: "My team and I work closely with our residents to gather information which helps build a picture of the offences and the offenders.

"I would like to thank the community for their help and would urge them to continue report the issue to us."

"I am happy with the amazing results secured by my team in the past month. This goes to show that every report matters and we treat all calls seriously."
