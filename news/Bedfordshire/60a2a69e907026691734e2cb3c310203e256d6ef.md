**On Thursday (28 February) officers from the Bedford Community Policing team were out on patrol as part of Operation Blackwall, which aims to provide high visibility policing in particular areas in relation to existing and emerging issues.**

The team consisted of three PCs, three PCSOs, a sergeant and an inspector all covering areas of Bedford, including the town centre, Kempston, Harpur, Putnoe and Goldington.

The operation yielded successful results, including:

* Two Community Protection Notices (CPN)

* One CPN Warning

* Five dispersal notices

* Two reports for summons for a breach of a CPN

* Seven intelligence reports

* Five stop searches

* One person arrested for a breach of a dispersal notice

Sergeant Ian Leeson said: "Op Blackwall was launched last year and gives us the opportunity to focus on hotspot areas and the feedback we have received from the community, so we are making the issues they tell us about a priority.

"By patrolling certain areas regularly, we are also reassuring the community that something is being done, as well as reprimanding these offenders."
