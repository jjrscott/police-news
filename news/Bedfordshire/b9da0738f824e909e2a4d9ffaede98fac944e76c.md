**We are investigating a theft in Sainsbury 's in Quantock Rise, Luton on 10 November (Saturday) and we are appealing for witnesses. **

At approximately 1.45am two men smashed the front of the cash machine at the location and used a USB device to withdraw a large sum of money.

The offenders left the location at approximately 3.50am after they were disturbed by a member of the public.

Approximately Â£42,000 was stolen from the cash point.

The offenders were wearing balaclavas at the time of the offence.
