We are investigating a robbery in Luton and we are appealing for information.

At around 3pm on Saturday (11 November) a woman was walking along Stuart Street when a car pulled up beside her. Three men exited the car and approached the victim before assaulting her and stealing her phone, leaving her unconscious.

The offenders were described as Asian and the car they were in was described as a white hatchback with tinted windows.

Anyone with information is asked to contact us on 101 quoting reference C/49082/2017. Alternatively you can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
