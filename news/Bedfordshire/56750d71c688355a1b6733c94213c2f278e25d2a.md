**Community officers from Bedfordshire Police are inviting residents to join them for an engagement day in Luton.**

The Luton community team will be in People's Park, in High Town, between 1.30pm and 4.30pm on Wednesday, 13 December.

Officers will be offering winter crime prevention advice to help people reduce their chances of becoming a victim of crime. Additionally, the officers will be available to listen to residents' concerns about anti-social behaviour and crime in their area.

Areas covered by the team include Bushmead and Barnfield, High Town, Saints, Biscot, Dallow and Bury Park.

Sergeant Sam Hunt said: "My team and I would like to invite residents to this engagement event as we are working hard to maintain strong relationships with our residents and would like to meet as many people as possible. We organise events like this regularly across town.

"If you would like to meet your local team, have a chat or find out more about the work of our community teams, stop by People's Park and say hello."
