**We are appealing for information after shots were fired in Luton yesterday (Wednesday). **

Shortly before 11.45am a black Audi collided with two men on bikes in Beadlow Road.

As the two men fled the scene, along with two other men who had been walking along the street, shots were fired at them from someone inside the vehicle.

Fortunately no-one was injured, but we are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

We understand that is a worrying incident for the community and we have a number of resources working on identifying those responsible, as we will not tolerate firearms criminality in our county.

We have had a number of high visibility patrols on duty in the area today (Thursday), which will continue overnight, and I would encourage anyone with concerns to speak to these officers.

Anyone with information is asked to contact the our Boson team on 101 or via the reporting section of our website, quoting Operation Tridam

You can also give information anonymously, via Crimestoppers, on 0800 555 111.
