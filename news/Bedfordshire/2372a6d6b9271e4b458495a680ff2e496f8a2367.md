A Bedford man has been served with a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) for prolific shoplifting and aggressive behaviour.

Mohammed Saada, 24, of Clarendon Street, Bedford, was served a three-year CBO at Luton Magistrates' Court on Thursday (23 January), preventing him from visiting Bedford town centre and any businesses in the area.

Saada was also handed a 23-week sentence for common assault and theft from a shop.

PC Emma Underwood, who applied for the successful order, said: "We work in close partnership with Bedford Borough Council and local business owners to make sure our town and High Street is a safe place for our residents.

"Saada has continuously targeted local shops, costing them money and causing distress to the owners and employees with his behaviour. We are happy with the court's decision to imprison him and issue him with a CBO."
