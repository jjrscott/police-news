**We are continuing to appeal for information following an incident in Potton on Friday (2 November) which resulted in the death of a horserider.**

The incident happened at around 4.10pm in the Hatley Road area.

The horse was seen without a rider, and a woman in her 60s was found nearby with serious injuries.

She was airlifted to Addenbrooke's for treatment, but was sadly pronounced dead on Saturday morning.

Sergeant James Wood, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Roads Policing Unit, said: "Our thoughts go out to the lady's family and friends at this difficult time.

"While we have made good progress in our investigation, we are trying to piece together exactly what happened in this tragic incident.

"There were a number of people in the area at the time, so if anyone saw or heard anything, please get in touch."

 Anyone with any information can contact us through our online reporting centre or by calling 101, quoting Op Lyreco.
