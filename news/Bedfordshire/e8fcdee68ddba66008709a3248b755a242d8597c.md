Tributes have been paid to a cyclist who died in a road traffic collision in Leighton Buzzard on Wednesday (1 July).

Richard Hadder, 27, of Turnham Drive, Leighton Buzzard, was involved in a collision with a grey Volkswagen Golf at around 6.25pm.

The incident happened on the A505 Leighton Buzzard bypass, between the Stanbridge Road and A5 junctions.

Emergency services attended, but Mr Hadder was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

In a statement, Mr Hadder's family and partner Ellen Tillman said: "Richard was a caring, loving and devoted partner, brother and son.

"Determined and hard-working, he devoted his considerable energy and enthusiasm to both his successful career as an engineer and his other interests, most notably climbing.

"With an infectious sense of humour, Richard will be greatly missed and the world a far poorer place without him in it."

Police continue to appeal for information in relation to the collision, and are particularly keen to hear from drivers with dashcam footage who were in the area at the time.

Anyone with any information is asked to call 101 or visit Bedfordshire Police's online reporting centre, quoting Operation Taraz.
