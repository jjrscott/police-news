A prolific beggar in Bedford town centre has been issued with a court order following a hearing at Luton Magistrates' Court.

On Thursday (January) Adam Bullard, 34, of Alexandra Place, Bedford, was issued with a Criminal Behaviour Order, with conditions for a period of three years.

The conditions restricts him from entering Bedford town centre, unless for a specific arranged appointment.

PC Emma Underwood, of the Bedford Community Team, said: "We are pleased Bullard will no longer be a nuisance to those who live and work in Bedford, as he would often become aggressive and intimidating in his begging.

"This order comes as a result of a partnership approach to problem solving. We worked closely with the Bedford BID which supported us in providing information to obtain the order.

"We continue to carry out proactive patrols and engagement days in to ensure the town centre is a safe and pleasant place to visit."
