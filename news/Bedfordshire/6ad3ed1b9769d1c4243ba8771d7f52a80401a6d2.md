**We have issued a photograph of a distinctive watch in a re-appeal for information, following an incident in which a man was punched and robbed in Luton. **

The victim was walking along Church Street at around 4.15pm on Wednesday 13 May, when he was approached by a man who tried to take his mobile phone from his pocket.

The offender punched him in the face when he resisted, causing him to fall to the ground and the offender took his phone, his wallet, and took the watch from the victim's wrist.

The offender is described as a black man, around 5'6", between 30-40 years old, slim, with short black hair, and was wearing dark clothing.

Detective Constable Daniel Matcham, investigating, said: "This distinctive watch is of great sentimental value to the victim, who is still shaken by this incident.

"Have you seen, or been offered this BOSS watch, engraved with "From all your friends at L&D", with brown leather strap and three winders?

"If anyone has information, or was in the area on that day and saw the incident, or has CCTV or dashcam footage which could help our investigation, please contact us."

You can contact us on 101 or visit our online reporting centre, quoting reference 40/25948/20.
