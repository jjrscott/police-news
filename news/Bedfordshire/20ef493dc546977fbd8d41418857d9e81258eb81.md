**We are reminding people that 999 is a vital lifesaving service and should be kept free for those in their time of need.**

The 101 number is available for all non-life threatening or non-emergency enquiries.

We are currently seeing significant volumes of calls throughout the peak time between 11am-6pm, during which around three quarters of daily calls are received.

During these times people are asked to be mindful that call handlers may be dealing with a number of live incidents, and anyone looking to discuss a non-urgent matter or pass over information is encouraged to use our website, which has an easy-to-use online reporting tool.

Alternatively, calling 101 outside of the peak times or using our webchat service would also help greatly in allowing call handlers to deal with the most urgent incidents.

Ed Essad, the force's Head of Public Contact, said: "It's really important to remember that 999 is for emergencies only, such as when life is at risk or if a serious crime is in progress. This is a vital, life-saving service, and we appreciate the public's help and understanding when it comes to allowing us to cope with the high call volumes.

"We recognise there may be occasions when people need to contact the police and it is not an emergency, which is why we have developed new ways for people to get in touch. The non-emergency 101 number was introduced for non-urgent enquiries, and last year in Bedfordshire we launched our live webchat service, which gives people the opportunity to contact us online."

**When to call 999:**

 * If life is at risk; for example if you have broken down on a live lane of the motorway, if someone is being threatened or exposed to violent behaviour
 * If a serious crime is on-going; for example if a burglary is in progress

**When to call 101, use ouronline reporting tool or use the web chat live:**

 * To report a crime no longer in progress; for example if you get home from a holiday to find your house has been broken into
 * To give information about crime you believe is happening in your area; for example drug dealing
 * To report anti-social behaviour
 * To contact your community policing team
 * Any other police enquiries that do not require an emergency response
