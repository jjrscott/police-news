**We are appealing for witnesses after a man was assaulted in Biggleswade last week.**

On Thursday (4 July), the victim was walking along Saxon Drive, between 5.30pm and 6.10pm when he was assaulted. He sustained serious injuries from the assault, and required hospital treatment.

We believe a number of members of the public stopped to help the victim, and would like to speak to them, as well as any witnesses to the incident.

An investigation is ongoing to establish the circumstances of the incident.

Investigation Officer Emily Partington said: "Unfortunately we don't have a description of who was responsible, which is why it's really important for anyone who was in the area at the time to come forward. I am keen to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident, and who may have information that could help this investigation."

Anyone with any information is asked to call 101 quoting reference number 40/38336/19. You can also report information online at www.bedfordshire.police.uk/report, or call independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
