We are appealing for witnesses after a man wearing a Spiderman mask robbed a Shortstown convenience store at knifepoint.

The incident took place at the Nisa Local on North Drive, at around 8.25pm yesterday (Tuesday), when the masked offender entered the store brandishing a knife.

The man was also wearing a blue boiler suit and black gloves. He demanded money and tobacco from two members of the shop's staff, one of whom suffered a cut to the arm from the knife during the incident.

PC Clare Alden-Farrow, investigating, said: "This terrifying offence is far from a joke, as robbery has a devastating, lasting impact on its victims and will not be tolerated.

"We are investigating all avenues of enquiry and I would ask that anyone with information about the robbery, or who saw someone with the Spiderman mask or clothing described, comes forward as soon as possible so he can be apprehended."

Anyone with information is urged to contact Bedfordshire Police on 101 quoting the reference 40/10433/20 or report via the online reporting centre on the force website.
