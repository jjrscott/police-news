**We are appealing for witnesses after an attempted robbery in Bedford.**

At around 12.30am on Thursday (12 July), a man was attacked by two or three men in The Broadway.

The attackers assaulted the victim, and demanded money, but he was able to escape and sought refuge in a nearby food takeaway shop.

A passer-by intervened in an attempt to stop the attack.

The suspects are described as all white, wearing grey hooded tops. One of them is described as having brown hair.

Anyone who saw the attack or has any information should visit our online reporting centre or call police on 101, quoting reference 40/11064/18.
