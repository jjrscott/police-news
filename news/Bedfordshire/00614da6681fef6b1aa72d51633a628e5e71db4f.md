**We are appealing for witnesses following a collision in Bedford on Christmas Eve (Monday 24 December).**

We were called at around 6.50pm to reports of a collision involving a cyclist and a car in Cardington Road, near the Tesco store.

A dark coloured vehicle was involved in the collision, but failed to stop at the scene. One man, the cyclist, was taken to hospital with serious, although not life-threatening, injuries.

Anyone with any information is asked to call 101 quoting reference number 282 of 24 December. Alternatively report information via our reporting centre or by calling independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
