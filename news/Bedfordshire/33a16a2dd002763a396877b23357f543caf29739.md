Officers from our south community team cycled for 125 miles in aid of charity at an event in The Mall, Luton on Saturday (24 February).

The team of four, comprising Sergeant Samantha Hunt, PC Luke Horan and PCSOs Asim Warraich and Chloe Phipps, cycled for 125 miles, the equivalent of riding from London to Nottingham, in seven-and-a-half hours.

Their amazing effort paid off and the team raised Â£734.85 for Stepping Stones, a local charity which offers much needed support to vulnerable women in Luton.

Sergeant Hunt, who completed the final leg of the journey, said: "We are extremely proud and excited to be able to support this charity, which supports women who have suffered from abuse or are vulnerable due to a substance misuse.

"We are grateful to all people who stopped by and donated to our cause. My team and I will continue to work closely with the charity and local partners to create a better future for Luton women."
