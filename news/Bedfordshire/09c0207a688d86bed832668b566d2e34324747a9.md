**We are appealing for information after a man was assaulted by two men attempting to steal his car. **

On Monday (1 February) between 5.50pm and 6.05pm, a man left Cloves Dental Surgery in Sandy and saw two men trying to steal his Toyota.

He approached the men and was then assaulted.

The men made off from the scene without managing to steal the car and were seen driving a blue Audi along High Street, Sandy shortly afterwards.

One of the suspects was described as white with an eastern European accent, around 5'8" and stocky. He was wearing a thick grey Parka jacket with a fur collar, dark woollen gloves, hat and a snood.

Police Constable Laura Smyth, investigating, said: "Thieves are very opportunistic, so please do not leave keys or any valuables in your vehicle and ensure it is locked before leaving it unattended, even for a few moments."

If you have any information that could help the investigation please get in touch by using our online reporting tool, or by calling 101, quoting the reference number 40/5328/20.

You can also contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
