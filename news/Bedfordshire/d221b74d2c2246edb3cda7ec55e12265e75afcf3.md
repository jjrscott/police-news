**We are appealing for information after a ram raid at a Co-op store on Mulberry Close in Stotfold on Monday (5 February) evening.**

Between 10pm and 10.15pm, a grey BMW X5 and a grey BMW 118 were used to drive into the store, causing considerable damage, before the offenders attempted to remove the cash machine. They left in a third car - a dark saloon - and headed in an unknown direction.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact us via 101 quoting Op Linhouse or report information online. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
