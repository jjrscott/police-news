**One week on from a fatal stabbing in Luton, officers will be returning to the scene to make a further appeal for information.**

Waryam Hussain, 20, from Luton, died after being stabbed in Bishopscote Road, Luton, on Sunday (6 May) at around 4.40pm.

Detective Inspector Phil Moss, of the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: "The investigation is progressing well, however, we are still appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the incident, or who was in the area before or after, to get in touch to help us establish what led to this terrible event.

"We are still gathering evidence and have been reviewing CCTV footage from the area and are following up a number of lines of enquiry.

"This Sunday, we will have a team in the Bishopscote Road area, hoping to talk to anyone who was there last Sunday (6 May).

"At this time, we also wish to extend our thanks to the local community for its continued support during this investigation. We will never tolerate knife crime, and we are doing all we can to investigate what happened."

Anyone with information should contact us via our online reporting centre, or by calling 101, quoting Op Penybont.

Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
