**A motorcyclist has died after a collision between a car and a motorcycle on the A4146 near Billington, Leighton Buzzard, yesterday (Sunday).**

At approximately 1pm, a motorcycle and a silver Hyundai collided on the eastbound carriageway of the road.

Emergency services attended the incident, but a 66-year-old man from St Albans in Hertfordshire was pronounced dead at the scene.

Officers from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Roads Policing Unit are currently investigating the circumstances behind the collision.

Sergeant Peter Scholes said: "It's always sad when someone loses their life on our roads, and our thoughts are with the victim's family at this time.

"We are currently piecing together the events leading up to the collision, and would urge anyone with information to contact us."

People with information on the collision or who saw the two vehicles in the area at the time are asked to contact Bedfordshire Police via its online reporting tool, or by calling 101, quoting Operation Savannah.
