**The body of a man has been found in a Bedfordshire river after an incident yesterday (Friday).**

A search was carried out in an area of the river Great Ouse near School Lane, Harrold, after emergency services were called to reports that a man in his late 20s had got into difficulties at around 4pm.

The body was found with assistance from the fire service and specialist dive teams.

His next of kin have been made aware, and police are supporting the family at this difficult time.
