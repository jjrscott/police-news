Our Boson team seized drugs following successful warrants in Bedford targeting a suspected county lines gang.

The team, dedicated to tackling gun and gang activity, carried out four warrants across Bedford yesterday (10 March). As a result, a quantity of cash and Class A Drugs were seized from a property in Kempston Road and class B drugs from a property in Westbourne Road.

Three people were arrested and charged with conspiracy to supply Class A drugs. All have been remanded in custody.

Detective Inspector Mark Pugh, the force operational lead for drugs, county lines and serious youth violence, said: "Boson are committed to disrupting the highest risk gang members across the county to reduce organised crime.

"As a team we are doing all we can to reduce county lines and I hope this provides the community with reassurance that we are working hard to crackdown on those involved in gang violence."
