The Bedfordshire Police Community Cohesion Team attended Diwali celebrations across the county this month. Diwali, the festival of light, celebrates the victory of good over evil, and is an important time for the Hindu community.

Community Cohesion PC Hayley Hunter visited the Festival of Lights Celebration at Bunyan Sports Centre in Bedford on Saturday 14 October to join Bedford's Indian community in celebrating Diwali.

The force's University Liaison Officer PC Craig Pearce also attended the Diwali and Hindu New Year celebrations in BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir on Friday (20 October).

PCSO Daniel McHugh visited the same temple on Sunday (22 October) to witness the display of food and decorations.

Community Cohesion Sergeant Carl Perri said: "My team attended Diwali celebrations in different parts of the county to celebrate this important event in the spirit of unity and cohesion.

"It was important to see members of all Luton and Bedford communities present to experience this together. We in Community Cohesion are dedicated to ensuring that all people of Bedfordshire live and work together in harmony and this was a great example of communities coming together as one to celebrate diversity."
