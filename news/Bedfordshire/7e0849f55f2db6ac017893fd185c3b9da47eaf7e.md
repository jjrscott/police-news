**Our officers are appealing for information after a 97-year-old woman was the victim of a burglary in Luton yesterday evening (Thursday).**

Between approximately 7.45pm and 8.15pm, an unknown number of offenders forced their way into the property on Abbey Drive, and proceeded to ransack bedrooms in search of valuable items. They were able to make off with a sum of cash.

The victim was unharmed, but has been left badly shaken.

Investigation Officer Gary Hales, from our Serious Crime Investigation Team, said: "This type of crime, on the most vulnerable people in our community, is appalling and I would urge anyone with information to contact us.

"We always ask that people take steps to prevent themselves becoming a victim of burglary, such as deadlocking doors at night, ensuring windows are locked, and leaving a light on when not at home.

People with information are asked contact us via the online reporting centre or by calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime number C/12032/18.

Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 55 111.
