**The emergency services will continue to search an area of river in Bedfordshire after a swimmer got into difficulties this afternoon (Friday). **

We were called at approximately 4pm to reports of concern for the welfare of a man, and officers were assisted by the fire service and police helicopter to search an area of the river Great Ouse, south of School Lane, Harrold, Bedfordshire.

We would request that members of the public avoid the area of the river near to this location until further notice.

We are appealing for anyone with any information to call 101 quoting reference 287 of today.
