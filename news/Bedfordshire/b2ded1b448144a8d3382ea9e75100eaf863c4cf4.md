**We are appealing for witnesses after an armed robbery at Barton Rovers Football Club on Sunday (3 December). **

At approximately 8.35pm three men threatened a staff member at the club and ordered him to open the till, before making off with a substantial amount of money.

The offenders are described as one white man and two black men, all wearing masks. One was wearing black tracksuit bottoms with a white line running up each leg, and a distinctive fur hooded coat.

Anyone with information is asked to contact us on 101 quoting reference number 386 of 3 December.
