We are appealing for witnesses after an attempted ram raid in Marston Moretaine.

At around 1.50am yesterday (Wednesday), two men in a Vauxhall Corsa were seen trying to ram the gates of the Co-op store in Station Road. They then attempted to cut through the gate with tools before they were interrupted and left the scene.

One of the men is described as wearing a blue jacket and a high visibility vest and the other is described as wearing dark clothing.

Detective Sergeant Simon Oldfield, investigating, said: "We are keen to hear from anyone who knows anything about this attempted ram raid or who saw anything suspicious to come forward as this could help us with our enquiries."

Anyone with any information is asked to contact police on 101 or via the online reporting centre on the Bedfordshire Police website, quoting reference 40/8975/20 of 12 February.

You can also contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
