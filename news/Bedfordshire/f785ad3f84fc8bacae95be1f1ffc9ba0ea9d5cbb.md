We have carried out an engagement day at London Luton Airport yesterday (3 September) to educate passengers about female genital mutilation.

Operation Limelight is a national police operation, led by the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) and Metropolitan Police, which targets harmful practices, and is carried out on the airports and other major travelling hubs.

This operation takes place before and after the summer break when the potential victims are more likely to be taken out of the country for a prolonged period of time.

Yesterday, officers spoke to over 40 people about harmful practices, explaining what are the warning signs and how to get help or report it.

Harmful practices rooted in tradition, including forced marriage and female genital mutilation, are still believed to be under-reported and the force remains committed to encourage people at risk and victims to come forward. Bedfordshire Police has a specially trained team of officers who investigate these kind of reports with respect and discretion.

Detective Inspector Elaine Cook, from the force's Public Protection Unit, said: "Throughout the operation we were met with openness, and passengers were willing to speak to us about harmful practices. This is a sign of a positive awareness change throughout the years.

"The awareness of harmful practices and trust coming from our communities is extremely important in protection of the potential victims and getting help and support for the survivors. We also need to remember that no tradition or cultural practice can be used as an excuse to abuse anyone.

"We will take any reports seriously and we have specially trained officers to deal with this."

If you suspect that you or someone you know is at risk of being a victim of female genital mutilation, forced marriage, honour based violence or other forms of abuse rooted in tradition or cultural practice, you can seek help through the police or through a number of partners the force is working with.

Remember if you or someone known to you are in an immediate danger always call 999.
