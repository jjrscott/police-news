**We're recruiting Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs), and we're inviting people from across the area to apply.**

Applications are currently open, and candidates are encouraged to complete an online application form before the closing date of Sunday 11 November.

Successful applicants must be effective communicators with excellent interpersonal skills and the desire to make a difference to people's lives.

Inspector Mo Aziz said: "PCSOs play a vital role in the communities in which they serve. They help build links between our communities and the force, and get involved in long-term and proactive crime prevention initiatives.

"Our PCSOs work closely with partners and community organisations to address issues like anti-social behaviour, to deliver crime prevention advice and provide visible reassurance to the communities of Bedfordshire."

PCSOs undertake an initial seven week training course which is classroom-based but involves practical exercises, too. During this course they receive a law and legislation input that is relevant to their role. There are knowledge checks before they go on patrol.
