**The enquiry office at Dunstable Police Station is to close for an extended period of time while refurbishment takes place.

** The improvement work is expected to take around six weeks. We will release information about exactly when the office will reopen as soon as it becomes available.

Many services offered by the enquiry office can now be accessed online, while the front desk at Luton Police Station is open every day from 8am to 8pm.

Chief Superintendent David Boyle, our lead for local policing, said: "This closure will allow a number of improvements to be made at Dunstable Police Station, improving the service we can offer to the community.

"While this will cause some disruption in the short term, I would stress that there are a number of other ways for people to access our services.

"You can report crimes and concerns through our online reporting centre, while we also offer a webchat service.

"For those who would prefer to deal with someone face to face, Luton Police Station will still be open, while we will be doing all we can to ensure the enquiry office at Dunstable is reopened as soon as possible."
