**We are appealing for witnesses after a motorcyclist died in a road traffic collision last night.**

At around 7.05pm on Tuesday (25 June) a black Yamaha motorcycle travelling southbound on the A6 Ampthill Road in Bedford left the road.

A man in his 30s from Biggleswade suffered fatal injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene. While the man has not been formally identified, his next of kin have been informed.

PC Matthew Jacob, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Roads Policing Unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the man's friends and family at this difficult time.

"While we do not believe any other vehicles were involved, we are trying to establish a fuller picture of the circumstances that led up to this collision.

"If anyone was in the area and saw the bike in the moments before the incident, please get in touch with us and help us establish what happened.

"We would be particularly keen to see any dashcam footage that any motorists might have that captured these events."

Anyone with information about the incident can contact police via 101 or submit information, including dashcam footage, online via www.bedfordshire.police.uk/report, quoting Operation Sansa.
