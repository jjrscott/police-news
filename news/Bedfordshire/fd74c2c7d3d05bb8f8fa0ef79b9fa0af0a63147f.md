Police are appealing for information after a teenager was left with gunshot wounds in Luton.

At approximately 8.10pm on Friday (22 January) the victim was in Purley Park when he noticed he was being followed by two men.

The victim heard a loud bang before he realised he was injured. He was taken to hospital, and his injuries are not life threatening.

One of the men is described as wearing all dark clothing, a black jacket, and a mask, and was believed to be in his late teens.

Detective Constable Richard Marshall, investigating, said: "We would be particularly keen to hear from anyone who has CCTV or dash cam footage of the location, as well as anyone who saw or heard anything around this time. This happened in a place where there are lots of shops and vehicles in the area.

"Although our enquiries are at an early stage, we believe this was an isolated incident with no risk to the wider public."

Anyone with any information about this incident is asked to contact police on 101 or via bedfordshire.police.uk/report, quoting 40/3548/21.

You can also speak to Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
