**We will be opening our doors for another community engagement event, this time focussing on our Force Contact Centre, on Sunday, 15 April.**

At the event officers and staff will be on hand to discuss how the contact centre works, from answering calls to directing police resources in the most effective way. Attendees will also be able to test out some of the equipment the team uses and see inside the main call centre via a video link.

The event will take place between 10am-12pm on Sunday, 15 April and is open to members of the public. Numbers are limited so anyone interested is encouraged to reserve their place as soon as possible by contacting the customer services team at customer.services@bedfordshire.pnn.police.uk

The Contact Centre, known within the force as the 'FCC', is where many of the first contact services live, including call handlers, customer services, crime bureau and the Oscars - the people who make the strategic decisions when police are responding to an incident.
