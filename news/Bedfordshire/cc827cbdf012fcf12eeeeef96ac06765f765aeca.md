We are appealing for information after a shop robbery in Cranfield.

Last night (29 January), at approximately 10pm, a man entered the Co-op store in Mill Road, threatened staff and forced the till open.

The man took money before making off in the direction of Braeburn Way.

The offender was described as a white man, of slim build, wearing black clothing and a black mask.

Detective Sergeant Simon Hancock, who is investigating the incident, said: "I would like to appeal to anyone who was in the area at the time and witnessed anything suspicious to come forward.

"We would also like anyone in the area who has CCTV or dashcam footage to come forward."

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to contact police on 101 or using the force's online reporting centre, quoting the reference number 40/5992/20.

Alternatively you can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
