**Our current regular officer recruitment window has been extended in support of the national recruitment campaign, and those considering policing as a career are invited to attend an information evening event on Wednesday (25 September).**

The event, which will be held at Police Headquarters in Kempston from 6.30pm until 9pm, is designed to provide information on how to apply, what is required of applicants and what they can expect if successful. It will also provide an opportunity for people to meet serving officers of many different ranks and hear about their experiences.

Over recent years, the force has continued to recruit more police officers, with a 2017 report by the Home Office revealing that Bedfordshire had become the second highest recruiter of officers from BME backgrounds of all 43 police forces.

Temporary Assistant Chief Constable Sharn Basra, who joined the force in 1992, said: "Our priority is to recruit the very best people to Bedfordshire Police - we want people who are inquisitive and who want to make a difference in our county. We are lucky to work in a county that's richly diverse, and as a force we have a number of different opportunities that people could choose to follow once they've joined.

"No day in policing is the same - I have been a police officer for over 20 years and I still enjoy every single day. I'm immensely proud of what I've achieved so far, and over 20 years later I'm still enthusiastic about serving the county."

Anyone interested in attending the event should register their interest by email to Bedfordshire Police recruitment
