**We are appealing for witnesses after money was stolen from a freestanding cash machine outside the Co-op in Marston Moretaine in the early hours of Saturday morning (2 March).**

At around 2:30am, a white Audi was seen driving off from the Co-op's car park at speed towards Beancroft Road, with the boot open and possibly four people inside.

The cash machine had been severely damaged and around Â£16,000 is believed to have been taken.

Detective Constable Tracey Litchfield, investigating, said: "We are keen to find the people responsible for breaking into and damaging this cash point.

"Although this happened in the early hours of the morning, we are urging anyone who has any information or saw the car leaving the scene to come forward as this could be vital to our investigation."

If you are able to help, please call police on 101 or via the online reporting tool quoting the 40/12328/19.
