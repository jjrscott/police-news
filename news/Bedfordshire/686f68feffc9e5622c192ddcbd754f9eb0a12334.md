**We welcomed 15 new police officers yesterday (Monday), after they took part in a parade at police headquarters.**

The parade marked the end of the officers' 16 weeks of initial training. They will now start their two year probation period working alongside experienced officers in response, community policing and in the force's Emerald Team which is dedicated to tackling domestic crime and serious sexual offences.

Including the 16 new recruits, we have welcomed over 70 new officers into the force since January, with a further 48 currently in training.

Deputy Chief Constable Garry Forsyth, who attended the parade, said: "I'm very proud of these new recruits and look forward to seeing them fulfil their potential with the force. The new officers will bolster our resources, and will all play a vital role in keeping Bedfordshire safe and will be based across the county. The calibre of the people who applied was exceptionally high and I'm confident that the new officers will uphold the high standards required by the force."
