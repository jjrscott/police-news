**Officers from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit are supporting the national 2 Wheel campaign, taking place between Monday, 20 tMay and Sunday, 2 June.**

It involves promoting safer riding to both motorcyclists and pedal cyclists and to raise awareness with drivers to improve road safety.

Sergeant Ian Manley said: "We are absolutely committed to making the roads of our three counties safer and officers will be out on patrol engaging with bikers and cyclists.

"We know poor rider behaviour can be a contributory factor in collisions and it's important we keep sharing with as many people as possible how to improve their riding.

"We carry out a lot of proactive work to prevent these vulnerable road users becoming involved in an accident. Operation Velo is running which encourages drivers to adopt a safe pass approach with the optimum distance to pass a cycle being 1.5m.

"We also deliver BikeSafe workshops around hazard awareness and hold engagement events. I would encourage anyone who hasn't attended the workshops to sign up here."
