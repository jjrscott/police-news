**We are appealing for witnesses following an attempted robbery in Luton at approximately 7.30am last Friday (3 August). **

The victim was walking alongside New Bedford Road, near the junction with Cromwell Hill, when two offenders approached him from behind.

The offenders pinned the victim to the railing, demanded his money and threatened him with a knife. The offenders left empty handed as the victim didn't have any valuables on him.

The first offender is described as a white woman in her twenties, with brown hair in a ponytail and a bottom lip piercing. She was described wearing a red baseball cap.

The second offender is described as a white man, also in his twenties, muscular and with short brown hair.
