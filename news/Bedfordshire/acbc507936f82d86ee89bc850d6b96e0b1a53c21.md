We are appealing for information following a burglary in Kempston on Monday 18 December.

Between 6pm and 7.30pm offenders forced the door to gain access to a property in The Bower. Once inside they searched the house and unwrapped the presents from under the Christmas tree, before taking several items of jewellery and a safe. The offenders also stole the occupants car keys and drove off in the car, which is a white Audi A5.

Anyone who believes they may have seen these items or has been offered them for sale is asked to call police on 101 with the crime reference number JH/55146/17. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
