Detectives have issued a fresh appeal for information over an unsolved shooting which took place a year ago.

The victim was shot while sat in a car in a parking area behind houses in Flint Close, Luton just after 11pm on Friday, 8 November 2019.

Three young men on push bikes and wearing masks were involved in the shooting.

They arrived at the scene, opened up the passenger door of a parked silver Vauxhall Corsa and opened fire.

The victim, a man in his 20s, was left with serious injuries after being shot in the chest.

Detective Inspector Philip Moss, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: "This cowardly and reckless attack represents violence of the absolute highest degree.

"The unsuspecting victim was shot at close range before the three attackers left the scene on their bikes. This simply cannot be tolerated. Someone will know who is responsible for this.

"I would ask them to think about how they would feel if any of these three people went on to commit similar acts of violence against someone they know, knowing that the information they hold now could have prevented that from happening.

"Our investigation has achieved a great deal, including taking a firearm off the streets, but we now need those with any information to come forward, so we can do our job and bring these clearly violent offenders to justice.

"You don't have to talk to us - you can give any information or names anonymously via Crimestoppers."

Our Boson guns and gangs team recently took four firearms off the streets in the space of a week, as well as seizing more than Â£20,000 in cash in a county lines operation.

The force is also preparing to take part in a week of action next week to target knife crime.

Serious youth violence fell by nine per cent in Bedfordshire last year, equivalent to 200 fewer victims.

Anyone with any information about the shooting should contact police through the Bedfordshire Police website or by calling 101, quoting Operation Maldon.

You can also contact Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111 or visiting the charity's website.

If you want help or support with getting out of a gang, including from former gang members, then please contact the Bedfordshire Violence and Exploitation Reduction Unit.
