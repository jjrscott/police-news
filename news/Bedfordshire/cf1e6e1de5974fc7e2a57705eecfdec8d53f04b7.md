**We are appealing for information after a man died following a collision on High Road, Haynes earlier today (Friday).**

At around 1.30pm, a collision occurred between a silver Citroen C4 travelling towards Shefford, and a white DAF tipper lorry travelling towards Bedford. Emergency services attended, and road closures remain in place while officers investigate the incident.

The driver of the car was pronounced dead at the scene, and his family have been informed and are being supported by specialist officers.

Sergeant Tim Davies, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the victim's family at this time, and we are working to establish the circumstances of the collision.

"We would like to speak with witnesses who saw either the car or the lorry, prior to the incident. We'd especially like to hear from anyone who has dashcam footage and was in the area at the time.

"Please get in touch as you may be able to help with our investigation."

Anyone with any information can visit the Bedfordshire Police online reporting centre, quoting Operation Apollo.
