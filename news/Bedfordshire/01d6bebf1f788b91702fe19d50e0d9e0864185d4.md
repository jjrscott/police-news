**To celebrate 12 months since the opening of the police enquiry office and community hub at Lime Street in Bedford, we are holding a Public Engagement Day on Tuesday 18 December, between 10am and 2pm.**

The event will give you the opportunity to meet your local policing team and find out more about what is happening in the local community.

The enquiry office was officially opened on 20 December 2017, replacing the former unit at Greyfriars Police Station, and is the base for our community north urban team.

Inspector Paul Ayling said: "We are holding the event to celebrate the first anniversary of the office and hub in Lime Street and also to engage with the community so people can see what we are doing, ask us questions and get to know their local policing team.

"Members of the public will also have the opportunity to find out more about working in the police and the volunteering opportunities we offer.

"Community policing is at the very heart of what is important to us and we deal with the real concerns of local residents. This is why having a base in the town centre allows us to best respond to these issues."
