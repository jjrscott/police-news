### Police are appealing for information after two people were attacked and left with serious injuries in a Bedfordshire village.

We have received reports of a man and a woman being assaulted by a number of people with weapons in Clements End Road, Studham, at around 4am yesterday (Thursday).

Both victims suffered serious but non life threatening injuries and remain in hospital.

Four people have been arrested in connection to the attack and subsequently been released on bail.

Detective Sergeant Ryan Barnes, investigating, said: "This appears to be a deliberate and targeted attack displaying some extremely nasty violence.

"We believe a number of vehicles were in the area at the time so if you saw or heard a disturbance in the early hours of the morning, or any vehicles being driven in and around this area at the time, please get in contact with us.

"We are determined to bring the perpetrators to justice and would really appreciate the public's help in taking violent criminals of this nature off the streets."

Anyone with any information can contact police via our website or through 101. Please quote reference 59 of Thursday.

People can also report anything anonymously through Crimestoppers or on 0800 555 111
