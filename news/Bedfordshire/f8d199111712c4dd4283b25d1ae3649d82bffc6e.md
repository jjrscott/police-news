**Two men have been arrested after a suspected armed robbery at a convenience store.**

We were called shortly before 7pm last night (Monday) to reports of two men with weapons threatening staff and stealing money from the Co-op store in Bird's Hill, Heath and Reach.

Shortly before 8pm a vehicle was involved in a collision and two men in their 20s were arrested on suspicion of robbery.

Both men are currently in police custody.

Anyone with any information about the incident is asked to call us on 101, quoting reference 366 of Monday.
