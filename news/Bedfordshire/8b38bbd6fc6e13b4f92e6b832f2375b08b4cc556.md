**We are appealing for witnesses after a man was seriously assaulted in Market Square, Leighton Buzzard in the early hours of Sunday morning (11 March).**

At around 3am, the victim was walking home from the Lancer Public House, when he encountered another man, and stumbled into him as he walked.

The man then assaulted the victim and he lost consciousness for a brief period outside Pizza Plus. He sustained serious injuries that required hospital treatment.

The offender is described as white, in his twenties, with a dark moustache and dark hair. He was wearing a flat cap and a long, dark, smart coat.

Detective Constable Jeremy Atkin said: "This was a serious assault on a man as he was simply walking home from a night out. We are urging anyone who witnessed this incident to come forward."

Anyone with information about this incident can report it using the online reporting centre, or by calling Bedfordshire Police on 101 quoting reference number JD/7152/2018.
