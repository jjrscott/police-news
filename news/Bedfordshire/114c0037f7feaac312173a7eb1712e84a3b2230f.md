**We have cracked down on drugs production and closed two properties which were believed to be used to grow cannabis.**

On Sunday (3 February) officers were called to an address in Strathmore Avenue, Luton. Following a search a large amount of cannabis plants was found.

The following day (Monday) officers carried out a warrant in a house in Meyrick Avenue, Luton. Growing equipment used for cultivation of cannabis was found in the address.

Sergeant Jamie Harrison, from the Luton community team, said: "Drugs have an extremely negative impact on our communities and we won't tolerate cultivation of controlled substances in our county.

"We would like to encourage our residents to come forward with any information about suspicious behaviour in your neighbourhoods. We treat all reports seriously and we are continuing to crackdown on drug criminality in our town."

If you have information about crime in your area please contact Bedfordshire Police online or by calling 101.

In case of emergency always call 999.
