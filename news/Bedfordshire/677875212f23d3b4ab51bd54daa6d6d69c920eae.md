### Officers are appealing for information after a lit firework was thrown out of a vehicle hitting a nearby child in Dunstable on Friday (6 November).

At around 9am, at the junction of High Street South and Periwinkle Lane, occupants of a small hatchback threw a lit firework from a vehicle which hit a young child in a buggy.

PC Sam Allen investigating said: "We do not believe the child was targeted in this incident and although the firework burnt their clothing fortunately they were not injured. However, it was a very distressing incident and could have resulted in serious harm. We are very keen to speak to anyone who has information or was in the area at the time and has dashcam footage that could assist our enquiries."

If you have any information about this incident please call 101 or visit our online reporting tool and quote reference 40/60291/20.
