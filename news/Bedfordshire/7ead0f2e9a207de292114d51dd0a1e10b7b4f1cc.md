Between approximately 7pm and 8.15pm on Wednesday (20 September) a property in Wilstead was broken into. An unknown number of offenders forced entry through the back door of the building and a number of unique ornaments were stolen.

The items taken from the property are quite distinctive and we are urging people who might have been offered to purchase or value these pieces to come forward.

Anyone with information is asked to call Bedfordshire Police on 101 quoting reference number JH/40460/2017. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
