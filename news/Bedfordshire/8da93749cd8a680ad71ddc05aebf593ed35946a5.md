We are appealing for witnesses after a man was stabbed in Luton as he tried to intervene in a fight.

The incident took place at around 2.15am on Sunday (9 February), in Chapel Street. The victim tried to break up a fight between two members of the public, and sustained non-life threatening injuries. It is believed he was stabbed.

He fled to a nearby hotel in Guildford Street, where an ambulance was called.

Detective Constable Hasan Balic, investigating, said: "We are asking anyone who saw anything, or who knows anything about the fight, to get in contact.

"It would have been quite busy at that time, with people on their way home from a night out."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Bedfordshire Police via 101 or online at www.bedfordshire.police.uk/report quoting reference number 40/8360/20.

Alternatively you can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
