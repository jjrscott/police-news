### We are appealing for witnesses, following a road traffic collision on the A600 on Tuesday (21 July), which left a police officer injured.

At approximately 4.30pm, on the A600 near to the junction with the A507, an officer reported a collision between a police vehicle and a flatbed vehicle, which left the scene.

The officer attended hospital with a knee injury and is recovering.

The vehicle is described as a tipper-style flatbed, with a white cab and a black cage at the rear.

The driver was described as a white man, medium build, with brown hair.

Inspector Nicky Baxter said: "An officer and a police vehicle are now off the road and we are appealing for witnesses to the collision.

"We would particularly ask anyone who has dash cam footage from the area to come forward, as this could help with our enquiries."

If you have information, please report using our online reporting tool, quoting reference 288 of 21 July.

Alternatively, please call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, anonymously.
