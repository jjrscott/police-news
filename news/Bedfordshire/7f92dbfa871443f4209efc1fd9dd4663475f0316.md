**We are appealing for witnesses after a young boy was fatally wounded in a collision with a car in Luton this afternoon (Saturday).**

At approximately 2.20pm, we were called to reports of the collision on White Horse Vale, at the northern end, close to the junction with Kirby Drive. Emergency services attended and provided treatment to a 6-year-old boy, but he was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

One man has been detained.

Sergeant James Thorne, investigating, said: "We are currently trying to establish the surroundings of this incident and would appreciate help from anyone who witnessed the collision to get in touch with us.

"We'd especially like to hear from anyone who saw a blue Vauxhall Astra in the area shortly before or after the incident, or from any drivers who may have dashcam footage of the area at this time today."

The road is currently closed whilst the investigation is underway.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 or visit our online reporting centre, quoting reference 185 of 20 October.
