**We are appealing for information following a robbery and knife attack on a man in Luton on Monday (22 October).**

At around 6.30pm, an 18-year-old man was followed by three men with knives after he got off a bus in Manchester Street. He headed towards Inkerman Street where the three offenders grabbed him from behind and proceeded to assault him, kicking him and pushing him into a window, all in an attempt to steal his bag.

The victim was slashed in the face and stabbed in the legs. His injuries are not life threatening.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact us via the online reporting centre or by calling 101 and quoting reference number 40/32921/18.

Alternatively, call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
