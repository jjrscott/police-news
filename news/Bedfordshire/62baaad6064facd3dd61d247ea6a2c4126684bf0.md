**We are appealing for witnesses after a robbery in Bedford on Sunday night (2 December).**

Officers first responded to reports of a victim being assaulted in Allhallows, near to the bus station, at around 10pm.

The victim had been attacked by a group described as a group of black and Asian males, in their teens or early 20s.

One of them was wearing a green Puffa jacket.

The group threatened and attacked the victim with a knife before stealing his bag.

The victim suffered serious but non-life threatening injuries and was taken to hospital for treatment.

Anyone with any information can contact the force through our online reporting centre or by calling 101, quoting reference 389 of 2 December.

Alternatively you can contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.

A 15-year-old boy has been arrested in connection to the incident and has been released under investigation.
