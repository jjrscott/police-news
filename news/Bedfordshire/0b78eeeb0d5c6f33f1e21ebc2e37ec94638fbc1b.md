### A man who ran an illegal taxi business for people at London Luton Airport has been banned from driving for six months.

Yasir Masood, 40, of Brook Street, Luton, pleaded guilty at Luton Magistrates' Court last week to touting for hire by a private hire vehicle. He was disqualified from driving for six months and fined Â£150.

PC Tom Hamilton, from the force's community policing team at the airport, said: "We are aware that illegal touts have been causing a number of issues at the airport, and it will not be tolerated. "This kind of behaviour is also unfair on legitimate taxi drivers, who have gone through the proper processes of getting a licence. "This six month ban and fine should show that this behaviour will be taken seriously by the courts. As air travel begins to pick back up again, we would also encourage people to use licenced taxi."
