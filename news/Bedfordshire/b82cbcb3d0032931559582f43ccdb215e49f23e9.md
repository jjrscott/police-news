**Members of the public had an amazing opportunity to see first-hand how our Force Contact Centre (FCC) operates.**

On Sunday 15 April we an held an open day at our FCC at our Headquarters in Kempston.

During the event, communities had a chance to speak to our police officers and staff about how the Force Contact Centre works.

A video link was set up so the visitors had a chance to observe how the heart of our force operates in real time.

Additionally Chief Inspector Rachael Glendenning used real life examples of what kind of the calls are acceptable and which ones are just an unnecessary strain on the Force Contact Centre resources.

Rachael said: "The day was amazing and the attendance was much bigger than we expected. It is great to see that the people we work hard to protect were interested in learning more about our force.

"I think it was a brilliant event and we are looking forward in organising similar events in other parts of the county."
