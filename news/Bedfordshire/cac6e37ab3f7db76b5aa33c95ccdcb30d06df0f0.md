We are appealing for information following two robberies in Bedford last week.

The first incident happened around 3.15pm on Monday 9 September in York Street. As the victim approached the crossing a man tried to snatch her bag from her shoulder dragging her to the floor, causing minor injuries. He ran off without the handbag.

Shortly afterwards around 3.30pm in Rothsay Gardens another woman was walking towards Goldington Road and was approached from behind by a man who pulled a purple rucksack from her back. She was dragged along the floor, causing injury to her arms and legs, before the suspect made off towards Goldington Road.

The offender is described as white, in his 30s, with blonde hair and a scruffy light beard, wearing a black hooded top.

Detective Constable Jay Watts, investigating, said: "These were two nasty robberies, committed in broad daylight, by who we believe to be the same offender. Both incidents have understandably left the victims feeling traumatised. Anyone who saw what happened or with information about the offender is urged to come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact DC Watts on 101, or by visiting our online reporting centre, quoting reference number 40/52123/19.
