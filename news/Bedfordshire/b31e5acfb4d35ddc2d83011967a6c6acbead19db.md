**This week, the Bedford Borough Community Safety Partnership will be running a Week of Action in the Midland Road and Tavistock Street areas.**

We have partnered with Bedford Borough Council and Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service and every day from today (1 October) to Saturday (6 October), we will be working in partnership with the local community to concentrate on ways to help improve the two areas. This will include activities and events that local residents and businesses can be involved in

Inspector Paul Ayling said "This initiative is aiming to address issues raised to us by our residents. We often run Operation Highgate, which focuses on tackling street drinking, homelessness and begging as this is a prevalent concern affecting the Midland Road and Tavistock Street areas of Bedford. This week of action showcases how we are working with our partners to tackle the problems in these hotspot areas."

Local residents and business of the Tavistock Street and Midland Road areas will have received a timetable of the planned events for the week, with dates, times and location through their letterbox, and this is available online at www.bedford.gov.uk
