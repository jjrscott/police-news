**We are appealing for information following a theft in Flitwick.**

On Wednesday (24 October) at 10am, a woman approached the elderly victim at a car park on Coniston Road. The woman distracted the victim by asking for some change for a trolley, but the victim noticed her bank cards were missing.

The woman was described as white, 5'6'', of medium build and with short grey hair. She was believed to be wearing a green jacket, maroon trousers and blue trainers.

Anyone with any information is asked to call 101 quoting crime reference number 40/33094/18.
