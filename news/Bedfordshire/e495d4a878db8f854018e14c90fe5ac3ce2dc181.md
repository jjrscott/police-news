**Detectives investigating a fire at a block of residential flats in Five Springs, Luton last night (Friday) are appealing for witnesses to come forward, after three people were taken to hospital suffering from smoke inhalation.**

We were called just after 6.30pm to a report of fire breaking out in the communal lobby area on the 14th floor. A number of residents were evacuated for a short period of time while Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service tackled the blaze.

Emergency services attended and three people, a woman and two children, were taken to hospital. The woman and one of the children remain in hospital and are being treated for serious smoke-related injuries.

Detective Inspector Elaine Cook said: "We are currently investigating the circumstances of this incident and believe that the fire may have been started deliberately so we are appealing for anyone who was in the area at the time and saw anything suspicious to come forward.

"We are particularly keen to speak to a group of young people who were seen near the building at the time of the incident as they may have vital information that could help us with our enquiries."

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to call us on 101 or visit www.bedfordshire.police.uk/report and quote reference number 338 of 3 January.

Alternatively you can also contact Crimestoppers anonymously and in confidence on 0800 555 111.
