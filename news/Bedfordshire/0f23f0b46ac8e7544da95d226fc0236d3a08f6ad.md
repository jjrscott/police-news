**We are appealing for witnesses after a tourist was robbed in Luton on Thursday (26 April).**

The victim was walking along King Street with two friends at approximately 7.45pm, when five men approached them, threatened them and demanded they hand over their shopping.

One of the offenders restrained the victim and took his watch and shopping bags. Members of the public shouted at the men to leave them alone, and the offenders made off towards The Mall.

The five offenders are described as black, and one had braces on his teeth.

Detective Constable David Elias, investigating, said: "This incident occurred in a busy street outside the YMCA hostel and we are keen to speak to anyone who may have witnessed it, particularly those who shouted out.

"Whilst the victim was not injured, this has unfortunately left him shaken and has marred his visit to the UK, and specifically to Bedfordshire. I would like to encourage anyone with information about the offenders to get in touch.

"Tackling robbery in Bedfordshire is a priority."

Anyone with information is asked to contact the police on 101 quoting reference number C/19108/2018 or by visiting our online reporting centre.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
