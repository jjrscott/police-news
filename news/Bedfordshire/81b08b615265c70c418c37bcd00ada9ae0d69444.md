**We are asking for witnesses to come forward, following a robbery in Dunstable on Wednesday (21 February) evening.**

Between 11pm and 11.30pm, a man was walking in Grove House Gardens when he was approached from behind and threatened with a knife.

After a brief chase, the victim handed over a quantity of money, and was subsequently walked to a cashpoint at an ASDA store on Court Drive where he was forced to withdraw a further amount of money.

The offender is described as a white man in his early 30s, 5'6", of stocky build.

PC Daniel O'Mahoney, investigating, said: "This is a clearly a very nasty robbery and we understand a number of people waiting at a nearby bus stop may have seen the incident.

"We would ask anyone with information to come forward as they may be able to assist with our enquiries."

Anyone with information is asked to contact us via our online reporting centre, by calling 101, and referencing JD/8514/201. Alternatively, report it anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
