**We have closed down a property in Cowper Street, Luton, which was being used as a brothel.**

The officers attended the location following a report from a member of the public that a number of individuals were attending the location and it has become a source of anti-social behaviour in the area.

During a search of the property, a number of items was found suggesting that it was being used as a brothel. Five people found at the address have been safeguarded.

The property has been issued with a 24-hour closure notice and was closed following a hearing at Luton Magistrates' court hearing on Monday (8 April).

PC Saqib Khan, from the local community team, said: "Tackling prostitution and anti-social behaviour are two of our priorities. We work closely with our partners to create a network of support to the victims of exploitation.

"We are also working on educating the offenders in order to reduce this kind of criminality in our county."

If you have any information about anti-social behaviour in your area you can report it to the police by calling 101 or by via the online reporting centre.
