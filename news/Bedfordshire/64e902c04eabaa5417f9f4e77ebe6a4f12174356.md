**We are appealing for witnesses after an attempted robbery in Biggleswade**

At around 9.20pm yesterday, (7 September), a couple in their eighties were in Station Road, Biggleswade, walking to their car which was parked nearby.

The attacker rode up to the couple on a bike and attempted to grab the lady's handbag. She resisted, and her husband tried to fend off the man, sustaining cuts to his hands, and was later treated at hospital for his injuries.

The suspect is described as white, in his late teens, wearing black jeans, and a black top with its hood up. He was riding a mountain bike, and rode off in the direction of Back Street.

Anyone who saw the incident, or has any information should visit our online reporting centre or call police on 101, quoting reference 436 of 7 September.
