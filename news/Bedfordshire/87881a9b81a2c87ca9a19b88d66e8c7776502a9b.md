### A Biggleswade property was made the subject of a three-month closure order by Luton Magistrates' Court on Wednesday (2 September) after a number of concerns were raised by the local community.

We are working with Central Bedfordshire Council, and a local housing association, successfully applied for the closure order on the property in Urban Way.

The property was reported as a source of nuisance by residents, and the local community policing team linked in with the local council to support the neighbourhood.

Following a search, a quantity of drugs and drug paraphernalia were discovered at the address.

PC Aiden Howarth, from the Biggleswade and Ampthill Community Team, said: "We are satisfied with the court's decision to close down the property. This closure wouldn't be possible without the support from the community and the council.

"We would also like to reassure our communities that every report matters to us, as they help us build a better intelligence picture of issues in your neighbourhoods."

If you have concerns around drug criminality and anti-social behaviour in your area report it to us online or call us on 101.

Councillor Ian Dalgarno, Central Bedfordshire Council Executive Member for Community Services said: "Nuisance neighbours can have a detrimental effect on their neighbours' quality of life and wellbeing, and this is unacceptable."

"This is a positive outcome, which has been secured by working in partnership with the police and housing association to tackle the anti-social behaviour."

"Residents can also report anti-social behaviour to us online."
