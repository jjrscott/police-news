**We are appealing for witnesses following an assault in Luton on Wednesday (10 January).**

Between 12.45pm and 1.15pm, the victim was approached by a man in Stuart Street, Luton, outside the Magistrates' Court. After punching the victim and threatening him with a metal bar, the offender made off with an amount of cash.

The offender is described as black, approximately 5'8'', with medium length dark hair and a dark beard. He is thought to have been wearing a yellow jacket.

Police Constable Thomas Mahendran, investigating, said: "This was a brazen attack in broad daylight which happened on a busy Luton street. We won't tolerate this kind of behaviour and we are appealing for anyone with information to come forward."

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to call 101 quoting crime reference C/1610/2018. Alternatively, you can contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
