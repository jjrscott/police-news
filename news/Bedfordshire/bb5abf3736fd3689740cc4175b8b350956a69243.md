**We are appealing for witnesses after a robbery outside a shop in Bedford yesterday (Tuesday).**

The incident took place at Costcutters in Mile Road at around 10.15pm, when the victim put the shop's takings into the boot of his car before locking it.

As he returned to the shop to put the shutters down, a group of men broke into the car and stole the takings before leaving in a green vehicle towards Progress Way.

All the men were reported to be wearing masks and gloves as they carried out the robbery, and one of the men may have been carrying what was believed to be a gun.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101 quoting crime reference 40/4777/18
