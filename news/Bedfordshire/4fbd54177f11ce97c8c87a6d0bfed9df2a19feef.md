**We're issuing a security reminder and appealing for witnesses following two distraction burglaries - one in Bedford and one in Luton.**

The first incident took place in Orwell Close, Bedford on Wednesday (17 April).

At around 3pm a woman knocked at the victim's door and asked for a carrier bag. While the victim was getting the bag for her, the woman stole car keys from the hall way and used them to steal the victim's car.

The stolen vehicle is a sliver Ford Fiesta with registration number EJ65 KLL.

The second burglary happened yesterday (Monday) afternoon in Ashburnham Road, Luton.

At around 2.25pm a woman approached a man who was in front of his house and asked for some change.

The man went inside to get some money and when he came back he noticed that the woman had gone inside his property. He asked her to leave and the woman ran away. Shortly afterwards, he noticed that two mobile phones were missing from his living room.

The offender in both incidents is described as a white, skinny woman in her 30s.

Detective Sergeant Chris Hutton said: "In both cases, the offender took advantage of another person's kindness. If you have any information about either incident, please get in touch with us.

"Although we are not formally linking the two incidents, we would like to encourage residents to stay vigilant. If you have an elderly family member, friend or neighbour please speak to them about securing their home and being wary of any strangers who call at their home."

Anyone with information is asked to call DS Hutton on 101 or by visiting www.bedfordshire.police.uk/report. Quote reference number 40/21942/19 for the Bedford incident and 40/22930/19 for the Luton incident.

Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
