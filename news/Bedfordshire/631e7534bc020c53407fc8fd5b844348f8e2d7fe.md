**A tribute has been paid to a "kind, loving, thoughtful, outgoing family lad" who died in a road traffic collision on the A505 near Leighton Buzzard on Sunday.**

Joseph Fennelly was killed as a result of the collision between a car and a pedestrian on the A505 Watling Street towards Stanbridge at around 5.30am.

A grey Ford Fusion was involved in a collision with Mr Fennelly. The 19-year-old from Bideford Green, Leighton Buzzard was taken to hospital but unfortunately died from his injuries.

In a statement his parents said: "There are no words to explain how much our beautiful son meant to us.

"He had such a bright future ahead of him and will be missed dearly. It is heart breaking that such a young life has been taken in such devastating circumstances.

"Joe was a kind, loving, thoughtful, outgoing family lad and will be missed by his two brothers, his sister and his nephew dearly.

"His death has affected so many friends, grandparents, aunties, uncles and cousins from all around the world. This boy touched so many lives."

Anyone with any information about the collision is asked to call 101, quoting Operation Toucan.
