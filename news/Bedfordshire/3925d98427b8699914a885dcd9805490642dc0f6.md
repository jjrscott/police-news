**A canteen worker at Bedfordshire Police has swapped cooking for sewing, organising a group of volunteers who between them have created 300 homemade laundry bags for frontline officers, to help in the fight against coronavirus.**

Sarah Bowers and her team of sewing bees have made the bags so officers can use them at the end of a long shift to put their uniforms in and not risk contaminating their cars and homes. The bags have been made from disused materials which have all been cleaned.

Chief Executive of the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner (OPCC) Clare Kelly said: "We are very proud of and thankful to Sarah and her team. The hundreds of hours of work that must have gone into producing the bags is unbelievable. "It's amazing to see this kind of generosity and kindness, at a time of national crisis. The bags will help to protect frontline officers and their families, as they continue to police Bedfordshire, putting their lives on the line to keep our communities safe."
