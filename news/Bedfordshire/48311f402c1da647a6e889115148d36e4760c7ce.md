**Our north urban community policing team has successfully secured a three-month closure order for a property in Bedford.**

On Thursday (22 March) our community officers attended the property in Western Street after receiving several reports that it was a source of anti-social behaviour and drug crime in the area and a continuous nuisance to the neighbourhood.

The team initially imposed a 24-hour closure notice on the location, and later that day the property was closed for three months following a hearing at Luton Magistrates' Court.

PC Charlie Crozier said: "We are happy with the court's decision to close the property and hopefully it will bring reassurance to our communities that they will be listened to and action will be taken. We treat all reports of anti-social behaviour seriously and we would like to encourage our residents to come forward with any information about crime in their neighbourhood."

If you wish to report anti-social behaviour in your area you can do it online through the force's online reporting centre or by calling 101.
