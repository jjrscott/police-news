The victim, a man in his 30s, was pronounced dead at the scene in Southwood Road after being struck by a vehicle at around 4.20pm.

The vehicle, believed to be a dark Renault Megane, failed to stop at the scene and investigations are ongoing to trace the driver.

It is thought the incident followed an altercation by the shops in Mayfield Road.

Detective Inspector Alan Page from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit said: "We are currently treating the death as murder and I would urge anyone who saw what happened or has any information about this incident to call police."Southwood Road was closed overnight while investigations were carried out but has now been re-opened.

Anyone with any information should call DI Page on 101 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111.
