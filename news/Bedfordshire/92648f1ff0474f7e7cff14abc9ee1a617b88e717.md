**The case of a man who was left with life-changing injuries after he was mown down by a car on a pavement in Dunstable is the focus of the latest episode 24 Hours in Police Custody.**

The hit fly-on-the-wall documentary returned to TV screens last Monday (19 February) for its sixth series.

Car Attack, which airs tonight (Monday, 26 February) on Channel 4 at 9pm, shows the attempted murder investigation unfold, with detectives having just 24 hours to question their main suspect.

The victim was left with life-changing injuries following the incident, which officers believed to be deliberate.

Detective Sergeant Simon Oldfield said: "Tonight's episode is a really interesting one and a total contrast to last week's. Mowing someone down by car is an unusual way to try to harm someone, and this episode takes you through our investigation into this nasty attack from start to finish."

The first episode of the new series, which showed former Bedfordshire Police officer Gareth Suffling jailed for blackmail, received rave reviews.

Chief Constable Jon Boutcher said: "It's incredibly important for us to be open and transparent with the public, and I'm really pleased by the feedback we have received across the country for last week's episode. I urge you all to tune in tonight and to the other episodes in the series - each one is a fascinating insight into the way in which we work to tackle offenders and keep Bedfordshire safe."
