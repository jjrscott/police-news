**We are issuing a video appeal for information after robbers held up a store at knifepoint.**

On 3 January (Wednesday) between 9.30pm and 9.40pm two men entered a store in High Street, Cranfield. The offenders threatened a member of staff with a knife and demanded money.

A large quantity of cash was stolen.

Officers have been carrying out a number of lines of enquiry into the incident but have so far been unable to identify any offenders. Officers are now issuing a video appeal featuring the CCTV and a crowbar which was left behind in the robbery.

Detective Constable Aroop Nandre said: "This was a disturbing robbery and we are appealing to anyone with information to come forward.

"Additionally, the crowbar is quite distinctive and I would appeal to owners of tool shops to get in touch if they sell this particular type of tool."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Bedfordshire Police on 101 quoting reference number JD/371/2018. You can also use the online reporting centre on the force's website.

Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
