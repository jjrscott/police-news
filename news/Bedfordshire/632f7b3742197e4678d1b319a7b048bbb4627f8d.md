**Our officers are seeking the public 's help as part of an investigation into an attempted robbery in Luton last week.**

On Tuesday 23 January, a woman was walking through Coniston Park at around 2.40pm when a man on a bike bumped into her causing her to drop her phone.

After an exchange of words the offender rode off before returning seconds later, assaulting her and demanding that she hand over her phone. He then took her handbag and rode off.

The offender is described as black, around 16-years-old and of skinny build. He is thought to have been wearing dark clothing; a grey hooded top with the hood pulled tightly around his face, grey tracksuit bottoms and black gloves. The victim also describes him as wearing 'old fashioned' glasses.

Anyone with any information is asked to call 101 quoting reference number C/3731/18. You can also submit information online by visiting our reporting centre or call independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
