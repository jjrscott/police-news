We're appealing for witnesses after a teenager was stabbed in Priestleys in Luton this afternoon (Tuesday).

Police were called at 4.10pm to reports that a 15-year-old boy had been stabbed in the leg. Emergency services attended, and the teenager was taken to hospital with serious injuries, but which aren't thought to be life-threatening.

A number of officers remain in the area following the incident, and part of Rockley Road, towards Longcroft Road, has been closed to allow an investigation to take place.

Detective Sergeant Claire Case said: "This is a concerning incident which is being taken incredibly seriously, and a number of officers are still in the area to carry out enquiries, but also to provide some reassurance to the public.

"A lot of people were in the area when the incident happened, and therefore we're asking anyone who has any information about what happened - including any mobile phone footage - to get in touch, as you may have information that is vital to our investigation."

Anyone with any information is asked to call 101 quoting reference number 240 of today's date.
