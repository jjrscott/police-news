Luton Community Team

**Officers from our south community team will be taking part in a charity cycle event in Luton later this month.**

Sergeant Samantha Hunt, PC Luke Horan, PCSO Asim Warraich and PCSO Chloe Phipps will take on a virtual bike ride at The Mall in aid of the charity Stepping Stones, covering 125 miles - the same distance from London to Nottingham.

Stepping Stones is a local charity which is dedicated to supporting vulnerable women from Luton.

Other members of the team will helping to collect money, and mascot Chase, from Paw Patrol, will also be making an appearance at around 1pm.

Sergeant Samantha Hunt, who organised the event, said: "Stepping Stones provides amazing additional support to women who have suffered from abuse or are vulnerable due to substance misuse.

"As a team we want to try and raise money for the women we see regularly who may benefit from this charity. We have chosen Stepping Stones because we are already aware of the great work they do through our involvement in Operation Code, which deals with the on street sex trade."

**If you wish to donate pleaseemail Stepping Stones directly or visit their website for more information. **
