### We are appealing for information after a man was robbed while a machete was held to this throat.

The victim was approached by a group of three men between 2.30am and 3am on Saturday (1 August) in High Street North, Dunstable.

The trio threatened the victim with a machete and stole cash, bank cards and a khaki Gucci bag.

PC Helen Pecorini, investigating, said: "We will pursue anybody who thinks this sort of brazen use of weapons is acceptable.

"This was clearly a frightening incident for the victim, who only suffered minor injuries.

"This sort of offending is often linked to organised crime and serious violence, so it is vital that the public tells us anything they know so we can track these men down and make our communities safer."

Anyone with any information on this incident is asked to contact the force through our website or by calling 101.Please quote reference 67 of Saturday.

Alternatively you can submit information anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Bedfordshire's Violence and Exploitation Reduction Unit (VERU), aims to tackle the root causes of serious violence. You can find out more at bedsveru
