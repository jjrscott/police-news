**We are appealing for information after a man in his 50s was robbed.**

The incident happened at around 11pm on Wednesday in St George's Square, Luton.

The victim was sitting on a bench outside VS Food and Wine when he was attacked from behind.

The man fell to the floor and the offenders stole his wallet before making off on foot. No description of the suspects is available.

Detective Constable Richard Marshall, investigating, said: "The victim of this unprovoked attack has been left with multiple and some quite nasty injuries.

"There are often people around this part of town and I would appeal to anyone who was in the area at the time or has any other information to get in touch with us."

Anyone with any information can contact police on 101 or through the online reporting centre on our website.

You can also contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
