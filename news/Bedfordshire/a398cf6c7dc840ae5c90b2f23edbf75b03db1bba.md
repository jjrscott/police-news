### We are appealing for witnesses following a distraction burglary in Luton.

At approximately 2pm on Sunday (13 September), two men knocked on the door of a property in Hitchin Road and spoke to the occupant. The callers introduced themselves as food item sellers and offered to sell steak and cheese to the man.

The man went to get his wallet when he suddenly became unwell. He woke up shortly after and the visitors left and closed the door. He then realised that his wallet, which contained bank cards and a quantity of cash, was missing.

Detective Constable David Pawelek, who is investigating, said: "We are keen to speak to anyone who witnessed this incident or was also visited by these men on the day.

"We are keen to identify them as we believe they have taken advantage of the unsuspecting victim.

"If you know anything about this incident please get in touch."

If you have any information please visit our online reporting centre or call 101 and quote reference number 40/49887/20.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
