**Almost 100 warrants have been executed in Bedfordshire this year as we continue our crack down on people viewing and sharing indecent images of children. **

Our Internet Child Abuse Investigation Team (ICAIT) carried out 89 warrants between January and the start of December, which resulted in the arrest of 80 individuals on suspicion of online child sex offences.

The team have also had a number of cases resulting in custodial sentences, with defendants sentenced to a collective total of 74 years in prison following successful prosecutions in 2017.

Most importantly, the team has also worked to safeguard more than 150 children across Bedfordshire.

ICAIT Detective Sergeant Graeme Twyford said: "It's been a very busy year for our team as the flood of reports of online child sex offending shows no sign of abating.

"The viewing and sharing of indecent images of children causes real harm to real children and it will not be tolerated in Bedfordshire.

"People who commit these types of offences online can often to go on to abuse children in the offline world, which is why it is vital we investigate them thoroughly and put appropriate safeguarding measures in place.

"I'm really pleased with how much the team has achieved in 2017, and we are committed to doing even more in 2018 to crack down on these predatory sex offenders and protect the children of Bedfordshire."
