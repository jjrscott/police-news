We are thanking members of the Luton community who found and informed the force about four firearms in public places this week.

Officers have been increasing patrols in the Marsh Farm, Hockwell Ring, Marsh Road and Marsh House areas, as part of the force's commitment to reduce gun crime and criminal activity.

They have also been engaging with communities and encouraging them to come forward with information.

The firearms were reported to police on Wednesday (7 June) and on Thursday (8 June) and were removed by forensic teams.

Sergeant Tau Chamboko, who led the increased patrols, said: "In two instances we received 999 calls alerting us to the guns - one had been found in undergrowth in a park when a person was retrieving a cricket ball.

"We are very pleased to remove these weapons and stop them being used by the offenders who hid them in totally unsuitable and unsafe places. We want to make our communities safer and protect the wider public and the people involved in gangs."

If you find a weapon, please call police immediately on 999. Alternatively if you have information that someone may have access to a weapon, please contact police via 101 or give information online.
