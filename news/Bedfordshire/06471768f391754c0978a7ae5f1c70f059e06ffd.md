**We are appealing for information after an aggravated burglary in Luton on Saturday (10 November).**

The incident took place at a house in Stanford Road at around 5.30am, when the occupant, who is in his 80s, was woken by someone trying to get in through his front door.

He went to open the door and there was a man with a knife demanding money and saying he was hungry.

The man inside the property was able to shut the door before the other man got inside, but while doing so suffered a small cut to his finger.

The offender is described as a white male wearing dark clothing.

Detective Constable David Pawelek, investigating, said: "This was a very frightening incident which left the victim very shaken.

"If anyone was in the area at this time, or has been subject to a similar sort of incident, then we would urge you to get in touch with us."

Anyone with any information can contact us through the force's online reporting centre or by calling 101, quoting reference 176 of 10 November.

Alternatively, call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
