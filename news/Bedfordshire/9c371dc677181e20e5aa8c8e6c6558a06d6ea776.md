**Bedfordshire Police would like to invite the public to its free family fun day, which will take place from 11am until 3pm on Sunday 1 September at Police HQ in Kempston.**

Families will have the chance to see displays from different departments, including the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Dog Unit and depending on operational needs, a visit from the police helicopter.

There will be an opportunity to meet and greet our special guest Paw Patrol's Chase and children will also have the chance to design their own police hat.

Chief Constable Garry Forsyth said: "Last year around 3,000 people attended, and we're looking forward to welcoming our communities again this year. We're excited to be hosting our fifth Family Fun Day; it's important to me that we invite the public in to find out more about what we do.

"It's also a really good opportunity to invite our partners so that they can demonstrate what they do, and the ways in which they support us to fight crime and protect the public."

No pets will be allowed on site during the event, however guide dogs are allowed.
