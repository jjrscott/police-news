**We are appealing for witnesses after two men were injured in a two-vehicle collision near Sandy this morning (Friday).**

At approximately 8.30am we were called to reports of a collision between a silver BMW and a white van on the A1 southbound between the A603 and the junction with the A6001 Biggleswade north.

Emergency services attended the scene and a man was taken by air ambulance to hospital with serious injuries.

A second man was also taken to hospital with minor injuries.

The road remains closed while investigation work takes place and is expected to be closed until approximately 2pm today. Drivers are asked to consider using alternative routes.

Sergeant James Wood, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire Roads Policing Unit, investigating, said: "We would appreciate assistance from anyone who may have witnessed the collision to get in touch with us.

"In particular if any drivers have dashcam footage of the area at the time please do let us know."

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 or visit our online reporting centre, quoting Op Wychester.
