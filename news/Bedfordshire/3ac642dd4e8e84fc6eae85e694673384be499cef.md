**We are appealing for witnesses after a teenage boy was stabbed multiple times in an incident in Luton this morning (Tuesday). **

We were called to reports of a stabbing at around 2.10am in Preston Gardens.

The victim, a 15-year-old boy, was taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries.

Detective Inspector Jerry Waite, from our Major Crime Unit, said: "The victim received more than 20 stab wounds in this shocking incident and is now fighting for his life.

"It's absolutely vital that anyone who has any information about this incident, no matter how minor it may seem, gets in touch with us. You could help us find the person, or people, responsible for this horrific attack.

"We have more than 30 officers working hard to establish the circumstances which led to the stabbing - but we need the public's help too.

"We will also have community police officers out in the area today on patrol, so if you have any concerns please do speak to them."

Anyone with information is asked to contact us on 101 or via our reporting centre quoting Operation Bald.

You can also contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
