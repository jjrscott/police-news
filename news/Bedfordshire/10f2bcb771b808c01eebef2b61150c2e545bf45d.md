**A targeted police operation to combat youth violence and gang activity in Luton has been hailed a success. **

Operation Sparkler ran for four days between 25 October and 8 November, and was established to target groups of individuals believed to be involved in violent crime in the Marsh Farm, Lewsey Farm and Leagrave areas.

The operation was supported by our officers and staff from both the community policing teams and also officers from Boson - our response to tackling gangs and guns.

Detective Inspector Aaron Kiff said: "This operation saw seven people arrested, 15 vehicles stopped and 39 people stopped and searched. As a result, we recovered a number of offensive weapons and a quantity of drugs.

"We are very pleased with the results of this targeted operation and, although it has now concluded, we remain committed to keeping our communities safe. We will continue to target violent crime and gang activity in these areas."
