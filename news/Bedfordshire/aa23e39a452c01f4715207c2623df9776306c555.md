We are appealing for information after a woman was assaulted in Dunstable on Monday (30 October).

The woman was walking along Britain Street while talking on her phone between 5.20am and 5.40am when she was approached from behind by a man who hit her with a brick causing minor injuries. The victim started running, and the offender turned and ran in the opposite direction.

The offender did not say anything, take anything or try to do anything else. He is described as white, stocky, aged around 30, clean shaven and was wearing a black jacket with the hood up.

Our investigation is ongoing, but we are keen to speak to anyone who has any information about the incident; whether you were in the area at the time and saw anything, or whether you know who may be responsible.

Anyone with any information is asked to call 101 quoting crime reference number JD/46923/2017. Alternatively, you can contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, by calling 0800 555111.
