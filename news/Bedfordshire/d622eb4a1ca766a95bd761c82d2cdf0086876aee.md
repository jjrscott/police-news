**Our Bedford Community Policing team has successfully applied for a three-month closure order of a property in Byron Cresent, Bedford.**

The property has been a source of issues to its neighbours and was reportedly linked to drug crime.

The team worked closely with the housing association and Bedford Borough Council to resolve local community concerns and apply for the closure order.

PC Sorrin Ruffell, from the Bedford Community Policing team, said: "The concerns of our local communities are always our priority. Therefore we would like to encourage our residents to report any concerns they have about their neighbourhoods.

"This helps us build a better picture of the issues in the area and investigate any ongoing criminal activity.

"We are dedicated to working with our partners to ensure a multi-agency approach to support our residents."

If you have any concerns about drug crime, antisocial behaviour or any other crime in your neighbourhood you can report it online or by calling 101.
