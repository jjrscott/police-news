**A tribute has been paid to the woman who sadly died in a road traffic collision in Bedfordshire on Christmas Day.**

Gloria Jones, 71, from Gwent in Wales, died on Monday (25 December) after her blue Citroen C3 was involved in a collision with a beige Vauxhall Astra at around 3.05pm on the A421 between junction 13 of the M1 and Milton Keynes.

The family of Mrs Jones have issued the following statement:

"We are absolutely heartbroken; we have lost the most caring and most generous mum and nanny in the world. She was the kindest and brightest light. She loved everyone, and she was dearly loved by everyone. We are completely lost without her."

She leaves behind two children and four grandchildren; three boys aged 12, eight and 11 months, and a girl aged four.

Enquiries into the incident are on-going and anyone with information is asked to call Sergeant Chris Smith on 101 quoting Operation Temperance.
