**We will begin a week of action on Monday (16 April) targeting speeding drivers across the county.**

Throughout the week, our Roads Policing Unit (RPU) will work alongside Speedwatch, a scheme supported by the Police and Crime Commissioner to give the public an opportunity to deter speeding drivers in their community.

Speedwatch volunteers use speed detection equipment at the roadside to monitor passing motorists at dangerous driving hotspots. Once a speeding driver has been detected, an advisory letter is sent by the scheme and the driver's details are passed on to the police.

Drivers who repeatedly speed through the area can expect a visit from a police officer.

Bedfordshire's Police and Crime Commissioner, Kathryn Holloway, said: "Speed is something we can all control and, by doing so, lives can be saved. It's an issue many residents in Bedfordshire are frustrated with, especially in rural areas where speeding causes the most deaths and serious injuries among young people on our roads.
