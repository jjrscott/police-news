**We are appealing for information following an attempted robbery in Luton on Saturday (27 January). **

At approximately 10.50pm, a man was walking along Wellington Street when he was approached by a man who threatened him with a knife and demanded money. The victim managed to run off.

The offender was described as a middle aged black male, of slim build, approximately 6ft tall and had dreadlocks. He was seen wearing a blue coat and grey tracksuit bottoms.

Detective Constable Jason Wheeler, investigating, said: "The victim was left shaken and I'm keen to hear from anybody who may have witnessed this incident. As part of our investigation we're currently reviewing CCTV footage from the immediate area, but I would urge anyone with information to come forward.

"I would like to reassure the public that we take reports of incidents involving knives incredibly seriously, and will work hard to apprehend offenders in each case. We are working hard to tackle a recent increase in knife crime in the county and this remains a priority for the force."

Please contact DC Wheeler on 101 quoting the crime number C/4281/18, or contact our online reporting tool.
