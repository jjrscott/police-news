### We are appealing for witnesses following a serious collision near the Dunstable Downs area of Kensworth on Friday (21 August).

At approximately 8.40pm the police were called to a serious single vehicle collision involving an orange Honda motorbike travelling north on Whipsnade Road in which a man in his 20s sustained serious injuries.

Emergency services attended and the road was temporarily closed. The man was transported to hospital where he remains in critical but stable condition.

Sergeant Timothy Davies, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit, said: "We believe that there were a number of people in the area at this time and we are keen to speak to anyone who may have witnessed the collision or saw the bike prior to the incident.

"We would also like to ask motorist to review their dashcam footage in case it may have captured the orange Honda motorbike from the time."

Anyone with information is asked to contact the police online or by calling 101 and quote the operational name Operation Whisper.
