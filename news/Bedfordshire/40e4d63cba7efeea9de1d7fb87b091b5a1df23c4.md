We are issuing a drugs warning to the public after a man was arrested and a batch of dangerous orange 'Donald Trump' pills were seized.

A man in his 30s from Luton has been arrested on suspicion of drugs supply offences after being found with a number of drugs, including MDMA tablets designed to look like Donald Trump.

Detective Sergeant Ryan Barnes, from Bedfordshire Police's Crime Investigation Team, said: "Criminals are constantly finding new ways to sell their drugs and make them more appealing.

"We have seen MDMA tablets created to look like a number of culturally popular items before and a recent example of this is the 'Donald Trumps'.

"The 'Donald Trumps' are dangerous tablets that contain extremely high levels of MDMA and could put anyone taking these in serious harm. If you come across these or any other type of drug, please do not take them for your own safety, as you can never be sure what these pills contain.

"We are dedicated to stamping this type of harmful criminality out across our county and protecting the most vulnerable from coming into harm's way."

Signs of a stimulant overdose can include:

 * Overheating
 * Dehydration
 * Rapid heart rate
 * Extreme agitation or disorientated and experiencing vivid hallucinations
 * Weird body sensations e.g pins and needles
 * Muscle tension and uncontrollable reflexes - this may present as being very rigid or jerking
 * Seizures

If you're in doubt, please get checked out.
