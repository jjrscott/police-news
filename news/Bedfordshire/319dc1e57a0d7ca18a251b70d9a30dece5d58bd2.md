**A property where concerns were raised around drugs and anti-social behaviour has been closed for three months.**

Officers from our rural community policing team executed a warrant at the address in Bilberry Road, Clifton on Thursday.

Once inside they uncovered suspected evidence of illegal drug taking.

On Friday Luton Magistrates' Court granted a full three month closure order on the address.

Central Bedfordshire Council's safeguarding team are now working with us to rehouse the tenant.

PC James Hunt said: "We acted swiftly after receiving a growing number and severity of reports about criminality in this location.

"The rapid turnaround from receiving intelligence from the community to closing the property is testament to our ability to work with partners in protecting those most at risk of harm within Bedfordshire.

"Our investigation into these issues is ongoing and we remain committed to stamping out this sort of behaviour in our community."

You can report concerns around drug activity and wider anti-social behaviour via 101 or the online reporting centre on the Bedfordshire Police website.

Alternatively you can contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
