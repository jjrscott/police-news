**We are appealing for information after a woman was racially abused in Luton last Sunday (20 May).**

At approximately 12.15pm, the woman was walking with her daughter in a buggy along High Town Road, when a man began shouting racial abuse at them and making threats of violence.

The offender is described as a black, aged 45 to 55 years, 5'9'' and slim. He had greying black hair and was wearing a dark grey hooded top, a grey round neck t-shirt with green and white writing and blue jeans. He also wore rimless glasses with round lenses and was carrying a blue plastic shopping bag.

PC Michael Gibbs said: "We are urging anyone who witnessed this incident to come forward. We do not tolerate racial abuse. This was a frightening and unacceptable incident which was extremely distressing for the victim.

"A member of the public assisted the woman following the incident, and we are also keen to speak with him."

Anyone with information is asked to contact us via the online reporting centre or by calling on 101 quoting reference number 367 of 20 May
