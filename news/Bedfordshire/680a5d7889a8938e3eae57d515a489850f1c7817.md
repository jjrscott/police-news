**Between approximately 1am and 1.30am police were called to a series of fires across Leighton Buzzard, that are believed to have been caused deliberately.**

The first fire was started outside the front of HSBC, High Street before a large bin was set alight at the back of Clarks shoe shop and Rosehill Pharmacy, High Street. The third fire was also a large bin fire at the side of the Dragon Inn restaurant, North Street. A fourth fire in a large skip was reported a short time after on Industrial Park, Cherry Court Way.

Police are treating all incidents as connected and would like to speak to anyone who may have seen or heard any suspicious activity in the area.

PC Leila Sadri-Hall, who is investigating, said: "These incidents clearly intended to cause damage. We are keen to speak to anyone who might have seen or heard any suspicious or unusual behaviour prior to the incidents taking place or who may have any information that could assist our investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact PC Sadri-Hall on 101 or visit the force's online reporting centre and quote reference number 40/19903/20.
