We will be opening recruitment for police officers on Friday (11 January), and applications will close on 3 February.

Anyone who is interested will need to complete an online application form, which will be live on 11 January. Following a paper sift, successful applicants will be invited to attend an Assessment Centre to complete various exercises, and those who pass at the Assessment Centre will be invited to interview.

We are hosting two information evenings - one on 10 January at police headquarters in Kempston, and one on January 17 at the Auction House in Luton. They are designed specifically for people who are interested in finding out more about joining the force.

Both events start at 6.30pm and will finish at about 9pm. In order to manage demand, we're asking that people register for a space - please email r.recruitment@bedfordshire.pnn.police.uk with your details to register your interest.
