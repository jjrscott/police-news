**The family of a man who died in a road traffic collision near Marston Moretaine on Christmas Eve (Thursday) have paid tribute to him. **

Paul Benson, 53, from Lidlington, died at the scene of a road traffic collision at around 7.30pm on Thursday (24 December), following a single vehicle collision on the eastbound carriageway of the A421.

Mr Benson's family issued a statement saying: "Paul was a much-loved partner to Avril, and a father to six wonderful children.

"Paul was a true legend who had a positive impact on everyone's lives, and he will be missed by all."

Sergeant Timothy Davies from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Roads Policing Unit said: "Our thoughts are with Mr Benson's family at this time.

"Our investigation into the circumstances continue, and we are keen to hear from anyone who may have been in the area at the time and witnessed the incident.

"If you think you saw the silver Ford Focus prior to the collision, or have any dash cam footage, then please get in touch."

Anyone with information should call police on 101 quoting Operation Linen or use the online reporting centre.
