**Our community policing team in Leighton Buzzard has launched the force 's first area-specific Facebook page, which will be run by the local team to provide information on matters specific to the town. **

The initiative aims to build on community engagement and communication between the policing team and the residents of Leighton Buzzard, and the team would like to invite all local people to join the page and keep up to date.

Sergeant Liam Mitchell said: "We are happy to announce the launch of the Leighton Buzzard Community Policing Facebook page. It's a first for the force and will be led by my local officers, who will be providing regular updates with that the team is up to.

"We would like to encourage people to talk to us about their concerns and ask questions about crime prevention and safety tips."

Please keep in mind that the community Facebook page is not monitored 24/7 and shouldn't be used to report crime. If you wish to report crime, visit the force's online reporting centre or call 101. In an emergency, always call 999.
