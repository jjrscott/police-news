**Detectives investigating a robbery are appealing for witnesses as part of their investigation.**

On Wednesday (6 February), a woman was waiting for a bus in St John's Street, Bedford. At some point between 6.20pm and 6.25pm, a man grabbed her bag from her shoulder, causing her to fall over, and ran away in the direction of London Road.

The offender is described as around 5' 7", of medium build, wearing jeans and a dark jacket with the hood up.

Detective Constable David Gordon, investigating, said: "The victim was understandably shaken and distressed following the incident. I am keen to speak to anyone who may have seen the robbery, or who was in the area at the time and saw a man running from St John's Street towards London Road.

"Any information, no matter how small, will help our investigation."

Anyone with any information is asked to call 101 quoting reference number 40/7525/19.

Alternatively report information through the force's online reporting centre at www.bedfordshire.police.uk/report.

You can also call independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
