A closure order on the property in Ivel Way, Flitwick, was obtained following partnership working between the force, Central Bedfordshire Council's Anti-Social Behaviour officers and Grand Union Housing.

PC Aaron Dagley said: "Drug-dealing and general nuisance from this property had blighted the area and the lives of people living nearby. We and our partners regard these situations as a priority and it was great to see active partnership between these agencies to disrupt drug-dealing."

The closure order prevents anyone from attending the property for a period of three months, under the Anti-Social Behaviour Crime and Policing Act 2014.
