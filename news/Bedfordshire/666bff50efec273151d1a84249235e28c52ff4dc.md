We are appealing for information after a man tried to rob a woman in Popes Meadow, Old Bedford Road, Luton, on Friday 29 September.

Between 1pm and 1.30pm, a man approached a woman who was walking on her own and demanded money, bank cards and her phone. When she refused, he threatened her with a knife.

Thankfully another man approached to help and gave the offender his mobile phone instead. The offender then demanded further property from the lady, before running towards Havelock Road.

The offender is described as a white man with a ginger beard and ginger hair, around 20 years old and between 5' 9" and 5' 10" and wearing a dark hooded top.

Officers are also keen to speak to the Good Samaritan, who is described as a white man in his 20s.

Anyone with any information is asked to call 101 quoting C/41930/17. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously 0800 555 111.
