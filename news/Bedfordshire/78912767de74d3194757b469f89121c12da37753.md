**Following the success of previous events, we are once again inviting members of the public to join us for a community engagement event, on Sunday, 14 October, to see how the force 's Contact Centre operates.**

At the event, officers and staff will be on hand to discuss how the Contact Centre works, from answering calls to directing police resources in the most effective way.

Visitors will be able to test out some of the equipment the team uses, and see inside the main call centre via a video link.

The Contact Centre, known within the force as the 'FCC', is where many of the first contact services live, including call handlers, customer services, crime bureau and the Oscars - the people who make the strategic decisions when police are responding to an incident.

The event will take place between 10am-12pm on Sunday, 14 October and is suitable for adults and children.

Places are limited, so if you are interested, please reserve your place as soon as possible by contacting the customer services team at customer.services@bedfordshire.pnn.police.uk
