**Bedfordshire Police, in partnership with Luton Borough Council and The Mall, is opening a joint base from which to tackle issues in the shopping mall Luton town centre.**

From tomorrow (6 December), new Community Safety Accreditation Scheme (CSAS) officers from The Mall will work with the force from the new Community Safety Office located in the shopping centre. During the opening event, the partnership will carry out an accreditation ceremony for eight CSAS officers from the Mall and five from Luton Borough Council.

A year ago Bedfordshire Police launched the CSAS scheme to give more powers to local authority officers and boost the uniformed presence on the streets of the county. It aims to accredit local authority employees with powers similar to those held by Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs). The Mall is the first private business whose employees will receive the accreditation.

Bedfordshire Police Community Chief Inspector Hob Hoque said: "We are dedicated to serving our community and tackling the issues that matter the most to our residents. Thanks to this scheme the force, in co-operation with our partners from Luton Borough Council and The Mall, will be able to tackle issues like street drinking, begging and other forms of anti-social behaviour more efficiently."

Laura McCluskey, Deputy General Manager at The Mall Luton, said: "As a community shopping centre our priority is to provide a safe and welcoming environment for our customers, tenants and staff. We are delighted to be involved as this scheme will give our team the tools and skills to further contribute to reducing crime and anti-social behaviour, through improved local partnership working and information sharing."

Cllr Aslam Khan, Executive Member for Community Safety at Luton Borough Council, said: "A key objective of the Luton Investment Framework is ensuring that Luton's town centre is safe and vibrant, and the work that has been carried out since the CSAS began a year ago is helping to achieve this."

"Working with our partners through the scheme means we can more effectively tackle anti-social behaviour issues that take place in the town making it a more attractive place for residents and visitors."
