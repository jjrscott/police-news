**We are asking for anyone who witnessed a stabbing in Bedford on Saturday (6 January) to come forward.**

At around 6.15pm on London Road, at the junction with Faldo Road, the force received reports that a man had been stabbed after he was approached by a group of men on bicycles.

Detective Constable Olyver Tomlinson said: "We take all reports of knife crime extremely seriously; this sort of crime will absolutely not be tolerated in Bedfordshire. We will be doing our utmost to find those responsible and bring them to justice.

"This incident happened at a busy time and people in the area may have seen something that could help our investigation. If you saw anything, or you have any information about who is responsible, I would urge you to come forward."

Anyone with any information is asked to call 101 quoting crime reference number JH/818/2018. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
