Officers investigating a serious assault in Barton-le-Clay are appealing for information from passers-by.

At around 5pm on Wednesday (13 November), a man was pushed to the floor by an offender in Sharpenhoe Road. The victim's face was then cut with an unknown weapon.

The offender got into a car and left the scene, while the victim sought help in a nearby Chinese restaurant.

DC Tracey Joyce, investigating, said: "This was a shocking incident which we believe to be targeted. The brazen attack took place at rush hour, so I would appeal for anyone who was in the area and saw anything suspicious, or who could have recorded dash cam footage from the scene while driving past, to come forward."

Anyone with information is urged to contact DC Joyce on 101 quoting the reference 40/65750/19, or use our online reporting tool at http://www.bedfordshire.police.uk/report/Report. You can also contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
