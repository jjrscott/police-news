**We are investigating after a car was shot at in the Whipperley Ring area of Luton on Friday night (17 April).**

At around 11.15pm, a man was sat in the rear passenger seat of a Toyota Yaris, when another car, believed to be a silver Audi, was driven alongside it and a shot was fired towards the other car, hitting the passenger through the window.

The victim took himself to hospital, but his injuries are not life threatening or life changing.

Detective Sergeant Bill Rumford, from our Crime Investigation Team, said: "We are appealing for anyone who has any information about this incident to come forward so we can track down the people responsible.

"We are currently treating this as an isolated incident with no risk to the wider public, and would reassure the community that we are thoroughly investigating this offence. I would urge anyone with information to get in touch so we can follow all lines of enquiry.

"Tackling gun crime is a key priority for the force and we take all firearms offences incredibly seriously.

"Offenders linked to organised crime in Bedfordshire were jailed for more than 300 years last year, while the force destroyed just under 400 firearms which had been taken off the streets."

If you have any information about this incident please call DS Rumford on 101, quoting 40/21454/20, report online at www.bedfordshire.police.uk/report or alternatively call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
