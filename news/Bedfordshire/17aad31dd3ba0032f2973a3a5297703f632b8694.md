Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman in her 70s was robbed while out walking for the first time in three months due to the coronavirus lockdown.

On Wednesday (1 July) at around 7.50am the victim was walking her dog in a wooded walkway which divides Henge Way and Spinney Road in Luton.

The woman was approached by a man on a bike who punched her and pushed her to the ground before making off with her handbag.

The man is described as black, of medium build and approximately 5'6''. He was wearing a navy blue hoody with the hood up and tied around his face. His bike is described as being a dark colour.

PC Jodie Dimmock, who is investigating the incident, said: "This is a terrifying incident for the elderly victim and I would urge anyone who saw the incident or anyone acting suspiciously in the area before or after it took place to contact us.

"This was the first time this lady had been out of the house for three months as she had been shielding during lockdown.

"Any information could assist with our investigation. We need to your help to get justice for this victim and catch those responsible."

If you have any information, please visit Bedfordshire Police's online reporting centre or call 101, quoting reference number 40/35217/20.
