**Officers from the Luton Community team carried out a three day operation targeting urban street gangs and related drug dealing.**

Operation Malting ran for three nights between Tuesday (5 February) and Thursday. This community policing operation aimed to target gang members in Luton town centre and the surrounding areas.

During the operation officers carried out a number of stop searches and arrested four people for various offences, including possession of a firearm and possession with intent to supply Class A drugs.

Sergeant Jamie Harrison, who led the operation, said: "Keeping our residents safe is our biggest priority and we will continue to carry out this operation in the future.

"My team worked extremely hard to identify gang members and crack down on the gang crime in our town. Thanks to their commitment, a quantity of drugs and weapons have been taken off the street and they can no longer pose a threat to our communities."

Anyone with information about drug dealing and other criminality can report it online or by calling 101.

In case of emergency always call 999.
