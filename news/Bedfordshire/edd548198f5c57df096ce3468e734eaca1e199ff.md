**There has been a decline in nuisance anti-social behaviour (ASB) across Ampthill and Flitwick following warning notices being handed out by us to the parents of the youths involved .**

Officers visited the parents and guardians in January to engage with them and hand out the notices, as part of an intervention to encourage them to take action to prevent their child's continued involvement in the problems.

A large number of youths had been damaging property, littering, being abusive and intimidating to members of the public, which was causing a major nuisance to residents.

PC Aaron Dagley, of the North Rural Community Team, said: "We are really pleased with the results after seeing a vast decline in ASB across the towns during the last six weeks.

"We took the step to involve the parents and guardians of the young people regularly associating within a group identified as being responsible for this behaviour, as they needed to understand it's their responsibility to know what their children are up to when they leave the house and the onus is on them to take action.

"We have been working closely with Central Bedfordshire Council and the Multi Agency Safeguarding Hub to tackle ASB in the area and will deal with offending robustly where evidence is present. By putting intervention measures into place, it is a chance to try and prevent more serious offending down the line.

"It's good to see parents and guardians took the issues seriously, as following the warning if there continued to be an unreasonable, persistent and detrimental impact on the quality of life of the community by the youths, we would have had to have taken further action against the parents, guardians or individuals."
