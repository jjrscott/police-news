### Detectives from our force are appealing for witnesses after a teenager was stabbed in the early hours of this morning (Tuesday).

At approximately 1.50am, police were called to a report that a 17-year-old boy had been stabbed to the head following an altercation with a man in Shakespeare Road, Bedford.

The victim was taken to hospital and his injuries are not believed to be life threatening or life changing.

Detective Constable Lindsey Cook, investigating, said: "Luckily, the victim is not seriously wounded, but we will never tolerate knife crime in our county and are determined to find out who is responsible.

"We are working to establish the circumstances of this incident and are following up several lines of enquiry.

"We would also like to hear from anyone who may have been in the area at that time and has any dash cam footage or information, which could help us establish who the offender is."

Anyone with information can contact police through the force's online reporting centre or by calling 101, quoting reference number 13 of 29 December.

Alternatively, you call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
