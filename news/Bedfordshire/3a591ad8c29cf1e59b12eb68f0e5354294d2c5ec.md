**We are investigating a robbery in Asda in Biggleswade yesterday (22 August) and we are appealing for witnesses to come forward.**

At around 8.12pm two offenders entered Asda in Church Street. They approached the cigarettes kiosk and took a large amount of cigarettes worth approximately Â£5,000.

When leaving, the men threatened a member of staff before driving off in a blue YN registered BMW Estate, but the number plates are believed to be cloned.

The offenders are described as both wearing hooded jackets and masks and are approximately 5'10''. A third man was seen driving the vehicle.

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to visit the force's online reporting centre or call Bedfordshire Police on 101 quoting reference number 40/20064/18.

Alternatively you can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
