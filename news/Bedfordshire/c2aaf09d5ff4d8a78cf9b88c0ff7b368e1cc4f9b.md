**"Burglary is a priority for our force and we have officers dedicated to tackling this type of crime as we know the impact it can have on victims.**

"While our detection rate is lower than we would like, it is worth noting that we did solve 279 offences in the 12 months to April 2018. We are also working hard to identify and manage those prolific offenders who cause us the most harm, with a focus on prevention.

"However, it is important to look at our ability to investigate burglary in the wider context of pressures we face in Bedfordshire. We are funded as a rural force yet face complex challenges usually seen in large metropolitan areas, so have limited resources and are currently facing unprecedented demand. We received 612 calls for service on one day earlier this month - which was 50 per cent more than we took on New Year's Eve which is traditionally the busiest day of the year. We are also experiencing increases in other offences such as knife crime, which has risen nationally.

"Responding to that demand puts an incredible strain on our ability to investigate crime. The stark reality is that we have to make difficult decisions every day regarding which incidents we can respond to and which cases we dedicate resources to investigate. Every incident is assessed on the threat harm and risk it poses in order that we keep people safe.

"In simple terms, if we had more resources to deal with the demand we are facing we would be better placed to do more to tackle burglary."
