### Detectives from our force are appealing for information after a newsagent in Flitwick was broken into in the early hours of this morning (Tuesday).

Police were called just before 2am to reports that a newsagent in Station Square had been broken into.

The offenders, believed to be two men, entered the shop by forcing the door off its hinges, conducted a search behind the counter and made off with a number of cigarettes.

One of the offenders is believed to be a white man and was wearing a black jacket. A balaclava was found at the scene.

Detective Inspector Ian Holden from the force's Crime Investigation Team, said: "This was a planned and targeted break in and the offenders managed to get away with cigarettes.

"We are currently investigating a number of lines of enquiry, but are appealing for anyone who has any information or who was in the area at the time of the break-in to come forward."

Anyone with information can get in touch via the online reporting centre or webchat, or by calling DI Holden on 101 quoting reference 40/57055/20.
