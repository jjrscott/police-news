**We are investigating two incidents where teenage victims were threatened with a knife in Bedford on Wednesday (26 June) and are appealing for information.**

Between 4.50pm and 5pm a 14-year-old boy was threatened by a man with a knife as he withdrew money from a Natwest cashpoint in High Street, Bedford. The offender made off with the cash. He matched a similar description, wearing similar clothing and was thought to be around 5'9", had a gold tooth and had one of his front teeth missing.

Around an hour later, two boys were walking along Rothsay Gardens towards Goldington Road when they were approach by a man in his 30s who produced a knife and demanded they hand over their personal belongings. The victims managed to flee the scene without the man taking anything. The offender was described as bald, with a beard and was wearing baggy jeans and a hooded top.

Detective Sergeant Simon Hancock, from the force's serious and complex crime team, said: "We are treating these incidents as linked and believe the offender has deliberately targeted young victims."

Anyone with information or who witnessed the incidents is asked to contact DS Hancock on 101 or submit information online via www.bedfordshire.police.uk/report.

Alternatively contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
