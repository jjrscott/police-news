We are appealing for information after a man was assaulted in Luton.

A man was approached in Wellington Street, yesterday (Tuesday) at around 5am, by a man demanding money.

When the victim said no, he was attacked with a weapon and left with serious, but not life changing injuries.

The offender was described as a tall black man and was believed to have been carrying a baseball bat.

Detective Constable Gary Hatton said: "This was a terrifying incident for the victim involved. We do not tolerate violence in our county and we are looking for anyone who witnessed the incident or noticed any suspicious behaviour in the area to come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to please contact 101 or report online at www.bedfordshire.police.uk/report quoting reference 40/8747/20. Alternatively you can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
