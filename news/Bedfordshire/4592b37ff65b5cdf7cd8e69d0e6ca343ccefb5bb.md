**A man currently serving a prison sentence for rape has now been found guilty of the rape of a 15-year-old boy in 1995.**

James Devlin, 55, was convicted today (Monday), following a six-day trial at Luton Crown Court, for the rape in Shortstown, near Bedford, after DNA evidence from an unsolved case investigation was matched to him.

On Monday 16 October 1995, at around 3.15pm, Devlin approached his victim as he waited at a bus stop. He asked the boy if he had the correct time, and then asked for help to get his car started. The boy agreed and followed Devlin to where he said the car was located.

Once the pair had passed through a hedge, Devlin proceeded to assault the victim and rape him.

Forensic evidence recovered during the original investigation did not match with an offender, but a case review more than 20 years later led to a match with Devlin.

Devlin is already serving a prison sentence for the rape of a 16-year-old boy in 1996, but this new conviction will ensure he remains in prison.

Devlin will be sentenced at a later date.

The investigation was part of Operation Painter which began in 2016, and has so far led to the review of more than 1,600 serious sexual assault cases.

Detective Chief Inspector Alan Page, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, which is investigating these unsolved cases, said: "Devlin is an evil individual who targets the young and vulnerable in our society.

"Prison is where he needs to be, both to pay for his criminality and protect other individuals from his abhorrent offending.

"His victim has shown extraordinary bravery in assisting the police, both back in 1995 and during this reinvestigation.

"I am so thankful that we have managed to solve this despicable crime and bring Devlin to justice, ensuring he remains where he should be; in prison.

After the verdict, Devlin's victim said: "As time went by I never thought this day would come, but it is just such a relief that the offender has now been caught.

"I want to thank the investigation team for finally bringing Devlin to justice. I am so grateful that advances in science have made this possible."

Detective Chief Superintendent Mark Lay of Bedfordshire Police, the officer in charge of Operation Painter, said: "We cannot underestimate the gravity of this particular case, and the horrific ordeal that Devlin inflicted on his young victim which has gone unpunished for so long.

"This is the fourth successful conviction under Operation Painter. It is with thanks to the advancements in forensic science that we can now review cases dating back decades.

"This verdict further proves the importance of our work in revisiting past cases in order to bring evil predators to justice, and finally deliver a form of closure for their victims."
