**We are appealing for witnesses after a man suffered multiple stab wounds during an attack in Luton.**

Officers were called at around 8.45pm on Monday (16 July) to reports of a stabbing in Ravenhill Way.

A man suffered serious but non-life threatening injuries and was taken to hospital for treatment.

The attackers are described as a large group of men, some of who were wearing balaclavas.

Detective Inspector Andy Southam, investigating, said: "We would like to speak to anyone who has information about this attack, or a group who were seen on bikes riding around the Lewsey Farm area prior to the incident.

"We are determined to catch those responsible and I would urge people to help us with our enquiries."

Anyone with any information can report it using our online reporting centre or contact police on 101, quoting reference number 469 of 16 July.

Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
