**The family of a woman killed in a collision in Kempston on Thursday (16 August) have paid tribute to her.**

Ida Saralli, 73, from Kempston, died after being involved in a collision with a car in Bedford Road at around 7pm.

Her family said in a statement: "Ida was a greatly loved mum, grandmother, aunt and sister who was loved and respected in the Kempston community, as well as the wider Italian community around Bedford.

"We as a family have been devastated by her loss, and would ask people to respect our privacy at this time."

Sergeant James Thorne, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Roads Policing Unit, said: "Our thoughts are with Mrs Saralli's family at this tragic time. Anyone who witnessed the collision is asked to contact us so we can further establish what happened."

The driver of the car was spoken to at the scene but has not been arrested and enquiries are ongoing.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting Operation Folly.
