We are appealing for witnesses following an incident in Bedford which is believed to be racially motivated.

On Sunday (5 November) at approximately 1.25pm, a woman was using the ATM outside McColls in Allhallows, Bedford when a man sat outside the store began to verbally abuse her.

The man is described as a white, stocky, in his 30's, with ginger hair, and was wearing a woolly hat.

Anyone with any information is asked to call 101 quoting reference JH/47933/2017. Alternatively you can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

If you or someone close to you has been affected by hate crime report it to True Vision online at report-it.org.uk. You can also use the Third Party Reporting centres which can be found on the Bedfordshire Police website. Don't ever suffer in silence.
