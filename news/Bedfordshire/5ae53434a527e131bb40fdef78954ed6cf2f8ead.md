**Four men have been arrested after a firearms warrant was carried out by Specialist Crime officers from the Metropolitan Police in partnership with ourselves.**

A 38-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession of a firearm with intent in Bute Street, in Luton town centre, shortly after 5pm yesterday (Thursday).

Following further searches at a property in Cheapside, Luton, 10 firearms were recovered as well as ammunition and a quantity of Class A drugs.

A 23-year-old man and two 18-year-old men were all arrested in a vehicle nearby a short time later.

The 23 year-old was arrested on suspicion of possession of a firearm and possession with intent to supply class A drugs.

Two 18-year-old men were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A and possession with intent to supply drugs other than class A.

They have all been taken into custody at police stations in Bedfordshire while enquiries continue.

Community officers will be carrying out high visibility patrols in the area today to provide reassurance.
