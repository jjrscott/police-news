### We are appealing for witnesses after a man was attacked in Luton.

On Saturday (15 August), a man approached a victim in Barker Road at 8.20pm and a fight broke out.

Shortly after a silver Audi, which was believed to have three passengers, was driven at the victim, causing serious injuries.

The men got out of the car, holding what were described as baseball bats, and the victim ran off. They were described as Asian men.

Detective Sergeant Ryan Barnes said: "We are appealing for anyone who may have witnessed this incident to come forward, or anyone who may have seen the silver car in the area at the time.

"We do not tolerate this kind of behaviour in our county and we are determined to find those responsible."

Anyone with any information is asked to report online via our website or call 101, quoting reference number 40/44342/20.

Alternatively, you can call independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
