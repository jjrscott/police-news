Twelve new volunteers have joined Bedfordshire's Independent Advisory Groups (IAGs), after a campaign to recruit more members was launched earlier this year.

Bedfordshire has two IAGs, one in the north of the county and one in the south, which provide independent advice to Bedfordshire Police and ensure the force is providing the best possible service to the communities it serves. The panels hold quarterly meetings and ensure that all services, policies, procedures and practices are free from any kind of discrimination.

The IAGs now have 29 members who will be provided with ongoing training and have been vetted to the approved standard. They are all volunteer members of the public from different walks of life and include health care professionals, support workers and councillors.

Chief Inspector Hob Hoque said: "The IAGs are vital to the force, and are our 'critical friends' who give opinions and share knowledge from an independent viewpoint to assist with the smooth running of incidents which may impact on the community. Working in partnership with the IAGs allows us to continue to build positive relationships and confidence in our communities, and we're pleased to welcome the new members to the group. They bring a wealth of experience and knowledge to the force which places us in great stead for the future."
