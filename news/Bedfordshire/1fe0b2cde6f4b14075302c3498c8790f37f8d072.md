**We are appealing for witnesses after a man was left with serious injuries following a stabbing in Luton yesterday (Monday).**

The incident took place at around 3.15pm in Vestry Close. A man in his 20s received multiple stab wounds and was airlifted to hospital. He is now in a stable condition.

The three male suspects are described as black, wearing black clothing, with their hoods up.

Detective Inspector Grant Maxted, who is leading the investigation, said: "This was a very nasty attack in what we believe to be an isolated incident.

"We are appealing for anyone who saw anything to get in contact. It was the middle of the afternoon so we are confident someone must have seen something or a group of men acting suspiciously prior to the incident.

"We really need your help in trying to catch the perpetrators, as we will not tolerate this kind of violence in our county."

Anyone with information can contact 101, or report online at www.bedfordshire.police.uk/report, quoting reference 40/25597/20.

Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
