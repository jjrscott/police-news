**A man from Luton has been sentenced to three years and six months behind bars for burglary after leaving his blood at the scene.**

Navid Nazir, 38, of Frederick Street, Luton, was sentenced yesterday (Tuesday) at Luton Crown court after pleading guilty to burglary of a dwelling.

Nazir forced entry into a property in Moor Path, Luton, on Thursday 6 June, where he stole Â£800 and jewellery.

He was linked to the offence after the scenes of crime officer noticed a small spot of blood next to the point of entry.

Detective Constable Jason Wheeler, investigating, said: "I am pleased another burglar is off of the streets in Bedfordshire. "Nazir has been sentenced to a lengthy time behind bars and I hope that he spends his time reflecting on his actions and the impact they have had on the victim.

"Burglary is a key priority for the force and our dedicated unit dealing with burglary offences, Operation Maze, is targeting those individuals who think this brazen behaviour in Bedfordshire is acceptable."
