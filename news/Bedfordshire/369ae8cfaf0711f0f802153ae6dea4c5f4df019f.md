**A man who was found dead in Luton on Christmas Day has been named.**

Monty Chitta, 55, of St Winifreds Avenue, Luton, was found in Cardigan Street at around 7.20am on Wednesday (25 December).

Detective Inspector Janine Graham: "Our thoughts are with Mr Chitta's family and friends at such a difficult time.

"We are continuing to investigate events surrounding his death and piece together his movements throughout the evening.

"We are making really good progress with this and pursuing a number of lines of enquiry, but we would still like to hear from anyone who came across Mr Chitta in the hours prior to his death.

"We would especially like to hear from anyone who was in the Cardigan Street area, particularly if they have CCTV or dash cam footage we are not yet aware of."

A post mortem is due to take place tomorrow (Tuesday). The death is still being treated as unexplained.
