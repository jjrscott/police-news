**The new enquiry office and community hub at Lime Street in Bedford was officially opened yesterday (Wednesday).**

The enquiry office, which replaces the former unit at Greyfriars Police Station, will be open to the public Monday-Friday between 9am and 5pm and will also be the base for the force's community north urban team.

The move to Lime Street is the latest initiative to increase accessibility to the force in the town centre and to provide the most effective service.

Deputy Chief Constable Garry Forsyth said: "We are delighted the new enquiry office at Lime Street is now open; it marks the latest step in moving force forward to best serve the local community.

"Community policing is at the very heart of what is important to us. The officers and staff based at the new office will be dealing with the real concerns of the local community and those in the town centre, right where it matters most.

Inspector Paul Ayling, from the force's community north urban policing team, said: "Lime Street is a hugely convenient location, for both ourselves and people wanting to speak to us, and we look forward to working with the local community and those visiting the town centre.

"The new office will allow us to best respond to the issues that impact the town centre, right at the heart of things."
