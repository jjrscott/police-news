**We are appealing for witnesses after receiving reports that a man was robbed in Pages Park, Leighton Buzzard on Thursday 11 January.**

At around 6pm the man was walking along Stanbridge Road. As he approached an alleyway leading to Richmond Road, a dark coloured Vauxhall Corsa pulled up alongside him and five white men in the car began to verbally abuse him. As the victim entered Pages Park, the men got out of the car and assaulted him, taking his wallet and his mobile phone before leaving him in the park.

We're now keen to speak to anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in Pages Park that evening.

Anyone with any information about this incident is asked to call DS Hamm on 101 quoting reference number JD/1684/2018.

You can also report information online.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
