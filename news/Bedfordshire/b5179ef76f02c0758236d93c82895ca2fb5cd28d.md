### We are appealing for information after a man was attacked in Luton in the early hours of this morning.

Police were called by the Ambulance Service at around 6.40am today (Tuesday) after a man was found with a head wound in Adelaide Street, Luton.

The victim had been struck about the head in the early hours with an implement, believed to be a hammer.

The offender is described as a white man, who made off from the scene in an unknown direction.

The victim's injuries required hospital attention, but are not life threatening or life changing.

Detective Constable Gary Hatton said: "A man was attacked, and sustained a nasty head injury between midnight and 6.40am, when he was found.

"We would very much like to speak to anyone who witnessed this incident, or noticed any suspicious behaviour in the area, to come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact DC Hatton on 101 or report online quoting reference 58 of today.

Alternatively, you can contact independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555111.
