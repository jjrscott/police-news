**Officers are appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Limbury Park, Luton on Saturday, 3 November.**

At approximately 3.50pm two teenage boys were walking by the bridge near the river when they were approached by three men who demanded they hand over their phones. The boys were told they'd be assaulted if they did not hand over their belongings.

The offenders made off with phones, bluetooth speakers and cash. They are described as black, and were wearing black tracksuits and black Puffa jackets.

Detective Constable Mandy Godfree, investigating, said: "This incident happened in broad daylight and we are keen to speak to anyone who may have witnessed it or seen anything suspicious in the area at the time.

"The park is very popular with dog walkers and we would urge anyone to come forward with information."

Anyone with information is asked to visit Bedfordshire Police online reporting centre or call 101 and quote reference number 40/35219/18.
