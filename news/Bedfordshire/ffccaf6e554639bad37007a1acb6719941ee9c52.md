**A free workshop on stop and search powers is being held in Luton.**

The event, which is being run by Att10tive Social Enterprise, will educate residents and community groups about the tactic as well as the police's wider role in protecting the public.

When used correctly stop and search can help officers tackle priority crimes, as well as confirm or allay suspicions that someone may be carrying illegal items.

To attend the workshop, titled Understanding Stop & Search, email att10tive@gmail.com

You will then be sent an online poll to select whether you can attend the workshop on either 3, 4, 10 or 11 July.
