**Police across Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire (BCH) will be targeting speeding drivers in a two-week crackdown across the three counties.**

The campaign will see officers from the BCH Road Policing Unit (RPU) will dedicate all available patrols, which are not responding to emergency calls, to enforce safe speeds in known problem areas.

The campaign, which starts today (Monday), will also look to raise awareness of the potentially fatal consequences of driving at an inappropriate or illegal speed through an online campaign.

BCH RPU Sergeant Ian Manley said: "We have established a list of collision hotspots which we will focus on in an attempt to reduce the number of people killed and seriously injured on our roads.

"Year after year we deliver the same messages to slow down, in the hope that one day we won't have to deliver heart-breaking news to families."

The list of areas to be targeted includes:

 * Cemetery Road, Kempston
 * London Road, Luton
 * A507, Clifton
 * Queens Drive, Bedford
 * New Road, Great Barford
 * A603 Sandy Road, Willington
 * A1 Northbound, Sandy
 * A1 Northbound, Beeston
 * Whitehorse Vale, Luton
 * Sharpenhoe Road, Barton Le Clay

Another of the planned tools to be utilised in the campaign is the unmarked HGV tractor unit, which will operate throughout BCH during the campaign.

Sgt Manley said: "Speeding is proven to be one of the leading causes of collisions so we will continue to do all we can to prevent offences where possible and prosecute those who choose to speed."

The campaign will support the Europe-wide TISPOL campaign, which aims to reduce road traffic fatalities.
