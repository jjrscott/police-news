We are appealing for witnesses after a road traffic collision in Eggington this morning (Friday).

At approximately 7am a black Ford Fiesta and red Vauxhall Astra collided on Leighton Road near the junction with Mill Road.

The road was temporarily closed whilst the emergency services attended the scene. One woman was taken to hospital with injuries, where she remains in a stable condition.

Sergeant Timothy Davies, of the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Roads Policing Unit, said: "We are investigating the circumstances of the collision and are asking for anyone with information, and in particular dash cam footage, to get in touch to help us establish what happened."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Bedfordshire Police via the force's website, or call 101 quoting CAD 54 of today.
