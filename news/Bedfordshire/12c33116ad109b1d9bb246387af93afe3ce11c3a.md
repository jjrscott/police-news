Detective Constable Richard Marshall, investigating, said: "The car and the caravan have been destroyed and we're keen to find out why this happened, and who is responsible. I'd urge anyone who has information to come forward, as they may be able to help our investigation."

Anyone with any information is asked to call 101 quoting reference number 40/39972/18, or use our online reporting tool
