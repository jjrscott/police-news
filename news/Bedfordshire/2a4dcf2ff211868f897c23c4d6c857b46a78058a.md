**Two brothers from Luton have been jailed for a total of 20 months for taking a car without permission and driving dangerously through Luton.**

Lee Docherty, 45, of Dunstable Road, was sentenced to one year in prison, while Jamie Docherty, 42, also of Dunstable Road, was sentenced to eight months at an appearance at Luton Crown Court on Wednesday, after pleading guilty to aggravated vehicle taking.

On 15 November last year, between 10pm and 5am, the two men gained entry to a house on Rylands Heath and stole the keys of the occupant's Renault Captor, which was outside on the driveway.

The following evening, our officers were out on patrol in an unmarked police car when they saw the stolen Renault Captur on Dunstable Road. It proceeded to stop at traffic lights at the junction of Beechwood Road and Roman Road, but when officers attempted to get the driver's attention, he drove up onto the pavement, rammed the police car and drove away, hitting another car in the process.

Our officers in the unmarked police car attempted to block the stolen car, which resulted in extensive damage to the passenger door of the unmarked police vehicle. A marked police car that had been called to assist was able to pursue the Renault Captur through Luton until it collided with another car.

Lee Docherty, the driver, and Jamie Docherty, the passenger, were both arrested at the scene.
