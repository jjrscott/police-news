**Police are appealing for witnesses after a teenager was stabbed in Luton yesterday (Thursday).**

At approximately 1.15pm police were called to reports that a boy had been injured following an altercation in Enterprise Way.

Emergency services attended and he was taken to hospital with serious but non-life-threatening injuries.

An investigation has been launched and officers are appealing for help in tracing those responsible.

Detective Inspector Grant Maxted said: "This incident happened in broad daylight and it is only by pure chance that the victim's injuries were not more serious. I'm appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the incident, or who may have information about those involved, to get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101 quoting reference number 200 from 11 July. You can also give information online by visiting www.bedfordshire.police.uk/report or by calling independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
