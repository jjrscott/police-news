**We are appealing for witnesses after a man was stabbed in Luton on Saturday night (15 December). **

At around 11.50pm, a man was approached by three people wearing masks on Upwell Road.

Two of them surrounded the victim and he was stabbed in the lower stomach/back with a knife. The third brandished another knife and then all three made off in the direction of Yeovil Road.

Detective Constable Hasan Balic, investigating, said: "We would like to hear from anyone who was in the area at that time and has any information to help us establish who these people are.

"This was a traumatic incident for the victim, who has significant injuries and is currently in hospital in a critical condition. We do not tolerate knife crime in our county and are determined to find those responsible."

Anyone with information can contact police through the force's online reporting centre or by calling 101, quoting incident 40/44385/18.

Alternatively, you call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
