We are appealing for information following an aggravated robbery in Bedford.

Yesterday (Wednesday) at around 8.15pm, a food delivery driver was in Carrick Road, when he was approached by two men who threatened him with a knife.

The victim was assaulted and his car was damaged, before the two men made off with a takeaway and around Â£300 in cash.

Both men were described as wearing dark coloured hooded jumpers, dark coloured trousers and white trainers. One of the men was wearing a white t-shirt underneath his jumper and the other had a black item covering the lower part of his face.

PC Shauna Brown, investigating, said: "This incident has left the victim and colleagues very shaken and we are keen to catch those responsible.

"We would like to speak to anyone who might have witnessed this incident or has any video doorbell footage or CCTV in the area."

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to contact Bedfordshire Police online or by calling 101, quoting reference number 40/10679/21.

Alternatively, you can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
