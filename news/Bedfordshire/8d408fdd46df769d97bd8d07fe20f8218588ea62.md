We are appealing for witnesses, following a serious road traffic collision involving two vehicles, on the A507 near to Clophill on Friday 31 January.

The incident took place past Beadlow Manor, towards the A6, at around 9.30pm, and involved a black Vauxhall Corsa and a blue Mercedes. The driver of the Corsa remains in a stable, but critical condition.

PC Christopher Dougherty, investigating, said: "We are trying to work out the circumstances surrounding the collision and ask anyone who witnessed it to come forward, or anyone with any dash cam footage to share it with us.

"We understand it's happened just over a week ago, but there were a lot of vehicles on the road at the time, and we know there must be people out there who saw something.

"We'd also like to speak to anyone who saw the Corsa being driven prior to the incident."

Anyone with any information please contact 101, or report online at www.bedfordshire.police.uk/report, quoting reference 492 of 31 January.
