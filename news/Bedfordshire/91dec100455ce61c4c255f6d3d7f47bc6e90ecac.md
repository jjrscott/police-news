**We** **are appealing for witnesses after the attempted robbery of a teenage schoolgirl.**

The victim was walking along a pathway from Links Way towards Kelling Close, Luton on Tuesday (25 June).

At around 7.50am she was approached by the suspect.

The man threatened her with a knife and demanded that she hand over her phone.

A man who was walking a dog in the area at the time then appears to have scared the offender off.

The suspect is described as black or mixed race, of stocky build and in his late 30s.

He was 6', bald and wearing a black jacket. His ear was pierced and he had a cross tattooed on the right hand side of his neck.

Detective Constable Tracey Joyce, investigating, said: "It is extremely concerning that someone has targeted a young girl who was walking on their own.

"If anyone was in the area at the time or has any other information that can help with our enquiries, please get in contact with us.

"I would be particularly keen to trace the dog walker to see if they have any further information which could help us track down the man responsible."

Anyone with any information is asked to contact police on 101 or visit the online reporting centre on our website, quoting reference 40/36139/19.

You can also contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
