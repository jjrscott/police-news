A property in Elgar Path, Luton, has been served with a three month closure notice following a police warrant.

Our officers executed the warrant in the early hours of Friday morning (20 October), after receiving reports suggesting that property was being used as a base for drug dealing.

Following the warrant, officers issued a 24 hour closure notice which was then extended to three months during a hearing at Luton Magistrates' Court on Saturday (21 October).

Sergeant Sam Hunt said: "My team and I are dedicated to tackling criminal and anti-social behaviour in our county, and we are continuing to work with our partner agencies to tackle issues in Luton.

"We would like to encourage people to come forward to report issues, or things they are concerned about, in their neighbourhoods. We take all calls seriously as they allow us build a better intelligence picture, which leads to successful warrants like this one."

If you witness any suspicious activity in your neighbourhood please call Bedfordshire Police on 101. In case of emergency or if the crime is still in progress always call 999.
