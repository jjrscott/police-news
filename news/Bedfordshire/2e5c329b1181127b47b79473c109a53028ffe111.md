On Monday (14 December) at around 8.30am, a teenage girl was approached by a man who engaged her in conversation before touching her in an inappropriate way at the bus station in Greyfriars, Bedford.

The man is described as being between 20 and 30-years-old with blonde hair. It is believed he was wearing a yellow jumper with colours on the arms.

PC Luke Skelton from Bedfordshire Police's Crime Investigation team said: "This incident has left the victim understandably shaken up and we will not tolerate this kind of behaviour.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have been in or around the bus station area at this time, which would have been a busy time of day, to come forward with any information that may assist us with our investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 or report information via our website quoting reference number 40/67328/20.
