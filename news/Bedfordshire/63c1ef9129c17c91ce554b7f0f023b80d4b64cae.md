**We are appealing for witnesses following a burglary at a property in Staploe on Wednesday afternoon (19 June), where firearms and ammunition were stolen.**

Just before 4pm, four men broke into the property via the back door and conducted a messy search of the house before leaving with four shotguns, a rifle and a quantity of ammunition. They left the scene in a white Volkswagen Golf.

Detective Constable David Pawelek from our Op Maze team, investigating said: "We are keen to recover the stolen weapons and enquiries are underway to identify those responsible as well as to recover the firearms. We would urge anyone with any information to come forward as this will help us with our investigation.

"Burglary is a priority for the force, and we remain absolutely committed to apprehending those responsible. We understand the impact that this type of crime has on victims and how distressing they can be - nobody has the right to enter someone else's home uninvited or under false pretences and make them feel unsafe."

Anyone with information is asked to contact DC Pawelek on 101 or visiting the forces online reporting centre and quoting reference number 40/34723/19.

Alternatively, you can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 111 555.
