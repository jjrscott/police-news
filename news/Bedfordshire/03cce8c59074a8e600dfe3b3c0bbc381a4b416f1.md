Are you interested in working for the police but unsure where to start?

Bedfordshire Police is supporting the College of Policing in hosting a virtual recruitment event, showcasing the career opportunities within the force.

Officers will be engaging with the public online, alongside Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Constabularies, offering advice and support to those interested in pursuing a career in policing or volunteering.

They will be sharing information and be available to have a live chat online or respond to queries via email.

The event is available now and runs until to 23 March.

Anyone interested in joining should register via the College of Policing website.
