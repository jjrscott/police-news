**We are appealing for witnesses after a pedestrian was struck by a vehicle in Bedford on Friday (8 June).**

Emergency services were called to Luke Place shortly before 5pm following reports that a Volkswagen Polo had struck a pedestrian before colliding with an outbuilding, damaging a gas main.

An 18-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and has since been released under investigation. The victim was taken to hospital and has been discharged.

Detective Sergeant Joanne Corbyn, investigating, said: "We are taking this incident extremely seriously and enquiries into what happened are ongoing.

"Officers have been patrolling the area and have taken the opportunity to speak to local residents.

"The incident happened at a busy time of day and we are encouraging anyone who witnessed it or who has any information to come forward."

Anyone with any information is asked to call 101 or using our online reporting tool quoting reference number 315 of 8 June. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111.
