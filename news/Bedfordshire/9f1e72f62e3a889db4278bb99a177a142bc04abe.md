**Four men have been arrested following a search of a house in Luton in relation to a drugs investigation and a Closure Order has now been granted on the property for three months.**

We carried out the warrant in Ruthin Close on Thursday (15 February) and officers seized a quantity of Class A drugs, a number of weapons including machete knives and a baseball bat, along with eight mobile phones.

The men were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply drugs. All were interviewed and released under investigation.

We are pleased to be making our communities safer by ridding them of drugs and weapons, which can have such a damaging impact. We continue to encourage people to come forward with any information about crime or suspicious activity in their area.

Anyone with information about crime in their community is asked to contact us via our online reporting centre or call 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
