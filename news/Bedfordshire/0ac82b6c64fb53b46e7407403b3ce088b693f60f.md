**We are currently investigating after a man had his moped stolen in Bedford on Tuesday (16 January).**

The man was travelling along Union Street on Tuesday evening when he was approached by two men riding dirt bikes, and two men travelling in a silver Vauxhall Astra. One of the men on the dirt bikes attempted to try to push the man off his moped.

The man was able to get away however he was then followed by the two men on the dirt bikes and the Astra to Hartshill, where he was robbed of his moped. The victim ran away from the scene on foot and it's believed the men in the Astra loaded the stolen moped into their car.

Three of the men are described as black, with two of them described as being in their late teens.
