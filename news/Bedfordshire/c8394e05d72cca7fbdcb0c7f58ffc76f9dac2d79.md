### We are appealing for witnesses after an unknown object damaged a police vehicle on patrol in Marsh Farm, Luton on Friday evening (31 July).

At approximately 10.40pm an armed police vehicle was travelling along Wauluds Bank Drive towards Arrow Close when it is believed someone deliberately aimed an object at the vehicle, shattering the rear window.

Detective Constable Kimberley Anderson, investigating the case, said: "This is an extremely upsetting incident. Targeting a moving vehicle is extremely dangerous and can have tragic consequences.

"Deliberately aiming to damage a police vehicle with police officers inside is completely unacceptable. Officers are carrying out their duties to the public and working to keep the community safe.

"We won't tolerate this kind of behaviour and we are keen to speak to anyone who have seen anyone in the area at the time or have information about this incident."

Anyone who may have witnesses this incident is asked to contact the police using our online reporting tool.

You can also contact Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111.
