**We are encouraging motorcyclists across the county to sign up to one of our upcoming BikeSafe sessions.

**BikeSafe is a police led motorcycle project that is run by most forces throughout the UK. The main aim is to reduce the number of bikers being hurt on the roads improving skills, knowledge and hazard awareness.Bedfordshire Police's BikeSafe team is made up of current advanced police motorcyclists, who between them have many years' experience both in the world of roads policing and motorcycling.

PC Mark Fairclough, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, and Hertfordshire Roads Policing Unit, said: "We think riding motorcycles should be fun, but also safe, which is why we are encouraging motorcyclists to sign up to the BikeSafe courses. Our BikeSafe team is made up of volunteers who are all passionate about motorcycling and staying safe. The workshops are run over a one day weekend session, followed by an observed ride, after which feedback will be given on how you can improve your safety."

The sessions will follow the national BikeSafe curriculum and covers attitude to risk, bend assessment, overtaking, and hazard management, as well as an observed ride with an advanced qualified police motorcyclist.

The dates of upcoming workshops are:

 * 26 May - Theory
 * 2 June - Assessed rides day
 * 30 June - Theory
 * 7 July - Assessed rides
 * 15 Sept - Theory
 * 30 Sept - Assessed rides
