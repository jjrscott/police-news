**We are appealing for witnesses following an armed robbery at a bookmakers in Bedford on Sunday (13 January).**

Just after 8pm, a man entered Coral on Castle Road, and demanded money from the tills and the safe, threatening staff with what is believed to be a gun. He left with over Â£600 in cash and is believed to have headed towards Howbury Street.

He is described as black, approximately 6 foot tall and of slim build and was wearing a red puffa jacket, grey trousers, trainers and a balaclava.

Detective Sergeant Simon Oldfield, investigating, said: "This was a distressing incident for staff, and we're following a number of lines of enquiry to trace the man responsible.

"As part of our enquiries, we're urging anyone who was in the Castle Road area at the time of the incident, or anyone who may have seen the offender in the area, to get in touch. Your information may prove vital to our investigation."

If you have any information, please call 101 quoting reference 356 of 13 January, or report information online via our online reporting tool.

Alternatively, call independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
