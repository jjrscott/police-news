**We are appealing for information after jewellery was stolen from a house in Common Road in Studham on Friday (12 January). **

Between 2.30pm and 4pm, a man gained access to the property after throwing a stone through the kitchen window. On entering the house, he searched the upstairs of the property before leaving with jewellery when he was disturbed by the homeowner.

The offender is described as being in his mid-20s, black, of average build, with a beard and a large earring in his right ear. He was wearing a blue tracksuit with white lines down the legs and black boots or trainers. He also had a black covering on his head that could have been a bandana or a hat.

Anyone with any information is asked to call us on 101 quoting reference number JD/1852/18. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or report information via the our online reporting form.
