### We are appealing for information after a person was threatened with a knife in Sandy.

The victim was walking along The Mill at around 10.30am on Tuesday (20 October), when he was approached by a teenage boy who was shouting abuse before pulling out a knife.

He was left with minor injuries and is believed to have been targeted for his gender identity.

The offender was described as white, with short brown hair, 5'8'', around 16-years-old and was wearing jogging bottoms.

PC Daniel O'Mahoney said: "This was a worrying incident in which the offender has used offensive language to intimidate the victim targeting his appearance before threatening him with a knife. Hate crime is unacceptable in our county and it won't be tolerated.

"The incident happened on a busy street, in the middle of the day and we are keen to speak to anyone who might have witnessed it."

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to use the online report tool or call on 101 quoting reference number 40/57247/20. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
