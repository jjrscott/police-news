**We are appealing for witnesses after a council worker was threatened with a knife in Dunstable.**

At approximately 9.30am on Friday (28 June) a man was collecting litter in Union Street when he was approached by another man who became verbally agitated and threatened the victim with a knife.

The victim ran away, but when he later returned to the location, he was again approached and threatened by the same man.

The offender is described as a white, in his early twenties, approximately six-foot-tall, stocky with a scruffy beard and brown hair. At the time of the offence he was described wearing a white Adidas jacket, a pair of Nike shoes and grey jogging bottoms.

PC Paula Thorne, who is investigating, said: "This incident happened in broad daylight in a busy area of town and we are keen to speak to anyone who may have seen the offender in the area.

"It is never acceptable to carry a knife, let alone using it to threaten anyone. Our force does not tolerate this kind of violence."

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to call PC Thorne on 101, or visit the online reporting centre quoting reference number 40/36826/19.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
