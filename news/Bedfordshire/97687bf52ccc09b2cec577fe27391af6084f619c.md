We are appealing for information following an attempted robbery in Bedford on Saturday afternoon (31 March).

At approximately 3.30pm, the victim was walking along a footpath connecting Palgrave Road and Kempston Road, opposite the junction of Brittania Road.

She was approached from behind as someone tugged her bag and, despite fighting back, fell to the floor and as a result sustained minor injuries. The offender then ran away towards the Palgrave Road estate.

The offender is described as a white man, in his early 20s, around 5'7" and skinny. He is thought to have been wearing a black jacket over the top of a black hoody with the hood up, black jeans and white trainers.

Anyone with any information is asked to call 101 quoting crime reference number JH/14681/18. Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, or report information online via the online reporting system.
