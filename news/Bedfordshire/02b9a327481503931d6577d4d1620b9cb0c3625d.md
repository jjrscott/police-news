**Four people have been arrested and more than 30 suspected stolen vehicles recovered after a community policing led operation.**

Officers attended an address in Heath and Reach last Thursday (16 April) and discovered dozens of stripped out vehicles, as well as a significant number of car parts.

Four men found at the scene - one man in his 60s from London, two men in their 50s from Sussex and a man in his 20s from Luton - were all arrested on suspicion of handling stolen goods.

They have been released on bail, pending further enquiries.

Sergeant Adrian Paine, from the Leighton Buzzard community policing team, said: "This was an exceptional proactive policing operation."The quick and decisive actions of the team were able to secure the scene for evidence as well as a number of suspects.

"Our officers are determined to root out those involved in this offending and bring them to justice, as well as keeping our residents' valuable property safe."
