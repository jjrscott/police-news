**We are appealing for information following a collision on the A6, Bedford Road, earlier today (Tuesday).**

Just after 3.50pm, a black Vauxhall Astra and a white school bus were involved in a collision.

One man in his 60s, the driver of the Astra, suffered serious injuries and has been taken to hospital where he remains in a critical condition. Two passengers in the car sustained minor injuries and have also been taken to hospital.

On the bus were a number of school children, none of whom were seriously injured. All the children were taken away from the scene on a replacement bus.

The road is closed and is expected to remain closed for several hours. Traffic is being diverted down Higham Road, and motorists are being advised to find alternative routes.

Sergeant Craig Wheeler, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Roads Policing Unit, said: "We're asking anyone who saw the collision to come forward, including anyone who has any dash cam footage in the run up to the collision."

Anyone with any information is asked to call police on 101 quoting Operation Radley.

Alternatively report information at www.bedfordshire.police.uk/report, or call independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
