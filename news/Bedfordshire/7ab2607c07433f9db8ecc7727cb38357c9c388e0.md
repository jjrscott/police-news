We continue to excel in the field of cyber crime, and have been recognised for our efforts with an award at the Security Serious 2017 awards.

Sean O'Neill, the force's cyber security advisor, received the Fraud Fighter award at the ceremony on Tuesday (3 October).

The awards give recognition to those who go over and above the call of duty when it comes to protecting their organisations from cyber threats.

Sean said: "We take cyber security very seriously at Bedfordshire Police, both in protecting our own cyber infrastructure as well as advising others on how they can keep themselves and their data safe online.

"I'm really pleased that our efforts have been recognised with this award and we hope to continue to build on our good work in this area."

The Fraud FighterHead of Intelligence Mark Lay said: "This is a fantastic achievement personally for Sean and testament to the commitment he brings to the role.

"Bedfordshire Police took the initiative to invest in Cyber security and create this post to help protect individuals and companies from cyber-attacks.

"I am so pleased that our initiative has been nationally recognised and we can share our learning and best practise with other forces."
