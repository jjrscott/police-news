**We are appealing for witnesses after a burglary where jewellery was stolen.**

At around 6pm on Friday (11 January) the victim returned to his home in Torquay Drive, Luton and disturbed an intruder who was upstairs.

The intruder then ran down the stairs and threatened the victim with an item in his hand before running out of the property.

The suspect is described as a man of slim build and around 5'10". He was wearing dark clothing and his face was covered by a white mask. He spoke with a local English accent.

DC Kevin Howes, from the force's specialist Operation Maze burglary team, which is investigating the incident, said: "This has left the victim extremely shaken.

"We would appeal to anyone who has any information to get in touch with us to help with our enquiries."

Anyone with any information should contact police on 101 or visit the force's online reporting centre, quoting reference 40/2174/19.

Alternatively you can contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
