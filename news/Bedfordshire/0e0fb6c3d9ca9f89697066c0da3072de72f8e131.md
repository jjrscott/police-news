**Our Boson team have secured a closure order for a property in Bedford following a warrant yesterday (Tuesday).**

The Boson north team carried out the warrant at a property in Torridge Rise, and found a quantity of suspected Class B drugs.

As a result, the team have secured a closure order on the property, with strict conditions about who can enter.

Sergeant Luke Blackburn said: "We worked closely with our partners to secure the closure order on the property, and are pleased with the outcome. We will continue to work towards safeguarding our communities by taking preventative action against people who try to cause harm, whether that's through violence or through drug criminality."

The Boson north team was introduced in January, to counteract gun and gang criminality and serious youth violence in the north of Bedfordshire. Bedfordshire Police already has a Boson team based in Luton, which secured more than 200 years in prison sentences for offenders in 2018.
