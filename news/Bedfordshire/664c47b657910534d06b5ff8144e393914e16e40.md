**A man who died in a fatal collision on Needwood Road, Bedford, yesterday (Wednesday) has been named.**

William Joseph Corrigan, 38, from Bedford, was involved in a collision with a vehicle at around 2.10pm and was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

His family paid tribute, saying: "William Joseph was a loving husband, dad, son and brother. He loved his music and was a gifted banjo player. He was hugely popular in the local area and will be sadly missed by all who knew him."

Investigating officer Sergeant Paul Stanbridge, from our Roads Policing Unit, said: "I'm appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident, or who saw the vehicle in the area before, or after, the collision, to get in touch to help us establish what happened.

"It is a tragedy when someone loses their life as a result of a collision and our thoughts are with Mr Corrigan's family at this time."

A man has been arrested on suspicion of death by dangerous driving and remains in police custody for questioning.

Anyone with information is asked to use our online reporting centre, or call on 101 quoting Operation Cathedral.
