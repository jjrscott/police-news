### Our detectives have arrested a woman in connection with a road traffic collision in Luton this morning (Wednesday).

Just after 8am, officers were called to reports that a blue Audi had left the road and collided with a building on Tomlinson Avenue. The driver and the two passengers had left the scene prior to police arriving.

One of the passengers - a 32-year-old woman from Luton - has been arrested in connection with the incident.

The driver is described as a black man, around six-foot-tall and was wearing a dark green hoody with black combat trousers. The other man in the car is described as white and was wearing a black coat with a fur hood and grey pin-striped trousers. The occupants of the vehicle were also described as carrying alcohol.

Detective Inspective Tom Hamm from the Crime Investigation Team said: "We understand that an incident of this nature can be very concerning for the community, and want to reassure the local residents that we have arrested one of the passengers and are carrying out enquiries to identify and locate the driver and the other man in the car.

"We are appealing for anyone who saw the collision or has any information as this will greatly help with our enquiries. We are also calling on anyone who may have dashcam footage of the area prior to the incident to get it touch too."

If you have any information, please call DI Hamm on 101 or visit Bedfordshire Police's online reporting centre quoting reference number 55 of 8 July.

Alternatively, you can contact Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111.
