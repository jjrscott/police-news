```

**We are appealing for witnesses following a collision between a man and a taxi on High Street North in Dunstable in the early hours of this morning (Sunday).**

Officers were called to reports of a collision near to the junction with Church Street at around 3.55am, and attended the scene alongside colleagues from other emergency services.

The man was taken to hospital with life threatening injuries.

A section of High Street North was closed while the scene was dealt with, but has since been re-opened.

Anyone with information is asked to contact us by calling 101 or by using our online reporting centre, quoting Operation Scott.
