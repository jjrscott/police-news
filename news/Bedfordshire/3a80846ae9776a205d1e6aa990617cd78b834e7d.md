A known Bedford shoplifter has been served with a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) which stops him from entering 40 shops in the town centre.

Liam Senior, 37, of no fixed abode, was served with a CBO for a period of five years at Luton Magistrates' Court on Wednesday (15 January).

He was also jailed for two years, of which he must serve half, for three counts of burglary and two counts of theft.

PC Emma Underwood, who applied for the successful order, said: "Our force works closely with Bedford Borough Council and local business owners to make sure our town and high street is a safe place for our residents and their families.

 "Liam Senior has time and time again targeted local shops, costing them money and causing distress to the owners and employees.

"We are happy with the court's decision to imprison Senior and issue him with the Criminal Behaviour Order."
