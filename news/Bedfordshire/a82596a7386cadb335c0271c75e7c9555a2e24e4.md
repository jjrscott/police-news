**We are appealing for information after a six vehicle collision which left the motorway closed for several hours.**

At approximately 7am on Wednesday (23 May), four heavy goods vehicles and two cars collided with each other on the M1 southbound at junction 13.

Five people were taken to hospital; four with minor injuries and one in a serious condition.

Sergeant Richard Cruse, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, and Hertfordshire Roads Policing Unit, said: "This incident happened at a busy time of the day so I'm appealing for anyone who was travelling along the M1 southbound, near to junction 13, who witnessed the build up to the collision to get in touch.

"We're especially looking for anyone who may have dash cam footage of the incident.

"We'd like to thank motorists for their patient while we carried out investigation and recovery work. We appreciate the inconvenience that closing a major motorway such as this can have, but someone was seriously injured in this collision and it is important that we establish the circumstances that led to this."

You can report information about this incident by contacting Sergeant Cruse through 101, or by visiting the online reporting centre on our website. Here you can also arrange for footage of the incident to be transferred to officers.
