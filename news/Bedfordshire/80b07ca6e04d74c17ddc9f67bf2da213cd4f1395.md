We are appealing for witnesses of a robbery in Luton on Monday (27 November), during which four shots were fired.

A man was standing next to his running car, a Mercedes A45, in Hitchin Road around 6pm when three men approached and pointed a firearm at him. One of the men got into the car and the firearm was discharged four times.

The victim dropped to the ground as his car was driven away and the other two men drove off in another vehicle, which was a pale colour.

Detective Constable Colin Knight, who is investigating, said: "This incident happened in the early evening on a residential street in the town. The victim feared he was going to be shot and has been left shaken by what happened. We would like to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time and can help us with our enquiries.

"We take firearms related criminality very seriously and we understand how it can affect a community, so we are working hard to find those responsible."

Anyone with information is asked to contact DC Knight on 101, quoting crime reference C/51990/17, or call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
