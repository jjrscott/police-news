**A police officer has been dismissed after being convicted for theft.**

Former Detective Sergeant David Sharpe was found to have breached professional standards, including honesty and integrity, and discreditable conduct, at a special case hearing at Cambridgeshire Constabulary Headquarters today (Thursday).

He had pleaded guilty to two counts of theft by employee and last Wednesday (28 August) was handed a 20-month custodial sentence for stealing Â£9,080 from an exhibits store in the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit.

He was suspended from duty in March 2019 as soon as the allegations came to light, and following today's hearing has been dismissed without notice.

Temporary Deputy Chief Constable Jackie Sebire said: "David Sharpe's actions go against everything policing stands for.

"It is a deeply disappointing situation when an officer is dismissed from our ranks for falling short of the professional conduct and high standards carried by us all. He not only let his team and colleagues down, but also the public."
