We are investigating a suspected hate incident inside of a bank in Bedford.

At approximately 3pm on Friday (12 June) a man attempted to pass another man in a queue at a bank in Allhallows. When challenged, he used offensive language towards a bank customer, which was believed to be racially-motivated.

PC Mark Conyers, who is investigating, said: "We are keen to speak to anyone who might have witnessed this incident but we are particularly keen to speak to the man who challenged the offender.

"Hate crime won't be tolerated in our community and we are keen to speak to anyone who has any details about this incident."

If you have any information please contact police by calling 101 or by visiting the online reporting centre, quoting reference number 40/31544/20.
