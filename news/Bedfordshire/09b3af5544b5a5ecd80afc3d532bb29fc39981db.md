**We are appealing for witnesses following a theft from a lorry in Bedford Road, Husborne Crawley, on Wednesday 25 October.**

Between 3am and 3.30am a driver of a lorry was asleep in the lorry cab when he was woken by noises coming from the trailer of the vehicle.

Approximately ten offenders wearing black clothing and balaclavas forced entry to the rear of the lorry, removed the property from the trailer using a forklift and moved it to another vehicle.

A large number of Panasonic TVs were stolen.

We are also reminding lorry and van drivers to always secure the back of their vehicles, even when they are inside them, in order to reduce the risk of theft.

If you have any information about this incident contact Bedfordshire Police on 101 quoting reference JH/46175/2017. Alternatively you can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
