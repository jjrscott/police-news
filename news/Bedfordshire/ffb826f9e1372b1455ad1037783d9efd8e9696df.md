**Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward, after a robbery in Grovebury Road, Leighton Buzzard, at around 10.20pm on Tuesday (18 September).**

A woman was sitting in a van outside the Chiltern Industrial Estate Screwfix store, when the vehicle was approached by two masked offenders. The victim was dragged out of the van and forced to open the door of the store.

They then continued to threaten the victim and gained entry to the safe, stole an undisclosed amount of cash and made off in a white Vauxhall car-derived van towards Chartmoor Road

The offenders were described as white, and were wearing dark clothing and face masks.

Detective Sergeant Thomas Hamm, investigating, said: "This was a terrifying and violent robbery, and I cannot begin to understand the emotional impact it has had on the victim."

"We are appealing for anyone who was in the area, who may have noticed anything suspicious, or who saw the white van in the area around the time of the incident."

Anyone with information is asked to contact us on 101 or by visiting our online reporting centre and quoting crime reference number 40/25518/18.
