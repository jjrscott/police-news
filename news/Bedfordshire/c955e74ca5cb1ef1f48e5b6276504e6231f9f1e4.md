We are appealing for information after a knife point robbery at a convenience store.

At around 8.30pm on Friday (22 May) a man entered a convenience store in Ashton Road, Luton, where he stole two bottles of cider.

A man working at the store confronted the man, who threatened him with a knife.

Fearful for their safety, the shop staff let the man leave the location, and he made off in the direction of London Road.

The offender is described as a mixed-race man, approximately 5'5" and of medium build. At the time of the offence he was wearing a blue denim jacket, black trousers and black shoes.

Detective Constable Richard Marshall, investigating, said: "A man working in this shop, providing a service to the local community, was put in genuine fear and was terrified by this offender.

"This sort of casual criminality will never be tolerated and we are following a number of lines of enquiry.

"If you were in Ashton Road, near the shop at the time, or in the wider area and saw anything which could help with our enquiries, please get in touch."

Anyone with any information is asked to contact police on 101 or visit www.bedfordshire.police.uk/report quoting reference 40/27618/20.

You can also contact independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
