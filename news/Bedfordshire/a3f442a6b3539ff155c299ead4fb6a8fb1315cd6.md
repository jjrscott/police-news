We are appealing for witnesses to a serious road traffic collision in Luton, in which a man sustained life changing injuries.

We were called shortly after 10.30am on Saturday (25 January) to reports that a black Renault Clio had collided with a silver Land Rover Discovery on Hedley Rise, just north of the junction with Warminster Close.

Emergency services attended, and one man, the driver of the Renault, was taken to hospital, where he remains in a stable but critical condition, with life-changing injuries.

The occupants of the Land Rover, a woman and two teenage girls, sustained minor injuries.

The vehicles were recovered and the road was re-opened by 1.15pm.

PC Sayf-Ali Khan, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Roads Policing Unit, said: "This happened on a Saturday morning on residential roads and we are working to establish the circumstances surrounding the collision.

"We would ask that anyone who witnessed the incident, or who may have dashcam footage from the area at the time, to come forward."

Anyone who has information, or who witnessed the incident is asked to contact police on 101 or via our online reporting tool quoting the reference number 143 of 25 January.
