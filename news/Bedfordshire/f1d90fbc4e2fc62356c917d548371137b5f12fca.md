**We have recently been contacted by pet owners concerned about the publicity surrounding the killings of cats and other pets in and around the M25 area.**

Since October 2014, a potential series of pet deaths have been reported in Hertfordshire. Hertfordshire Constabulary is utilising Operation Tupelo in response to these cases. The Metropolitan Police is coordinating its own response under Operation Takahe.

Bedfordshire Police has received three reports of animal deaths in Bedfordshire in the past six months, and Operation Cosmic is the force's trigger plan to investigate and identify any links between the deaths.

Pet owners are asked to be vigilant and keep a close eye on their pets. If you're concerned about attacks on pets in your area it may be worth trying to keeping them inside at night.

Any incident, or suspicious behaviour, should be reported using our online reporting tool, or by calling us on 101.
