Detectives are appealing for information and issuing advice following two offences targeting businesses in Kensington this morning, Thursday 12 November.

At around 7am, three males attended at Mohamed Mini Mart, Kensington. One took goods from outside the store and a second informed the shopkeeper inside that he was a police officer and needed to view CCTV footage. A third man approached the shopkeeper behind the counter at which point the shopkeeper called for assistance. The men left the store and are believed to have stolen a mobile phone from a van outside. CCTV and forensic enquiries are ongoing.

The first and second men are described as white, in their 20s or 30s, wearing face masks and baseball caps. The third man is described as having a black cap with a white logo, a black jacket and blue jeans. One was in possession of a walkie-talkie.

At around 8am, two men entered Best Inn Late Shop on Atwell Street, also in Kensington, one again in possession of a walkie-talkie. They claimed to be from the immigration service. A customer challenged the man and asked for identification, before she left and called police. The shopkeeper was then threatened with a small flick knife and cash and cigarettes were stolen. The offenders stole the victim's car, which was found abandoned on Ellens Close. The victim was uninjured by left shocked. CCTV and other enquiries are ongoing and we believe the incidents are linked.

Detective Inspector Simon Hurst said: "These are both concerning incidents and distressing to experience. I would urge anyone who witnessed them or has any information to come forward, as our enquiries continue. All of those targeted has suspicions and did the right thing in alerting us. We will continue to work with all businesses locally to make it known that such incidents have occurred, and provide any advice when necessary.
