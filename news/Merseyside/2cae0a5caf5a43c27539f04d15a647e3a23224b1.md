We are appealing on behalf of Liverpool Coroner's Office to find the family of a 50-year-old woman believed to be from Peterborough, who died in Liverpool.

Lorraine Foreman was sadly found deceased at her home address in Feltwood Road, West Derby. Her death is not being treated as suspicious.

It is believed that Ms Foreman may have extended family in the Peterborough area.

Anyone who can help is asked to contact Simon Knuckey on 0151 233 0134 or by emailing simon.knuckey@liverpool.gov.uk.
