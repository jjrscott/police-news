Officers have today, Thursday, 26 November, executed a warrant at an address in Vauxhall to target those involved in County Lines in to North Wales.

The activity was part of the ongoing Project Medusa, an operation led by Merseyside Police set up to tackle County Lines drug dealing and child criminal exploitation.

Two people, a 27-year-old man from Netherton and a 26-year-old woman from Liverpool, were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the illegal supply of drugs.

As part of their investigation, officers recovered a significant quantity of cash, a car, Cartier jewellery, a Rolex wristwatch, Gucci clothing and Dior shoes under the Proceeds of Crime Act.

A spokesperson said: "Today's warrant is on the back of the work we're carrying out day in day out to arrest those involved in this type of criminality and shut down County Lines.

"Those involved blight the communities they deal drugs in and it's a sad fact that these criminals are known to target vulnerable people to do their dirty work on the ground, often coercing them with gifts and more often than not, violence.

"Despite the global pandemic, it is business as usual for these criminals, who will carry out this type of activity, despite the restrictions that are in place, risking the health of everyone they come into contact with, when we should be doing all we can to halt the spread of the virus.

"Ultimately everyone should be warned that if you get involved in crime, you risk facing the consequences. But when we identify vulnerable, exploited people during our enquiries, we ensure they are treated with sensitivity and understanding, and are offered appropriate support. Our primary target is those who seek to use them for their own selfish gain."
