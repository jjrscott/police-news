Detectives investigating a burglary in Liverpool in July have issued CCTV images of a man who they believe may be able to assist enquiries.

At around 9.15pm on Sunday, 26 July 2020, it was reported that a man had gained entry to a supported accommodation flat in Dene Court, Long Lane, before stealing a large amount of cash from the purse of a woman in her 80's.

The victim was present at the time and although uninjured, was left shaken by the ordeal.

An investigation is ongoing and detectives are keen to speak to the man pictured, as he may have vital information to assist the investigation.

Detective Inspector Sean Kelly-Martland said: "To target supported accommodation for elderly residents in this way is shameful, burglary is not a victimless crime and no-one deserves to feel unsafe in their own home.

"We are carrying out a number of enquiries to locate the person responsible and would ask anyone with information to get in touch.

"We are particularly keen to speak to the man pictured, as he may have vital information to assist enquiries, so if you recognise him, or have any further information, CCTV or dashcam footage from the area, please let us know."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 quoting ref. 20000442453 or Crimestoppers, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
