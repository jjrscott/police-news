Officers from Merseyside Police Roads Policing Unit are appealing for witnesses following a road traffic collision in West Derby.

At around 7.15am on Saturday 9th May, a 70 year-old man was cycling on Yew Tree Lane near its junction with the Finch Lane, alongside the perimeter fence of West Derby Golf Club, when a vehicle approached from behind and sounded a distinctive horn which startled the rider causing him to fall.

The vehicle then passed the rider and appears to have driven away from the area prior to the emergency services arriving. The rider of the bicycle sustained serious injuries and remains in hospital in a critical but stable condition.

Constable Andy Roper from the Roads Policing Unit said: "We are keen to speak to anyone who witnessed this collision or who may have CCTV or dash camera footage of that location around the time in question.

"We are particularly interested in tracing the vehicle involved which had a distinctive audible horn that played a loud musical melody".

Witnesses are asked to call 0151 777 3339 or DM @MerPolCC quoting reference number 20000268674 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
