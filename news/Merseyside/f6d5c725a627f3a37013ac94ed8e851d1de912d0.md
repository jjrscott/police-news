Officers in Stockbridge Village and Huyton are introducing a Section 60 order today, Monday 30th November, following the murder of 19-year-old Nyle Corrigan and ongoing issues in the Huyton area.

We will continue high visibility patrols in the area and encourage anyone with information to speak to us.

The Section 60 will be in place from 5pm today (Monday 30th November) until 4am tomorrow (Tuesday 1st December).

The Order, under S60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, gives officers enhanced stop and search powers to stop males aged 14-50 in the area (pictured) and is designed to minimise serious violence in the area.

The area is bounded at the bottom by Princess Drive, Following the M57 boundary of Huyton, then going left towards to Croxteth Hall Lane, then going down along Princess Drive, across to Finch Road to the junction of Dovecot Ave and Pilch Lane, down to Pilch Lane East with the junction of A5080, then following the boundary of the A5080 to the M57 boundary.
