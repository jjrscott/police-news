Officers on patrol yesterday (10th November) arrested three people on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs.

The three people were stopped whilst driving along Tithebarn Road, Southport just before 8pm.

A search of the car was conducted resulting in officers finding four bags of white powder, suspected as cocaine, hidden inside a cat food box.

The two men, aged 38 and 34 and the 18 year old woman were all arrested and taken to custody for further questioning.

Chief Inspector Michael O'Malley said: "We often see people try to conceal drugs and weapons in unusual places and some can be very innovative but regardless of where they're hidden, we have the means to find them and take them out of circulation.

"I want to remind the wider public and more specifically those involved in supplying drugs in Southport that we are actively looking for them and I would urge anyone that knows someone selling drugs, to get in touch.

"Drugs have a huge negative impact on our community - not only do dealers exploit vulnerable people, they also bring the threat of more serious violence to our area. Therefore, it is important that we all work together to make sure our friends and family are safe and free from drugs jeopardising our safety."
