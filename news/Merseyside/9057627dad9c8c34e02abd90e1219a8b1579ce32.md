Liverpool Community Policing Superintendent Diane Pownall said: "I know that people in the Toxteth area and the wider communities of Merseyside may feel shocked by the incident that has taken place today.

"I want to reassure the public that Merseyside Police is committed to keeping our communities safe and ensuring that everyone can go about their daily business safely and without fear.

"This was an isolated incident in which officers responded to a number of members of the public reporting a woman in possession of a knife in the Toxteth area.

"We are not looking for anyone else in connection to the incident. The matter has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) and we will be co-operating fully with their investigation in the coming days and weeks.

"The woman remains in hospital.

"In the next few days you will see an increased police presence in your community. If you have any questions then I would ask you to speak to one of my officers.

"We will also be working closely with our partners in the local authority and Toxteth community leaders to ensure any concerns are addressed."
