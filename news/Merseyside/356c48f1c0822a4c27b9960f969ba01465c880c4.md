We have arrested two teenagers after two 16-year-old males had their electric bikes stolen at knifepoint in Rainhill on Thursday (16 July).

We were called just before 6pm to a report the victims had been threatened with a flick knife and had their bikes taken by a group of three males on land known locally as 'The Wreck', off Old Lane.

Officers attended and two males were detained after a search of the field and gardens nearby, and the bikes recovered.

A 14-year-old boy from Huyton and a 14-year-old boy from Prescot were arrested on suspicion of robbery and taken to be interviewed.

Detective Inspector Jackie Guinness: "Thankfully the boy will be reunited with his bike, but the emotional impact of being subjected to such an ordeal could last a very long time.

"The use of knives to cause fear and intimidation on our streets will never be tolerated by Merseyside Police, and I know our communities feel just as strongly.

"Our officers, assisted by members of the public, located two males soon after this incident and made two arrests. But we are keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed any part of this incident or knows who was responsible."
