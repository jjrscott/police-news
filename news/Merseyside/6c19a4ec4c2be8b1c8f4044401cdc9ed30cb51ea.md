We are appealing for witnesses after a cyclist was assaulted and had his bike stolen in St Helens.

The 55 year-old male cyclist had been riding along Fleet Lane at around 4am on Sunday 5th July when he was approached by a man who grabbed the back of his bike, assaulted him and stole the bike.

The cyclist suffered a cut to his face during the assault but did not require hospital treatment.

The male is described as being white and wearing a black and orange jacket, baseball cap, jeans and a grey jumper with hiking boots.

The stolen bike was maroon with a white seat with an X Factor logo.

CCTV enquiries have been carried out in the local area.

Anyone who was in the area around Fleet Lane who witnessed anything or thinks they may have captured something on dashcam or CCTV footage is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 20000392683.
