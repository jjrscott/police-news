Officers in Wirral are introducing a Section 60 order in the Beechwood Estate following recent incidents, including an alleged firearm sighting earlier today, following which a man was arrested.

The Order will begin at 5pm today (Wednesday 11 November) and will conclude at 4am tomorrow (Thursday 12 November).

The Order, under S60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, gives officers enhanced stop and search powers in a specified geographic location for a set period of time.

The authorisation includes the extent of the whole roads at the boundary and the area and land within this boundary.

Community Policing Inspector Tom Welch said: "I want to assure those in the community that we take all such incidents extremely seriously, and increased patrols will be in the area tonight so speak us with any issues and we will take the appropriate action."

Anyone with information on crime in the area is urged to come forward and speak to us, either directly or via @MerPolCC, or anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. We will act on all information to remove those who cause harm from your streets.
