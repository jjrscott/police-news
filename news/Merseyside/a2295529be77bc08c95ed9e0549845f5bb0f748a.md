We can confirm officers remain at Knowsley Business park this morning, Saturday 5th September.

We were contacted at 10.10pm last night, Friday 4th September, following reports that a group of protestors had gathered outside News International on Kitling Road.

Officers are speaking with members of the group and are dealing with the situation.

Penrin Road and Villias Road are currently closed.

A further update will be issued in due course.
