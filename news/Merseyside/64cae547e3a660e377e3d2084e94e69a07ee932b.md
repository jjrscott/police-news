Merseyside Police would like to thank the fans from both Everton and Liverpool Football Clubs for heeding advice to stay at home and watch the derby game.

Together with Everton FC, Liverpool FC, Liverpool City Council, Blue Union, Spirit of Shankly and the NHS, we asked fans to do the right thing and stay at home to prevent any further spread of Covid-19.

Assistant Chief Constable Rob Carden, said: "For the last five years fans from both Everton and Liverpool have been supporting the foodbank initiative set up by Everton fans Dave Kelly and Robbie Daniels with Liverpool fan, and MP for West Derby, Ian Byrne, and the supporters groups Blue Union and Spirit of Shankly.

"And today fans showed again how they are able to come together to support their communities during times of crisis by staying at home to watch the game and help reduce the potential spread of COVID-19.

"This is a city that is passionate about its football and today will have seemed strange for many fans. But by staying at home, for the game today and games to come, they are playing their part to keep themselves, their families, friends and neighbours safe. Thank you."
