We are appealing for witnesses following reports of a cash-in-transit robbery in West Derby.

Officers were called at 11.55am today, Monday 4th November, to the Tesco Express store on Princess Drive following reports a male, armed with what is believed to be a crowbar or bat, approached a security guard.

The guard was hit on the helmet forcing him to drop a cash box. The male picked up the cash box and ran away in the direction of Finch Road.

The male is described as being of thin build, 5ft 5in tall and wearing dark clothing.

The guard was not seriously hurt but was left shaken by his ordeal.

An investigation is underway and CCTV and forensic enquiries are being carried out. The cash box believed to have been taken in the robbery was recovered a short time later in Ashover Avenue/Shellingford Road.

Detective Inspector Jennie Beck said: "I would appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of the Tesco Express store on Princess Drive who saw anyone or anything suspicious to contact us as they may have information which is vital to the investigation.

"I would also appeal to any motorists who may have been in the area to check their dash-cam as they may have captured something important."

Anyone with information asked to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 19100643054.
