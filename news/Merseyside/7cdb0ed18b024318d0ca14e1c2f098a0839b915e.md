We arrested an 18 year-old man and seized two electric bikes in Sherdley Park in St Helens last night, Tuesday 27th October.

Two males were seen acting suspiciously by officers on the bikes on Marshalls Cross Road at around 10.15pm. The males got off the bikes in Sherdley Park and attempted to make off on foot.

An officer was assaulted as he tried to detain one of the males. The other male made good his escape.

The 18 year-old was arrested on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle, criminal damage, possession of a controlled drug of Class B, cannabis, assault police, dangerous driving, driving without a licence and no insurance.

A search was also conducted at his home address where a further quantity of cannabis was recovered.

The male remains in custody for questioning.

The officer did not require medical treatment.
