It is with sadness that today (Remembrance Sunday, 8 November)when we commemorate those whose lost their lives in conflict that we are having to appeal for witnesses to the theft of a poppy box from a shop in West Derby yesterday (Saturday, 7 November).

At about 9.30am yesterday a man walked in to a butchers shop on Mill Lane and stole the poppy box from the counter.

The offender is described as a white male, with black hair (slightly receding) and he had black framed glasses on top of his head. He was wearing a dark coloured winter coat over a grey coloured top with a motif on.

We are issuing a CCTV image of a man we would like to speak to in connection with the theft.

If you recognise him please contact @MerpolCC, or phone 101, or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 0487 of Saturday, 7 November.
