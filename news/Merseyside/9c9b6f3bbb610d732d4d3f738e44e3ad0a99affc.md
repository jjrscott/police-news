We are appealing for information following a reported robbery and assault on Dover Street, Liverpool, this week (Monday 1 March).

At around 7.30pm on Monday, it was reported that a 27-year-old woman was approached by two unknown men on pedal bikes, when walking along Dover Street, from Brownlow Street.

It was reported that the men assaulted her, resulting in minor injury, and took her mobile phone, a blue Huawei B20. They then made off from the scene on pedal bikes in the direction of Ashton Street.

The men are described as aged around 18 to 24 years old and spoke with Liverpool accents. At the time of the incident they were wearing dark clothing with their hoods up.

A CCTV and forensic investigation is underway.

Detective Inspector Nick Suffield said: "This incident was extremely shocking for the victim and I want to reassure the public that we are committed to finding the people responsible for committing this offence and bringing them to justice.

"I would appeal to anyone who was in the area around Brownlow Street and Dover Street on Monday night who saw anyone or anything suspicious to contact us.

"I would particularly ask anyone who was driving past who may have a dash-cam footage to check it to see if they captured anything significant. Please get in touch as you could hold information which is vital to our investigation."

Anyone with information on this incident can contact us by DM via our social media desk on Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' with reference 21000134708.
