A Genk football fan has been given a suspended prison sentence and three year football banning order after admitting assaulting four police officers.

Tom Rosius, 36, a Belgian national, was arrested during the LFC v Genk football match at Anfield on Tuesday 5th November.

He appeared before the Community Justice Courts today, Friday 8th November where he pleaded guilty to assault

He was given a 12 week prison sentence suspended for two years and given a three year football banning order.

He was also ordered to pay compensation to the four police officers and a victim surcharge.

Match commander Gary O'Rourke said: "This type of behaviour will not be tolerated. Police officers and stewards are there to assist in keeping people safe and ensure that big public events such as football matches can run smoothly.

"Merseyside Police takes a zero tolerance approach when it comes to tackling football violence and we will do everything within our powers to bring the people responsible for behaviour such as this to justice."
