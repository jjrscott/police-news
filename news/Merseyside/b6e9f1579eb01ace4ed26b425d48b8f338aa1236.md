Our Operation Target officers are in the L8 area of Liverpool today, Wednesday 9th September, as part of our ongoing commitment to disrupt criminal activity and prevent antisocial behaviour and drug dealing.

A warrant has been carried out and high visibility patrols, stop searches, vehicle searches and open land searches are being carried out in the area.

Liverpool community policing Inspector Geoff Stewart said: "It is important that we do everything we can to disrupt any criminal activity in our communities.

"We ask people to tell us what concerns are then we act on those concerns.

"This sort of activity is not aimed at stopping people going about their lawful business but give a visible presence on the streets of our communities and at the same time disrupt criminal activity.

"We hope that the public who see our officers out and about will feel reassured and will engage with them.

"I would also encourage people to keep coming forward with information. If you know who is dealing drugs or carrying weapons in your area then please tell us so that we can take action."

Anyone with information can DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111.
