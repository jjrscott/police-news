We are appealing for information following reports of a man acting suspiciously in local parks in South Sefton.

It was reported that on Tuesday 16 March a man was seen acting suspiciously, close to a group of children, in Bowersdale Park, Seaforth.

Reports have also been made of suspicious behaviour from a man of the same description in Marine Gardens and Potters Barn Park, Waterloo.

Officers are making enquiries into these reports, and ask anybody with any information about who the man is to come forward.

He is described as a white male in his 40s, of medium build with a beard and dark hair who has been seen wearing sunglasses and a dark jacket.

Sefton Community Policing Superintendent Graeme Robson said: "We are aware of images circulating on social media of a man acting suspiciously in parks in South Sefton.

"We take all reports of such behaviour very seriously and so if you have any information relating to this then please tell us - either come directly to us or through Crimestoppers. However you choose to tell us we will act

"If you have visited Bowersdale Park or the surrounding area recently and have any information about the man or what he was doing in the area then I would urge you to get in touch with us."

Anyone who has any information is asked to contact @MerPolCC on Twitter, 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook or call 101 quoting reference 096 of 18/03.

You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
