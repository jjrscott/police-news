Detectives have issued CCTV images of a man they wish to speak to in connection with an assault in Liverpool city centre on Sunday, 2 February.

At around 4.15am, officers received a report that an 18-year-old man had been assaulted while in Hardman Pizza on Slater Street. It was reported than while he was standing in the queue, an unknown man approached him from behind and grabbed him round the neck, before biting his ear.

The victim sustained a serious but non-life threatening injury and was taken to hospital for treatment.

An investigation is ongoing and detectives are appealing for anyone with information to get in touch.

Detective Constable Nick Glascott-Tull said: "This was an unprovoked attack which left a man with a serious injury to his ear while simply enjoying a night out. This kind of senseless violence will not be tolerated and we are carrying out a number of enquires to find the person responsible.

"The assault happened in a busy area of the city centre in the early hours, when a lot of people would've been around and I would urge anyone who witnessed the incident, or has any information to please let us know.

"Likewise, we are particularly keen to speak to the man pictured as it is believed he could have vital information to assist enquiries, so please contact us if you recognise him."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 quoting ref. 20000070482 or @CrimestoppersUK, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
