We are appealing for information following a burglary in Hightown yesterday, Thursday 25 February.

At around 3.20pm we received a report that intruders had entered a home address on North End Lane after forcing entry via a rear door.

They made an untidy search of the bedrooms before making off with jewellery - including watches and a wedding ring.

The offenders are described as white, wearing masks, and dressed in black. It is reported that they left the property via the back doors and headed towards Hightown Train Station.

CCTV, forensic and witness enquires are ongoing to identify those responsible and return the stolen items to their owner.

Detective Chief Inspector Gayle Rooney said: "To be the victim of burglary is incredibly upsetting, and the occupant of the house, who was present at the time, has naturally been left incredibly distressed by this incident. We're keen to speak to anyone who can help bring the offenders to justice.

"We are carrying out house-to-house and CCTV enquiries, and I would ask anyone who may have heard or seen suspicious behaviour, or has their own CCTV or dashcam footage from North End Lane or Hightown Station to get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 quoting ref. 21000123230 or Crimestoppers, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
