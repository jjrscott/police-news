Detectives are investigating after shots were fired in Toxteth tonight, Thursday 21 November, causing damage to a house.

At 9.25pm, officers were called to Jermyn Street to reports of shots being heard. Armed police attended and confirmed damage to a house.

Initial enquiries are being carried out in the area, including house-to-house, forensics and CCTV.

Chief Inspector George Phillips said: "At this early stage, we are gathering information as to the circumstances, who was responsible, how they left the scene, and where they and the weapon is now. To fire towards a house is incredibly reckless and it's through luck alone that nobody has been seriously hurt.

"People in the community may have seen or heard the incident, or recorded something on CCTV or dashcam. Whatever you know, come forward as it could be vital in getting these people and their weapons off the streets. We've carried out significant activity across Merseyside in recent weeks, including warrants, stop checks, arrests and the seizures of weapons and drugs. We'll keep taking action."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC or 101 with reference 901, or the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
