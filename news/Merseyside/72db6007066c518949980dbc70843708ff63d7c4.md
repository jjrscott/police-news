Wanted

13:54 06/01/2021

We are appealing for help in tracing Wirral man Jack Stuart Hayes.

Officers investigating an incident of violent disorder outside Anfield football ground in July last year believe the 27 year-old could assist with their investigation.

They would also like to speak to him in connection with a large quantity of cannabis recovered from a vehicle.

Hayes, who is originally from the Birkenhead area, is described as a white male, 5ft 9in tall, of medium build with brown hair and brown eyes.

Anyone who has seen Hayes or has any information about his whereabouts is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111.
