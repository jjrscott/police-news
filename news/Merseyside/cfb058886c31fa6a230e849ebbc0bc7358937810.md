Detectives are investigating following a cash box robbery in Garston on Friday morning, 24 October.

At shortly before 7am, officers were called to Asda on St Mary's Road to reports of a cash delivery driver being approached from behind by two men, one of whom forcefully grabbed the cash box. Both men were wearing gloves and had their faces covered. They reportedly got into a black Audi A3, which was located abandoned a short time later on Island Road. The cash box was found in Melbreck Road, Allerton.

Forensic and CCTV enquiries are ongoing.

Detective Inspector Sean Kelly-Martland said: "We're keen to speak with anyone who saw this incident, saw or captured the vehicle in question making off, or anyone acting suspiciously in the Allerton area a short time later.

"The guard was not injured but obviously shocked to be targeted in such a way, and we're determined to find those responsible and put them before the courts. We work closely with security companies and businesses, and there are many measures to deter would-be offenders, as well as previous successes we have had in court. These recent incidents are no different. We continue to investigate a similar incident in Belle Vale earlier this month and are keeping an open mind as to whether these are linked.

"If you have any information, please contact us on Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 quoting ref. 20000642236 or Crimestoppers, anonymously on 0800 555 111."
