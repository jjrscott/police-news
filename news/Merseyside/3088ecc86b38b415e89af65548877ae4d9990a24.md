Officers yesterday (27th Jan) conducted a warrant on Suburban Road in Anfield following intelligence suggesting a cannabis farm was being grown in one of the properties.

The warrant took place at 9:30am as Officers forced entry into the home where they detained a 30 year old man.

Following a search, they recovered three growing rooms consisting of 109 cannabis plants. The electricity was also found to be dangerously bridged.

A large machete was also seized.

The man was arrested on suspicion of cannabis production, abstracting electricity and possession of a controlled Class B drug.

He was taken to custody where he was charged overnight and appeared at court this morning (28th Jan).

Anyone who knows someone involved in drug dealing or more serious violence, should let us know immediately so we can take action. #OpTarget
