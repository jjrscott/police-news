**UPDATE - 6.50pm Tuesday 10th September**

Adam Bennett has been located and arrested and is currently in custody.

ORIGINAL

We are appealing for information to find a wanted man who escaped from Liverpool Crown Court yesterday, Monday 9 September.

An arrest warrant was issued at court for 28-year-old Adam Bennett following his earlier conviction for domestic abuse offences, namely engaging in controlling behaviour.

Bennett, from Scarisbrick Drive in Norris Green, is described as white, 6ft tall, of medium build and has blue eyes, brown receding hair and a beard.

Inspector Jane Moreau from Merseyside Police's Fugitive Team said: "Extensive enquiries are ongoing to locate Bennett since the warrant was issued yesterday.

"Please share his image as far and wide as possible, to ensure he doesn't come into contact with any unsuspecting women. Bennett is regarded as a dangerous and violent individual so I would urge anyone who has seen him or has any information to come forward immediately and help us remove him from the streets."

Please contact 999 if you come across Bennett, or if you have any other information, message @MerPolCC or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Women who have been victims of domestic abuse can also call 0808 2000 247, the 24-hour National Domestic Violence helpline.
