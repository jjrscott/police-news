We have arrested a man in Anfield who was wanted after he failed to appear in court charged with offences including rape and false imprisonment.

Police attended a house on Argyle Road at 10.40am on Thursday 24 September and arrested Kamil Lesiak, 24, of no fixed address.

He had been wanted for failing to attend court on 1 July 2020 after being charged with rape, false imprisonment, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and causing a man to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.

Lesiak has been remanded in custody to appear at Liverpool Magistrates Court on Friday 25 September.
