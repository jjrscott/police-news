Recognise these men? Detectives think they may have information to assist an investigation into attempted drug supply into prison.

At around 1pm on Wednesday 14 October, a package was brought into DHL on Estuary Boulevard, Speke, addressed to a prisoner at HMP Manchester.

Staff at the location searched the package and suspected cannabis was found hidden inside. Enquiries have been ongoing.

Detective Inspector Jennie Beck said: "If you know either of these men, come forward as we think they may hold vital information to assist our investigation.

"Thanks to the vigilance of staff at DHL, this package was intercepted and we work closely with prisons, delivery companies and other partners to ensure that drugs and other items are identified within the postal and prison systems, and of of those responsible are put before the courts."

Anyone with information on suspected drug supply is asked to contact us via our social media desk @MerPolCC on Twitter or 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook.
