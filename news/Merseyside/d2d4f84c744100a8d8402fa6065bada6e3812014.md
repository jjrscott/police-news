We're appealing for the public's help in tracing a 17-year-old male who is missing from home.

Anh Tran was last seen in Kenmare Road, Wavertree on Monday, 4 January.

He is a Vietnamese male, around 5ft 1in tall, of slim build, with dark brown hair and brown eyes. He does not speak English.

When last seen, Anh was wearing a red hoodie, a black polo shirt and blue skinny jeans. He was carrying a black Adidas bag.

We are becoming increasingly concerned for Anh's whereabouts and anyone who has seen him is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 or the charity Missing People on 116 000.
