Do you know this man? We would like to speak to him after a man was assaulted in a shop in Waterloo.

We were contacted at 6.35pm on Saturday 19th October 2019 following reports a man had been assaulted inside the Iceland store on South Road.

The man, aged 37, suffered cuts and bruising to his head during the incident.

We have issued CCTV footage of a man we would like to speak to as we believe he may have information which could assist with our investigation. It is not believed the man was responsible for the assault but may be able to help with our ongoing enquiries.

Detective Inspector Cat Walsh said: "Thankfully the man was not seriously injured but was left shaken by the incident.

"Prior to entering the store he reported that he had been verbally abused by a group of males in the street. A short time later he was assaulted in the Iceland store in what was an unprovoked attack.

"I would appeal to anyone who recognises the man pictured or the man himself to come forward and speak to us."

Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 19100607632.
