We're appealing for information after shots were fired at a house in West Derby this morning, Saturday, 31 October.

At 11.25am, a report was received that the window of a house in Culme Road had been shot at. Officers attended and damage consistent with a firearm being discharged was found. No one was injured during the incident.

An investigation is underway and patrols remain in the area to carry out witness, CCTV and forensic enquiries. Anyone with information is asked to get in touch.

Detective Chief Inspector Cath Haggerty said: "We are in the very early stages of an investigation following a firearms discharge this morning and will remain in the area to provide reassurance to the community and gather information.

"The use of weapons on our streets will not be tolerated and we know this will be an alarming incident for local residents. An extensive investigation will be carried out and we are determined to find the person responsible and remove firearms from our streets.

""If you saw or heard anything suspicious in Culme Road or the surrounding area, or may have captured home CCTV or dashcam footage, please come forward as any information could be vital to the investigation."

Anyone with information can contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC, or 101 with reference 20000660430. You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
