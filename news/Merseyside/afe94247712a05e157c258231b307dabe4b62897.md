Proactive patrol leads to recovery of 33 cannabis plants and thousands of pounds in cash from a flat on Catharine Street in Liverpool.

Officers attended the block of flats just before 11pm yesterday evening (17th Feb) following information suggesting cannabis was being grown inside.

They noticed a strong smell of cannabis coming from one of the flats so they forced entry inside where they detained a 40 year old man - he was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply cannabis, production of cannabis and possession of criminal property as a large quantity of dried cannabis, plants and Â£10,000 were all seized.

He was taken to custody and has since been released pending further enquiries.

D/Sgt Philip Ryan said: "This is a good result and means that more harmful substances have been taken out of circulation in Liverpool.

"The proactivity of Operation Target means that we have dedicated patrols and are able to locate criminals more effectively. In addition to this, we rely on the information given to us by the public, so please continue to share your concerns and we will do everything we can to investigate crime taking place in your area whilst bringing offenders to justice."
