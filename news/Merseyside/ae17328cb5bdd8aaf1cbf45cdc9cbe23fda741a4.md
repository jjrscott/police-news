We are warning of the risks posed by cannabis farms after a fire at a house containing one in Halewood on Monday (14 October 2019).

Police received a report of the fire on Boundary Farm Road just before 11pm.

Officers seized 100 cannabis plants in the property, and the farm would have had an estimated annual yield of Â£400,000. Growing equipment was also recovered and an investigation is continuing.

Chief Inspector Philip Mullally said: "Fortunately there are no reports of any injuries, but significant damage has been caused to the rented property.

"This incident is a sad reminder of the unpredictable nature of cannabis farms.

"After an assessment by Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service, we believe this fire was caused by an electrical fault.

"It just goes to show that cannabis farms pose very serious risks not just to anyone inside them, but to neighbouring residents too.

"Those criminals who set up cannabis farms will tamper with electricity to avoid detection, set up their own electrical systems and overload sockets. Their actions are reckless and they don't care that the lives and wellbeing of other members of the public are being put at risk.

"Electricity and water are never a good combination, and the fire service have seen an increase in the number of fires they have been called to as a result of fires caused by the crude systems put in place by the people who set up these farms.

"My question to residents in Merseyside is simple - would you want to live next to such a house, that is putting you and your family at risk?

"If you know or suspect there is a cannabis farm on your street, do the right thing and contact police."

If you suspect someone is growing cannabis in your community, DM @MerPolCC or contact us on Facebook Merseyside Police Contact Centre. You can also call 101 quoting incident reference 1318 of 14 October or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.

Things to look out for if you suspect cannabis is being grown:
o Strange smells and sounds
o Heat from an adjoining property
o Windows sealed and covered
o Curtains permanently closed
o Frequent visitors to a property, often at unusual times
Together, these activities could indicate potential cannabis farms in your community.
