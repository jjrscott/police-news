Detectives in Sefton are appealing for information following an armed robbery in Bootle this afternoon, Tuesday 6 October.

At 3.50pm, officers were called to Done Bookmakers on Hawthorne Road to reports of a man having entered in possession of a firearm and made threats to staff, before taking a quantity of cash. Nobody was injured although staff and witnesses were shocked, and are providing statements. Witness, CCTV and forensic enquiries continue.

The suspect is described as white, aged 20-25, with a neck warmer covering his face, a hood up and a dark tracksuit, riding a pedal cycle.

Detective Inspector Paul Gillies said: "For someone to use a firearm to threaten people while they carry out their business is despicable and we are carrying out extensive enquiries this evening. The staff and witnesses present were understandably shocked to see such an incident.

"If you were also in or around the bookmakers at the time and saw the incident or someone matching the suspect's description riding off, come forward if you haven't already done so. Your description, CCTV, dashcam or other information could be the key to finding the person responsible and removing them from the community.

"We work closely with all businesses to ensure they are as safe as possible and will being doing all in our powers to bring this offender to justice."
