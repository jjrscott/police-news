Do you know this man? We would like to speak to him in connection with an assault on a bus driver in Walton.

At around 10.20pm on Friday 6th December the victim was driving the number 20 Stagecoach bus close to the junction of Breeze Hill and County Road in Walton when a male passenger became aggressive towards him and started punching the safety Perspex glass in the driver's cab.

The man then punched the driver in the face before the driver managed to get the male off the bus and lock the doors. The driver suffered an injury to his eye and leg during the incident.

We have issued CCTV images of a man who we believe could assist with our investigation.

Anyone who recognises the man or has any information which could assist the investigation is asked to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 19100714548.
