Detectives investigating an assault in Southport are issuing a new appeal for witnesses to come forward.

On Wednesday 13 January at around 5.10pm, officers were called to Lord Street to reports of a man in his 50s being wounded with a machete-type weapon.

The victim is recovering in hospital while police carry out ongoing CCTV, witness and forensic enquiries.

Detective Chief Inspector Simon Hurst said: "We're keen to speak to anyone who saw this incident or has heard any information since. It is reported that four males dressed in black made off in the direction off Stanley Street after attacking the victim near to the junction of Lord Street and Bold Street.

"Anyone who was driving in the area around 5pm may have important dash cam footage which could help our investigation. Likewise anyone with local CCTV is encouraged to come forward and help us identify what happened."
