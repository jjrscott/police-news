We are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a man sustained head injuries in an assault in Kirkby on Monday night (14 September).

Officers were called to Langton Road at 6.40pm to reports three males damaged the front window of a house, before attacking a 25-year-old man who came out to see what had happened.

The victim was reportedly struck with bike seats, and his mobile phone was taken after it fell to the ground.

He was taken to hospital for treatment where he is in a serious but stable condition.

The offenders were described as being around 13-17 years old and were reportedly wearing black hoodies with their hoods up, and face coverings. It is believed they arrived and left the scene on bicycles.

Officers attended and house to house enquiries have been carried out and CCTV opportunities in the area explored.

Detective Inspector Tony O'Brien said: "This was a shocking attack on a man who had every right to spend the evening at home, and has instead spent a night in hospital being treated for serious head injuries.

"We are determined to find and bring to justice all of those involved, and urge anyone who saw anything or has heard who was responsible to do the right thing and contact police. If you don't feel comfortable speaking to us, you can let Crimestoppers know anonymously."

Anyone who witnessed three males acting suspiciously or saw any part of the incident are urged to contact police. You can DM us on Twitter via @MerPolCC or message us on Facebook at 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre'. Alternatively, call 101 quoting incident reference 20000556807 or contact the independent charity @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their website: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously
