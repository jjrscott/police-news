We are appealing for information following a burglary in Wyke Road, Prescot last month.

Officers were called after two men had been seen attempting to break into houses along the road on 1st May just before 1am. The two men managed to gain access through the rear patio doors of one property, however were disturbed by the home owners house alarm being activated.

Thankfully no one was harmed and nothing has been reported as being stolen, however residents remain hugely concerned for their own safety, knowing that these two men could be out committing further crimes.

Officers have been busy carrying out house to house enquiries and other investigations to try and identify the men, however have had no luck as of yet.

If you have any information, please get in touch quoting: **20000250484.**
