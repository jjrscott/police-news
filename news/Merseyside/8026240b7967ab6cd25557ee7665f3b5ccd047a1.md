Recognise this man? Officers think he may have information following the theft of a poppy appeal tin from a Liverpool City Centre shop on Tuesday 10 November.

At around midday, a charity tin was stolen from WH Smith in South John Street by an unknown man who used a lighter to burn string securing the box and poppies, before concealing them and leaving. Enquiries are ongoing and officers think the man pictured may have information to assist.

Detective Inspector Jennie Beck said: "If you recognise this man please let us know.

"To steal from any charity is completely reprehensible and we're determined to find the person responsible."
