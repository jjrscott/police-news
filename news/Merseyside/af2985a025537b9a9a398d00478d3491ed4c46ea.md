Yesterday, 2ND September, our Liverpool #OpTarget team took to the #Kirkdale area to undertake a day of action aimed at deterring organised crime and ASB.

Sgt Tom Griffiths said "Yesterdays activity comes as a response to community concerns and intelligence. We conduct these days of action to proactively target criminals in specific areas. Deployments and the tactics we use are based on lots of analysis and investigative work to ensure the most effective ways to identify those causing fear in our communities or who we suspect to be involved in gang crime or serious violence."

On this occasion, high visibility patrols on foot conducting warrants and open land searches, as well as traffic enforcement teams were used.

Open land searches took place around Commercial Road and around the Liverpool/Leeds canal embankments. Here, officers recovered a knife, iron bars and a stolen City Bike.

On the roads, officers issued a number of notices for driving offences, in addition to arresting two men in their 40s, both for drug driving after one was stopped on Fountains Road and the other on Fonthill Road. Both men failed roadside drugs tests and were taken to custody.

Following this, a 46 year old woman, wanted on warrant was arrested. She was detained at her home address on Everton Valley and taken to Sefton Magistrates Court.

Later in the evening, officers conducted warrants at addresses on Breeze Hill in relation to Class A drug dealing and on Beversbrook Road, where a 36 year old woman, also wanted on warrant in relation to a drug driving offence, was arrested.

Sgt Griffiths continued: "With your help, we are locating offenders, weapons and illegal substances and making the area a safer place for the wider community. Deployments like these will continue and we will use a variety of tactics to bring offenders to justice."

Anyone that knows someone involved in serious violence or wants to report something to us, please contact us @MerPolCC or call @CrimestoppersUK anonymously.
