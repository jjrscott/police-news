We are appealing for help in finding a 23 year-old woman who is missing from home in Bootle.

Caitlin Baxendale was last seen in St Philips Avenue at 10pm on Monday 28th December.

She is described as a white female, 5ft 2in tall, of medium build with shoulder length brown hair and green eyes.

It is believed she may be wearing jeans, boots and either a dark coat with a fur hood or a flowery coat.

She also has links to the Leeds area.

Anyone who has seen Caitlin or knows of his whereabouts is asked to DM @MerPolCC or contact @missingpeople on 116 000.
