We would like to speak to this man who may have information that could assist an investigation into a burglary at a clothes shop in Liverpool city centre in October.

It was reported in the early hours of 11 October that an offender had forced entry to the front door of a clothes store on Queens Avenue before taking clothes, including wedding suits, and making off on foot. The clothes were later recovered and returned to the shop.

Officers carried out house to house enquiries, and checked the area for any CCTV opportunities.

Anyone who recognises the man pictured or who has information on the incident should contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre'. You can also call 101 quoting incident reference 19100588812 or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their website here: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously
