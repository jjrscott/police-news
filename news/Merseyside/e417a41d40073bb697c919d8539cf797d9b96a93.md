We're appealing for information following a sexual assault in Toxteth in February.

At around 9.30pm on Wednesday, 26 February, a woman in her 20's was waiting by a bus stop on Ullet Road, near Princes Park, when she was approached by a man.

It was reported the man tried to engage in conversation with her, before touching her inappropriately a number of times. He ran off in the direction of Devonshire Road and the victim called the police.

The offender is described as a dark skinned male in his 40's, around 5ft 9in tall, of skinny build wearing a dark coat and jeans. He had one smaller tooth next to his front teeth and had a Tesco carrier bag.

Detective Inspector Phil Atkinson: "We are carrying out a number of enquires to locate the offender and would ask anyone with information, or CCTV or dashcam from Ullet Road, Devonshire Road or the surrounding areas to please get in touch.

"This would've no doubt been an incredibly distressing ordeal for the victim and we are working to ensure the person responsible is removed from our streets."

If you have any information, CCTV or dashcam footage, please contact @MerPolCC, 101 quoting ref. 20000124754 or @CrimestoppersUK, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
