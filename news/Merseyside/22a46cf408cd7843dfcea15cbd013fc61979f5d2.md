Detectives investigating a suspected arson in Birkenhead on Sunday (16 August) are issuing footage of two males who may have information to assist enquiries.

At around 5.10pm, police and Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service (MFRS) were called to Corporation Road at the junction with Pool Street to reports of vehicles alight on a car park.

Road closures were put in place and the fire was extinguished. A joint investigation with MFRS is ongoing.

No injuries were caused but three cars and a caravan were reportedly damaged.

Detective Inspector Nick Suffield said: "The footage shows two males in the vicinity of where the incident took place and, although filmed from a distance, we're hopeful that their appearance and clothing may prompt them, or people who know them, to come forward.

"Likewise, if you were in the area around 5pm or passing in a vehicle and captured anything on dashcam or other devices, come forward as this too could prove vital in finding those responsible and putting them before the courts. This incident could have resulted in injuries or worse, and we're determined to get to the bottom of what happened."
