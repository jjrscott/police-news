We have arrested a man after a report of a racially aggravated assault at a pub in Birkenhead on Sunday (19 January 2020).

A report was received at about 9.15pm that a group of people were fighting at The Firemans Arms pub. It was alleged several men had been punched to the head.

It was reported the offenders directed racial abuse at one of the victims.

Officers attended and a 30-year-old man from Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire was arrested on suspicion of assault. He was further arrested on suspicion of assault of an emergency worker after being taken into custody, and has since been released under investigation.

Detective inspector Tara Denn said: "The Birkenhead community will be understandably shocked to hear about this incident.

"Merseyside is renowned for being a welcoming place, and there is absolutely no place for hate crime of this nature here, or anywhere in society.

"We know from speaking to victims what a huge impact it has on them. All our communities have a right to be treated with fairness, dignity and respect and we work closely with our partners to eradicate hate crime in all its appalling forms.

"Victims can report directly to us where experienced hate crime officers will treat them with sensitivity and compassion, or via third party reporting centres in fire stations, citizen advice bureaus and hospitals where the information will be passed on."
