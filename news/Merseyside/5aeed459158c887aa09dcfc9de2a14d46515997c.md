Officers from our Liverpool #OpTarget Team have yesterday (1st December) conducted a drugs warrant following intelligence being received by concerned members of the community.

The warrant took place on Newcombe Street, Liverpool at around 7:30am. Inside the property, officers found four growing rooms with approximately 70 cannabis plants, lighting equipment and a watering system.

Eran Zekal 27, of no fixed address was arrested at the scene and has since been charged with producing a controlled Class B drug. He appeared at Liverpool Crown Court this morning (2nd December).

Anyone that knows of other people involved in the supply of distribution of any drug, should get in touch @MerPolCC or by contacting @CrimestoppersUK anonymously.
