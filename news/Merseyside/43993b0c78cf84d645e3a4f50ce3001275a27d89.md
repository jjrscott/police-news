We're appealing for the public's help in finding Kieron Carson, who is missing from home.

Kieron, aged 34, was last seen in Freckleton Drive, Kirkby at around 1.30pm yesterday, Friday, 26 February.

He is described as a white male, around 5ft 6in tall, of medium build, with brown shaven hair.

When last seen, Kieron was wearing a black Under Armour hoody, black bottoms and grey and white trainers.

He is known to frequent areas of Kirkby and Ormskirk.

We are becoming increasingly concerned for Kieron's whereabouts and anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or charity Missing People on 116 000.
