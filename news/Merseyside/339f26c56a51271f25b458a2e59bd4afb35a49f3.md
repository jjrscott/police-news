We have seized cash and suspected Class A drugs after executing a warrant an address in Crosby today, Tuesday 16th February.

Officers attended at a property on Alexandra Road this morning and recovered approximately Â£9000 in cash, over 800 bags of suspected street deals of cocaine, a kilo of adulterant, a cocaine purity testing kit and large quantities of cannabis bush.

Enquiries are ongoing.

The warrant was executed as part of the national Operation Venetic.

Sefton Community Policing Superintendent Graeme Robson said: "Our work to target those who supply and distribute drugs remains ongoing.

"Today's successful warrant means that we have removed large quantities of Class A drugs which were destined to be sold on the streets of Merseyside.

"An investigation is ongoing and we will continue to work closely with partner forces up and down the country, as well as North West Regional Organised Crime Unit and the National Crime Agency, to protect our communities and prevent harmful drugs from reaching our streets.

"We cannot do this without the help of the public and would urge anyone with information on the supply of drugs or individuals involved in serious and organised crime, to please get in touch, either directly through us or through Crimestoppers, completely anonymously."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
