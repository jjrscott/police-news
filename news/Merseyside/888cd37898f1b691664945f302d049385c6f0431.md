Detectives are appealing for information after a man was assaulted in Rainhill yesterday afternoon, Monday 15 February.

At around 12.20pm, a report was received of a man in his 50s being assaulted on a pathway between the golf course and clubhouse at Blundells Hill Golf Course on Blundells Lane.

The victim was approached by three males and knocked to the floor, before being kicked to the face and ribs. The suspects walked back towards the clubhouse and the victim made his way home before police were called. He was taken to hospital for assessment of facial, neck and rib injuries.

The suspects were described as wearing dark clothing. Two were described as in their late teens with dark hair and strong scouse accents. The third was described as mid-30s, bald with shaven head and wearing glasses, also with a strong scouse accent.

CCTV enquiries are ongoing.

Detective Inspector Leanne Hobin said: "This was an appalling and completely unprovoked attack and we're determined to find all of those responsible and put them before the courts. The victim is in hospital and was extremely distressed to be set upon in this way. We will be supporting him as enquiries continue.

"If you were in the area of the golf club at this time and saw or heard anything, or captured these three males on CCTV or dashcam, please come forward and we will do the rest."
