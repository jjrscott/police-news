****Update: Officers have arrested one person on suspicion of Section 18 assault in relation to the stabbing in St Helens. He has been taken to custody for questioning****

Officers are currently in attendance of Marshalls Cross Road, St Helens this evening (5th November) following reports that a 17 year old man suffered stab wounds.

We were called shortly after 7.30pm to reports of an altercation on the grass verge by the roadway. A 17 year old male was treated by ambulance staff and has since been taken to hospital where his condition is described as serious but non life threatening.

T/Superintendent Paddy Kelly said: "Although this incident did not happen at the fireworks display, it is still shocking which again, although is believed to be targeted, has taken place in an area where there are undoubtedly lots of innocent children and members of the public wondering around.

"This is currently a live investigation and officers at the scene are working with security staff to secure the area, analyse CCTV and conduct forensic analysis and urge anyone with information to come forward quoting log 1051 of 5th November. We cannot have this sort of reckless and brutal behaviour and we will do everything we can to bring the offenders to justice."

Please call 101, DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK with any information.
