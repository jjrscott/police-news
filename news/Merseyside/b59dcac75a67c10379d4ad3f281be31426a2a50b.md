We have arrested five people on suspicion of firearms offences following an incident in Waterloo last night, Sunday 13 December.

At around 8.55pm, armed police were called to Oxford Road to reports of a person sighted in possession of a firearm. Five people were detained in a nearby property and have been arrested on suspicion of possession of a Section 1 firearm.

A 22-year-old woman from Seaforth; a 28-year-old man of no fixed abode; a 20-year-old man from Runcorn; a 26-year-old woman from Waterloo; and a 29-year-old man from Formby were all taken to police stations for questioning.

Enquiries remain ongoing this morning, including an area search.

Detective Chief Inspector Gayle Rooney said: "Our enquiries are continuing to establish what happened but I want to assure people living locally that nobody was harmed in this incident and acting on all information we have, we're determined to identify any criminal offences and put those involved before the courts."
