Detectives have arrested and charged two men in connection with burglary and other offences following an incident in St Helens yesterday, Wednesday 16 September.

At around 5am, officers were called to Knowsley Road to reports of a burglary, in which electrical and other items were stolen. The burglary is believed to have happened at some time overnight and was discovered in the morning.

A Citroen C4 was also stolen from outside the property but this vehicle was recovered on Prescot Road, having reportedly collided with parked cars.

Following enquiries, two men were arrested and have since been charged as follows:

19-year-old Liam Rigby of North Road was charged with burglary dwelling and theft; and handling stolen goods.
27-year-old Nathan Murphy of no fixed abode was charged with burglary dwelling and theft; handling stolen goods; and criminal damage.

Both men were remanded in custody and will appear at St Helens Adult Remand Court, Derby Square, Liverpool today (Thursday 17 September).

Anyone with information on suspected burglary is asked to call 999 if a crime is in progress, or you can pass information via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre', or the independent charity @CrimestoppersUK anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
