Detectives have launched a murder investigation after a man who was injured during a serious assault in St Helens passed away in hospital.

Warren Glover, 33, was assaulted at around 10.15pm on Saturday 13 June in French Street at its junction with Thomas Street in Thatto Heath.

He was taken to hospital where he sadly passed away on Tuesday, 7th July.

Detectives have now launched a murder investigation and want to appeal to any witnesses to come forward.

Detective Chief Inspector Craig Sumner said: "Warren sadly passed away earlier this week as a result of injuries he sustained during that attack and we are determined to find the person or people responsible and bring them to justice.

"We would ask anyone who was in the area of French Street or Thomas Street on the evening of 13th June, or captured footage on CCTV or dashcam to let us know.

"We think that a number of people may have been involved in this assault, and may have turned up in a grey Kia Sportage vehicle in possession of weapons. We're determined to identify all of these people and put them before the courts.

"Extensive enquiries are underway and we are working with our colleagues in neighbouring police forces.

"I would ask if you hold any information about the incident, the vehicle mentioned or anything else, to come forward so that we can take positive action."

A 28-year-old woman and a 41 year-old man who were previously arrested on suspicion of Section 18 wounding with intent have been released on conditional bail pending further enquiries.

A 54 year-old woman was also interviewed under caution yesterday in connection with the incident.

Anyone who has information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, with reference number 20000344324, or via their website here: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously
