Detectives, working alongside Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service (MFRS), are investigating the suspected arsons of two cars in Anfield in the early hours of this morning, Tuesday 17 September.

At around 2.50am, emergency services were called to Lynholme Road to reports of a Vauxhall Corsa on fire. Around the same time, a Ford Focus was found alight on nearby Hildebrand Road. Damage was caused to both cars but nobody was injured.

CCTV, witness and forensic enquiries are ongoing in connection with both offences.

Detective Inspector Sean Kelly-Martland said: "At this early stage we believe that these offences may be linked, but enquiries are ongoing to find out exactly what happened and the reasons behind it.

"The consequences of these reckless acts could have been so much worse for those living nearby in the community, so if you saw or heard anything suspicious, or have home CCTV, come forward as soon as possible and we will take positive action to remove those responsible from your streets."

Anyone with information can contact @MerPolCC with reference 19100527180 or you can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
