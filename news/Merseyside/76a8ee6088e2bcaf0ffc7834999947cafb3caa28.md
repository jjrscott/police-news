We arrested a man after it was reported two cars were set on fire outside a house in Formby in the early hours of today (Tuesday 31 March 2020).

Merseyside Police and Merseyside Fire & Rescue Service were called at 2.30am to a report two vehicles outside a property on Queens Road had been set light. The fire also damaged the front door of the property.

A 46-year-old man from Sefton has since been arrested on suspicion of arson. He has been taken to a police station to be interviewed about the incident.

A joint police and fire service investigation is ongoing.
