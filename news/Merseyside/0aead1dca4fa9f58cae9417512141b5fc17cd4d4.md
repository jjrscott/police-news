We are appealing for witnesses after a collision in Southport this evening, Friday 26 March.

At around 4.25pm, a police car signalled for the rider of a Suzuki motorbike to stop on Norwood Road. The bike continued to the junction of Peel Street where it was involved in a collision with a black Ford Fiesta, which was in turn in collision with a white Ford Transit van.

The rider of the bike, a 27-year-old man, and the pillion passenger, a 22-year-old man, were taken to hospital. The rider is being treated for serious but non-life-threatening injuries, and the passenger is being treated for minor injuries.

No-one else was injured in the collision.

The Force's Roads Policing Unit has now opened a full investigation.

Roads Policing Sergeant Mat Shaw said: "We're asking anyone who was travelling along Norwood Road, Sussex Road or the surrounding area around the time of this incident to get in touch. It might be that you have CCTV, dash cam or other footage which may have captured the collision and can assist us with our enquiries."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, with reference 21000193400.
