Officers have arrested a man and seized drugs, cash, and weapons following a warrant in St Helens last night, Thursday 21 November.

A drugs warrant was carried out at an address in Junction Lane, and suspected cocaine and heroin were seized, in addition to cash, two CS sprays, a knuckle duster, lock knife and suspected stolen items. A man was detained at the scene.

A 29-year-old man from St Helens was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply drugs; possession of a Section 5 firearm; possession of criminal property; and handling stolen goods.

He was taken to a police station for questioning and has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

St Helens Inspector Neil Birkett said: "As the photo shows, last night's warrant located drugs and weapons, all of which have the potential to cause serious harm within our communities. We're determined to keep removing these items and those we believe are storing, carrying and using weapons from our streets.

"Positive action like this is often the result of information provided you, so keep coming forward with what you know and we will respond."
