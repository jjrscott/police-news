We have today, Friday 13th September, welcomed the sentencing of a 32-year-old man for manslaughter in Southport.

James Peter Gelling, of Hampton Road, Southport, assaulted 51 year-old Ventsislav Marginov, on Lord Street in the town on the evening of Saturday 1 June this year.

Mr Marginov, a Bulgarian national who was resident in Southport, sadly died in hospital three days later.

Gelling admitted manslaughter at an earlier court hearing and was today sentenced

at Liverpool Crown Court.to six years in jail plus an extended four years on licence.

Detective Inspector Gary Stratton said: "This was a particularly nasty and violent assault on an innocent man who had been out earlier in the evening with his two sons watching the Champions League final.

"Mr Marginov sadly never recovered from the injuries he suffered and he died in hospital.

"His family, and in particular his parents who still live in Bulgaria, have been left devastated by their loss and the senseless manner in which he died.

"Sadly no sentence, however long, will be able to bring him back, but I hope the knowledge that Gelling will be spending a considerable time behind bars will bring them a sense of closure and allow them to begin the grieving process."
