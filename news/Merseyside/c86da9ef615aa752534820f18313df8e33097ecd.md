Police set up a temporary cordon in Anfield today (Sunday 28 March) following a false report a suspect item had been seen.

Officers were called at about 10.45am after the item was seen on Walton Breck Road.

A cordon was put in place while enquiries were carried out, but it was quickly established that the report was false but made with good intent.

The item did not pose any danger and the road was re-opened at 11.15am.

We would like to thank members of the public who avoided the cordoned area while the incident was dealt with.
