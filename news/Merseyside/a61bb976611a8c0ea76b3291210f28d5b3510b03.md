We are appealing for information following a collision involving a car and a pedestrian on Prescot Road in St Helens.

We were contacted at around 11pm on Saturday 26th December following reports of the collision.

The pedestrian, a man in his 20s, was taken to hospital with serious injuries. He has since sadly passed away in hospital.

The driver of the car stopped at the scene and is assisting with enquiries.

Officers are appealing for anyone who was in the area of Prescot Road who saw the collision or has any information which could assist the investigation to call the Roads Policing Unit on 0151 777 5747, message our social media desk @MerPolCC, or call 101 quoting reference number 20000784830.

The family of the pedestrian have asked for privacy at this time.
