We are appealing for witnesses following a road traffic collision in Southport this afternoon, Friday 15 November.

At 2.25pm, emergency services were called to Marshside Road to reports of a collision between a Peugeot and a bicycle. The male cyclist has been taken to hospital for assessment of a head injury. The driver of the car stopped to assist.

Road closures are currently in place at Marshside Road at the junction of Marine Drive and the junction of Fleetwood Road. Road users are asked to avoid the area and take an alternative route.

Anyone who witnessed the incident is asked to contact @MerpolCC or 101 with reference 526.
