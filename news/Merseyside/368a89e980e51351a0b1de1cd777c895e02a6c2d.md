We can confirm that emergency services are in Maghull following a serious RTC this morning, Thursday 1 April.

At around 6.40am, we were called to Liverpool Road South to reports of a collision involving a bus and a female pedestrian.

The pedestrian has been taken to hospital for assessment of a head injury and enquiries continue.

Road closures are in place at the junction of Liverpool Road South/Northway; Liverpool Road South with Hall Lane (roundabout by the Meadows pub). Northway is down to one lane citybound. Please avoid the area where possible.
