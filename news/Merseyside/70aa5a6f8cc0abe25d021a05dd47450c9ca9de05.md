We arrested three males after a report a car and dogs were stolen in a burglary at a house in Old Swan on Sunday afternoon (18 October).

Officers were called to Derwent Road West just after 2.25pm where it was reported a group of males had forced entry through a back door, with one carrying what appeared to be a firearm and another a knife.

The males demanded cash and jewellery while making threats, before leaving with a number of American Bulldogs and a silver VW Golf car that was parked outside.

They left in the VW Gold and a white Ford Focus in the direction of Green Lane.

None of the occupants sustained injuries, but have been left extremely shaken by the ordeal.

The VW Golf was later located abandoned on Cotswold Street and will be forensically examined.

The Ford Focus, which was found to have been stolen in a previous incident, was reported to have been in a collision with a van on Sheil Road at around 3.45pm and will also be forensically examined.

Three males were detained by officers and taken into custody.

Two men, aged 23 and 42 from Liverpool, remain in custody. The third male was de-arrested.

Efforts are ongoing to locate any outstanding suspects.

Several of the dogs have been recovered and enuqiries to establish the whereabouts of the others are ongoing.

House to house enquiries are being carried out and officers are exploring any CCTV opportunities in the area.

Anyone with information or who may have dashcam footage is asked to contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre'.
