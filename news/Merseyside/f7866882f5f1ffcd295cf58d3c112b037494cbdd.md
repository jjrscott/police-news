Updated News Post

We are appealing for information after a 23-year-old man was assaulted in St Helens in the early hours of this morning (Saturday, 11 July 2020).

Officers received reports that a man had been assaulted and when they attended they found that the victim, who had suffered stab wounds to his stomach and head and had also been hit with a pool queue.

The victim was taken to hospital where he is being treated for his injuries, which are not life threatening.

A 19-year-old man from Newton-le-Willows has been arrested on suspicion of Section 18 wounding. He will be questioned by detectives.

It is believed that the victim and a friend were walking along Merton Bank Road just before 4.20am when a red car pulled up alongside them and three men got out and assaulted him. One of the males armed with a knife is believed to have stabbed the victim, whilst another male hit him with a pool cue. Following the assault the three men drove off in the car towards Haresfinch.

Officers are keen to speak to anyone who may have seen a red saloon car being driven erratically in the area shortly before or after the incident to contact them. They would also like to speak to anyone who may have CCTV/dashcam footage that may help with their inquiries.

You can DM @merpol CC, or call 101 quoting reference 0176 of 11 July, or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
