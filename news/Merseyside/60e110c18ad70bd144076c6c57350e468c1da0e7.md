Police have arrested two men and a woman on suspicion of drugs offences after a stop search in Kirkby yesterday, Wednesday 31 March.

Shortly before 3.20pm, officers on patrol were alerted to a grey Ford Kuga on Elstead Road. Police conducted a search on the vehicle due to a strong smell of cannabis, and the passenger attempted to make off before being detained by officers.

Following a search on the passenger's home address, officers recovered a large amount of suspected heroin and cocaine.

The two men - aged 22 and 40 - and the woman aged 21 - were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs, and possession of a Class B drug. They have been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Detective Chief Inspector Simon Vaughan said: "This is a great proactive arrest and shows what recoveries can be made following a stop search.

"We work continuously on the streets of Merseyside to stop potential drug dealers from harming people in our communities, and we'd urge anyone with information to reach out to us."
