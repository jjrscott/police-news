We are appealing for information following reports that two elderly ladies had money stolen while shopping in the Liscard area.

In the first incident a woman in her 80s was approached by a male who asked her for change as she shopped in the Cherry Tree shopping centre at around 10.45am on Tuesday 16th March. While she was distracted £90 was taken from her handbag.

In the second incident at around 10.35am today, Thursday 18th March, an elderly woman was shopping on Liscard Way when she was approached by a male who asked her to change a £2 coin. While she was distracted £180 was taken from her.

In both incidents the male is described as being around 5ft 11in tall, of average build with dark hair and wearing black clothing.

Enquiries are ongoing to establish if the two incidents are linked and CCTV enquiries have been carried out in the local area.

Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111.
