Detectives are appealing for information following a robbery in Kirkdale on Monday 16 September.

At 9pm, officers were made aware of an incident in Summer Seat, to a report that a man in his 80's had been assaulted and robbed.

He was threatened by a male who took his house keys and also attempted to take his shopping bag. The 81-year-old was kicked and also suffered minor injuries to his knuckles, leaving him extremely distressed.

The ambulance service were called to the victim's home address to treat his injuries.

Detective Inspector Sean Kelly-Martland said: "We're keen to hear from anyone who witnessed this appalling incident.

"The victim and his family have been left understandably shaken by this ordeal, and I want to reassure them and the local community that we will take action on all the information you provide.

"It is despicable to think that the offender targeted a vulnerable man in this way, and I know the wider community will share our disgust.

Anyone with information can contact us @MerPolCC, call 101 with reference 19100528703 or @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111.
