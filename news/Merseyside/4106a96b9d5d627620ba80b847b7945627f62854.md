We have today, Monday, 24 February, welcomed the sentencing of a man for a stabbing in Belle Vale last year.

At around 11.30am on Monday 7 October, it was reported that a man had entered the Jobcentre on Childwall Valley Road, before making threats towards a female member of staff. A security guard intervened and asked him to leave, before he was stabbed by the offender. Emergency services attended and the victim, a man in his 40s, was taken to hospital for treatment to a serious but non-life-threatening injury to his back.

Following enquiries, 19-year-old Brendan Cole from Lee Park Avenue, Gateacre was arrested and charged with section 18 wounding with intent, assault by beating and possession of an offensive weapon in a public place.

Cole admitted the offences and was today sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court to five years and three months in prison.

Detective Constable Tom Patterson said: "To be attacked in such a way while simply carrying out your job is despicable and it is extremely fortunate that the consequences weren't fatal.

"There is never an acceptable reason for carrying a knife and I hope Cole now takes time to reflect on his reckless actions that day.

"The use of knives will not be tolerated by Merseyside Police and we will continue to work closely with communities, partners, parents and guardians to educate young people on the dangers of knife crime."

Anyone with information on knife crime or the storage of weapons can contact @MerPolCC, 101 or @CrimestoppersUK, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
