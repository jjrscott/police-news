Detectives in Liverpool are investigating following a firearms discharge in Toxteth this afternoon (Sunday, 9 August.)

Officers were called to Malt Street at around 2.45pm, to reports males on a pedal bike had fired shots in the area. There are no reports of anyone being injured.

The scene has been cordoned off for forensic examination. House to house enquiries have begun and CCTV from the area is being examined.

Local Policing Chief Inspector Andy Creer said: "Following today's incident and the shooting incident in this area earlier this week, we understand that local residents may be concerned.

"We will again be implementing a Section 60 order in this area from 5pm this afternoon, allowing us enhanced stop and search powers and patrols have also been stepped up.

"We are working hard to trace those responsible for these incidents and again are appealing for public information - thankfully on this occasion no-one has been injured, however we need to trace the person(s) responsible to ensure this does not happen again. I'd appeal to anyone in this community, who has any information about this incident to get in contact, so that we can bring the person(s) to justice and make this community a safer place to live."

Anyone with any information about this incident can DM @MerPolCC or call 101. You can also contact @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111.
