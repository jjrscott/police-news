Working with Liverpool Football Club, we have arrested two men following an ongoing operation targeting ticket touts selling match tickets at inflated prices.

Officers attended the Throstles Nest pub on Scotland Road after information was received that fan cards were being sold at the premises.

Following a search of the building, the two men were located in a back room and detained by officers.

A 26-year-old from Kensington and a 36-year-old from Fetcham, Surrey were arrested on suspicion of selling a ticket for a designated football match. They have been released under investigation.

Superintendent Diane Pownall said: "We believe the majority of ticket touts target visitors to the city who have little or no experience of purchasing tickets, so may not be aware that the prices they are paying are vastly inflated or that the way they have been sold is illegal.

"In many cases it is the trip of a lifetime for people. In this case, buyers had travelled from as far afield as Malaysia, the USA and Australia. But their passion and eagerness to watch their team was exploited by unscrupulous touts."

Superintendent Pownall added: "For fans to be ripped off in this way - whether fans have travelled from near or far - is completely unacceptable.

"Our activities to target touts will continue on future match days, working closely with the club.

"I hope arrests such as these serve as a powerful deterrent in the future. We'll keep identifying ticket touts and doing all we can to prevent them from ruining people's experience of football and the city.

"Liverpool welcomes many thousands of tourists every week and we are determined to ensure that those who come to our city have a safe and enjoyable time protected from such fraud.

"Our advice to any supporters is clear: don't buy from ticket touts. It is a huge risk and you might just be throwing substantial amounts of money down the drain."

You can report any information to officers at the game, pass information via @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via the club at the following link: https://www.liverpoolfc.com/corporate/ticket-touting
