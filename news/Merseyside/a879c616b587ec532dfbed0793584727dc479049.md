We have arrested two men and seized suspected drugs and paraphernalia following a stop check in Knowsley on Saturday night, 27 March.

At around 10.30pm, Matrix officers intercepted a BMW travelling from Liverpool towards Cheshire on the A562, close to the junction for the Knowsley Expressway. Both occupants were searched and a large amount of suspected Class A drugs were recovered.

Both men were detained.

Working alongside Cheshire Police, further searches were carried out in the Widnes area and further items were seized.

A 63-year-old man from Widnes was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs; and drug driving.
A 28-year-old man from Widnes was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs.

Both were taken to police stations for interview and have been released under investigation pending further enquiries.
