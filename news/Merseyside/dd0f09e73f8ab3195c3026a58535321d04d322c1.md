We're looking for wanted Huyton man Robert Case, after a prison recall was issued for him.

The 39-year-old breached the conditions of his licence after his release from prison on 5 November and is now wanted.

Extensive enquiries are ongoing to trace him.

He is white, 6ft tall, of heavy build, with brown hair and blue eyes.

We are issuing one wanted appeal per day for the next 12 days to support the work of our Force Fugitive Team, so help us track these people down before Christmas.

If you have seen Case or have any information as to his whereabouts, please contact us via @MerPolCC on Twitter, 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook, or call the independent charity @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111, with reference 20000685178.
