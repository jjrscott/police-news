Detectives are appealing for information following a robbery at the Esso garage on Southport Road in Formby this morning (Friday 8 January).

At around 9.20am officers were called to reports of a male suspect assaulting a security guard carrying a cash box outside the garage.

Following the attack, the suspect retrieved the cash box, which contained a large quantity of cash.

He then made off towards Liverpool in a dark blue Volvo.

The suspect is described as a white male of slim build. At the time of the incident he was wearing a dark green hooded coat with a high visibility vest underneath, grey trousers, dark gloves, trainers and a black face mask.

The security guard suffered minor injuries.

CCTV, witness and forensic enquiries are ongoing.

Detective Inspector Paul Gillies said: "Robberies of businesses such as this are far from victimless crimes - they have a huge impact on people living and working in Merseyside, who provide a vital service to our communities.

"We are committed to finding the people responsible so we can put them before the courts. I would appeal to anyone who was in the area of the garage this morning who saw anyone or anything suspicious to contact us.

"I would also particularly ask anyone who was driving past who may have a dash-cam footage to check it to see if they captured anything significant. Please get in touch as you could hold information which is vital to our investigation."

Anyone with information on this incident can contact us by DM via our social media desk on Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' with reference 21000015711.

You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
