Police are appealing for information following recent burglaries in Billinge.

Three burglaries and three attempted burglaries were reported in the Chadwick Green area between 11 February and 14 February.

During one incident, which took place overnight on Friday 12 February, it was reported that offenders stole a white Suzuki Swift car, a black Toshiba television and a laptop.

In a further incident which took place overnight on Saturday 13 February, it was reported that a wallet, purse, mobile phones and cash were stolen.

In the afternoon on Thursday 11 February it was reported that an electric scooter was stolen which has since been recovered by police.

Police have increased patrols in the Billinge area.

Enquiries into the incidents are ongoing and anyone with information is asked to contact police.

Community Inspector Jon Smith said: "Nobody has the right to violate the security and safety people should feel in their own home. While nobody has been injured during these incidents, the victims have been left very shaken by what has happened to them.

"I want to reassure the community in St Helens that we are committed to finding the people responsible for committing these crimes and bringing them to justice.

"We are appealing for anyone who was in the Chadwick Green area last week and over the weekend who saw anyone or anything suspicious to contact us. Similarly it is vital that we find anyone who was driving or walking in the area who may have captured something, either on their mobile phone, or dash cam to get in touch.

"Operation Castle is our ongoing response to burglary across Merseyside and was set up to put anyone suspected of being involved in burglary in our communities before the courts.

"Since we began, offenders our officers have arrested have been sentenced to more than 300 years in prison, and burglary offences dropped by 18.9% across Merseyside last year. It's thanks to information provided by those communities affected that we can record such results.

"Incidents such as this show that while we have had great success in preventing people from being victims of burglary, we still have more to do. I would ask anyone who sees or hears anyone acting suspiciously close to homes or businesses, let us know and we will keep taking positive action to bring offenders to justice."
