Officers have continued to utilise stop searches, proactive deployments and open land searches to target those involved in serious violence.

At around midday yesterday (10th Feb), officers arrested two men aged 26 and 28 on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs after becoming suspicious of activity at an address on Woodstock Street, Liverpool.

Officers knocked on the door of the property which was answered by the 28 year old. The man smelt strongly of cannabis so he was cautioned, arrested and a search was commenced. During which, suspected heroin was seized as well as weighing scales and a number of items of designer clothing, electrical items and an electric bike, totalling in the region of Â£30,000.

Both men were taken to custody and have since been released under investigation.

Officers stopped the Peugeot at around 9:40pm after the car was seen driving dangerously. Here, the man was searched and found with a number of wraps of white powder suspected as cocaine.

His car was also searched where officers found a significant amount of cash and so he was arrested at the scene for possession with intent to supply Class A drugs and possession of criminal property.

Officers conducted a further search of home in Tuebrook where a further 29 wraps of drugs were seized along with more cash and a Garmin watch.

He was taken to custody as a result and released under investigation.
