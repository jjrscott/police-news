A 29 year old man has been charged following the recovery of a firearm and ammunition in Liverpool earlier this week.

At around 10am on Monday 9th November, officers conducted a drugs warrant at an address on South ferry Quay, Liverpool.

Forced entry was used to get inside where two people were located and detained.

Officers conducted a search of the property and recovered a modified live firearm and ammunition in the kitchen cupboard.

The 19 year old woman and 29 year old man were arrested on suspicion of possession of a firearm and taken to custody.

Following enquiries and forensic examination, the woman was released under investigation for this offence but was remanded in custody due to being wanted on warrant for a separate drugs offence in Scotland.

The man, Anthony Foat, of South Ferry Quay, was charged with possession of a prohibited weapon and possession of ammunition. He appeared at Liverpool Crown Court on Wednesday morning (11th November) where he was remanded into custody until 30th November.
