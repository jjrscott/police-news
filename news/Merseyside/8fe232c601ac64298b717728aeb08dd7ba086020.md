Wanted

05:00 17/12/2020

We are appealing for help to find a Liverpool man who is wanted on recall to prison.

Alan Hughes, 52, of no fixed abode, was recalled to prison on 12 October this year for breaching the conditions of his licence, after his release on 14 August. He had been jailed for three-years, four months for burglary.

He is described as a white male, 5ft 7in tall, of slim build with brown hair and green eyes. He speaks with a Liverpool accent.

We are issuing one wanted appeal per day for the next 12 days to support the work of our Force Fugitive Team, so help us track these people down before Christmas.

If you have seen Hughes or have any information as to his whereabouts, please contact us via @MerPolCC on Twitter, 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook, or call the independent charity @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111. You can also contact them via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
