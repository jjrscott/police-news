Officers from our #OpTarget team in St Helens spent the day yesterday (11th November) carrying out deployments to tackle serious violence and the repercussions of this.

Inspector Rob Budden said "The aim of these deployments are ultimately to reduce crime in the area and reassure the local community that we are listening to their concerns and taking action where we can."

The day consisted of a number of stop searches, four arrests for drugs offences, a recovery of a cannabis farm and seizure of a Taser as well as an open land search near Monastery Road and the Loop Line and high vis patrols around the area.

Officers also conducted a warrant on Hawthorne Road, Sutton in relation to drugs after intelligence received suggested that the occupants were involved in criminality. Unfortunately on this occasion, nothing of note was found, however neighbours thanked officers and were pleased to see officers taking action.

**Arrests:**

Officers on Canberra Avenue just before 11am arrested a 52 year old man after they noticed a strong smell of cannabis coming from one of the properties.

The man was detained and following a search of the house, officers located a cannabis production in the front bedroom consisting of around 16 plants in two growing tents and vacuum packed cannabis. The man was consequently arrested on suspicion of production of cannabis and possession with intent to supply Class B drugs.

He was taken to custody for questioning.

Following this, officers on Knowsley Road conducted a drugs warrant where they arrested a 25 year old woman on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class B and possession of a firearm.

During a search of the property, officers recovered cannabis and a Taser.

The woman was taken to custody but has since been released pending further investigation.

Later in the afternoon, officers stop searched a man on New Street who was found to be carrying suspected cocaine and heroin. The 52 year old man was arrested on suspicion of possession of a controlled Class A drug.

The last arrest was at around 3pm when a 47 year old man was stopped on Rigby Street South. He was found in possession of cannabis and was consequently arrested.

Insp Budden continued "We carry out these days of activity to target those involved in crime, no matter what level, to ensure that more serious violence is deterred.

"It is important that during these turbulent times, that we all work together and act safely and responsibly to bring those involved in crime to justice.

"Anyone that knows someone involved in crime, whether it is the production, sale or distribution of drugs, please get in touch. These substances come with deadly consequences so it is important that we do everything we can to take them off the streets of St Helens."
