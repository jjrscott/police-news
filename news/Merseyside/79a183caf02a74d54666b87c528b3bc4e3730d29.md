We have recovered suspected drugs and high value items in St Helens this week (Wednesday 24 March).

Officers attending an address in the Wasdale Avenue area noticed a smell of cannabis.

Following a search of the address, officers recovered a quantity of cannabis and high value items including watches.

A 56-year-old man from St Helens is assisting officers with enquiries.

Inspector Rob Budden said: "We will not tolerate crime in our community and officers continue to work hard to take drugs off our streets.

"Where we receive information about crime taking place on St Helens and across Merseyside we will take action. If you know someone involved in crime, please let us know so we can take them off our streets."

Some of the signs that cannabis is being grown are:

• Strange smells and sounds
• Frequent and varied visitors to a property, often at unusual times
• Gardening equipment being taken into a property, such as plant pots, fertiliser, fans and industrial lighting
• Windows are sealed and covered or the curtains are permanently closed
• Heat from an adjoining property
• Birds gathering on a roof in cold weather
• Individually these activities may seem commonplace, however, together may indicate something more suspicious
