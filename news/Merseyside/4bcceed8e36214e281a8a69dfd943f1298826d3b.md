Detectives are appealing for information following a fire at a house in Dingle this morning (Friday 5 February).

At around 8.30am, emergency services were called to a family home on fire on Dingle Lane.

Four people - including three children - were inside the property and managed to escape unharmed. The fire caused extensive damage to the house and is being treated as arson.

Officers are working alongside Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service (MFRS) to establish the circumstance.

Detective Inspector Jennie Beck said: "At this stage we believe the fire was started deliberately.

"Although thankfully no-one in the family was hurt, it is incredibly distressing to imagine what a mother and her children must have gone through when they realised their house was on fire and they had to escape.

"I would urge anyone who has information about the fire to contact us as soon as possible. Your footage, descriptions or other information could be vital in finding those responsible - so please come forward and we'll do the rest."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC on Twitter, 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook, call 101 or the independent charity @CrimestoppersUK anonymously, on 0800 555 111, with reference 182.
