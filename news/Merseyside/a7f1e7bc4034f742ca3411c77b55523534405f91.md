Five men have been arrested in connection with serious violence offences on the Wirral.

At around 6:30pm on 31st Jan, officers received reports that a 26 year old man had been threatened by multiple armed men on Buchanan Road, Wallasey.

Fortunately the man, who was on a bike at the time, rode away and was unharmed.

He reported seeing the men making off in a Grey VW Golf.

Following extensive investigations overnight, officers from our Op Target team located the car believed to be involved in the previous days incident yesterday afternoon (1st Feb) parked on Manor Lane, Wallasey with five men on board.

They were all detained for a search and inside the car, officers found a baseball bat, pick axes, hammers and crow bars, along with balaclavas, gloves and a small amount of Cannabis.

All five men, aged 29, 26, 25, 24 and 22 were arrested for the previous night's offences including affray and possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear and drugs offences before being taken to custody for questioning.

Additional searches of four addresses linked to the men were also carried out where machetes and another hammer was seized.

They have all been released under investigation until early March.

Inspector Jordan Quinn said "Anyone involved in crime, in particular those carrying weapons or using them to scare or harm members of the public, will be caught and action will be taken against them.

"Carrying a weapon does not protect you and will often lead to serious, if not fatal consequences - please report anything you know to us before it is too late." #OpTarget
