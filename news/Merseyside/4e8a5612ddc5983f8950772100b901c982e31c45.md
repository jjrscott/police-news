Detectives in Wirral are appealing for witnesses to a suspected arson in Wallasey in the early hours of yesterday, Monday 24 February.

At around 12.50am, Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service (MFRS) were called to Demesne Road to reports of a Toyota being burnt out. Slight damage was also caused to a Ford Ecosport.

CCTV and witness enquiries are ongoing and a joint investigation is being carried out.

Detective Inspector Paul Parry said: "Were you in the area of Demesne Road in the early hours, or live locally and have home CCTV or dashcam footage? You may have captured those responsible.

"To set a vehicle alight in a residential area is reckless beyond belief so tell us what you know and we take action."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 with reference 20000118093.
