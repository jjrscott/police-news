We are appealing for information after a burglary in Kensington on Saturday morning (30 May 2020).

Police were called at around 6.45am to a report two men had forced entry to the back door of a property on Earle Road, threatening the occupant - a man a man in his 80s - and taking food, documents, clothing and medication.

The victim was unharmed but left extremely distressed by the incident.

Detective Inspector Jennie Beck said: "Any burglary is a despicable act, but in this case an elderly man's home has been targeted and he has been threatened simply because he went to investigate what the noise was in his house.

"Regardless of the value of the property taken, burglaries violate a person's sense of safety at home, and can leave them feeling frightened in the very place they should feel most secure.

"We are determined to find the males responsible for this and bring them to justice.

"If you witnessed anything or have heard who may be responsible please get in touch."

Anyone with information should contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre'.
