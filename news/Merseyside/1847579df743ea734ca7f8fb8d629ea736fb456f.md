We have charged a woman and arrested four men and a woman in connection with an investigation into street robberies and handling stolen goods in Southport last week.

Michelle Wilson, aged 41, of no fixed abode, was charged with three counts of robbery and five counts of fraud. Wilson appeared today (Monday 18 November) at South Sefton Magistrates Court and was remanded in custody to a later date.

A 24-year-old man from Southport has been arrested on suspicion of robbery.
A 42-year-old woman from Southport has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit robbery and possession of Class A drugs.

Following further enquiries, three other men have been arrested for handling stolen goods: a 52-year old from Southport, a 55-year-old from Ainsdale and a 42-year-old of no fixed abode.

The remaining woman and five men remain in custody for questioning.

The arrests come after an investigation into four incidents between 9-16 November in Southport, in which male and female victims were targeted and had personal items stolen, including bags and bank cards, some of which are believed to have been used in transactions locally.

Anyone with information on robbery offences in the area can contact @MerPolCC or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
