We can confirm that officers attended woodland in Litherland today (Saturday 27 March) following the discovery of a man's body.

The man, believed to be in his 60s, was sadly found on land off Bleasedale Way shortly before 12.25pm and pronounced deceased at the scene.

The incident is not being treated as suspicious at this time, and work is ongoing to formally identify the man and inform his next of kin.

Anyone with information can direct message @MerPolCC on Twitter or 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook with reference 398 of 27 March, or by calling 101.
