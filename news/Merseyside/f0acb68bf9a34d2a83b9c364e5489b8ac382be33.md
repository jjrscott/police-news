Do you recognise these men?

We believe they may have information that could assist enquiries into on an assault in Liverpool city centre in August last year.

It was reported a 20-year-old man was slashed to the hand during an altercation on Wood Street at about 4.25am on 31 August 2019. Two male offenders made off in the direction of Bold Street.

Detective Inspector Sean Kelly-Martland said: "The victim in this case required hospital treatment for a nasty laceration to his hand.

"We will not tolerate the use of knives in our city centre, and will do everything we can to take them off the streets and bring those offenders who carry and store weapons to justice.

"We believe the two men in these images could have information that will assist this investigation and appeal to them to come forward, or anyone who knows who they are to get in touch."

Anyone who recognises the people pictured or has any information is asked to contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police CC. You can also call 101 quoting incident reference 19100490166 or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
