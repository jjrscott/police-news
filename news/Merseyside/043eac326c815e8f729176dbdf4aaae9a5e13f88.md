We are appealing for information following a fatal collision in Southport this morning (Monday 21 October 2019).

A report was received shortly after 8.10am that a collision involving a bus and a male pedestrian had happened on Lord Street.

Police, Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service and the North West Ambulance Service attended and the man was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

Efforts are ongoing to identify the man and inform his next of kin.

A section of Lord Street is closed in both directions from its junction with Eastbank Street to the fire station roundabout.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police CC. You can also call 101 quoting incident reference 199 of 21 October.
