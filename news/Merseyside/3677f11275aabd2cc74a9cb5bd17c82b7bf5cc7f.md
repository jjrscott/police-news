Detectives investigating the death of a woman in Woolton on Friday (6 March) have charged a man with her murder.

Emergency services were called to a house on Kings Drive, Woolton just before 1am where a woman in her 60s was sadly pronounced deceased.

We can now confirm her identity is 64-year-old Janice Child.

A Post Mortem has confirmed the cause of Janice's death was severe blunt force head injuries.

37-year-old Robert Child from Kings Drive, Irby, Wirral has been charged with murder and will appear at Merseyside Domestic Violence Remand Court in Liverpool tomorrow, Monday 9 March.

A 33-year-old woman from Wirral, who was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder, has been released on conditional bail pending further enquiries.
