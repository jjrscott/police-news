We are appealing for information following a report of suspicious circumstances in St Helens on Wednesday, 25 March.

At around 6.55pm, it was reported that a white transit van with three men in the front seats had been seen driving in a dangerous manner along Cooper Street, Chapel Street and Oxford Street.

It was also reported that a possible fourth person had been heard in the back of the van and officers are working to establish the full circumstances and ensure the safety of those involved.

Detective Inspector Jackie Guinness said: "Although at this stage there is nothing to suggest criminal activity, the person who reported the incident to police did the right thing and we are keen to trace the occupants of the van, described as men in their 20's or 30's, and see that everyone is safe and well."

"We are carrying out a number of enquiries and would ask anyone with any information, who witnessed a van or men fitting the description in the area at the time, or has any dashcam or CCTV footage to please get in touch."

If you have any information, please contact @MerPolCC, 101 quoting ref. 776 of 25/03/20 or Crimestoppers, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
