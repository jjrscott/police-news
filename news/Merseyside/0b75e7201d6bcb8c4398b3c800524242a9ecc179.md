Detectives in Wirral are appealing for witnesses to a robbery in Oxton on Christmas morning.

At around 8.15am on Friday 25 December, the victim, a man in his 40s, was walking home from work. He was followed by two men from the area of Balls Road to Carlton Road. He was approached by one of the men, who was in possession of a knife, and threats were made. Following an altercation, the victim received minor injuries to his nose, thumb and wrist. He had a backpack stolen and was left extremely shaken.

The suspects made off down Carlton Road towards Borough Road. Both were wearing face coverings.

The first suspect was described as white, late teens to early 20s, 5ft 10in tall, broad build, build wearing dark jacket, dark pants and gloves, a hood covering his head and surgical mask on. He spoke with a local accent and was in possession of a knife. The second man was white, late teens to early 20s, 5ft 10in, slim build, wearing a dark bubble type jacket, also had a hood up and black fabric mask.

House-to-house enquiries were completed, and CCTV and witness enquiries are ongoing.

Detective Constable Jon Head said: "This incident left the victim understandably shocked and with injuries, which were thankfully not more serious. If you live locally and witnessed this incident, or saw two men matching the description, please come forward and we will take action.

"You may have captured something on home CCTV or dashcam, which could be vital in removing these men from the community."
