We have arrested a Lancashire man and seized cash following the stop check of a car in St Helens yesterday, Monday 2 November.

At around 3.30pm, officers sighted a BMW in suspicious circumstances on Hatfield Close. The driver was reportedly nervous and a search of the vehicle led to £10,000 being recovered from the passenger door.

A 38-year-old man from Skelmersdale, Lancashire was arrested on suspicion of possession of criminal property and has been taken to a police station for questioning. Further searches of addresses in Lancashire have led to around £26,000 in cash and two kilos of suspected cocaine being seized. Enquiries are ongoing.
