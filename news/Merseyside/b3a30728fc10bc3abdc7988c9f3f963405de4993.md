We have arrested three men on suspicion of murder following the sudden death of a man in Clubmoor on 24 September.

Emergency services were called to a house on Larkhill Lane just after 7pm where the 49-year-old man was pronounced dead.

The man had recently received medical attention involving surgery following an assault on Tuesday, 18 June 2019.

Emergency services were called to Wapshare Road, Norris Green at about 3.40pm on 18 June, to reports that a man had been the victim of an assault using a golf club.

The offender was described as white, 5ft 7in, of slim build, with blonde hair, wearing a dark blue coat with a hood up.

Emergency services attended and the man was taken to hospital where he received medical treatment for leg and arm injuries.

A 26-year-old man from Walton, a 27-year-old man from Old Swan and a 46-year-old man from Walton were arrested on suspicion of murder. They have been released on conditional bail.

Detective Chief Inspector Mark Baker said: "This was a shocking and unprovoked attack, during which the victim was struck a number of times with a golf club in broad daylight.

"This incident happened in a busy residential area and we know it attracted the attention of a large group from the local community.

"We appeal for any of those people, who may have seen something suspicious on the day or heard something about it in the months since, to get in touch with us."
