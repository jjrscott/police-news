Officers were in St Helens today (27th Feb) on the lookout for those involved in criminality.

We have been using both plain clothed and high visibility patrols and carried out three warrants at Tickle Avenue, Conroy Way and Catherine Way where two men, aged 20 and 23 have been arrested for drugs offences.

Officers have also used tactics on the roads, checking cars are safe and road worthy whilst also monitoring those acting suspiciously. This has currently resulted in another arrest of a male who was wanted on warrant.

Also as part of the day of action, officers have been joined by the Mini Police who have conducted a line search and got involved in the police dog training.

The activity is continuing throughout the day and we'll update you as and when we get more information. Thank you for your cooperation #OpTarget
