We have arrested a 46 year-old man on suspicion of burglary at a Liverpool hotel.

Officers were called to the Titanic Hotel on Regent Road at 5.40pm yesterday, Wednesday 29th April, after a member of the public reported two males acting suspiciously. It was discovered that entry had been forced to the building and a quantity of alcohol had been stolen.

The man, who is from the Walton area, was arrested on suspicion of burglary and is currently in custody.

Anyone who sees anyone or anything suspicious or knows where stolen goods are being stored are asked to DM @MerPolCC or call @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111.
