Detectives investigating a knifepoint robbery at Heron Foods in Newton-le-Willows earlier this month have issued CCTV images of a man they believe has information to assist with their enquiries.

At around 6pm on Wednesday 10 February it was reported that a man assaulted and threatened two female members of staff at the shop with a knife.

The man made off from the Market Street store with two cash boxes on a pedal bike.

Nobody was injured but the victims were left extremely shaken by the incident.

An investigation is ongoing and detectives are appealing for anyone with information or who may recognise the man pictured to get in touch.

Detective Inspector Leanne Hobin said: "We'd like to speak the man pictured as he may hold vital information to assist this investigation.

"Thankfully the victims in this incident were not physically hurt, but left extremely shaken by the ordeal they were put through.

"We would like to appeal to anyone in the vicinity of Market Street on Wednesday 10 February who may recognise this man or saw anyone or anything suspicious to contact us.

"We continue to work proactively to educate people of all ages, make arrests and seize weapons to prevent others from being put through ordeals such as this involving the use of knives.

"You can help us by telling us where knives are stored and who is carrying them. We will take all reports seriously and take action to make our streets safer."
