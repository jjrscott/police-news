Do you know this man? Detectives in Liscard think he might have information to assist an ongoing burglary and fraud investigation.

At some point between 7pm and 7.20pm on Sunday 16 February unknown persons gained entry to a house on Greenheys Road in Liscard and stole a bank card.

The card is then believed to have been used in purchases on 16 February at 7.30pm at McDonalds in Liscard, then twice at 8pm and at 8.01pm at Mill Lane News in Liscard and then used at 10.50pm for a Vodaphone mobile top up.

Enquiries are ongoing.

Detective Inspector Laura Lamping said: "We think the male pictured may hold vital information so I would encourage him, or anyone who recognises him, to come forward.

"To be a victim of burglary and fraud is extremely distressing and we are determined to find those responsible and put them before the courts."

Anyone who recognises the man or has any information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 with reference 20000104401.
