We can confirm a man has been arrested and a murder investigation is underway following an incident in Anfield today (Wednesday 16 October 2019).

Officers were called to Vicar Road shortly after 9am to reports a man in his 50s had been found dead inside a house.

Emergency services attended and the man was pronounced dead at the scene.

A cordon remains in place while forensic, house-to-house and CCTV enquiries continue. Officers will remain in the area to provide reassurance to the community and to gather information.

A 32-year-old man from Anfield was arrested at the scene on suspicion of murder and has been taken to a police station in Merseyside to be interviewed.

The victim has been formally identified and next of kin are aware. A Home Office post mortem will take place to establish the cause of death.

Detective Inspector Jennie Beck said: "We are in the very early stages of the investigation into this incident and are trying to piece together exactly what happened in the time before and after this man's death.

"It is vital that anyone who knows anything at all about what happened gets in touch. Any information, no matter how small, may prove vital to our investigation."
