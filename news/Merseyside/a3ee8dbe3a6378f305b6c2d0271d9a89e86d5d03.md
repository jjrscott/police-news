Roads Policing investigators are continuing to appeal for witnesses following a fatal road traffic collision in Haydock on Wednesday 11 December 2019.

At around 8.40pm, four men were seriously injured after the black Lexus car they were travelling in collided with a number of parked unattended vehicles at the junction of Vista Road and Queens Road.

A rear seat passenger in the Lexus, a 19-year-old man from St Helens, was taken to hospital but he sadly passed away later that night.

The driver of the vehicle and two other passengers were taken to hospital with serious injuries.

The driver of the car, a 25-year-old man from Newton-le-Willows is currently in a serious but stable condition and the other passengers, a 25-year-old man from Wigan and a 26-year-old man from Newton-le-Willows are both stable and in recovery.

Enquiries are ongoing including investigating CCTV and dash-cam footage.

Inspector Stuart McIver, from Merseyside Police, said: "We are continuing to appeal for anyone who witnessed the collision or captured anything significant on dash-cam footage to contact us as they may have information which is vital to our investigation.

"We have spoken to a number of witnesses however our enquiries continue and we believe there are other people out there who may have seen the vehicle in the area before the collision happened."

Anyone with information is asked to call the Matrix Roads Policing Unit on 0151 777 5747 or DM @MerPolCC or 101 quoting reference 19100724889.
