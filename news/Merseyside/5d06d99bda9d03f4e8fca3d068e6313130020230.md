Detectives in Sefton are appealing for information after a man sustained serious injuries following an assault in Waterloo on Saturday, 12 September.

It was reported that at around 1.50am, the victim, a 19-year-old man, was approached by a group of males outside William Hill on South Road, before an altercation took place and he was punched.

He was taken to hospital for treatment to serious but non-life threatening facial injuries, which required surgery.

An investigation is underway with extensive CCTV and witness enquiries ongoing, and anyone with information is asked to get in touch.

Detective Inspector Cat Walsh said: "We know a number of people were in the area at the time of the assault and I would ask anyone who can recall witnessing the incident, or a group of males making off, to please get in touch.

"We are also keen to speak to anyone who may have been driving in the area and has dashcam footage, or anyone with CCTV footage.

"A young man has been left with serious facial injuries following this assault and we are determined to bring those responsible to justice, so if you were out in the South Road area and witnessed the assault or altercation, or have any information, please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 quoting ref. 20000550804 or Crimestoppers, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
