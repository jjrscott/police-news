Officers have yesterday (10th Nov) arrested three people on suspicion of possession of a firearm and possession with intent to supply Class A and B drugs.

They attended a property on Storrington Avenue, Liverpool at around 9:30am to conduct a firearms warrant at the address.

Two men aged 29 and 22 were detained upon entry whilst officers recovered a significant amount of white powder, suspected as cocaine, approx. Â£1300 in cash, mobile phones and a rifle.

The home owner, a 30 year old woman, returned to the property mid search and was also detained.

All three were arrested and taken to custody for questioning. They have since been released pending further investigation.
