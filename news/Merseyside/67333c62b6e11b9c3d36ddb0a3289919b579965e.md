Detectives are appealing for information following the rape of a woman in St Helens on Saturday 28 November.

At around 10.50pm, officers were called to Taylor Park to reports that a woman had been raped by an unknown man. The victim is being supported by specialist officers as our enquiries continue.

A 32-year-old man from St Helens was arrested nearby on suspicion of rape and possession of an offensive weapon. This man has since been eliminated from enquiries in connection with the rape and released under investigation in connection with possessing an offensive weapon.

Detective Inspector Andy McCourt said: "We understand the concern that this incident may cause and are carrying out extensive enquiries to find out exactly what happened. If you were in or around the Taylor Park area on Saturday night and saw anything suspicious, or have heard any information since, then please let us know. We will be continuing our enquiries in the area today."

Anyone with information or who wants to report a sexual offence allegation is asked to call 101 where you will be spoken to by specially trained officers, or you can pass information to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. Anyone with information on this incident is asked to contact us with reference 20000724820.
