Tonight we have seen masses of people flock to the Pier Head area heightening the risk of spreading covid-19. We want you to have a good time, but only when that time is right so please continue following government guidelines. By no means should you completely ignore social distancing measures - we must act responsibly whatever the circumstance. Protect yourselves and each other.&quot;
