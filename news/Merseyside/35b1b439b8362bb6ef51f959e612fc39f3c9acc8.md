Officers in St Helens have been carrying out extra patrols in and around Chapel Street following recent reports about drug dealing and anti-social behaviour.

On Wednesday 4 November, patrols near to Queen Street detained and arrested a 41-year-old man from St Helens on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs and possession of criminal property. Suspected heroin and cash were seized.

The man was taken to a police station for questioning and has been released under investigation.

Inspector Rob Budden said: "We take all concerns on suspected drug dealing and anti-social behaviour in our communities extremely seriously. This arrest and our ongoing patrols in the area shows this commitment and I'd like to thank everyone who passes us information to enable these positive results.

"Keep telling us what you know and we will do the rest."
