We have arrested two men after a man was assaulted in Liverpool city centre in the early hours of today (Friday 31 July).

Police were called to Thomas Steers Way just before 12.45am to a report of a fight in the area involving a group of men.

Patrols attended and a 40-year-old man was located off The Strand, near the entrance to the Royal Albert Dock.

It was reported the victim had been kicked and stamped on, and he was taken to hospital where his condition is serious but stable.

The group left the victim and crossed the road up the steps into Chavasse Park.

Officers conducted a search of the city centre and a short time later, two men were detained.

Two men aged 33 and 40, from Liverpool city centre, have been arrested on suspicion of Section 18 assault and taken into custody for questioning.
