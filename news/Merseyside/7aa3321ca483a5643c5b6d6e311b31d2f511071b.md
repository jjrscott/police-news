We can confirm a Liverpool fan was taken to hospital during the match against Napoli last night, Tuesday 17th September.

The same man, aged 26, had been assaulted earlier in the evening in Naples with a second man, aged 46. He suffered superficial cuts and grazes to the head and was treated at the scene before continuing to attend the match.

At half time it is believed he passed out at the stadium and was taken to hospital for a check-up as a precaution. He has since been discharged.

Officers from Merseyside Police and representatives from Liverpool Football Club attended the hospital to check on his welfare.
