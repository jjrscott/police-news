We are appealing for information following a burglary at Krakajack garage on Liverpool Road in Southport.

At around 9.45am on Saturday 9 January, officers were called to reports that a burglary had taken place at the garage between 6pm on Friday 8 January and 9.30am on Saturday 9 January.

Unknown offenders are believed to have forced entry to the garage to remove a large quantity of stock, before making off from the premises in an unknown direction.

A total of 89 electric bikes, with "Krakajack" written on the frame, 50 boxes of bike accessories (including locks, helmets, lights and gloves), 10 hoverboards and three Segways were stolen.

Two vehicles, a blue Land Rover Discovery and a black Kia Sorento, were also taken from the garage by offenders.

One of the vehicles has since been recovered by detectives.

An investigation is underway and CCTV, witness and forensic enquiries are ongoing.

Detective Inspector Paul Gillies said, "Crimes involving businesses such as this are far from victimless - they have a huge impact on people living and working in Merseyside, who provide a vital service to our communities.

"We are committed to finding the people responsible so we can bring them to justice. I would appeal to anyone who was in the area of Krakajack garage on the 8th and 9th January who saw anyone or anything or anyone suspicious to contact us.

"We believe that the offenders may have used a heavy goods vehicle to remove such a large quantity of stock from the garage, so we are particularly interested in hearing from anyone driving past who may have captured relevant dash-cam footage.

"Similarly, if you have seen any of the items described when out and about locally then please get in touch as you could hold information which is vital to our investigation."

Anyone with information on this incident can contact us by DM via our social media desk on Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' with reference 21000017926.

You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
