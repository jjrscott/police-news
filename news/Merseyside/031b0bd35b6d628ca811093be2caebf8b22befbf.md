We have arrested a 21 year-old man from Halewood and a 27 year-old woman from Truro in Cornwall for being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs.

The arrests - as part of Project Medusa - came as part of a joint operation with Devon and Cornwall Police and relate to an investigation into County Lines drugs supply in Devon and Cornwall.

Both were arrested in the Prescot area this morning, Thursday 1st April, and are currently in custody where they will be questioned by detectives.

Detective Inspector Gary Stratton said: "Project Medusa works across force boundaries to ensure we make arrests and take potential offenders off our streets.

"County Lines drug dealing blights communities and the lives of those taking drugs and those who are often coerced into dealing them on behalf of organised crime groups.

"Our work to remove these people from our streets and bring them to justice continues on a daily basis and I would ask anyone who has information about this kind of activity to come forward so action can be taken."
