Detectives are investigating after shots were fired in Bootle last night, Thursday 21 November.

At 9.15pm, reports came in of shots being heard in Breeze Hill. Armed officers attended and evidence was found of shots being fired close to the Mons public house.

A cordon and road closure is now in place at the junction of Breeze Hill with Southport Road as enquiries continue, and we would ask that road users avoid the area at this time.

Detective Chief Inspector Gayle Rooney said: "We're looking to establish exactly what has gone on, but we know that shots were fired close to a public house on a busy road, possibly involving occupants of a vehicle or vehicles nearby.

"No injuries appear to have been caused but to fire a gun on such a busy street with local residents at home and on the streets is beyond belief.

"Recent weeks have seen a lot of positive action against those who use weapons, deal drugs and bring risk to our communities. Stand with us, tell us what you know, and we'll respond."

You can contact @MerPolCC or 101 with reference 892, or via the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
