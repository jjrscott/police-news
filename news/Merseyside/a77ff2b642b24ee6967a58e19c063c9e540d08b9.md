Detectives in Sefton are appealing for witnesses to a stabbing in Bootle earlier this month.

At 10.20pm on Saturday 3 October, a man in his 60s contacted police to report that he had been stabbed by a small kitchen knife on Merton Road.

Officers and the ambulance service located the man with a small puncture wound to his stomach, which was non life-threatening. He was taken to hospital for treatment. CCTV, witness and forensic enquiries are ongoing and we want to speak to anyone with information who has yet to come forward.

Detective Inspector Cat Walsh said: "Thankfully the victim's injuries were not more serious but as we have seen, the consequences of carrying a using knives can be catastrophic. We believe that this was a targeted attack and are still looking into why it happened.

"From our enquiries, we believe that there were people on Merton Road around the time of the attack who have yet to come forward. I would urge them to do so at the earliest opportunity, either directly or anonymously via Crimestoppers, and likewise anyone living locally who has home CCTV or dashcam. What you saw, captured or may have heard since may be the key to removing a dangerous offender from the community."
Anyone with information is asked to contact us via social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police CC with reference 20000599399.

You can also pass information via the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
