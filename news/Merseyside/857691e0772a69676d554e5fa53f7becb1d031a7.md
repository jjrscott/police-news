We are today, Wednesday 17th March, continuing to appeal for help in finding Liverpool man John Dickens who has been missing for over a month.

The last confirmed sighting of 47 year-old John was on Northumberland Terrace in Everton on Tuesday 9th February.

Although there have been further reported sightings since that date none have been confirmed.

John, who is known locally as 'John John', is a white male, 5ft 10in tall, of medium build, with short brown hair and has a scar on his right eyebrow.

He is known to frequent London Road and the Everton area, including Netherfield Road and Everton Park.

Detective Inspector Amy Smith said: "We are becoming increasingly concerned for John's welfare as it is now over five weeks since we had the last confirmed CCTV sighting of him and his family are very concerned.

"I would ask anyone who has seen him or spoken to him since the 9th February or know where he is to contact us as matter of urgency."

Anyone who has seen John or knows where he is can contact us via 101, our social media desk @MerPolCC on Twitter or 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook, or the charity Missing People on 116 000.
