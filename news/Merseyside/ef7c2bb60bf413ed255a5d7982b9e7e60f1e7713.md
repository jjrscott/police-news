We are appealing for information following a burglary in Woolton on Tuesday 27 October.

It was reported at 7.50pm that a burglary had happened at a house on Hillview Gardens and that offenders had forced entry via a rear door.

They had made an untidy search of the address before making off with a number of items including designer handbags and jewellery, and stole a Mercedes GLA220 AMG Line from the driveway. The car was later recovered and has been forensically examined.

The items stolen include a Louis Vuitton organiser which is personalised with initials

Enquiries are ongoing to identify those responsible and return the stolen items to their owner.

Inspector Lynsay Armruster said: "To be the victim of burglary, particularly at this time of year when we have all faced such a challenging time, is incredibly upsetting and an investigation is underway to find those responsible and bring them to justice.

"We have carried out house-to-house enquiries and studied CCTV, and I would ask anyone who may have heard or seen suspicious behaviour, or has their own CCTV or dashcam footage from the Hillview Gardens, Vale Road and nearby Menlove Avenue to please get in touch.

"We have issued images of some of the handbags stolen in the hope that we can return them to their owner. Not only are they valuable, some of the items taken belonged to family members and have huge sentimental significance to the family.

"I appeal to anyone who has seen any of the items, or may have been offered them for sale or as a gift, to contact us.

"I would like to remind the public to take extra precautions during the upcoming festive period to ensure your homes are safe and secure. Remember to check front doors, windows and garage doors and ensure your car keys are safely out of sight. It is especially important at this time of year, when Christmas presents may also be visible and the hours of darkness are longer."
