Detectives are continuing to appeal for information and dashcam footage two weeks to the day that 19-year-old Nyle Corrigan was murdered in Stockbridge Village.

Mr Corrigan died following a shooting in Boode Croft at around 6.30pm on Thursday 12 November and a Home Office post mortem confirmed the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the back.

A police investigation is ongoing and officers are particularly keen to hear from any members of the public or taxi drivers who might have been driving in Stockbridge Village between 5.15-11.45pm on 12 November and might have dashcam footage.

If you have dashcam footage and you were in the area of Stockbridge Village between those times, please you can send footage or information direct to us via https://mipp.police.uk/operation/05MP20M39-PO1

A 33-year-old man from Huyton arrested on suspicion of murder has been released on bail pending further enquiries.

Detective Chief Inspector Cath Haggerty, who is leading the murder investigation, said: "We are making significant progress with this investigation - we have made an arrest, studied CCTV extensively and spoken to people in the area.

"Nobody wants to see a shocking and tragic incident like this happen in the community, and the public have stepped forward to help our efforts to bring Nyle's killer, and anyone involved, to justice.

"Information and CCTV or dashcam footage provided by the public and taxi and private hire drivers can be crucial in achieving that, and I am appealing directly to anyone who was driving in the area at the time and may have dashcam.

"It could prove vital in our efforts to achieve justice for Nyle's family, who are devastated by his sudden loss and have spent the past two weeks grieving and trying to come to terms with the fact they will never see him again.

"There is no place in Merseyside for firearms, and anyone who stores them or uses them to cause fear, injury or worse are simply not welcome here.

"I would urge anyone who saw anything or who has any information which could help us with our enquiries to contact us urgently. You may not think that the information you have is significant but it could help us with our enquiries."

Anyone who has any information which could help detectives with their inquiries is asked to contact our social media desk on Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' quoting the reference number 20000688863.
