Detectives are issuing images of a male who may have information following the assault of a member of staff at a St Helens convenience store in July.

At around 9am on Monday 20 July, a male entered Lavelles on Marshalls Cross Road and was asked by the member of staff to remove his baseball cap as per shop policy. The male approached the counter to pay for his goods and punched and slapped the member of staff, causing cuts and grazes. The suspect then left.

Detective Inspector Jackie Guinness said: "This was a completely unprovoked attack on a vulnerable adult who volunteers at the shop. To be assaulted when carrying out such work for a local business is completely abhorrent and we are continuing to work with the business in investigating.

"Our CCTV enquiries have so far been negative, so we're circulating these images to the public. If you recognise the person in these images or have any information about the incident, let us know and we will take action."
