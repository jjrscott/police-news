We are investigating following a fatal road traffic collision in Everton this morning (Wednesday 27 May).

At around 5.30am, emergency services were called to Belmont Road at its junction with Breck Road in Everton to reports of a collision involving a red Vauxhall Corsa and a blue BMW 530. Traffic lights were also damaged during the collision.

Two men - the driver and rear passenger in the Corsa - were taken to hospital for treatment. Sadly, the passenger was pronounced deceased a short time later.

The man's next of kin have been informed and are being supported by officers.

The driver of the Corsa, a man in his 60s, remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition.

The junction of Belmont Road and Breck Road remains closed while officers carry out investigations at the scene, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.

We would ask anyone who witnessed the collision to call our Roads Policing Unit on (0151) 7775747 or pass information on Twitter via @MerPolCC.
