Today (Thursday 21 January), officers from Merseyside Police and Cheshire Constabulary conducted a search warrant on a Merseyside address, leading to one man being arrested as part of a joint investigation into County Lines drug supply in Chester.

The activity was part of the ongoing Project Medusa, an operation led by Merseyside Police set up to tackle County Lines drug dealing and child criminal exploitation.

A 19-year-old man from the Dovecot area of Liverpool has been arrested on suspicion of Conspiracy to Supply Class A Drugs, and taken to a police station for questioning.

Detective Inspector Gary Stratton of Merseyside Police, said: "The activity comes on the back of the work we're carrying out day in, day out to arrest those involved in this type of criminality and shut down County Lines.

"Those we suspect of being involved blight the communities they deal drugs in and it's a sad fact that these criminals are known to target vulnerable people to do their dirty work on the ground, often coercing them with gifts and more often than not, violence."
