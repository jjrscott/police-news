Detectives are appealing for information following a stabbing in West Derby last night, Sunday 11 October.

At around 10.40pm, emergency services were called to Eaton Road to reports of a 16-year-old male being assaulted. The victim later presented at hospital for assessment of non-threatening injuries to his back. He has been kept in hospital for treatment.

A cordon is currently in place near to Walker Playing Fields on Eaton Road and enquiries will continue today, including forensics, house-to-house and CCTV.

Detective Inspector Sean Kelly-Martland said: "At this early stage in the investigation, we are keeping an open mind as to what happened and why. Initial enquiries indicate that the victim was with a friend and they were threatened before a pedal cycle was stolen, but we are looking to speak to anyone in the area who saw this incident, anyone running off, or who has heard talk since.

"If you live locally, saw, heard or may have captured anything on CCTV or dashcam, please come forward and we will take action. As we have tragically seen, knife crime can have catastophic consequences and while this young person has not received life-threatening injuries, this is purely by chance and will leave a significant impact nonetheless.

"We work hard to regularly remove from the streets dangerous weapons and those who carry them, so keep passing information on and we will do the rest."
