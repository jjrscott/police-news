We have today, Thursday, 10 October, welcomed the sentencing of Richard Wallach, for the manslaughter by gross negligence of his wife in 2017.

On Thursday, 24 August 2017, emergency services were called to the couple's home address in Gwendoline Street, Toxteth following reports of concern for safety of 61-year-old Valerie Wallach. She was taken to hospital where her health deteriorated and she sadly passed away on Tuesday, 12 September.

Following enquiries, it was found that Mrs Wallach had been living in poor home conditions and had a number of medical ailments that had not been treated.

Today, at Liverpool Crown Court, 67-year-old Richard Wallach was sentenced to eight years in prison for gross-negligence manslaughter.

Detective Inspector Tracey Martin said: "This was a shocking case which resulted in Mrs Wallach sadly losing her life in the most tragic circumstances.

"Richard Wallach showed no regard for his wife, who was left in some of the worst conditions I have ever seen in the run up to her death. Her health and quality of life was extremely poor by the time emergency services were alerted and she sadly died in hospital around three weeks later.

"We welcome today's sentencing and I hope Mr Wallach now takes the time to reflect on the consequences of his actions. No one deserves to suffer the awful conditions that Mrs Wallach did, and I hope her family now have some closure and can begin to move forward with their lives."
