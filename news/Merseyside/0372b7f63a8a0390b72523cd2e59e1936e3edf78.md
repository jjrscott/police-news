Wanted

10:14 15/02/2021

Detectives are issuing images of two men who are wanted in connection with drug conspiracy offences, as part of Operation Venetic, the international mobile encryption investigation.

Extensive enquiries are ongoing to trace 34-year-old Lee Malone (left) and 34-year-old Carl Aldridge (right), who are both wanted on suspicion of conspiracy to supply Class A and Class B drugs.

Malone, from Garston, is described as white, 5ft 7in tall, of medium build and with brown hair and blue eyes.

Aldridge, from Aigburth, is described as white, 5ft 6in tall, of proportionate build, with fair hair and blue eyes.

Detective Sergeant Steven O'Neill said: "As part of Operation Venetic, Merseyside Police has so far arrested more than 60 people, of which many have been charged with serious drug trafficking or firearms offences.

"We have also seized around 45 kilos of Class A drugs, Â£1.3 million in cash and recovered three firearms with ammunition. We're working closely alongside our partners in the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit (NWROCU) and the National Crime Agency (NCA) in these and other investigations.

"If you know the whereabouts of either of these men, let us know and we will do the rest, to ensure they are put before the courts like so many others will be this year.

"We'll continue to use all available powers and work alongside our law enforcement partners to who we suspect impact on our communities and beyond."
