We were called to reports of a breach of Covid regulations at Everton Park Sports Centre on Saturday 13 February at around 10.45am.

It was reported youths had trespassed on the site and were playing football, with a number of others spectating.

Officers attended and spoke to a small group of youths who were packing up to leave. It is believed that a number of people who had been playing football on the site had made off from the scene.

Inspector Paula Oldham said: "We are aware of potential Covid breaches at this location at weekends and officers are working alongside Liverpool Council to address this issue, with additional police patrols in the area.

"We will continue to respond to reports of breaches of current legislation, and proactively patrol to ensure members of the public are adhering to restrictions.

"With local NHS services facing huge pressure, it is vital that everyone continues to play their part to ensure the rate of transmission of coronavirus is reduced, and our loved ones are protected."

You can report any matters concerning COVID-19 and the current legislation to us on Twitter at @MerPolCC or via this website.
