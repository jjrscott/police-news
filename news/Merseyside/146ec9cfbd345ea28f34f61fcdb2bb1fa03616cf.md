We can confirm we have executed a firearms warrant in Kirkby, this morning (Tuesday, 28 April).

At around 10.20am, a warrant was executed at an address on Perimeter Road and a shotgun, a rifle, and ammunition were discovered following a search of the property. Two women have been arrested in connection to this matter.

Detective Inspector Sarbjit Kaur said: "On this occasion a number of firearms and ammunition have been found. We are determined to keep such dangerous Firearms off our streets. We will continue to disrupt criminals who we suspect may seek to store, carry or even use firearms.

"We continue to execute warrants to disrupt criminal activity in the area and rely on the community cooperating with us and giving us information which we will act upon.

"Our work has not stopped in the relentless pursuit of criminal activity across Merseyside and we are grateful to the community in helping us seek out criminals and put them before the courts. Please keep talking to us and together we can make a difference to the safety of our community."

Anyone with information on criminal activity is asked to contact @MerPolCC, quoting ref 0225 of 28/4/20 or @CrimestoppersUK, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
