Detectives investigating a serious assault earlier this month in Walton Vale are continuing to appeal for information.

At around 8.20pm on Saturday 8 August, emergency services were called to the beer garden of the Windsor Castle pub to reports of a 47-year-old man being injured. The man was taken by ambulance to hospital for treatment of head injuries, which were initially assessed as non life-threatening. His condition is now described as critical.

Witness and CCTV enquiries have been ongoing since the incident. A 49-year-old man from Walton has been interviewed on suspicion of Section 18 wounding and remains under investigation.

Detective Inspector Amy Smith said: "Sadly the victim's condition has deteriorated since this incident, and our extensive enquiries continue.

"If you were in the beer garden on the night in question, or have seen or heard anything since, please come forward as soon as possible."
