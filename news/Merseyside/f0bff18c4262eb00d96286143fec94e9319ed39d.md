Have you seen wanted man Anthony Leonard Hogan? He is 38 years old, from Halewood and wanted on recall to prison after breaching his licence conditions.

We'd also like to speak to him in regards to a serious assault in Scotland and common assault in Merseyside.

Hogan is described as 5ft9, of slim build, with brown hair and blue eyes.

Anyone that thinks they've seen him, please get in touch quoting crime ref: 20000428309.
