We have released a picture of a yellow and blue Lapierre mountain bike which was stolen from a shed in Kirkby on Saturday 20 February.

It is believed that an unknown offender climbed over a rear gate overnight and gained access to the shed on Medbourne Crescent.

A bag of fishing equipment including a tent and fishing rods were also stolen.

An investigation is underway and CCTV enquiries are being carried out to help identify who is responsible.

Community Policing Inspector David Morgan said: "If you have seen or been offered a bike like the one pictured, please get in touch with us and we'll take it from there.

"I would encourage members of the community to ensure sheds and garages are kept locked and secured. For added security and peace-of-mind, we would recommend anyone storing valuable or sentimental items in their shed considers buying a shed alarm or infrared sensor - some of which can detect movement before an intruder has broken in, and can be a great deterrent."

Anyone with information on this incident is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 quoting ref 21000110810 or Crimestoppers, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
