Officers have arrested a teenage boy in connection with criminal damage being committed against Stagecoach buses in Kirkby.

Last week, we conducted an operation that saw officers accompany bus drivers on their shift, both on and off the bus.

The operation which comes after some recent reports of criminal damage to Stagecoach buses resulting in a disruption of some services utilised both marked and unmarked police cars as well as plain clothed officers travelling on various bus routes.

As promised, this targeted activity has continued to ensure the safety of our fellow key workers and other passengers using the buses.

As a result, yesterday (26th January), officers arrested a 17 year old man in connection with the most recent report of criminal damage.

We were called to Tower Hill at around 12:40 in the afternoon, following reports that another bus had been damaged. After analysing CCTV provided by Knowsley Council's security team, a teenage boy was identified and stop searched on Ebony Way.

The 17 year old was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and questioned by officerd. An investigation is ongoing.

Sergeant Sarah Hughes said: "We will continue to run our joint Operation with Stage Coach and Knowsley Council Safer Communities and hopefully the public will see the benefits of our partnership approach to tackling ASB being committed against key workers and key services."

If you have any more information or see someone acting dangerously, please get in touch @MerPolCC or calling 101. #OpTarget
