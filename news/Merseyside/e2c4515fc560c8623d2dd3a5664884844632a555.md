A fourth person has been arrested in connection with the murder of Dre Estridge in Toxteth in the early hours of last Friday, 26th June.

The 19 year-old man from the Fairfield area was arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. He is currently in custody where he is being questioned by detectives.

A 17 year-old male from Wavertree, who cannot be named for legal reasons was charged with murder and appeared in court yesterday Wednesday 1st July. He was remanded into custody until his next appearance on Wednesday 29th July.

A 45-year-old woman from Wavertree who was previously arrested on suspicion of murder and a 25-year-old man from Allerton arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender have both been released on bail.

Emergency services were called to an address on Oakham Street, Toxteth, at around 6.15am last Friday where they found 26 year-old Dre with a single stab wound to the chest. Sadly, he later died as a result of his injury.

Anyone who has any information which could assist the investigation is asked to DM @MerPolCC, or 101 or contact @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111.
