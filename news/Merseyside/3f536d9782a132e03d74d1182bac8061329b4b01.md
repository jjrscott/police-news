We have recovered a firearm in Bootle this afternoon, Saturday, 30 November.

A report was received at around 12.05pm that a pistol and ammunition had been discovered in Springs Close.

Officers attended and the items have been removed safely and taken for forensic examination. A scene remains in place while enquiries continue in the area.

Detective Inspector Lee Wilkinson said: "An investigation is now underway following the recovery of a firearm and ammunition this afternoon and I would ask anyone with information to come forward.

"This weapon has thankfully been removed from our streets and enquiries will be carried out to establish whether it linked to any recent incidents involving firearms.

"I want to reassure the public that we are working tirelessly to pursue those involved in serious and organised crime, and another dangerous weapon removed from the hands of criminals is a positive result.

"Individuals involved in serious and organised crime have no place in our communities and it is vital that people continue to come forward with information so we can put them before the courts.

"If anyone has any information about the recovered firearms, those involved in gun crime, or who knows where weapons are being stored, please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 quoting ref. 19100701094, or Crimestoppers, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
