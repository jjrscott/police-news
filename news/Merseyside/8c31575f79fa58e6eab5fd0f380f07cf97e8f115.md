Op Target officers in Liverpool have arrested a woman for drugs offences following a warrant in Liverpool this weekend.

Just after midnight on 25th September, officers carrying out an ongoing investigation into the drugs distribution around the area undertook a drugs warrant on Dunluce Street.

The warrant lead to the recovery of 1KG of cannabis, a large quantity of suspected heroin and drugs paraphernalia.

A 26 year old woman from Liverpool has been arrested at the scene on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A and B drugs and was taken to custody for questioning.

She has been released pending further investigation.

Anyone that knows someone involved in the supply of drugs across Merseyside should get in touch with us @MerPolCC or by calling @CrimestoppersUK anonymously. #OpTarget
