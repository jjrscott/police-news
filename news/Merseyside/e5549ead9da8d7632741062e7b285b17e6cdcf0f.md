We're appealing for information to help find a 15-year-old boy who is missing from home.

Harvey Ellis was last seen in Southport on Wednesday, 27 January.

He is described as a mixed race male, around 5ft 8in tall, of slim build, with short, dark, curly hair and facial stubble.

When last seen, he was wearing dark trousers and a black jacket with a fur hood.

Harvey is known to frequent skateboarding areas in Southport.

Anyone who has seen Harvey, or has information on his whereabouts, is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 or the charity @missingpeople on 116 000.
