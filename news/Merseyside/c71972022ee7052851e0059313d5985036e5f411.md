We have welcomed the sentencing of three males to a total of 25 years, one month in connection with a shooting in Prescot in January 2020.

At around 4.50pm on Monday 20 January, a 17-year-old male was shot and injured in the abdomen in an alleyway off Station Road, requiring surgery.

A male now aged 16 and two aged 17 from Huyton were arrested and later charged in relation to the incident.
They were convicted of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and on Friday 19 February they were sentenced to detention in Young Offenders Institutions.

Boy A , 17, was sentenced to seven years and nine months' detention.
Boy B, 16, was sentenced to eight years and four months' detention.
Boy C, 17, was sentenced to nine years, with an extended three years on licence.

Detective Chief Inspector at Firearm Investigation Matt Smith said: "The offenders travelled to Prescot from Huyton to carry out the shooting in the afternoon in front of members of the public including children.

"They have left a teenager with life-changing internal injuries, and the physical and mental scars this has caused will last a lifetime.

"I want to assure people in the community that we'll continue to act on all information provided on firearms across Merseyside, and take decisive action to make sure we take guns off the streets and put the people prepared to carry, store and use them before the courts.

"Keep supporting what we are doing and you will see the difference where you live, with suspects apprehended, groups disrupted and weapons seized."

Anyone with information on gun crime or where guns are being stored can contact us directly via @MerPolCC, by calling 101 or the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or report online at https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously
