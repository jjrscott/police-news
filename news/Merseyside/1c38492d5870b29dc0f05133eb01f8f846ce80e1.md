A woman has been arrested and an investigation launched following a serious domestic assault in St Helens on Saturday, 13 June.

At around 10.15pm, officers were called to French Street to reports of a man in his 30s being assaulted, resulting in a serious head injury and his transportation to hospital. Following enquiries, a 28-year-old woman fwas arrested on suspicion of Section 18 wounding with intent and taken to a police station for questioning. She has been released on conditional bail pending further enquiries.

The victim remains in a serious but stable condition in hospital.

Detective Chief Inspector Craig Sumner said: "Although one woman has been arrested, we're still very much looking to piece together exactly what happened during this assault, which has left a man seriously injured in hospital. If you live nearby and saw or heard anything on Saturday night, or captured footage on CCTV or dashcam, let us know. We think that other people may have been involved in this assault, and may have turned up in a grey Kia Sportage vehicle in possession of weapons. We're determined to identify all of these people and put them before the courts.

"Extensive enquiries are underway, so you hold any information about the incident, this vehicle or anything else, come forward and we will take positive action."
