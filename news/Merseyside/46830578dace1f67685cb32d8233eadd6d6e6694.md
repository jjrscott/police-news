A post-mortem examination has confirmed Stephen Maguire, 27, died as a result of a gunshot wound to the abdomen following a shooting in Birkdale on Monday (16 March).

Emergency services were called to an address in Guildford Road shortly after 11.35pm to reports a man had been shot.

Mr Maguire, from Birkdale, had been shot twice - to the leg and abdomen - with a handgun.

Detectives believe it was a targeted attack involving up to four male offenders. It was reported they wore facial coverings and dark clothing, and made off from the scene in a dark coloured Mercedes in the direction of New Cut Lane. It is also believed at least one of the offenders left on a scrambler bike.

A cordon remains in pace at the scene and enquiries into the murder are ongoing.

The family of Stephen Maguire have issued the following statement:

"Stephen was adored by his family and friends. He was a loving son to his mother and father and an amazing brother to his two brothers and three sisters.

"Stephen's unconditional love for his dogs was well known and they were never from his side.

"He would do anything to protect his family and friends, without a second thought for himself.

"Stephen was a selfless person who wouldn't hesitate to offer help to anyone, whether family, friends or complete strangers."

His partner Megan added: "Stephen was the most caring and loving boyfriend. Not only that, he was my best friend.

"He was a devoted stepdad to Keisha who gave the best cuddles, and will always be loved and remembered as an amazing man.

"Goodnight baby I love you forever."

Stephen's family respectfully request the media allow them time to grieve privately.
