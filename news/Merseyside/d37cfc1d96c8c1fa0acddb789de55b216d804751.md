Detectives are appealing for witnesses following an armed robbery at a shop in Old Swan this morning, Wednesday 2 December.

At around 6.25am, officers were called to Greggs on Edge Lane to reports that two men had entered, one of whom was in possession of a knife. Threats were made to staff and cash was taken. Nobody was injured although the staff were left understandably shocked and are being supported by officers.

Forensic, CCTV and witness enquiries are ongoing at the scene.

The suspects are described as white and in their 30s-40s, wearing dark clothing and facial coverings.

Detective Inspector Amy Smith said: "This was an awful experience for those members of staff to go through, and we'll be offering support as our initial enquiries continue.

"To be threatened at your place of work is despicable and we will be working closely with all local businesses to make them aware of this incident, and also to ensure that we do all we can to find those responsible and put them before the courts.

"If you were near to Greggs and saw two men acting suspiciously, or making off after the incident, let us know and we'll take action."
