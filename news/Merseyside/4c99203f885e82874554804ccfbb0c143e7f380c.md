We have issued a CCTV image of a man we believe could have information to assist an investigation into a theft in Huyton.

It was reported that at around 5.30pm on Monday 16 September, a woman dropped her mobile phone in Asda on Salerno Drive.
â€‹
Shortly after, it was reported that a male picked up the phone and made off with it.

An investigation is ongoing to establish the full circumstances and officers are keen to speak to the man pictured, as he may have information to assist enquiries.

The man pictured, or anyone who recognises him, is asked to contact @MerPolCC or call 101 with reference 19100527136 or @CrimestoppersUK anonymously, on 0800 555 111. You can also use their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
