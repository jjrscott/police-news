We have arrested a man and a woman on suspicion of possession with intent to supply drugs and seized a car after a drugs warrant was carried out at a house in the Greenbank area of Liverpool this morning.

Officers attended at the address and arrested a 20 year-old woman and a 21 year-old man on suspicion of PWITS Class A, B and C and warrant offences relating to another police force. Both remain in custody where they will be questioned by officers.

A quantity of cash, suspected drugs and mobile phonses have been seized and will be taken away for forensic examination.

A car was also seized.

Community policing Sergeant Jacqui Keeler said: "We know that drug dealing is a scourge on our communities so we are committed to taking action against the people responsible. I would continue to urge people to come forward if they have information about drug dealing in their neighbourhood."
