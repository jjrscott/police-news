We have charged a man in St Helens after officers were called to reports of a man trying car door handles on Africander Road, just after 1am on Tuesday 28 April.

The officers investigated and with the help of a police dog located and detained a man on Lorton Avenue. Upon further inspection he was found to be in possession of a torch and a screwdriver.

22-year-old Christopher Russ from Johnson Street, St Helens, was charged with going equipped for theft, appearing before court the following day (Wednesday 29th April).
