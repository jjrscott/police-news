We are appealing for information after a quantity of jewellery was stolen from a jewellery store in Liverpool city centre.

Between 12.50am and 1am on Friday 5th February officers were called to Ernest Jones Jewellers on South John Street in Liverpool One after reports that two unknown males had broken into the premises and stolen jewellery including pendants, rings and bridal sets.

The males have then made off on pushbikes.

The jewellery that was stolen included a Le Vian strawberry gold and pearl pendant, gold and diamond oval cluster ring, vanilla gold blue aquamarine and diamond ring, and a strawberry gold and raspberry Rhodolite ring.

CCTV and forensic enquiries have been carried out and an investigation is underway.

Detective Inspector Paul Jones said: "Some of the jewellery that was taken is very distinctive and we hope that by releasing these pictures people will recognise them.

"I would ask anyone who thinks they have seen the jewellery, or being offered any for sale, in the days following 5th February to contact us as they may have information which is vital to our investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 21000076570.
