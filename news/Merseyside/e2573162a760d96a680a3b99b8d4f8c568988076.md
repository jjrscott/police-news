Merseyside Police working alongside Torus62 Housing have obtained a Closure Order for 47 Woodhouse Close, Kirkdale, in response to reports of ongoing anti-social behaviour and threats to local residents.

The order which expires on 23rd July 2020 is made to provide respite to members of the local community. The only person allowed to be on the premises until the expiry date is the tenant and anybody else within the premises may be arrested and sentenced with up to six months imprisonment.

Inspector Graeme Rooney said: "The order was applied for by the local policing team in response to repeated reports of alcohol-fuelled antisocial behaviour at the address which was brought to our attention by members of the community.

"The order means nobody other than those specified in the order can enter the premises for three months. Anyone else found to be on the premises will be subject to arrest."

A spokesperson for Torus62 Housing said: "Torus have worked closely with Merseyside Police and had commenced possession proceedings due to serious and persistent anti-social behaviour caused by the tenants and their visitors.

"The making of the Closure Order is an excellent result and will bring some much needed relief to the community, as well as helping to reduce the spread of Covid-19."
