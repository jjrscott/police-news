Officers from Merseyside Police's Project Medusa have charged two people with drugs offences following a pre-planned County Lines operation on Friday, 26 March.

Officers from Project Medusa, working alongside officers from the Force's Roads Policing Matrix Vehicle Enforcement Team (MVET), stopped a car on Gravel Lane in Southport at 2.55pm. The occupants were detained and the car recovered and searched.

Christopher Jopson, 28 years, of Brooke Close, Southport and Lucy McTaggart, 36 years, of Tennyson Avenue, Bryning with Warton, were arrested and have now been charged with being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs.

They were remanded in custody to appear at Liverpool Magistrates Court tomorrow (Monday 29 March).
