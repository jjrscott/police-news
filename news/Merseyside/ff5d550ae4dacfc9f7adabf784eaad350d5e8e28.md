Detectives investigating the theft of a van and parcels in Prescot in November have issued CCTV images of three men they wish to speak to in connection with the incident.

At around 2pm on Saturday, 23 November, it was reported that an Avis delivery van had been stolen, after the driver got out to deliver a parcel on Ford Road. A man is reported to have got out of a white van on the street, before making off in the Avis van.

A short time later, the delivery van was recovered in the Rainhill area. It is believed a quantity of Amazon parcels were removed and transported into the white van, which had made off.

Constable Chesworth said: "An investigation is ongoing following the theft of a van in parcels in November, and we are keen to speak to anyone with information.

"We are particularly keen to speak to the three men pictured as it is believed they could have vital information to assist our enquiries and would ask them, or anyone who recognises them, to please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 quoting ref. 19100686043 or @CrimestoppersUK, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
