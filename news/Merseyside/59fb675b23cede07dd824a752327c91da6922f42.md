We are appealing for help to locate a 17-year-old male from Walton who we believe may have information that could assist our enquiries into a firearms offence.

Detectives investigating an incident on 13 July when a male was reported to have made threats while holding a firearm in Walton are keen to speak to 17-year-old Carl Power.

He is described as a white male, 5ft 3in tall, of slim build, with ginger hair and brown eyes.

Anyone who has seen Mr Power or knows of his whereabouts is asked to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 quoting reference 19100378545 or contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
