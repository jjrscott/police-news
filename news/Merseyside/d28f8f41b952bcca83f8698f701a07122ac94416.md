We are welcoming the sentencing of a Wirral man to nearly 29 years in prison for the murder of his mother in Woolton earlier this year.

Just before 1am on Friday 6 March, Emergency services were called to a house on Kings Drive, Woolton, where 64-year-old Janice Child was sadly found deceased.

37-year-old Robert Child from Kings Drive, Thingwall, Wirral was charged with murder which he initially denied, admitting manslaughter.

At the start of his murder trial in August, Childs changed his plea to guilty for murder but denied that it was for financial gain. This was rejected at a Newton hearing which concluded yesterday (Monday 7 September).

He was sentenced today at Liverpool Crown Court to 28 years and 364 days in prison.

Speaking after the sentencing, Detective Chief Inspector Cheryl Rhodes said: "Robert Child brutally murdered his mother in an appalling violent attack. Ever since committing the offence, he has gone to great lengths to try to lie and cheat his way out of the consequences of his actions, in the same way as he has lied his way through life. We're pleased that the courts have not accepted any of these accounts, and today he starts a significant prison sentence.

"The death of Janice is a tragedy which has affected everyone involved, and we hope that today's outcome at least provides some comfort for those who knew her. Although nothing can bring Janice back, the strongest possible justice has at least been served."
