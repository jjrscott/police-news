We have welcomed the sentencing of a Huyton man for the possession of a weapon and drugs at Liverpool Crown Court today, Thursday, 11 June.

At around 3pm on Monday (8 June), officers on patrol in Liverpool city centre sighted a man acting suspiciously on Cornwallis Street, before items were allegedly discarded. The man ran off and was chased and detained by officers on Lydia Ann Street.

A hunting knife, sheath and cannabis were seized.

21-year-old Christian Dick of Balmoral Way in Huyton was arrested and charged with possession of a knife/sharply bladed article in a public place and possession of cannabis.

He was today sentenced to six months and two weeks in prison after pleading guilty.

Superintendent Diane Pownall said: "Thanks to the response of patrols who noticed Dick acting suspiciously, he has been swiftly put behind bars and a dangerous weapon has been seized.

"The possession or use of weapons is reckless and unacceptable, and I hope today's sentencing sends a clear message to anyone that considers carrying one - it will not be tolerated by Merseyside Police.

"By working closely with our communities, we will continue to pursue those involved in criminality and the use and storage or weapons, and I would like to encourage anyone with information to please come forward and let us know, so we can take action."

If you have any information about the suspected storage or possession of weapons, you can contact @MerPolCC or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, and we'll do the rest. #OpTarget
