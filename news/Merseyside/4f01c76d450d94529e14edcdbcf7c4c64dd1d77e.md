Detectives are continuing to investigate the stabbing of a 14-year-old boy in St Helens.

Shortly before 6.55pm on Tuesday 19 January, officers were called to Princess Avenue after it was reported that a 14-year-old boy had been stabbed following an altercation involving a group of youths.

Emergency services attended and the victim was taken to hospital for treatment to serious wounds to his leg and chest. He has now left hospital and is recovering from his injuries.

The victim reported that he was racially abused during the assault but at this stage it is not believed that he was attacked because of his race.

Police have so far arrested four suspects in connection with the incident, all of whom have been released on bail.

Detective Chief Inspector Simon Vaughan said, "Racial abuse will not be tolerated by Merseyside Police, and we take reports of this extremely seriously. We would like to reassure the community in St Helens that we are exploring all lines of enquiry to establish a motive behind this appalling attack and will leave no stone unturned in our investigation.

"We'd still urge anyone who witnessed the incident, saw any suspicious behaviour, or a group of youths in the Princess Avenue or Bishop Road playing fields area around the time of the incident, to please contact us. Either tell us directly or anonymously through Crimestoppers, however you tell us, we will take action."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 quoting ref. 21000039628 or Crimestoppers, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
