Detectives in Wirral are appealing for witnesses to the knifepoint robbery of a bike from a teenager in New Ferry last week.

At around 9pm on Friday 13 November, a 15-year-old boy was walking with a friend in Winstons Place (close to New Ferry bypass) in possession of his pedal bike when they were approached by two men, one of whom reportedly was in possession of a knife. The victim left his bike which is believed to have then been stolen by the men.

The bike (pictured) is a yellow Diamond mountain bike with white and black writing. The suspects were both around 6ft tall, one wore a blue jacket and both had their faces covered. CCTV and witness enquiries are ongoing.

Detective Inspector Tara Denn said: "This incident left both boys extremely shaken up and one of their bikes stolen, we believe by these men. If you were in the area around 8.30-9pm last Friday and saw or heard anything, or have seen or been offered this bike for sale since, let us know. We're determined to find those responsible and remove them from the community so come forward and we will take action."
