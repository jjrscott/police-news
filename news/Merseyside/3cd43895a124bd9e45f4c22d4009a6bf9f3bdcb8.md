We can confirm that emergency services are in Huyton following a road traffic collision this afternoon, Monday 9 November.

At around 3.15pm, officers were called to Princess Drive to reports of a collision between a Ford Focus and a three-year-old boy pedestrian. The boy has been taken to hospital for assessment. The driver stopped at the scene.

The road is currently closed Liverpool-bound and traffic is being diverted down Lordens Road. We ask drivers to avoid the area as enquiries are carried out.

Anyone who saw the incident or was passing and has any dashcam is asked to contact us via @MerPolCC on Twitter with reference 20000681115.
