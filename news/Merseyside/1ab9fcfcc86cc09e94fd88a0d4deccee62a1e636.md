We have arrested a man and recovered suspected Class A drugs in Botanic Gardens, Southport yesterday (Thursday 18 March).

At around 5.40pm yesterday police sighted a white Ford driving at high speed.

The vehicle drove into Botanic Park and, on reaching a barrier in the park, the male driver exited the car on foot.

After a short foot chase, the man was detained by police.

A bag, which was reported to have been thrown away by the man, was recovered by police and found to contain an amount of suspected Class A drugs.

Officers arrested the man, aged 34 and from Southport, on suspicion of dangerous driving, drug driving and possession with intent to supply Class A drugs.

He was taken into custody and will be questioned by the police.

Investigations are ongoing.
