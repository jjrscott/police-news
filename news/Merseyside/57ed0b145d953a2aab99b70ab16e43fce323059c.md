Merseyside Police can confirm that 26 people have been arrested following a protest by Extinction Rebellion at Knowsley Business Park in Knowsley.

We were contacted at 10.10pm last night, Friday 4th September, following reports that a group of protestors had gathered outside News International on Kitling Road.

The 30 people arrested for aggravated trespass have been taken to police stations across Merseyside where they will be interviewed by officers.

A boat and two vans, used by the protestors to cause obstruction to and from the premises of News International have been removed. The incident has now been stood down and the surrounding roads and entrances have been fully opened.
