At around 11.45am, officers sighted a suspected stolen BMW being driven erratically on Park Road, Dingle. A pursuit was carried out around Sefton Park, Allerton and Hunts Cross before the car was abandoned on the Speke estate. Officers, assisted by our dog section, detained a man and woman nearby. A hammer was found in the vehicle.

A 23-year-old man from Orrell Park was arrested on suspicion of burglary; aggravated vehicle taking; dangerous driving; possession of an offensive weapon in a public place; disqualified driving; failing to stop; failing to provide a specimen and using threatening words/behaviour.
A 20-year-old woman from Fazakerley was arrested on suspicion of burglary; aggravated vehicle taking; dangerous driving; possession of an offensive weapon in a public place.

Both have been taken to a police station for questioning as our enquiries continue.

Matrix Chief Inspector Tony Jones said: "This was excellent work involving several officers and ably assisted by our dog unit. We are committed to ensuring that those who we believe to be driving dangerously on our roads are apprehended as soon and as safely as possible. Those arrested will now be questioned in connection with a number of offences."
