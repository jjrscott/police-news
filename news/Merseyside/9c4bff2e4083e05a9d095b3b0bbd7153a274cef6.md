Police have arrested a man on suspicion of drugs and knife offences following a stop search in Liverpool on Saturday, 13 March.

At around 9.10pm, officers on patrol were alerted to a man driving a black Volkswagen Tiguan on Parkfield Road. After searching the vehicle, police seized cocaine along with a Stanley Knife and a large amount of cash.

A 43-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs and possession of a bladed article.

During a later search of the man's address, officers recovered approximately Â£7,500 in cash, and arrested the man on suspicion of possession of criminal property.

He was questioned in custody and has been released under investigation.

Detective Chief Inspector Sabi Kaur said: "This is a great proactive arrest and shows what recoveries can be made following a stop search.

"We work continuously on the streets of Merseyside to stop potential drug dealers from harming people in our communities, and we'd urge anyone with information to reach out to us."
