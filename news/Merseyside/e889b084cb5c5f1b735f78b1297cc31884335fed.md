Officers in Wirral are introducing a further Section 60 order in the Beechwood Estate today following recent incidents, including an alleged firearm sighting earlier this week, after which a man was arrested.

The Order will begin at 5pm today (Friday 13 November) and will conclude at 4am tomorrow (Saturday 14 November).

The Order, under S60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, gives officers enhanced stop and search powers in a specified geographic location for a set period of time.

The authorisation includes the extent of the whole roads at the boundary and the area and land within this boundary.

Wirral Inspector Chris-Lucan Pratt said: "I want to continue to assure those in the community that we take all such incidents extremely seriously. Patrols will be in the area tonight so speak to us to raise any issues and we will take the appropriate action. We will work with the community to ensure that those who are intent on bringing threats and violence to the streets are dealt with."

Anyone with information is urged to come forward and speak to us, either directly or via @MerPolCC, or anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. We will act on all information to remove those who cause harm from your streets. Always call 999 if a crime is in progress.
