Police have arrested two people on suspicion of arson following an incident on Terminus Road, Huyton, this morning (Thursday 25 February).

At around 3.30am emergency services were called to reports that a silver Vauxhall Zafira had collided with the bus shelter on Terminus Road, off Liverpool Road and was alight.

It was reported that there were four people in the vehicle who made off from the scene.

Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service (MFRS) attended to extinguish the blaze and nobody was injured during the incident.

The incident is being treated as suspicious as a petrol canister was found in the vehicle.

A 39-year-old woman and a 51-year-old man have been arrested by police on suspicion of arson and drink driving. They have both been taken to police stations for questioning as enquiries continue.

Detective Inspector Peter McCullough said: "Although two arrests have been made, we are still in the early stages in finding who was responsible for the incident this morning as we believe the fire was started deliberately.

"Our enquiries continue and we'd urge anyone who witnessed the incident or saw any suspicious behaviour in the Terminus Road area around the time of the incident, to please contact us.

"If you have any information or witnessed the incident, either at the time or via CCTV or dashcam footage, please come forward directly or anonymously via Crimestoppers. Any information you hold could really help with our enquiries."
