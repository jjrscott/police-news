Officers in Wirral are introducing a Section 60 order in Birkenhead this evening (Wednesday 17 March) following reports of serious violent crime in the area.

The Section 60 will begin at 4pm today and remain in place until 4am tomorrow (Thursday 18 March).

The Order, under S60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, gives officers enhanced stop and search powers in the area (pictured) and is designed to minimise serious violence.

The area covered by the order is bounded by the A552 to the M53 Junction, the M53 Motorway to the junction of A5139 , A5139 to the Dock Road, Dock Road to the Seacombe Water front, Seacombe water front to the A552 - and all streets and locations found within these boundaries.

Target Team Inspector Jordan Quinn said: "Following assaults and reports of violent crime in the area covered by this order, we have introduced a Section 60 in order to help prevent further danger in the community.

"We regularly patrol the Birkenhead-Seacombe area, and I hope the people who live there will welcome the fact they will see more of our officers out in force this evening.

"Officers will not be troubling people going about their business. If you see us in the street then please do come and say hello - and feel free to share any information or concerns you have so we can take positive action."
