We have issued an image of a man officers believe could hold information that could assist enquiries into a stabbing in Liverpool city centre in the early hours of Sunday (1 March).

It was reported a group of men had been seen fighting close to River Island on Church Street at 4am, and a 19-year-old man sustained a stab wound to the chest during the incident. He is in a serious but stable condition in hospital. A second 19-year-old man who was cut to the face was treated in hospital and later discharged.

Detective Inspector Jennie Beck said: "We have made significant progress with the investigation into this incident, and one man has been charged in connection with it.

"But we believe the man pictured could further assist our enquiries and we appeal to anyone who recognises him to come forward."
