We have issued CCTV images of a man we want to trace following an attempted armed robbery at a shop in Garston.

At around 2.35pm on Friday 21st August a male armed with a knife entered RMS News and Wine on St Mary's Road.

He walked up to the counter and demanded cash. When another customer entered the shop he left empty-handed.

Nobody was injured during the incident.

Anyone who recognises the man or has any information which could assist the investigation is asked to DM @MerPolCC or contact @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 20000503258.
