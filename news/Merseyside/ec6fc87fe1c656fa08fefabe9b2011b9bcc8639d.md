Detectives from our ongoing burglary crackdown Operation Castle are welcoming the sentencing to prison of a Walton man.

Appearing today (Tuesday 15 October) at Liverpool Crown Court, 23-year-old Tomas Balog of Frampton Road was sentenced to two years and two months in prison for burglary, handling stolen goods and breaching a Community Order.

At around 2.30am on Monday 16 September, a burglary was reported on Bagot Street, Wavertree, in which a man was reported to have entered a property and stolen a television. Officers searched the area and quickly detained a man matching his description nearby, in possession of various suspected stolen items.

Balog was subsequently arrested and charged with the Bagot Street burglary; handling stolen goods from another burglary in Langdale Road, Wavertree on Monday 2 September in which electrical items were stolen; and breaching a Community Order.

Detective Sergeant John Fitzgerald from Operation Castle said: "The swift response of officers on the night and our investigations have taken another burglar off the streets of Liverpool.

"At Operation Castle, we're committed to pursuing and putting before the courts those who invade the homes of people in all of our communities. Burglary can have a lasting impact on victims and Balog clearly paid no regard to those from whom he stole.

"We hope that his sentence provides time to consider his thoughtless actions and change for the better."

If you have any information about suspected burglary or the sale of stolen goods, contact @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. Always call 999 if a crime is in progress.
