We have arrested two people and issued 7 Covid Fixed Penalty Notices following a group of people gathering in Liverpool City Centre to demonstrate against the Police, Crime, Courts and Sentencing Bill today, Saturday 20 March.

We would like to thank the overwhelming majority of people in Merseyside who continue to abide by the Covid-19 rules and avoid large gatherings.
