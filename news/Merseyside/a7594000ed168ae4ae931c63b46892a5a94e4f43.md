We are appealing for information after a boy aged 12 was assaulted by four youths in St Helens last night (Tuesday 3 March).

A report was received just after 6.35pm that four young people had been threatened in the car park of The Range on Chalon Way West by offenders who demanded they let them use a mobile phone. When they refused, one of the victims, a 12-year-old boy, was kicked and punched by the offenders.

The offenders are described as four males aged around 15, dressed in dark clothing with hoods.

Community Inspector Matt Drennan said: "Thankfully the victim was not seriously hurt, but all four of the young people have been left extremely shaken by this experience.

"We want to hear from anyone who was in the area of the car park at The Range who may have seen youths acting suspiciously at around 6.30pm on Tuesday.

"Any information you have, however small it may seem, could help us identify those responsible and bring them to justice."
