We have arrested and charged a man and seized a knife and drugs following an incident in Liverpool City Centre yesterday, Monday 8 June.

At around 3pm, officers on patrol sighted a man acting suspiciously on Cornwallis Street, before items were allegedly discarded. The man ran off and was chased and detained by officers on Lydia Ann Street.

A hunting knife, sheath and cannabis were seized.

21-year-old Christian Dick of Balmoral Way in Huyton was taken to a police station for questioning and has now been charged with possession of a knife/sharply bladed article in a public place and possession of cannabis. Dick will appear at Liverpool Adult Remand Court today, Tuesday 9 June.

If you have any information about the suspected storage or possession of weapons, tell us what you know via @MerPolCC or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, and we'll do the rest. #OpTarget
