We are appealing for witnesses following a robbery at a Post Office in Crosby this afternoon (Tuesday 2 February).

Shortly after midday, three men with their faces covered confronted a Post Office worker on College Road and made threats with a hammer.

No staff members or customers were injured but were left extremely shaken.

The offenders made off with a cash box - which was empty - before attempting to destroy it on Coronation Drive. It is reported that the three men left the scene in a white Audi vehicle with suspected damage to its front.

CCTV, forensic and witness enquiries are ongoing, and detectives would like to hear from anyone who can assist the investigation.

Detective Chief Inspector Paul Gillies said: "Key workers, including Post Office workers, are helping to keep our communities going at this challenging time.

"It's hard to believe someone would be cowardly enough to confront them in such a distressing way, and we will do all we can to find those who did and put them before the courts."

You can pass information via @MerPolCC or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, with reference 21000070477.
