We have arrested 13 people and issued 11 more with fines for breaching coronavirus legislation after two parties in Liverpool overnight.

It was reported just before 8.30pm on Saturday (2 May) that a number of people were at an address on Garmoyle Road in Wavertree having a party.

Officers attended and upon arrival, a group of people were found to be at the house the majority of whom are believed to have travelled from the Greater Manchester area. None of them resided at the address. A total of 11 were issued with fixed penalty notices for breach of Covid-19 legislation.

A twelfth person, a 20-year-old woman from Hyde in Greater Manchester, became aggressive on the attendance of officers and was subsequently detained and arrested on suspicion of breach of Covid-19 legislation and three counts of assaulting constables. She has been taken into custody for questioning.

Just after 1.20am on Sunday, we attended another property, on Duke Street in Liverpool city centre, following suspicions a group had forced entry and were holding a party.

Officers on patrol saw a dark-coloured Audi car leaving the scene. The vehicle was stopped and four people on board arrested.

Officers then attended the address and following further enquiries it was established it had been broken into and a further eight males and females, aged 17-22, were arrested on suspicion of burglary. None of them resided at the address.

Enquiries into both incidents are ongoing.

Chief Inspector George Phillips said: "The overwhelming majority of our communities are showing admirable patience and understanding in these difficult times. They are selflessly making huge sacrifices for the sake of the NHS as well as the health of themselves and others.

"Unfortunately last night two groups of people did not show the same level of respect for others, and flagrantly ignored Government advice to only travel when essential and to social distance from anyone outside your own household.

"We attended both scenes and took swift action. It is despicable to think that in their efforts to protect the wider public, three of our officers were assaulted.

"Enforcement will always be a last resort, but when people travel to gather in this way with others outside their home we are left with little option but to issue fines and make arrests to protect the wider public.

"I am sure the vast majority of people support this approach and will continue to report any concerns."

Chief Insp Phillips added: "We will maintain our common sense approach in the days and weeks ahead, encouraging the people our officers meet on patrol to respect the restrictions and explaining to people why they are so important.

"I would appeal to our communities to adhere to the guidance to keep your loved ones and ours safe.

"The safety of vulnerable people in Merseyside and our key healthcare workers should be everyone's priority, and I hope everyone now understands the risks to themselves and others of not listening to government advice. In order to return to normality as soon as possible, we need to work together and follow that advice."
