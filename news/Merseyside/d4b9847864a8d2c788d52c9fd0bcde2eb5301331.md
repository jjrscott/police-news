Officers are appealing for anyone that recognises these men in the CCTV pictures to get in contact.

We'd like to speak to them following an incident in Liverpool City Centre today (15th August) where another man was stabbed.

We believe they could have information to help us with our ongoing investigation.

D/Insp Graeme Osborne said: "This is a frightening incident for the general public to witness and I would urge anyone with information to get in contact straight away.

"Carrying a knife puts yourself and others in significant danger and we must do all we can to bring those responsible to justice."

If you recognise any of them or know how we could get in contact with them, please give us a call on 101 or DM @MerPolCC quoting log 447 of 15th August.
