We have arrested a teenager and recovered a knife and drugs following an incident in Roby yesterday, Monday, 30 November.

At 9.30pm, Matrix officers in Western Avenue attempted to speak to a male riding a bike, who made off when he saw patrols. He was detained a short time later and following a search, officers recovered a large knife and suspected cocaine and heroin.

A 17-year-old male from Liverpool was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs and possession of a bladed article, and remains in custody for questioning.

Detective Inspector Jackie Guinness said: "The proactive work of officers in Roby last night resulted in a significant seizure of a dangerous weapon and illegal drugs, which now thankfully have been removed from our streets.

"Criminal gangs and those involved in the supply of drugs have no regard for the lives they affect and we will continue to pursue these individuals and put them before the courts. Information from our communities is crucial in helping us do this, so if you have information on criminality in your area, please get in touch."

If you have information on the supply of drugs or storage of weapons, please contact @MerPolCC or 101. You can also pass information to independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
