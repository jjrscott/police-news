We are issuing a CCTV clip of a man officers wish to speak to following the theft of an electric pedal cycle earlier this month in Bromborough.

At around around 5:55pm on Friday 11 September, the bike was taken from Allport Road, near to Bromborough Wines.

CCTV enquiries have been ongoing and officers are keen to speak to the male in the clip, as he may have vital information to assist the investigation.

If you recognise the male or have any information about the incident, or captured any other CCTV, mobile or dashcam while parked at or passing the location at this time, please contact our social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police CC with reference 20000550016.

You can also pass information via the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
