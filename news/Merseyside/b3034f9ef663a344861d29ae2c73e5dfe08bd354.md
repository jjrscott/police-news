Officers from Merseyside Police Roads Policing Unit are appealing for witnesses following a road traffic collision on Monday 9th November.

A white Renault heavy goods vehicle carrying scrap metal was travelling along Copy Lane in Aintree from Ormskirk Road when it was in collision with a railway bridge outside Old Roan train station at around 11.10am.

The collision caused damage to the bridge structure and the road was closed for repair work to be carried out which caused traffic disruption in the area.

Police are appealing for any witnesses who may have seen the collision occur or who may have any dash camera CCTV footage of the incident or its aftermath to get in touch.

Constable Andy Roper from the Roads Policing Unit said: "The collision caused considerable damage to the bridge forming part of the local train network and this resulted in interrupted services for several hours at an inconvenience to rail and road users. We are keen to speak with anyone who may have witnessed this collision and would urge anyone with CCTV nearby or dash camera footage within their own vehicle to get in touch."

Witnesses can call 0151 777 3339, @MerPolTraffic or call 101 quoting reference number 20000680453 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously.

 * Vytautas Kuzas, 61, of no fixed abode, has been charged with careless driving and driving whilst unfit through drink and was remanded in custody to appear in court today, Tuesday 10th November.
