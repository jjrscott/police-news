We are appealing for information after it was reported a man was found with serious facial injuries in Maghull last night (Thursday 10 October 2019).

A report was received just before 10.55pm that a man was on the footbridge off Rutherford Road with serious facial injuries. The man then walked near to Maghull train station before being taken by ambulance to hospital.

The victim, a 38-year-old man, remains in hospital where his condition is described as serious.

Enquiries are ongoing to establish how the man sustained the injuries. Potential witnesses are being spoken to and CCTV opportunities in the local area are being explored.

Officers have set up a cordon to allow for forensic examination of the scene, including the footbridge on Rutherford Road and canal path to Hall Lane.

Anyone with information about the incident is asked to contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police CC. You can also call 101 quoting incident reference 19100588254 or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
