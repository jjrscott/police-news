Wanted

08:57 28/08/2020

We are appealing for help in locating a man who we believe could help with an ongoing firearms investigation.

We would like to speak to 49 year-old Anthony Johnston following the discovery of a firearm and ammunition in a property in Huyton in March this year as we believe he could assist with our enquiries.

Johnston, who is from the Huyton area, is described as a white male, 5ft 6in tall, of slim build with brown hair and blue eyes.

Anyone who knows of Johnston's whereabouts is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111.
