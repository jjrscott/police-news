We are issuing CCTV images of four women officers believe may have information that could assist an investigation into thefts at Co-op stores in Bebington and Tranmere.

It was reported that between 7.17pm and 7.43pm on Wednesday 8 January 2020, a group of women entered three different Co-op stores, secreting items in bags they were carrying as well as under their clothes before leaving the stores without paying. They are believed to have made off from the location in a vehicle, details of which are unknown.

The stores targeted were on Teehey Lane and Cross Lane, both in Bebington, as well as Church Road in Tranmere.

CCTV enquiries have been ongoing and officers are keen to speak to the women pictured as it is believed they may have vital information to assist the investigation.
