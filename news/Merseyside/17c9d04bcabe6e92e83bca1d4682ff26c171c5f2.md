Detectives in Sefton are appealing for information, following the assault of a 17-year-old youth in Ainsdale last week.

The incident took place at around 10.30pm on Wednesday, 24 June, where the victim was with a group of other youths on Ainsdale Sands, Shore Road. He was punched to the face by another youth and was later taken to hospital where he was treated for multiple fractures to his eye socket.

Detective Inspector Catherine Walsh said: "This was a particularly nasty assault, which has left a young man with some serious facial injuries. The incident took place on a particularly hot day in June and even at this late hour, there were a lot of people out and about, who I believe would have seen this group of youths and witnessed this incident.

"I'd appeal to anyone who has any information about it to get in contact - we are especially keen to speak to members of the wider group of youths who were with the victim, as I'm sure they would remember this incident and have information that could assist our investigation."

Officers would ask anyone who has any information about this incident to DM @MerPolCC or call 101 quoting reference 20000369678. You can also contact @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111.
