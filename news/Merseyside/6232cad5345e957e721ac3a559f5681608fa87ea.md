We have issued images of a man we want to trace following a cash-in-transit robbery in Liverpool in October last year.

At 11.30am on Saturday 19th October two security officers were at the Tesco store on the High Street in Wavertree when they were approached by two males, one armed with a knife and one armed with a gun, who made threats before making off with a quantity of cash.

Neither of the security officers were injured during the incident but were left shaken by their ordeal.

We have issued images of a man who we believe could assist with our investigation.

Anyone who knows the identity of the man or has any information which could assist the investigation is asked to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 19100606901.
