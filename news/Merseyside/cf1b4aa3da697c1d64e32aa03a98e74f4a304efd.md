The family of 26 year-old Jordan Welsby, who sadly died following a road traffic collision on Prescot Road in St Helens on Boxing Day, 26th December 2020, have today paid the following tribute:

"It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that as a family we have suffered the tragic loss of our beloved son, grandson, brother, boyfriend, uncle, nephew and cousin Jordan Welsby at the tender age of 26 years.

"We are all still coming to terms with the tragic events and our hearts are heavy with grief and sadness.

"Jordan was such a thoughtful, caring and wonderful person, loved by many and the world is a sadder place for all without him.

"As a family we are overwhelmed by the kind messages and support, in particular that from the world of rugby league and his family at Blackbrook rugby club.

"Jordan played representative rugby for his town St Helens, County Lancashire and Great Britain being a representative of BARLA in 2016.

"Jordan fought so hard for all his family and friends as we prayed around the clock for a miracle at his bedside.

"Alas the miracle that we prayed for could not be provided but due to Jordan's selflessness and wishes a New Years miracle was able to be granted.

"In the early hours of New Year's Day Jordan became an organ donor ensuring others could celebrate the New Year with renewed hope and with the ultimate gift of life. Unselfish to the very end. We are all so very proud of him.

"The family would like to take this opportunity thank everyone for their continued support and kind words.

"Goodnight and God bless Jordan until we meet again X"
