We have issued CCTV images of a man who may have information about the theft of a purse from an elderly woman's handbag in Bromborough.

On 22 October, a purse belonging to an 81-year-old woman was taken from her handbag as she shopped in Aldi, on Port Causeway.

Cash and bank cards were taken, and following enquiries it was discovered the bank cards were then used in a number of transactions.

Inspector Bernard McHugh said: "We are very keen to speak to this man, as we believe he could have valuable information about this incident that would help our enquiries.

"We continue to ask the community to take sensible precautions when they are out and about - take extra care to zip handbags, purses and pockets, don't write down pin codes or keep them together with cash cards, and split up cash in different parts of your handbag.

"Members of the public should be alert when paying for items using their pin number and when withdrawing cash from ATMs at all times. Any suspicious activity should be reported immediately. Supermarket staff in the area have also been briefed to be extra vigilant, and I would also ask neighbours and family members to pass this advice on to elderly or vulnerable people."
