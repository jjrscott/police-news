We are investigating following a fatal road traffic collision in Birkenhead last night, Thursday 26 March.

At around 9.30pm, emergency services were called to Rock Retail Park, Rock Ferry to reports of a collision involving a Ford Fiesta and a tree.

The driver of the car, a man in his 50s, was sadly pronounced deceased at the scene. No other vehicles were involved.

It is believed the driver have travelled from the North Wales area and possibly along the M53 and A41 New Chester Road area.

The man's next of kin have been informed and are being supported by officers.

We'd ask anyone who witnessed the collision to call our Roads Policing Unit on (0151) 7775747 or pass information via @MerPolCC, with reference 915.
