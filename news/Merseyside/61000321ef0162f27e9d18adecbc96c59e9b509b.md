We are appealing for witnesses after extensive damage was caused to a business premises in St Helens during an arson attack.

We were contacted on the morning of Sunday 1st November following reports that two offenders had set fireworks off on the Moorfoot Road industrial estate in Parr, at around 6.40am.

The fireworks are believed to have started a fire in the yard of MAW Shredding Services, a commercial waste business, causing extensive damage to commercial waste bins, a commercial van and other property. Nobody was in the property at the time.

It is believed the offenders made off in the direction of Boardmans Lane.

An investigation is underway and enquiries have been carried out in the local area.

We are appealing for anyone who was in the area of Moorfoot Road or Boardmans Lane or believe they may have captured something significant on CCTV or dashcam footage to get in touch.

Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 20000662565.
