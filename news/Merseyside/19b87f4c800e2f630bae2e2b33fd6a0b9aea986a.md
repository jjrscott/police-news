We're appealing for information following a fatal road traffic collision in Bebington this afternoon (Wednesday, 2 December).

Shortly before 12.45pm, officers were called to Broadway at its junction with Kings Road following reports of a collision involving a red Honda Jazz and a pedestrian.

Emergency services attended and the pedestrian, a man believed to be in his 70s, was taken to hospital where he was sadly pronounced dead a short time later.

The driver of the car - a woman in her 80s - stopped at the scene and is assisting with enquiries. Officers are working to formally identify the man. His next of kin have been informed.

Road closures remain in place and anyone who witnessed the incident is asked to come forward.

Sergeant Simon Duffy said: "Tragically a man has lost his life following this incident, and officers will remain in the area while enquiries are carried out to establish the full circumstances.

"If you were in the area of Broadway and Kings Road and witnessed the collision, or have any CCTV or dashcam footage, please let us know as it may assist our enquiries."

Anyone with information is asked to contact the Roads Policing Unit on 0151 777 5747, @MerPolCC or 101 quoting reference 20000732506. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
