We are urgently appealing for help in tracing a man who is wanted to recall to prison.

Peter Skerry, 42, from the Liverpool area, was released from prison on life licence on 3rd February 2020 after serving part of a sentence for a murder in Speke in 2002.

He was recalled to prison on Monday 13th July after failing to comply with his release conditions.

Skerry is described as 5ft 8in tall, of proportionate build, with light brown shaved hair and blue eyes. He has scars on both legs and speaks with a Liverpool accent.

He has links to the Liverpool area including Speke, Garston and Old Swan.

Members of the public are urged not to approach Skerry if they see him but to call 999 or contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
