We are appealing for information following a burglary in St Helens on Thursday, 2 January.

At around 8.40pm, officers were informed that a house on Robins Lane had been burgled at approximately 5.30pm and a number of possessions taken.

The offenders had forced entry to the rear door of the property and took house keys, car keys, an iPad and approximately Â£50 in cash as well as other items yet to be confirmed.

Officers attended the address, home to an elderly couple - a man in his 80s and his partner.

CCTV, forensics and witness enquiries are ongoing.

Detective Inspector Leanne Hobin, of Merseyside Police, said: "We are keen to speak to anyone who may have witnessed suspicious behaviour in the Robins Lane area, or have CCTV or dash-cam footage to please contact us.

"To be the victim of burglary is incredibly upsetting and an investigation is underway to find those responsible and bring them to justice."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, or 101 quoting ref. 20000005617 or @CrimestoppersUK, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
