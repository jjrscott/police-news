A man has been charged with an incident in which a PCSO was threatened in Edge Hill in June.

At about 4.20pm on 11 June 2019, a PCSO was on patrol in the area of Thornburn Drive when three males appeared. One of the males ran past him and the other two ran towards him, threatening the PCSO.

The men then left the scene in a car suspected to have been stolen in burglary in January.

Carl Bowles, 29, of Cardwell Street, Liverpool was arrested on 13 November and later charged with robbery. He has been remanded in custody and is due to face trial at Liverpool Crown Court on 12 December 2019.
