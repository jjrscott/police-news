Can you help?

We have released a CCTV image following an aggravated burglary on Queens Drive in Allerton in which a quantity of jewellery was stolen.

At around 10.10pm last Thursday, 13th August, four males wearing dark clothing with their hoods up entered a property and threatened the occupants at knifepoint before making off with the jewellery (including the watches shown below)

The occupants of the house were not injured but were left shaken by their ordeal.

We want to trace the males pictured and also a woman who was walking a dog on Montclair Drive at the time of the burglary and may have information which could assist our investigation.

Detective Inspector Steve Ball said: "We understand these images aren't the best quality but we hope they may jog people's memories of that night and that other people may come forward with CCTV, mobile phone or dash-cam footage they captured.

"Were you in the area around Queens Drive or Montclair Drive that night and saw anyone or anything suspicious? Or do you believe you were the woman walking the dog? Please come forward and speak to us.

"I would also ask anyone who recognises the watches pictured, or have been offered them for sale, to contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC or contact @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111.
