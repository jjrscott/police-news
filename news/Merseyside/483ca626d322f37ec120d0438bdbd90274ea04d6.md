We are today, Monday 18th January, continuing to appeal for help in finding a 24-year-old woman who is missing from home in Bootle.

Caitlin Baxendale was last seen in St Philips Avenue at 10pm on Monday 28th December.

There are increasing concerns for Caitlin's wellbeing.

She is described as a white female, 5ft 2in tall, of medium build with shoulder length brown hair and green eyes.

It is believed she may be wearing jeans, boots and either a dark coat with a fur hood or a flowery coat.

She also has links to the Leeds area.

Anyone who has seen Caitlin or knows of her whereabouts is asked to DM @MerPolCC or contact @missingpeople on 116 000.
