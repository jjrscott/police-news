Officers from the Roads Policing Unit have arrested a man from Liverpool after an incident in Toxteth last night (Monday 22 March).

At around 11.20pm, police were alerted to a silver Peugeot 206 travelling on Upper Parliament Street. After a short pursuit, officers were able to detain the driver on Cardigan Street and arrested a 27-year-old man from Liverpool on suspicion of failing to stop, driving without insurance, and dangerous driving. The car was searched and inside police seized a screwdriver, crowbar and laptop.

Following enquiries, the suspect was also arrested on suspicion of going equipped for theft. He was taken into custody for questioning by police.

Inspector Carl McNulty from the Roads Policing said: "Proactive policing and visible patrols not only give the public reassurance, they allow officers to observe any suspicious activity and act on it.

"Conducting stop checks of vehicles such as this can potentially stop someone from being burgled, or keep them safe from the violence and exploitation often involved with drug dealing.

"Stop checks are hugely important when it comes to taking dangerous people and drugs and weapons off our streets.

"No criminal should profit from misery while our wider law abiding communities work hard to earn an honest living. If you know someone involved in crime, please let us know so we can take them off our streets."

Please report all crime via our social media channels, calling 101 or in an emergency, always call 999.
