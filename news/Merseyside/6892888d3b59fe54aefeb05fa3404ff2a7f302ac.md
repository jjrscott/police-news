We have arrested two men and recovered cannabis during two days of policing activity in Southport and Ormskirk.

Cannabis was recovered from four addresses after six warrants were executed by officers from the Targeted Team and Community Officers, supported by officers from Lancashire Police yesterday and today (Thursday 28 and Friday 29 May).

Three warrants were carried out in Southport on Thursday, with a further warrant in Southport today and two in Ormskirk.

A 23 -year-old man from Birkdale was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply cannabis after a stop check on Canning Road in Southport, and a 37-year-old man from Ormskirk was arrested on suspicion of driving offences.

Inspector Graham Fisher said: "Our efforts to tackle and disrupt criminals involved in serious and organised crime continue.

"This activity should serve as a wake up call to anyone engaging in the storing and selling of illegal drugs - we will stop you in the street and turn up on your doorstep if we suspect you are involved.

"We know that offenders cross county borders to deal drugs and our work alongside other forces, such as Lancashire Police, to search homes and make arrests so that geography is no obstacle to the pursuit of justice."

Anyone with information on drug dealing in their area is asked to contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre'. You can also call 101 or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
