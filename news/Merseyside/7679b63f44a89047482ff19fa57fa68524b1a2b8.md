We made arrests and issued traffic offence reports for a range of driving offences in a day of action on main roads in Liverpool yesterday (Thursday 4 June 2020).

The Force's Local Policing Central Targeted Team conducted the operation in areas where the public have told us they have concerns about motorists speeding.

As part of the roadside traffic enforcement operation, officers were deployed to several locations across central Liverpool to educate and engage with motorists and enforce legislation where necessary.

Checkpoints were set up and speed guns were used on main arterial routes such as Muirhead Avenue East and Edge Lane, and the following action taken:

• Drivers and passengers of more than 50 vehicles stopped and engaged with
• Four men arrested on suspicion of offences of possession of drugs and driving under the influence of drugs
• Two stolen vehicles located and recovered, including a black Volkswagen Golf stolen during a burglary
• 20 traffic offence reports issued to motorists driving in excess of 30mph speed limit on Muirhead Ave East - with one car travelling at 50 mph - and gave advice to 15 who were travelling between 37-40mph
• Three motorists reported for offences of having no MOT, no seat belt and driving whilst using a mobile phone
• Traffic offence report issued for driving with no insurance and vehicle seized
• Two people cautioned for possession of a Class B controlled drug

Liverpool Targeted Policing Inspector Leigh Price said: "Our officers are out policing the roads of Merseyside every single day of the year, but this operation was about focussing our activity in specific areas people have told us they have concerns about.

"It is in everyone's interests to keep our roads safe. The drivers themselves, other road users and pedestrians will all be a lot safer if those who drive dangerously, at speed, or under the influence of drink and drugs are subject to enforcement.

"This activity gave us an opportunity to educate drivers about the risks they posed to themselves and others by driving too fast, without their seat belt and while on their phone, as well as those who drove without insurance or in a car with a valid MOT certificate.

"With restrictions on travel having eased, our roads are busier now then they have been for several months and it is imperative that those taking to the roads again are responsible, and drive safely."
