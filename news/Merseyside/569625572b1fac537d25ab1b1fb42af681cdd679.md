A man and woman have been charged after two attempted robberies in Liverpool on Monday (30 March 2020).

At around 8.55pm a man entered PRM Rocket Food Stores on Queens Drive armed with what was believed to be a knife. He confronted a member of staff and during the struggle the male assistant suffered cuts to his fingers.

Nothing was stolen from the shop and the male fled empty handed in the direction of Edge Lane. The assistant was taken to hospital for treatment for his injuries.

A short time later, at 9.10pm, a man and woman entered Blue Nile on Holt Road, Kensington. The man threatened a shop worker with a knife and demanded money. After a struggle - causing a small cut to the finger - the offender dropped the weapon and left empty-handed on foot with the female suspect.

Following extensive enquiries, two people were arrested on Tuesday (31 March) and were charged last night (Wednesday 1 April).

Stuart Barnes, 44, and Emma Lewis, 35, both of Maritime Court, West Derby were each charged with two counts of attempted robbery.

Barnes was also charged with possession of a bladed article in a public place.

They were remanded in custody to appear at Liverpool Magistrates Court today (Thursday 2 April).
