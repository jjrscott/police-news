We are appealing for witnesses after a man was assaulted in Wirral in the early hours of Friday 1st January.

At around 2.30am, a 29 year-old man was walking past Tesco on Upton Road in Claughton Village when he witnessed two males fighting. He attempted to help one of the males and the second male reportedly jumped on his back and he felt a sharp pain. Both males then made off.

The man returned home and complained of pain to his lower back. It was then discovered he had a wound to his lower back consistent with a bladed weapon being used. The man was taken to hospital for treatment for his injury which is not believed to be life threatening.

An investigation is underway and enquiries are being carried out in the local area.

Detective Constable Andy Uren said: "I would ask anyone who thinks they witnessed the initial fight, or has any information as to who the two males fighting were, to contact us. I would also ask anyone who was either walking or driving past who thinks they may have captured something on their mobile phone or dash cam to get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 21000001985.
