We're issuing the CCTV image of a man detectives think may have information after an assault in Maghull last year.

At 10pm on Saturday 19 September, a man was drinking with friends at the Meadows Hotel public house, Liverpool Road South when he was punched, resulting in him sustaining a fractured a jaw.

Door staff at the location ejected a suspect and enquiries have been ongoing to find those responsible.

Detective Constable Neil Jones said: "Our enquiries have been ongoing following this incident and we think that man pictured may hold important information to assist.

"Although the CCTV isn't of the best quality, we're hopeful that it either brings the man forward or prompts a witness to this attack to do so.

"This was a shocking and unprovoked assault which left the victim seriously injured, and we're doing all we can to bring the person responsible to justice."

If you recognise this man or witnessed the incident, please contact our social media desk on Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' with reference 20000569174.
