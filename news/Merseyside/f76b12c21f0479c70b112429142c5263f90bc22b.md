We have issued CCTV images of a man we want to trace following criminal damage outside a house and shop in Wirral.

At 7.30am on Saturday 8th August it was reported that offensive graffiti had been sprayed outside a house on Hadfield Road in Hoylake.

Graffiti was also found on a wall of a shop on Market Street in Hoylake. Enquiries are ongoing to establish if the two incidents are linked.

We have issued CCTV images of a man we would like to speak to as we believe he may have information which is vital to our investigation.

Anyone who recognises the man or has any information is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 20000471243.
