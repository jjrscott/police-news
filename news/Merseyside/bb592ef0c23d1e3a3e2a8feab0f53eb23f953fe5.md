Detectives investigating a shooting at a house in Wallasey in February have arrested two men in connection with the offence.

Officers were contacted at 9.15pm on Thursday, 27 February to reports damage had been caused to the front window of a house in Lea Road. There was no-one inside the property at the time and no suggestion anyone has been injured.

Following enquiries and warrants carried out at Wirral addresses this morning, a 22-year-old man from Poulton and a 30-year-old man from Leasowe have been arrested on suspicion of possession of a firearm and conspiracy to commit criminal damage.

They have both been taken to local police stations for questioning.

A quantity of cash and mobile phones were also recovered as part of the investigation.

Community Policing Inspector Paul Harrison said: "We know the impact gun crime has on our communities and we will continue to pursue those involved in serious and organised crime and put them before the courts.

"It is vital that the public continue to come forward with information so we can take action and rid our streets of firearms and individuals that think it's acceptable to use them to cause harm or fear.

"I hope today's warrants send a clear message to our communities that we are committed to ridding our streets of gun crime and ensuring Merseyside remains a safe place to live, work and visit."
