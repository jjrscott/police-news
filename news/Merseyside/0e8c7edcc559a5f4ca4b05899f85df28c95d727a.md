Detectives are investigating following an armed robbery at a Halewood shop last night, Saturday 11 January.

At around 10pm, officers were called to Aldi in Halewood Shopping Centre on Leathers Lane to a report of three men gaining entry and making threats to staff, before stealing money. Nobody was injured but staff were left shaken.

CCTV, witness and forensic enquiries are ongoing at the scene as we look to establish the full circumstances, and support those affected.

Detective Inspector Allison Woods said: "These are the vital early stages of our investigation and we want to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident, or saw three men in the area or making off from the area. Come forward and we will take positive action to put those responsible before the courts.

"Any small detail, be it CCTV, dashcam or a vehicle seen at speed in the area, could be key evidence, so let us know."

Anyone with information can contact @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, giving the reference 967.
