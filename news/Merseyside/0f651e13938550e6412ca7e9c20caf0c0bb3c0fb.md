****Poor quality pic****

We are appealing for information following reports of suspicious behaviour in the area around Knowsley Safari Park.

We were contacted following reports that the man was seen acting suspiciously, close to a group of children, in the area around Burrows Lane, over the weekend of 24th to 26th January this year.

An image was captured of a man officers are now keen to speak to.

Detective Sergeant Leanne Toole said: "We understand this is a very poor quality picture but we are hoping that with the area and circumstances it may ring a bell with someone and they may have information as to who the man is and what he was doing in that area.

"Similarly I would ask the man if he recognises himself to come forward and speak to us as he may have information which could assist our investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC or contact @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 20000075600.
