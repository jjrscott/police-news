We have recovered a cannabis farm with an estimated street value of nearly £1.5m from a house in Anfield.

Officers from the Central Targeted Team were on patrol in the Anfield area at around 11.45pm last night, Tuesday 15th October, when they noticed males acting suspiciously.

As they approached they became aware of a strong smell of cannabis and forced entry to a nearby property in Stonehill Street.

A 23 year-old man was arrested on suspicion of producing a controlled drug (cannabis), abstracting electricity and immigration issues. He is currently in custody where he will be questioned by officers.

A total of 374 mature cannabis plants with an estimated street value of £1,496,000 were recovered from four rooms in the property.

Cannabis dismantling team manager Matt Brown said: "Cannabis growth can cause serious harm in our communities. Nobody wants to live next door to a property containing a cannabis farm and we would ask that if you believe someone is using a property for this purpose, please tell us so we can take positive action and find those responsible for setting them up.

"Our communities can help us stop these groups, who are only interested in making money, from turning houses and businesses into potential death traps."

Ways to spot cannabis is being cultivated include:

• Strange smells and sounds
• Frequent and varied visitors to a property, often at unusual times
• Gardening equipment being taken into a property, such as plant pots, fertiliser, fans and industrial lighting
• Windows are sealed and covered or the curtains are permanently closed
• Heat from an adjoining property
• Birds gathering on a roof in cold weather

Individually these activities may seem commonplace, however, together they may indicate something more serious.

You can also call 101 or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
