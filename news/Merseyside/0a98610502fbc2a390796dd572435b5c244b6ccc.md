We are investigating following a suspicious incident in Speke yesterday, 30 January.

At around 8.20am, a report was received by St Ambrose Catholic School on Alderfield Drive of a man driving a car approaching a nine-year-old boy and offering sweets.

The pupil walked away and staff at the school were immediately made aware. Details have also been circulated to other local schools and parents to be alert.

The man is described as white, in his late 30s-40s. He was driving a grey Ford Focus and wearing a woolly dark grey hat.

Community Policing Inspector Jon Smith said: "The boy did exactly the right thing in moving away immediately and alerting adults.

"This will understandably cause some concern amongst parents and young people and I would encourage anyone else who has seen such an incident to come forward.

"Our officers have been visiting local schools yesterday and today and will continue to be, to offer advice and speak to anyone with information.

"I'd also encourage people in the community ensure young people in your care are aware of what to do, and make clear arrangements when picking them up from school or on the way home."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
