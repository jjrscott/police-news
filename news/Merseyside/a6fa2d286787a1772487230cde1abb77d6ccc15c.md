Your Local Policing team are in Tranmere today (Thursday 3 October) to carry out a drug warrant and speak to the community following information about suspected drug dealing and associated crimes.

A warrant was carried out at an address in St Catherines Gardens, Tranmere and we are speaking to local residents to gather information and address any concerns they might have about crime and anti-social behaviour.

Sergeant Alan McKeon said: "This activity has been well-received so far, and I want to thank everyone who has spoken to us and provided information.

"Our communities can be our eyes, ears, mouths and noses, and we are grateful for everything you tell us. We will keep taking positive action to target those we suspect of causing fear and harm.

"You can tell us what you know in a number of ways, by speaking local officers, contact us via our social media desk @MerPolCC or Wirral Police on Facebook and Twitter, or anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, a charity which is completely independent of police."
