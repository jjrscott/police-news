We are appealing for information following a stabbing in Prescot last night, Monday, 18 November.

Shortly after 10pm, officers were called to Coronation Drive following reports a 16-year-old boy had been assaulted by three males. Emergency services attended and the victim was taken to hospital for treatment to non-life threatening injuries to his hands and legs.

CCTV, witness and forensic enquiries are ongoing in a bid to identify the offenders and anyone with information is asked to come forward.

Detective Chief Inspector, Craig Sumner said: "An investigation is underway to establish the full circumstances and we are keen to hear from anyone with information.

"I would like to reassure the local community that we are doing all we can to find those responsible and I would ask anyone with cctv or dashcam footage from the area, or who saw any suspicious behaviour or people making off from the scene, to please let us know. Knife crime will not be tolerated by Merseyside Police and for a 16-year-old boy to be left injured in this way is simply not acceptable.

"We will be carrying out a number of enquiries in the area and anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 quoting ref. 19100675691 or @CrimestoppersUK, anonymously on 0800 555 111."
