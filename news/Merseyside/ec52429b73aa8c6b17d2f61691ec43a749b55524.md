Detectives have charged a West Derby man with drug conspiracy offences following warrants yesterday, Wednesday 5 August.

30-year-old Jordan Quinn of Valiant Close was arrested and has now been charged with conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine, ketamine, cannabis and possession of criminal property.

Quinn was remanded in custody to appear this morning (Thursday 6 August) at Liverpool Magistrates Court.

A second warrant was carried out Huyton, resulting in the seizure of around 12 kilos of drugs and adulterants, and high-value watches. Enquiries are ongoing to locate the occupants.

The enquiries are linked to the national Operation Venetic.
