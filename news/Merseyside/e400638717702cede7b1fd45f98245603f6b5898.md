Officers in Stockbridge Village and Huyton are introducing a second Section 60 order today, Tuesday 1 December, following the murder of 19-year-old Nyle Corrigan and ongoing issues in the Huyton area.

It follows an order introduced on Monday night during which we carried out stop searches and a number of arrests were made for offences including drugs possession and possession of a bladed article.

We will continue high visibility patrols in the area this evening and encourage anyone with information to speak to us.

The Section 60 will be in place from 5pm today (Tuesday 1 December) until 3am tomorrow (Wednesday 2 December).

The Order, under S60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, gives officers enhanced stop and search powers to stop males aged 14-50 in the area (pictured) and is designed to minimise serious violence in the area.

The area is bounded at the bottom by Princess Drive, Following the M57 boundary of Huyton, then going left towards to Croxteth Hall Lane, then going down along Princess Drive, across to Finch Road to the junction of Dovecot Ave and Pilch Lane, down to Pilch Lane East with the junction of A5080, then following the boundary of the A5080 to the M57 boundary.
