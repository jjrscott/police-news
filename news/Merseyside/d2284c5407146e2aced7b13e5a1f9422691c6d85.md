We are appealing for information after an armed robbery in Litherland this morning (Saturday 17 October).

It was reported just after 10.20am that a man holding what appeared to be a gun had entered Subway on Hawthorne Road demanding money.

He was handed a quantity of cash before leaving the branch and leaving the scene on a dark-coloured bicycle in the direction of Tesco.

The offender was described as white, with long wavy curly hair, wearing black clothing and a face covering.

There is a no suggestion a firearm was discharged or that anyone was assaulted or injured, but a member of staff was left shaken by the incident.

Detective Inspector Gary Stratton said: "These are the vital early stages of our investigation into this robbery, and we want to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident or saw a man with a bicycle acting suspiciously in the vicinity of Subway at about 10.20am today.

"No-one should be subjected to this level of fear and intimidation while they try to earn an honest living, so please come forward and we will do everything in our power to put this offender before the courts.

"Any small detail, be it CCTV, dashcam or a vehicle seen at speed in the area, could be key evidence, so let us know."

Anyone with information or who may have dashcam footage is asked to contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre'. You can also call 101 quoting incident reference 20000629019, or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
