Officers in Stockbridge Village are introducing a further Section 60 order today following the murder of a 19-year-old man on Thursday evening (12 November).

We will continue high visibility patrols in the area and encourage anyone with information to speak to us. The Section 60 will be in place from 3pm today (Monday 16 November) until 3am tomorrow (Tuesday 17 November).

The Order, under S60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, gives officers enhanced stop and search powers to stop males aged 16-40 in the area (pictured) and is designed to minimise serious violence in the area.

The area is bounded at the bottom by Princess Drive then running along Seth Powell Way and the M57, then down to Deysbrook Lane before meeting again at Princess Drive. The authorisation includes the roads at the boundary and the area and land within it.

Anyone who has any information which could help detectives with their enquiries is asked to contact our social media desk on Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' quoting the reference number 20000688863.
