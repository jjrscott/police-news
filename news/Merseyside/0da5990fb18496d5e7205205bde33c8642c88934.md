We are continuing to appeal for help in finding missing Liverpool man John Dickens.

John is 47 and has been missing from his home address in Everton since Wednesday 17th February.

He is white, 5ft 10in tall, of medium build, with short brown hair and a scar on his right eyebrow.

John is known to frequent London Road and the Everton area, including Netherfield Road and Everton Park.

Anyone who has seen John or knows where he is can contact us via 101, our social media desk @MerPolCC on Twitter or 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook, or the charity Missing People on 116 000.
