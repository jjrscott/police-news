Wirral detectives have charged a man and a woman with robbery in Birkenhead last month.

At around 1pm on Wednesday 18 November, the female victim was approached at the junction of Laird Street and Brassey Street by a woman who reportedly asked her for some change. A man then approached the victim and allegedly stole cash from her, and both made their escape following a struggle.

Following CCTV enquiries, officers attended at an address on Wednesday 2 December and detained two people.

38-year-old Michael Whelan and 46-year-old Francina McNulty, both of Rufford Road, Poulton, have now been charged with robbery and kept in custody to appear at Wirral Magistrates Court this morning, Friday 4 December.
