Police are appealing for information following several burglaries in Windle, Saint Helens, last week.

On 8th and 9th February three separate burglaries were reported overnight in the Bleak Hill Road area.

All of the incidents are reported to have taken place overnight while the victims were asleep.

It was reported that a wallet containing an amount of cash, an iPad, a laptop and a gold ring were stolen during the incidents.

Police have increased overnight patrols in the area.

CCTV, witness and forensic enquiries are ongoing and anyone with information is asked to contact police.

Inspector Matt Drennan said, "Burglary is an invasive crime that pervades people's homes and personal space, and can have a significant impact on victims

"I want to reassure the community- that we are committed to finding the people responsible for committing these crimes and putting them behind bars.

"We are appealing for anyone who was in the Bleak Hill Road area last Monday or Tuesday evening who saw anyone or anything suspicious to contact us. Similarly it is vital that we find anyone who was driving or walking in the area who may have captured something, either on their mobile phone, or dash cam to get in touch.

Anyone with information on this incident can contact us by DM via our social media desk on Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre. '

You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
