Patrols will continue to be out across Merseyside today to crack down on anti-social behaviour, deal with any unlawful gatherings and keep our communities safe.

A number of fixed penalty notices were issued last night (Saturday, 28 November) following reports of unlawful gatherings, including house parties and alcohol being served at licensed premises.

At around 6.30pm, patrols were called to the Queens Arms on Blacklow Brow following reports of a number of people gathered inside and alcohol being served. Officers attended and the licensee was issued with a fixed penalty notice for breaching Covid regulations.

At around 11.10pm, it was reported that a number of people had gathered and music was playing at the Liverpool Golf Driving Range, Caldway Drive. Officers attended and 11 people were issued with fixed penalty notices for breaching Covid regulations.

A number of house parties were also reported across Merseyside. In total, 17 fixed penalty notices were issued throughout the evening.

Superintendent Chris Gibson said: "The vast majority of our communities continue to follow government restrictions, however over the weekend we have again seen reports of gatherings and breaches of covid legislation.

"We have consistently engaged with our communities and encouraged the correct behaviour in the first instance, however we will not hesitate to use enforcement where people and businesses are blatantly flouting the rules.

"At present, we are still in a national lockdown and I can't stress enough the importance of staying at home to prevent risking the health of yourself and others. Merseyside cases continue to decrease but we must all abide by the rules to keep this going and to avoid undoing all the hard work so far, we do not want to see cases rise again.

"Christmas is fast approaching and we will then be able to spend time with our family and friends, but until then we must work together to protect our loved ones, neighbours, and vulnerable people across Merseyside.

"Patrols from the Roads Policing Unit, Matrix and Local Policing will be out across Merseyside today to engage with the public, crack down on antisocial behaviour, criminality and unlawful gatherings, and ensure the safety of our communities."

You can report any matters concerning COVID-19 and the current legislation to us @MerPolCC or through Merseyside Police's website https://www.merseyside.police.uk/.
