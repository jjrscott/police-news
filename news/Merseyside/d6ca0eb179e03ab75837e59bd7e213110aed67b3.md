We are investigating following a fatal collision in Thornton in the early hours of this morning, Saturday, 30 November.

At around 12:15 am, it was reported that a blue Audi Q7 was in collision with a female pedestrian on Moor Lane, near to the junction with Edge Lane.

Emergency services attended and the 50-year-old woman was taken to hospital, where she later died of her injuries.

The driver stopped at the scene to assist with enquiries.

The woman's next of kin have been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers at this time.

Officers are appealing for any witnesses to the collision to come forward, and are particularly keen to speak to a black hackney taxi driver that is believed to have dropped the female off in the area, immediately prior to the collision.

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 quoting ref. 19100700400 or the Roads Policing Unit on 0151 777 5747.
