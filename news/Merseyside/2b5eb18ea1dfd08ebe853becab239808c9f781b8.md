We have arrested three people and seized a firearm, drugs and cash following a warrant in Thatto Heath yesterday, Thursday 23 July.

At around 1.20pm, officers carried out a warrant at an address in Freemantle Avenue and detained three men. Following a search, a Glock handgun, drugs and cash were seized. The firearm has been forensically recovered for assessment.

A 20-year-old man from St Helens was arrested on suspicion of possession of Class A and Class B drugs; possession of a firearm; and money laundering
A 20-year-old man from St Helens was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs, possession of a firearm; and money laundering
A 48-year-old woman from St Helens was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A and Class B drugs; possession of a firearm; and money laundering

All three people have been taken to police stations for questioning.

Inspector Rob Budden said: "We're delighted to be removing this firearm from circulation, in addition to Class A and B drugs and cash. This and any firearm have the potential to cause significant fear and harm in our community.

"Our investigations are now underway and I would ask anyone with information to come forward.

"We work tirelessly to pursue those involved in serious and organised crime, and responding to information from our communities. Keep coming forward with information so we can put those involved before the courts and remove dangerous weapons."
