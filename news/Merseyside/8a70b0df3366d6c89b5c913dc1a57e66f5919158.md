A man has been charged this evening (Thursday 30 April 2020) with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in Wallasey on Wednesday.

We were called shortly after 11.45am to reports a 20-year-old man had sustained stab wounds to the head, leg and back in an assault on St Elmo Road. He remains in hospital receiving treatment where his condition is described as serious but stable.

Connor Young, 22, of Beckwith Street, Birkenhead was arrested a short time later and has been charged with attempted murder. He has been remanded in custody to appear at Wirral Magistrates Court tomorrow (Friday 1 May).
