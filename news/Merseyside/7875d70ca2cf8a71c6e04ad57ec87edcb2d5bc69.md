Detectives investigating a robbery in Kirkby on Tuesday 16th February have arrested three men in connection with the incident.

At around 1.25pm a man in his 50s had returned to his van after withdrawing money from a cashpoint at the junction of Rowlings Way and Broad Lane when he was approached by a male carrying a black sports bag with boxes of kitchen knives.

The male placed one of the boxes on the dashboard of the man's car.

The male then produced a knife and made threats to the man to hand over cash. The man handed over cash and the male walked away.

Following an investigation, three men aged 18, 20 and 42, all from Chester, were arrested yesterday (Tuesday, 2 March) on suspicion of robbery and handling stolen goods. They have since been released under investigation as enquiries continue.

An investigation is ongoing and anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 21000102227.
