A 19 year old from St Helens was arrested yesterday (24th March) on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs and possession of criminal property.

Officers on patrol in the Clock Face area of St Helens spotted the man in a Blue Fiat Punto at around 10am. The teenager and the car were searched where, inside the boot of the car, officers found a large amount of cash, three phones, around 100 wraps of white powder, believed to be cocaine and 10 wraps of brown powder, believed to be heroin.

All items were seized and the man was taken to custody for further questioning.

Inspector Neil Birkett said "Drugs are deadly and should not be sold or used by anyone living in Merseyside. Often, those involved in drugs, whether that's dealing or taking them, are exposed to more serious violence and other crime.

"Please continue to report those involved in this illegal activity and make Merseyside a safer place for kids to grow up, visitors to explore and law abiding citizens to live. If you suspect someone in your community, then report it to us @MerPolCC, dial 101 or contact @CrimestoppersUK anonymously."
