We are appealing for witnesses following reports of an assault in Tuebrook this afternoon, Saturday 10th October.

At 1.40pm we were called following reports two males, both in their 20s, had been assaulted at Pepinos Cafe on Rocky Lane. One suffered laceration injuries to his leg, arm and back and the second suffered laceration injuries to his hand. It is believed the injuries were caused by a bladed weapon. Both are currently in hospital receiving treatment for their injuries.

An investigation is underway and house-to-house and CCTV enquiries are being carried out in the area.

Detective Inspector Simon Hurst said: "At this stage the motive for the assault is not clear. I would ask for anyone who was in the area of Rocky Lane this afternoon who saw or witnessed anything suspicious to contact us as they may have information which is vital to our investigation."

Anyone who has information is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 462 of 10th October.
