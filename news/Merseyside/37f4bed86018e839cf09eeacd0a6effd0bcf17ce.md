Detectives are appealing for information after two men were stabbed at their home this morning (Saturday, 23 May 2020).

At about 9.35am officers were called to an address on Croxdale Road West to reports that two men had been stabbed.

When they arrived at the address they found a 55-year-old man who had suffered a serious cut to his right arm and other cuts to his left arm, and an 18-year-old man, who had suffered a cut to his head. Both men were taken to hospital where they are being treated for their injuries, which are not life threatening.

House-to-house inquiries are underway and the scene has been cordoned off whilst Crime Scene Investigators carry out forensic examinations. Officers will also be examining CCTV in the area in a bid to identify the offenders.

Chief Inspector Karl Baldwin, said: "The investigation is in the early stages and at this stage the motive for the attack is unknown.

"It is believed that the 55-year-old victim was attacked by a group of three or four males, not further described. He went back in to his home, but was followed by the males, who also attacked an 18-year-old man in the house before leaving. The attack is believed to have been targeted and there is no risk to the wider community.

"Both victims have been taken to hospital where medical staff are treating them for their injuries.

"I would ask anyone in the area who witnessed the incident, or a group of males acting suspiciously in the area before or after the attack, to come forward with information. You may have been passing in a car at the time and have dashcam footage - if you do, we would be very keen to hear from you."
