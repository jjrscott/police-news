Can you help Liverpool Coroner's Office find the next of kin for a West Derby man who recently passed away?

75-year-old Peter Ferris sadly died last Wednesday (10 February) at his home on Coachmans Drive. There are no suspicious circumstances.

Please call Karen Gregory on (0151) 233 0989 with any information or email hmcoroner@liverpool.gov.uk. Thank you.
