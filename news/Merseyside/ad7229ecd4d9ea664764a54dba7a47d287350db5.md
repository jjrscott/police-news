Detectives in Liverpool are appealing for information as we investigate a shooting in Dingle yesterday, Tuesday 29 December.

Armed police were called to Dingle Lane at around 11.15pm to reports of damage to a house, later confirmed as the result of a shot fired. Nobody was injured but the occupants were left extremely shaken.

Officers remain in the area to carry out house-to-house enquiries, and a full search of the area.

Detective Inspector Lisa Milligan said: "It appears that this incident, by good fortune alone, hasn't resulted in any injuries. We initially believe that the address damaged was not the target, and those occupants have been left understandably shocked by what has happened.

"We'll be supporting them, speaking to local residents and carrying out an initial investigation. If you know anything, please come forward and share with us, either directly or anonymously.

"Information from those communities harmed by serious violent crime is vital to tracking down those responsible, and removing criminals and their lethal weapons from circulation.

"If you saw the incident itself, or anyone making off on foot or at speed in any vehicle, pass on your dashcam, CCTV and other information straight away, and we'll take action."
