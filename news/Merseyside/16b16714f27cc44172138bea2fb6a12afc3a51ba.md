We have arrested a man and seized a quantity of cash following a warrant in Wirral this morning, Tuesday, 16 February.

At around 7am, officers attended an address in School Lane, Bidston and arrested a 49-year-old man on suspicion of conspiracy to supply class A and B drugs. He has been taken into custody for questioning.

Following a search of the address, officers recovered a quantity of cash and cash counting machine.

The arrest is part of national Operation Venetic.

Acting Detective Sergeant John Molyneux said: "Today's arrest comes as part of a national investigation into the use of encrypted mobile devices, commonly referred to as Encrochat, and drug supply across the UK.

"Those involved in the supply and distribution of dangerous drugs have no regard for the misery they cause and the lives they can affect, which is why operational activity such as today's warrant is vital in disrupting criminal activity and putting individuals involved before the courts.

"An investigation is ongoing and we will continue to work closely with partner forces up and down the country, as well as North West Regional Organised Crime Unit and the National Crime Agency, to protect our communities and prevent harmful drugs from reaching our streets.

"We cannot do this without the help of the public and would urge anyone with information on the supply of drugs or individuals involved in serious and organised crime, to please get in touch, either directly through us or through Crimestoppers, completely anonymously."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
