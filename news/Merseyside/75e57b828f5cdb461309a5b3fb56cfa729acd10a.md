Wanted

16:54 21/12/2020

Have you seen this woman? David Edwards, 38, from Kirkdale is wanted on recall to prison.

Edwards - who also uses the surnames Roach and O'Brien - was given a sentence of two months, 23 days for harassment and released on licence on 18 December this year.

He was recalled to prison the same day for breaching the terms under which he was released, and once arrested will serve the remainder of his sentence.

Extensive enquiries have been ongoing to trace him since.

Edwards is described as white, 6ft tall, of medium build, with short brown hair, blue eyes and facial hair. He has a Liverpool accent and has links to the city centre, Kirkdale, Litherland, Toxteth and Kensington.

He has scars on his forehead, nose, left arm and right leg.

He also has tattoos including one reading 'Born a Red Die a Red' on his left arm, a leaf on the back of his left hand, Donald Duck smoking on his right arm, a tribal sleeve on his lower right arm and Arabic words on his chest.

Anyone with information on Edwards's whereabouts is asked to contact @MerPolCC or 101 with reference 20000768554.

You can also pass information anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, or contact them via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
