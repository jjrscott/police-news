We are appealing for information following a cash robbery in Allerton this morning, Monday 21 December.

At around 9.50am, officers were called to Tesco on Mather Avenue to reports of two men, one armed with a crowbar, approaching a cash delivery driver and stealing cash. Threats were made but no injuries caused.

CCTV, witness and forensic enquiries are ongoing at the scene.

A silver Vauxhall Mokka believed to have been involved has been found burnt out in nearby Glendyke Road. Officers and MFRS are at this location carrying out house-to-house, CCTV and forensic enquiries.

A/Detective Sergeant Lucy Nicholson said: "This incident happened at a busy location and as such we've already identified a number of witnesses. But anyone else who was there and saw the incident, saw this vehicle making off or being abandoned nearby, please let us know. Your CCTV, dashcam and other footage may be vital.

"Although thankfully not injured, this will have been a shocking experience for the victim and anyone who saw it. We work closely with security companies and businesses, and there are many measures to deter would-be offenders, as well as previous successes we have had in court. Come forward and we'll act on all information to put those responsible before the courts.

"Anyone with information is asked to contact our social media desk @MerPolCC, call 101 quoting ref. 20000773541 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
