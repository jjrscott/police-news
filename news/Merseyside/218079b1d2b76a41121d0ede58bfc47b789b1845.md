Detectives are appealing for information following an aggravated burglary at a home in St Helens in December.

At around 7.30pm on Monday 21 December, three males gained access to a home on Park Road and made threats to the occupant, a woman in her 60s. The victim was pushed against a wall and threatened further while the property was searched. No items were stolen and the males made off a short while later.

All three were wearing face coverings. Forensic, witness and CCTV enquiries are ongoing.

Detective Constable Andrea Thompson said: "Enquiries thus far lead us to believe that this was a case of mistaken identity, and nothing was stolen or injuries caused. For the lady concerned to have her home invaded and be threatened, pushed and terrified by three offenders is despicable, and she is being supported as our investigation continues.

"Were you in the Park Road area at around the time of 7.30pm the Monday before Christmas? If you saw or heard anything, or captured these suspects on home or business CCTV, dashcam or any other device, please come forward as soon as possible and we will take action. Burglary causes a significant impact on all of those who are targeted, so tell us what you know and we will remove those responsible from the community."
If you have information about this incident, contact us by DM via our social media desk on Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' with reference 20000774953. Always call 999 if a burglary is in progress.
