Detectives investigating the murder of Stephen Maguire in Birkdale in March have arrested a fourth man today, Tuesday, 22 September.

Emergency services were called to an address in Guildford Road shortly after 11.35pm on Monday 16 March to reports that a man had been shot. The victim, 27-year-old Stephen Maguire, was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead a short time later.

In May, three men were arrested and charged in connection with the murder.

As part of the ongoing investigation, officers today arrested a 34-year-old man from Liverpool on suspicion of murder.

He has been taken to a local police station for questioning.

Detective Chief Inspector Rachel Wilson said: "We have arrested a fourth man in connection with the murder of Stephen Maguire today, which is another positive step forward in seeking justice for Stephen and his family.

"Despite this arrest, an extensive investigation remains ongoing and we are still keen to speak to anyone with information on this brutal crime.

"Enquiries are still ongoing to trace a dark coloured Mercedes seen making off from the scene of the crime in the direction of New Cut Lane. If you saw, heard or captured any images of this vehicle, be it the smallest detail, please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to submit information via the UK Police Major Incident Public Reporting Site, at the following link: https://mipp.police.uk/operation/05MP20M36-PO1 where it will be treated sensitively.

You can also pass on information anonymously via the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 with reference 20000166174.
