A Section 60 order in the Birkenhead area has been extended following reports of serious violent crime in the area.

The Section 60 will resume at 1pm today, Thursday 18th March and run until 4am tomorrow, Friday 19th March.

The Order, under S60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, gives officers enhanced stop and search powers in the area (pictured) and is designed to minimise serious violence.

The area covers Birkenhead North, Birkenhead town centre, Beechwood and Noctorum estates, Oxton, Claughton and Prenton.

Community policing inspector Tom Welch: "Following assaults and reports of violent crime in the area covered by this order, we have chosen to extend the Section 60 in order to help prevent further danger in the community.

"Officers will not be troubling people going about their business. If you see us in the street then please do come and say hello - and feel free to share any information or concerns you have so we can take positive action."
