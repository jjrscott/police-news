Detectives have charged a Wirral man with drug conspiracy offences following a warrant yesterday, Thursday 25 March.

Officers carried out a warrant in Upton early yesterday morning, detained a man, and seized items including cash.

33-year-old Bradley Luxton of Birch Avenue, Upton has now been charged with three counts of Conspiracy to supply Class A; two counts of Conspiracy to supply Class B; and converting criminal property. He has been remanded in custody to appear this morning (Friday 26 March) at Wirral Adult Remand Court.

The charge forms another part of the Merseyside Police response to Operation Venetic: a national investigation into the use of encrypted mobile devices, commonly referred to as Encrochat.
