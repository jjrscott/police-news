Kyle Gareth Whitley

The family of 18 year-old Kyle Gareth Whitley - who was fatally stabbing in Vincent Road, Litherland on Monday - have today paid the following tribute:

As a family we are devastated by the sudden and tragic loss of our much loved Kyle.

It has been such a terrible shock for our family and our hearts are heavy with grief and sadness.

Kyle was such a kind, funny yet mischievous son and brother, and with much love from all of his family, he truly brightened up the atmosphere of any place whenever he was around.

The world is a sadder place for all of us without himâ€¦ he just wanted to belong.

We realise now more than ever, how loved and valued he was by those who knew him and loved him, including his true friends.

It is hard to describe just how much Kyle meant to us all as a family, No one can compare to him.

We will always love and miss him x Fly high with your big brother now Kyle and please keep smiling x

We would really like to thank all of the people who tried so hard to help save Kyle.

We are forever grateful to every single person who showed him kindness and compassion when he really needed it, and we are so appreciative of all the lovely comments that people have posted on social media for Kyle.
