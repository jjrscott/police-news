**Issued on behalf of the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit**

Officers from the Regional Prison Intelligence Unit at the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit (NWROCU) jointly with North Wales Police, have arrested a prison officer based at HMP Berwyn in Wrexham, North Wales Yesterday, Thursday 16 July.

Following enquiries, the 25-year-old woman from Wrexham was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in a public office and conveying prohibited articles into prison.

She was taken to a police station for questioning and has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

In a joint statement, Detective Inspector Dawn Hampson from NWROCU and Nick Leader, Governor at HMP Berwyn, said: "We can confirm that following a joint investigation between the Prison Service and NWROCU, a member of staff from HMP Berwyn has today been arrested.

"Corruption of any kind will not be tolerated and we continue to work closely in partnership to ensure anyone who breaks the rules is brought to justice.

"We would like to encourage members of staff working at prisons to report anyone they suspected are involved corrupt activity, so that we can act on it immediately and put offenders before the courts.

"The majority of prison staff are hardworking, honest individuals and we are committed to removing the harmful minority and deterring others from this foolish and harmful path."
