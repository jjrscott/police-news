Two men have been arrested for possession of an offensive weapon and theft after they reportedly stole a motorcycle from outside Nando's in Queens Square, Liverpool.

The Honda motorbike was stolen at around 7:30pm yesterday evening (24th November) whilst the owner was inside the restaurant.

Luckily, the bike was fitted with a tracker and so officers were able to follow its journey to a property on Sycamore Road, Wirral.

Officers from the #OpTarget team in Wirral attended the location where they found the bike in an alleyway nearby.

Two men aged 17 and 22 were detained at the property and arrested on suspicion of theft. A hammer was also found underneath the motorbike seat and so the pair were further arrested for possession of an offensive weapon. They were both taken to custody for questioning.

A further search of the property recovered a large amount of suspected ecstasy tablets concealed inside the BBQ.
