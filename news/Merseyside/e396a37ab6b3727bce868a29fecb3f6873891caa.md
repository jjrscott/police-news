We have seized a knife and hammer off a 15 year old boy in Everton as part of our efforts to prevent serious violence.

Op Target officers in plain clothes spotted two men on Breck Road at around 7pm yesterday (17th December) who they thought were acting suspiciously.

The pair were stop searched and the 15 year old boy was found carrying a knife and hammer whilst the 20 year old man was found in possession of multiple wraps of suspected cocaine.

The teenager was arrested on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon and bladed article, taken to custody and later returned home. The 20 year old was arrested on suspicion of possession of a controlled Class A drug and also taken to custody for questioning.

Officers remain committed to keeping our communities safe and protecting young people from getting involved in criminality. If you know someone involved in crime, please report it and help us educate teenagers by showing them that there is much more to life than being involved in serious violence - together, we can all keep our communities #BladeFree
