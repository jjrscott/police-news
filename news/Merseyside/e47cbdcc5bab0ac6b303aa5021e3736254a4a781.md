We are appealing for information after a man was assaulted in a park in Kirkby on Sunday, 15 March.

It was reported just before 9am that a man had been walking through Old Rough Park when he was assaulted by a group of around four males.

The victim, who suffered minor injuries to his face, made his way onto Roughwood Drive where he was seen by a member of the public who kindly drove him home.

Officers attended and the 18-year-old victim was located safe and well with family at a property in Ormskirk.

Enquiries into the exact circumstances of the incident and who is responsible are ongoing.

Anyone with information should contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre'. You can also call 101 quoting incident reference 242 of 15/3/20 or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their website here: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously
