Detectives in Liverpool are issuing the image of a man who may have information following an attempted robbery in Liverpool City Centre earlier this month.

At around 8.45am on Thursday 7 January, a woman in her 20s was walking to work at the junction of College Lane and Peters Lane towards Liverpool One. She noticed a man walking towards her who attempted to grab her bag, but she managed to hold on.

The suspect made further demands for money before walking off towards the Doctor Martins shop. The woman was uninjured but left distressed, and called police.

Detective Constable Chris Cook said: "We'd like to speak the man pictured as he may hold vital information to assist this investigation.

"This woman was extremely brave but left understandably shaken by what happened, and we're determined to find the person responsible. If you know anything, please contact us directly or anonymously via Crimestoppers."

You can pass information via @MerPolCC on Twitter or message 'Merseyside Police CC' on Facebook with reference 21000013392. Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information-online/
