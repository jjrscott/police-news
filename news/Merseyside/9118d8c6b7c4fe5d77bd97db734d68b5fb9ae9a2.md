Officers attended Formby beach on Saturday 20 March following the discovery of a suspected unexploded ordnance device.

At around 1.50pm, a member of the public called emergency services to report an ordnance on Lifeboat Road.

The device - identified as a marine location marker - was safely detonated by the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Team.

We would like to thank the community for their patience while the incident was dealt with.
