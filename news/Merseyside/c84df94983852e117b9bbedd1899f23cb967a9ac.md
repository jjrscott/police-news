ORIGINAL

We can confirm that armed officers are in the Kirkdale area dealing with an incident this morning, Monday 13 January.

At around 10am, officers attended Westminster Road following information of a man allegedly in possession of a weapon and making threats. A negotiator is on the scene.

The road has been closed while we deal with the incident at Leven Street; Bradewell Street; Tawd Street and Barlow Lane and we would ask people to avoid the area.
