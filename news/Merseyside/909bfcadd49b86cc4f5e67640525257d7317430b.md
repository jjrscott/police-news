We are appealing for information after a report a teenage boy was robbed at knifepoint in Crosby on Wednesday afternoon (26 February).

It was reported the 14-year-old was approached by a white male, aged 16/17, who threatened the boy with a knife in Rimrose Valley Country Park, just off Drummond Road.

He then took the victim's grey Trek bike, which has yellow grips.

The offender is described as having short black hair and was wearing black pants and a grey/silver Berghaus coat. He walked away across the park with the bike and met two other males, who were also on bikes.

Detective Inspector Catherine Walsh said: "The victim was thankfully unharmed during this incident, but to be threatened at knifepoint for his bike is clearly extremely upsetting.

"We will act on all information given to us to bring those responsible to justice, and I am calling upon anyone who saw anything, has heard about what happened or who has seen or been offered the bike since to get in touch.

"We are making our own enquiries and we will continue until justice is served, but information from the public could prove absolutely vital.

"Knife crime has no place in our communities, and our green spaces are there to be enjoyed safely by people of all ages. We intend to keep it that way."

Anyone with information should contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre'. You can also call 101 quoting incident reference 20000124222 or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their website here: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously
