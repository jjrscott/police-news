We can confirm a 37-year-old man was jailed at Liverpool Crown Court yesterday (Thursday, 12 December) after admitting sex offences against a child.

Matthew Quirk, of Winter Grove, St Helens, pleaded guilty to rape of a female under 13 and sexual assault by penetration. All of the offences were committed in 2002 against the same girl.

Quirk was sentenced to 11 years and four months and has also been issued with a Sexual Harm Prevention Order (SHPO).

Detective Constable Kevin Thomas said: "Quirk is a dangerous individual and he will now spend a significant amount of time behind bars where he can no longer pose a risk to children.

"I would like to commend the victim for her bravery in coming forward and hope this sentencing sends out a message that time is no barrier to obtaining justice. If you have suffered a sexual offence and can find the courage to come forward, we will take your report extremely seriously and investigate it thoroughly.
