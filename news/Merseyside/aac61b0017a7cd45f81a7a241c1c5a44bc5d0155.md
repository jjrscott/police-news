Officers have arrested a 47 year old man on suspicion of murder yesterday evening (15th August).

We were called to Moorland Road, Maghull by North West Ambulance Service at around 9:20pm following a concern for safety of a 45 year old woman in the area.

The woman was taken to hospital where she sadly passed away. Specialist officers are supporting her relatives at this difficult time.

Investigations are ongoing into the full circumstances and forensic analysis as well as house to house enquiries will likely continue throughout the weekend.

Anyone with information should contact police quoting log 1071 of 15th August.
