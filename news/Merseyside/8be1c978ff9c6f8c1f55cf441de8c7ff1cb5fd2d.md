Officers on patrol in Kirkby yesterday (8th December) attended the industrial park on Newstet Road following reports that a suspected cannabis farm was located in one of the units.

Upon arrival at around 3:30pm, they noticed a strong smell of cannabis so entered the unit where they located over 50 6ft cannabis plants being grown in a large tent and a separate drying room containing further full sized crop in the process of being dried out.

Two men, aged 24 and 21 were also located inside the unit. They were both arrested on suspicion of Production of Cannabis and being concerned in the Supply of a Controlled Drug.

They were taken to custody for further questioning.

The unit has undergone extensive forensic analysis and our Cannabis Dismantling Team have attended to seize and destroy the plants.

Sergeant Sophie James: "Anyone involved in growing cannabis on Merseyside will be found and their product will be destroyed. It is not healthy or safe to be involved in drug crime and often leads to more serious violence. I would encourage anyone that knows someone selling, using or growing cannabis to get in touch so we can keep our communities drug-free."
