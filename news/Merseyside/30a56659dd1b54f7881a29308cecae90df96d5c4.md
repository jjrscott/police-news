An investigation is underway after a man was assaulted in Liverpool city centre tonight, Friday 11th December.

We were contacted at 6.35pm following reports a man had been assaulted near to the TJ Hughes store on London Road. The man is believed to have suffered head and facial injuries and has been taken to hospital where he is a serious but stable condition.

A 28 year-old man from the Old Swan area was arrested nearby on suspicion of s18 assault and is currently in custody where he will be questioned by detectives.

An investigation is underway and witness and CCTV enquiries are being carried out in the local area.

Detective Inspector Nick Suffield said: "Enquiries into what took place are in the early stages. I would ask anyone who was in the area of London Road this evening who witnessed anything to contact us.

"I am particularly interested in any taxi or delivery drivers who may have been in the area and would ask that they check their dash-cams to see if they have captured anything significant."

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has any information which could assist the investigation is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK quoting reference 20000753062.
