A loaded gun has been recovered and four men have been arrested on suspicion of possession of a firearm after officers stopped a car in Bowring this afternoon (Saturday, 26 October 2019).

Shortly after 1pm officers stopped a silver Mercedes A200 at the junction of Bowring Park Road and Chelwood Avenue. One of the occupants tried to run off and threw an object as he ran, but officers managed to detain the male and recovered the item, which turned out to be a loaded handgun.

The four men - a 29-year-old from Rock Ferry; a 22-year-old from Ellesmere Port; a 25-year-old from Kensington and a 24-year-old from Seacombe - who were arrested on suspicion of possession of a firearm, have been taken to a police station where they will be interviewed by detectives.
