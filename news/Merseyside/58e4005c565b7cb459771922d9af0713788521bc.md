Chief Constable Andy Cooke has today expressed his delight following the news that a member of the force has been awarded the MBE in the Queen's New Year's Honours list.

Following the announcement that Merseyside Police Constable Malique Jamal Al-Shabazz has been given the award in the New Year's Honours, Chief Constable Andy Cooke, said: "I am so proud of Malique and delighted that he has been recognised for the fantastic work he does for the communities of Merseyside

"Malique's dedication and passion signify the very best of community policing and for the last 20 years he has served the community of Toxteth and the wider BME communities with a real desire and passion to make a difference and provide them with support.

"In his role as an officer within the Granby Cop Shop he has earned the trust of local community working with groups from the Muslim and Jewish faiths and Pakistani, Yemanese, Iraqi, Somalian and Eritrean residents. Over the years he has helped the different communities to secure premises for local meetings, but more importantly he has acted as a mediator to end disputes and bring cohesion and peace to the area.

"Malique is also a role model for new constables and has introduced a new process for probationers, which involves them spending a day with him learning about Muslim and Jewish cultures and how their policing style could affect these faiths and communities, which helps the force to deal more sensitively with cultural issues and provide an appropriate and understanding response tailored to the different communities we serve."

"All of Merseyside should be proud of Malique's achievements and I am sure that those who have worked with Malique, and those who have benefitted from his compassion and dedication to local policing throughout the last 20 years, would join me in congratulating him.

Constable Malique Jamal Al-Shabazz, said: "I'm really humbled by receiving this award and would like to thank the local community for all their help and support over the years, it has been a true partnership of people who want to do their best for each other.

"I felt truly humble when I was told that I was receiving the award, particularly as I love doing what I do and the support I receive from my local community really helps to make my job so much easier."
