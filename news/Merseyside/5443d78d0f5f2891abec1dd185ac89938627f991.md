We are appealing for witnesses following reports on assault in Wirral.

At around 8pm on Sunday 24th May a 32 year-old man was assaulted by three males as he walked on Bidston Hill, close to the windmill, and punched to the head and face.

The man suffered a fractured jaw as a result and has had to undergo hospital treatment.

The first man is described as bald, of medium build and muscular, in his late 20s or early 30s and wearing a blue top, with white shorts and white socks.

The second man was is in his late 20s, 5ft 8in tall, with brown hair and brown eyes and of large build. He was wearing a white T-shirt, grey shorts and a blue cap.

The third man is described as of skinny build, with long straight hair, wearing a white T-shirt with a red logo, brown shorts and white trainers.

It is also believed that two other males were present and may have witnessed the assault. One of the males had dark black hair and was wearing a white top and black shorts and had a black dog on a lead.

Detective Paul Parry said: "This was a shocking and unprovoked attack on a man who was out walking and resulted in him suffering a terrible facial injury.

"We know that Bidston Hill is popular with dog walkers and walkers and I would appeal to anyone who was in the area that evening or who recognises the description of any of the males to contact us as they may have information which is vital to our investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 20000302931.
