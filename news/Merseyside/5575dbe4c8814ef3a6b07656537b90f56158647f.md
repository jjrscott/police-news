Detectives are investigating following shots were fired in Vauxhall in the early hours of this morning, Tuesday 14 January.

At 1.15am, officers were called to Eldonian Way to reports of gunshots. Damage was found to the windows of a residence, but no injuries were caused.

Forensic, house-to-house and CCTV enquiries are continuing this morning as we look to establish the full circumstances.

Detective Inspector Sabi Kaur said: "We are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances of this incident, and who the intended target was.

"To fire any weapon in the street is reckless in the extreme and, although nobody was injured, this is by chance alone. Were you in the Eldonian Way area around 1am and have home CCTV, dashcam, or saw or heard anything? Let us know and we will take positive action.

"Information from those communities who are affected by serious violent crime is often the key to removing people and their weapons off the streets. We have had excellent recent successes off the back of such calls, so stand alongside us and we will continue to seize items, arrests people and disrupt criminal activity where you live."

You can pass information via @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
