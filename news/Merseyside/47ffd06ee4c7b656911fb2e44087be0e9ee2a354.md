Detectives are appealing for information following an armed robbery at a Whiston shop on Sunday, 7 March.

At around 7.15pm, officers were called to Bargain Booze on Windy Arbor Road to reports of a man entering the shop in possession with what appeared to be a firearm.

Demands were made and cash was stolen before the man ran from the shop. Nobody was injured but staff were left distressed.

The suspect is described as wearing a facemask, gloves and dressed in dark clothing with a navy jacket. He is believed to have fled the scene on foot down an alleyway next to Guys and Dolls Hair Salon. Enquiries are ongoing, including forensics, CCTV and witnesses.

Detective Inspector Jackie Guinness said: "Regardless of whether this firearm was real or an imitation, this was a frightening experience to go through and we're supporting the victim as our investigation continues.

"If you saw anyone running from the location around 7.15pm on Sunday, or captured any images nearby on CCTV, dashcam or other devices, please come forward and we will take action.

"To be threatened at your place of work will not be tolerated and we're determined to track this person down and put them before the courts."

Please pass any information via our social media desk on Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' with reference 21000147110.
