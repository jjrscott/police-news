We are appealing for help in finding a 14 year-old boy who is missing from home in Knowsley.

Tu The Nguyen was last seen in the Huyton area at 2.15pm on Saturday 8th February.

He is a Vietnamese male, 4ft 10in tall, of medium build with short/shaven black hair and brown eyes. He also has a small scar in the middle of his forehead.

When last seen he was wearing a black Under Armour tracksuit with a black coat and black trainers and was wearing a large silver chain around his neck.

Anyone who has seen him or knows of his whereabouts is asked to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact @missingpeople on 116 000.
