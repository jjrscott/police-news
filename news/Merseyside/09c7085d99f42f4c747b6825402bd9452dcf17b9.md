Officers have arrested a 30-year-old man on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A controlled drugs, assault and resisting arrest.

At about 5.15pm the man, who was riding an electric motorbike on Ditton Lane, Moreton, was seen acting suspiciously by officers after getting off the bike and going in to some shrubs. As the officers approached the male he swung a glass jar hitting one of the officers causing a cut to his head which later required stitches. The jar smashed on contact and a large number of bags containing what is believed to be Class A drugs fell to the floor.

With the assistance of two other officers the man, who comes from Leasowe, was detained, but during the struggle one of the officers sustained an injury to his wrist.

He has been arrested on suspicion of possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply, resisting arrest, and two offences of assault and has been taken to a police station where he is being interviewed by detectives.
