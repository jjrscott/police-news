Detectives are issuing CCTV images of a man who may have information following an assault in Liverpool City Centre last November.

At around 11.30pm on Friday 1 November, the victim, a man in his 30s, was at the Grapes on Mathew Street when he was struck with a glass to the face, causing lacerations to the lip, cheek and neck.

Enquiries have been ongoing.

Detective Constable Matt Carlson said: "We believe that the man pictured could have vital information to help our continuing enquiries.

"This was a brutal assault following what can only be described as a minor altercation, and in which the victim was fortunate not to be more seriously injured.

"However, this will have been a traumatic experience and we're determined to find the person responsible."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 with reference 19100638215.
