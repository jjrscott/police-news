We can confirm a cordon was established in St Helens today (Friday 8 November 2019) following the discovery of fireworks that initially appeared to be a suspicious package.

They were found at around 6.15pm by officers investigating reports of a domestic incident in a house on Prescot Road.

As a precautionary measure a cordon was set up and nearby homes evacuated while further enquiries were carried out.

A short time later it was established that the items were several fireworks, and residents allowed back to their properties.

The safety of the public is always our priority and we would like to thank everyone for their patience and understanding while we responded to this incident.
