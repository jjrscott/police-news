We are issuing images of a man who may have information following a sexual offence in Birkenhead in May.

At around 8.20pm on Wednesday 27 May, CCTV footage at the Pyramids Shopping Centre captured a man exposing himself and committing an sexual act. Enquiries are ongoing.

Wirral Community Chief Inspector Paul Holden said: "This was a concerning incident which happened in a public place and close to a busy main road. We've been carrying out extensive enquiries since to identify the man responsible, and remove him from the streets.

"The man pictured may hold important information so if you recognise him, please let us know."

Anyone with information can contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' with reference 20000310480.
