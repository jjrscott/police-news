Sixty one fines were handed to people at house parties on Friday and Saturday night for breaching Covid restrictions, but we would like to thank the vast majority of the Merseyside public who did their bit to keep family, friends and neighbours safe.

Of those 61 fines, 53 were given to attendees at just two house parties in Liverpool.

Twenty-one 21 people were fined after officers attended at a house party on Cotswold Street, Kensington, shortly before 11pm on Friday night, whilst 32 fines were handed out to people after police received calls just after 10pm about a party at a flat in Lowbridge, Court, last night (Saturday, 4 October). A venue in the Baltic Triangle was also issued with a fine after failing to adhere to guidelines to keep customers safe.

Chief Inspector Karl Baldwin, said: "This weekend the majority of people across Merseyside have done the right thing and they are doing what they physically can to keep their loved ones safe. The Liverpool city region is currently in a really precarious position in relation to the potential spread of Covid-19 and special measures have been brought in for the area due to the sharp rise in positive tests across the county.

"Sadly, there have been some people who have blithely ignored the restrictions and through their own stupidity and recklessness they have put themselves and others at risk.

Chief Inspector Baldwin, added: "We will maintain our common sense approach in the days and weeks ahead, encouraging the people our officers meet on patrol to respect the restrictions and explaining to people why they are so important. And where people are flouting the restrictions we will take action. Our officers are out on the streets again tonight to make sure that the people of Merseyside understand the restrictions and are abiding by them.

"I would appeal to our communities to adhere to the guidance to keep your loved ones and ours safe.

"The safety of vulnerable people in Merseyside and our key healthcare workers should be everyone's priority, and I hope everyone now understands the risks to themselves and others of not listening to government advice. In order to return to normality as soon as possible, we need to work together and follow that advice."
