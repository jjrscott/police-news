Detectives are appealing for information after a shot was fired in Walton last night, Tuesday 5 January.

At shortly before 9pm, officers were called to Walton Lane to a report of a loud noise and a damage being found to the rear of an address. Armed officers attended and confirmed that the damage was caused by a firearm. Nobody was injured. House-to-house enquiries have been carried out and officers will remain in the area this morning to continue the investigation, including an area search, forensics and CCTV.

Detective Chief Inspector Matt Smith from our Firearms Investigation Team said: "At this stage we are looking to speak to anyone who saw or heard this incident, and we're keeping an open mind as to the motive and target. Although no injuries were caused, any weapon fired close to homes has the potential to have catastrophic consequences for people nearby.

"If you live nearby or were passing and hold any CCTV, dashcam or other information, let us know and we will take positive action. Although shootings have decreased on Merseyside, this is in no small part down to information provided in those communities affected. If you know where firearm and other weapons are being stored, carried or used, come forward and we will do the rest.
