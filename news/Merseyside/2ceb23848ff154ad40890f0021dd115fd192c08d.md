We are issuing the images of these two men, who detectives want to speak to in connection with two shootings in Kirkby in January.

Between 6.25pm and 6.40pm on Monday 6 January, two shootings took place at addresses on Windermere Drive and Mossborough Drive, resulting in damage to both properties.

Extensive enquiries continue and detectives think the two men pictured may have information to assist.

Dean Colquhoun (left), 25, is white, 6ft tall, of proportionate build, with dark brown hair and brown eyes.
Bobby Davies (right), 24, is white, 5ft 6in tall, of proportionate build, with brown hair and brown eyes.

Detective Inspector Sabi Kaur from our Firearms Investigation Team said: "We'd like to speak to both men as soon as possible, so if you have seen them or know where they are, let us know. Likewise, if you have any information about the incident itself, including CCTV, dashcam or any other footage, come forward.

"You can speak to us directly or anonymously via the charity Crimestoppers, which is completely independent of police. We understand the worry that people sometimes have in speaking to police abotu such incidents, but we will treat all information with sensitivity and care."
