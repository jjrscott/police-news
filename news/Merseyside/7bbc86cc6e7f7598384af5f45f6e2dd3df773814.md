We are appealing for drivers to check their dashcam after an armed robbery in Litherland at around midday yesterday (Thursday 10 September).

A man entered Denise Thomas Hair Salon holding a knife and demanded cash, taking a quantity from the till.

Staff handed over a quantity of cash and he left the premises. There were no reports of assault or injuries.

The offender - who was in dark clothing with a hood up and was wearing a mask - is reported to have left the scene on a bicycle across Church Road in the direction of Orrell Road.

Detective Inspector Paul Gillies said: "We believe the offender dropped the knife on Church Road before picking it up, and detectives are keen to speak to anyone who may have seen him before or after the incident.

"We are particularly keen to hear from any drivers who may have captured him on dashcam, and urge anyone who was driving on Church Road, near the junction with School Lane, at about midday to check their footage.

"Having studied CCTV we know a white van passed close to the offender after the incident and would be keen to speak to the driver about what he may have seen."

Det Insp Gillies added: "Business robberies are not victimless crimes and in this case staff and customers were left distressed by what they witnessed.

"We are committed to finding the man responsible and bringing him to justice, and information from the public could prove crucial."

Anyone who witnessed the incident or was passing and may have dashcam footage can DM us on Twitter via @MerPolCC or message us on Facebook at 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre'.
