Detectives investigating an assault in Southport last year are issuing CCTV images of two men who may have information to assist ongoing enquiries.

At 2.45am on Thursday 5 December 2019, officers were called to reports of a fight in Nevill Street, in which a man was found with facial injuries after allegedly being assaulted by a group of people.

Since the incident, extensive enquiries have been carried out. Two people have been arrested and remain under investigation, as follows:
A 35-year-old man from Kirkdale was arrested on suspicion of assault and affray
A 22-year-old woman from Southport was arrested on suspicion of assault, affray and obstructing police

Detective Chief Inspector Gayle Rooney said: "Although significant time has passed since this incident, arrests have been made as our enquiries have continued. As a result, we now believe that the two men pictured could hold valuable information to help so if you know them, please come forward.

"This was a sustained and violent assault in which the victim was extremely distressed but thankfully made a full recovery. We're determined to find all of those responsible and put them before the courts."
