Yesterday (21st November) #OpTarget officers were in #Liverpool carrying out activity to tackle serious and violent crime.

During the activity officers conducted 30 stop searches of people in the area and arrested 10 people for offences including possession of an offensive weapon, drug driving, theft and possession of drugs.

Other activity resulted in a stolen bike being recovered and a car being seized during a roadside operation.

Open land searches also took place in the Westminster Road and Melrose Road areas including roadside operations on Commercial Road, Westminster Road, Rocky Lane and Belmont Road.

Inspector Jordan Quinn said "This activity is absolutely crucial in enabling us to track down criminals and take them off our streets.

"These tactics remain the 'bread and butter' of policing and I'm pleased with yesterday's result and hope this shows those living locally that we are continuing to carry out this sort of activity on a daily basis and will do everything in our power to keep Liverpool as safe as it can be.

"I would continue to urge anyone with information to come forward. Passing on information about where weapons are being stored, who is carrying them and who is dealing drugs in your community is essential to allow us to take action.

"Supplying, dealing and taking drugs cause significant harm in our communities and we must educate young people of the consequences of their actions. We will continue working proactively with other emergency services, various partner agencies and our ambassadors to reassure the public and disrupt those actively involved in criminality."
