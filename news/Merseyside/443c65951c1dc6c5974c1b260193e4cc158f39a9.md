Wanted

12:23 22/12/2020

We are continuing to appeal for help to trace a 46-year-old man who is wanted on recall to prison.

John Riley was originally jailed for 10 years for conspiracy to supply drugs and released in December 2017. He was recalled to prison in February 2019 for failing to abide by license conditions.

Riley is described as a white male, 5ft 6in tall, of medium build, with very short brown hair and green eyes. He has a scar over his left eye and speaks with a Liverpool accent.

His last known address was in Bootle but he also has links to Scotland.

We are issuing one wanted appeal per day for 12 days to support the work of our Force Fugitive Team, so help us track these people down before Christmas.

Anyone with information on Thomson's whereabouts or any of our wanted people is asked to contact @MerPolCC or 101 with reference 19100060563.

You can also pass information anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. You can also contact them via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
