Officers have arrested two people following a firearms incident overnight.

We were called to an address on Wellington Road, Wavertree yesterday evening (6th July) at around 9:30pm following reports that a man had threatened another man with a gun.

Armed police were deployed to the scene and road closures were put in place on Wellington Road, Picton Road and Fairbank Street whilst officers dealt with incident.

First, a 27 year old woman was arrested at the scene on suspicion of possession of a firearm. A search was then undertaken of the house, where officers located a gas powered firearm. Officers then detained a 29 year old man, who was hiding in a shed. He was again arrested on suspicion of possession of a firearm and affray. Both were taken to custody for questioning.

The incident was stood down as a firearms incident at 11:45pm.

Officers remain at the location carrying out further enquiries this morning (7th July).

Detective Inspector Jennie Beck said: "Being in possession of any firearm, whether you intend on using it or not, is dangerous and puts the owner and wider community at risk.

"This threatening behaviour will not be tolerated by us - and those living in Merseyside should not feel scared to go about their daily lives or ever have to come face to face with someone carrying a weapon. Anyone with information on this incident or knows someone else who might be in possession of any type of firearm should get in touch @MerPolCC or contacting @CrimestoppersUK anonymously."
