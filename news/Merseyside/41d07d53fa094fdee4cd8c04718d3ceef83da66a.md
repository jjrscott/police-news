Following two weeks of dedicated proactive activity in the Liverpool area, last night (10th August) we ran an operation specifically using social media where the public were encouraged to contact us with their thoughts and concerns and we would deploy and deal with the issues (where we could) as they were brought to our attention.

We received numerous tweets and Facebook responses, some reaching over 13,000 people. This activity resulted in 31 stop searches, 12 arrests, 3 roadside operations and the recovery of 2 cannabis farms.

Those arrested included a man wanted on an arrest warrant following an armed robbery, four men arrested on suspicion of production of cannabis and the remainder for other offences.

Head over to our Liverpool Police Facebook Page to catch up on all the activity from last night.
