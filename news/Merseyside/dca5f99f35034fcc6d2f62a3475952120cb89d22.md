We are appealing for information after a report of a man indecently exposing himself in Kensington yesterday (Thursday 28 January).

A woman reported that she had witnessed the man performing a sex act at around 9.20am while she was walking along Denman Drive, near Saint Francis of Assisi School.

She confronted the man who made off on foot along Denman Way in the direction of Gardner's Drive.

Patrols attended the scene and searched the area but the man was not located.

He is described as white with very fair skin and light eyebrows, in his 30's, of medium build and around 6ft tall. At the time of the incident he was wearing a black woollen hat, a black coat with a light brown fur hood, a red t-shirt, black trousers and black trainers. He was carrying a black rucksack with yellow motifs on it.

An investigation into the incident is ongoing.

Detective Inspector Sean Kelly-Martland said: "We would like to appeal to the public who may have witnessed a man fitting this description in and around the Denman Drive area yesterday morning to come forward with any information that they might have as it could be vital to our investigation.

"Although incidents such as this are rare, I would like to reassure the local community that we are taking this matter very seriously. I would ask anyone with CCTV or dashcam footage from the area to please let us know. Any information, no matter how small, could assist our enquiries and help us find the man responsible."
