Three people have been arrested on suspicion of money laundering after officers spotted their Mercedes being driven suspiciously in the Mulgrave Street area yesterday evening (6th August).

The car was stopped just before 9pm and officers conducted a search where they found a large quantity of cash concealed down the side of the driver's seat.
The driver and two passengers (three men aged 18,18 and 33) were arrested and taken to custody for questioning.

The Mercedes was seized, along with a number of mobile phones and a sim card hidden in one of the offender's trainers, for further investigation.
