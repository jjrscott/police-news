A 38 year old man from Liverpool was arrested yesterday evening (28th Nov) on suspicion of affray, possession of an offensive weapon and Section 18 assault after he was involved in altercation at a gym on Derby Lane, Liverpool.

Two PCSOs who were out on patrol in the area sighted two men armed with poles enter the gym just after 8pm.

The PCSOs followed the men inside and tried to intervene where unfortunately one of them was assaulted, causing him injury to his ankle. He was taken to hospital for treatment.

A 38 year old man was consequently arrested, whilst officers are still appealing to locate the second man who made off from the scene.
