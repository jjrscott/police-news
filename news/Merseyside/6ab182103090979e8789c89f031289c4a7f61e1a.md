Detectives investigating a shooting in Toxteth last month, have released CCTV of four males they wish to speak to.

The incident happened on Sunday, 9 August at around 2.45pm when police were called to Malt Street, to reports a number of males on pedal bikes had fired shots in the area.

Detectives have now released CCTV images of four males they wish to trace and speak with as part of this investigation, as they believe they will be able to assist with enquiries.

Detective Inspector Sabi Kaur said: "We remain committed to tracing the person(s) responsible for this incident. While thankfully no-one was injured, this could have been a different story. The people responsible have been reckless in their actions, as they could have shot and injured or even killed someone.

"Members of local community were understandably upset and concerned by this incident but I believe they can also help us to put a stop to this and bring those responsible to justice. I would appeal to anyone who recognises the males pictured to get in contact. You can DM us @MerPol CC or call 101. You can also contact @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111."
