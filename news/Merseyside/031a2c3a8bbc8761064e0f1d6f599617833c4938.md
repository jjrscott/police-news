We are appealing for information following a non-injury discharge in Huyton.

Police were called to Gort Road just after 10.45pm on Monday, 3 February, to a report of a number of gunshots being fired at the second floor window of an occupied property.

Police attended and confirmed the damage is consistent with a firearms discharge, and a number of bullet holes and casing were located in and around the property.

There were no reports anyone was injured during the incident.

A cordon is in place while forensic investigations are carried out.

House to house enquiries have been carried out and officers are looking into what may have been captured on CCTV in the area.

Chief Inspector Lisa Ledder said: "This is a shocking incident in a residential area and it is totally reckless to shoot a gun like this, and we are doing all we can to find those responsible. A witness said they heard what sounded like a motorbike during the incident.

"Information from the community could be a vital part of our efforts to bring the perpetrator to justice and take the weapon used off our streets, and we ask anyone with information to speak to us.

"I know that people will be concerned and even feel too frightened to speak directly to us. If that's the case then please give information anonymously through Crimestoppers.

"Any information may help us, no matter how small it is so please help us identify those responsible."

Anyone with information should contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre'. You can also call 101 quoting incident reference 1016 of 3/2/20 or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their website here: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously
