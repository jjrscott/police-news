Detectives investigating a public order incident at Royal Liverpool University Hospital last week have arrested a woman.

At around 9.25pm on Tuesday 12 January, officers were called to reports of three women being removed from the hospital after reportedly causing distress to patients, staff and visitors. One of the women also reportedly directed homophobic abuse towards a male nurse.

Security at the hospital removed the women.

A 33-year-old woman from Kensington was arrested on suspicion of using threatening/abusive/insulting words/behaviour to cause harassment/alarm/distress and was taken to a police station for questioning.

She has been released on conditional bail pending further enquiries.
