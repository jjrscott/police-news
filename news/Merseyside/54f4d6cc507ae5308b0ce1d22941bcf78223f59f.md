Detectives have launched a murder investigation following the death of a man in Wirral.

Officers were called to a house in Vyner Croft, Birkenhead, at around 5.20pm on Sunday 7th March where they found the body of a 69 year-old man.

The man was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

A Home Office post mortem has revealed the cause of death to be a severe blunt force head injury.

The man, who lived alone, has been formally identified as Martin Decker and his next-of-kin have been informed.

An investigation is underway and a number of lines of enquiry are being pursued. CCTV, house-to-house and forensic enquiries are also being carried out in the local area.

Detective Chief Inspector Rachel Wilson said: "This is obviously a very a tragic incident and our thoughts are with Mr Decker's family and friends.

"The investigation is in the very early stages and we are currently working to establish Mr Decker's movements on the Saturday and Sunday (6th/7th March).

"Vyner Croft is only a small cul-de-sac and I am keen to establish if there was anyone seen in that road or any of the surrounding roads acting suspiciously prior to the discovery of Mr Decker's body.

"I would ask anyone, including delivery or taxi drivers, who were driving in the area in the past few days to check their dash cam to see if they have captured anything significant.

"I would also ask anyone who may have mobile phone or CCTV footage to get in touch as they may be able to assist our investigation.
