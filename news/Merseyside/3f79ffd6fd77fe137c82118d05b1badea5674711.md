Detectives in Wirral are appealing for information following an armed robbery at a shop in Heswall last night, Friday 25 September.

At around 8.50pm, officers were called to T&P Stores, Village Road to reports that two males wearing balaclavas had entered the store. One was in possession of a knife, and threats were made before money and cigarettes were stolen. The shopkeeper was uninjured but left extremely distressed. The two men reportedly made off in the direction of Station Road.

Detective Inspector Catherine Walsh said: "We're supporting the victim as our enquiries continue. To be threatened in such a way is an awful experience for anyone to go through, and we're determined to find those responsible and remove them from the streets. Nobody should be fearful in their workplace or elsewhere in the community.

"Were you in the area around 8.45pm and saw anyone enter or making off? Details of CCTV, dashcam or any vehicles used could be vital in our investigation, so come forward and tell us what you know."
