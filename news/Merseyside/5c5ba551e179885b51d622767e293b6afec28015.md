We are appealing for witnesses following a fatal RTC this afternoon, Monday 7 December.

At around 3pm, emergency services were called to the M57 in Prescot to reports of a collision involving a Vauxhall Corsa between junction 4 and junction 3.

The driver of the Corsa, a man in his 30s, was sadly pronounced deceased at the scene. He will be formally identified and his next of kin informed.

The motorway will be closed for a considerable time and diversions are being put into place, so please avoid the area.

Enquiries are ongoing with our Roads Policing Unit to establish the circumstances. We'd urge anyone who witnessed this incident or was passing at the time and may have captured dashcam footage to contact us @MerPolCC or call (0151) 777 5747, with reference 589 of 7 December.
