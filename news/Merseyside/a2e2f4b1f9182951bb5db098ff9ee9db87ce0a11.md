Detectives are investigating following an armed robbery at a Garston shop last night, Saturday 14 March.

At around 8.30pm, officers were called to Garston Food and Wine in Garston Old Road to a report of three men having entered the shop and made threats to staff, before stealing money and cigarettes.

The offenders were carrying a knife, a metal pole and a hammer.

All three offenders were wearing face coverings and dark clothes. The offenders made off in a dark coloured or black Ford Fiesta and a fourth man was seen driving the car

The car left the scene travelling along James Street and then onto Duke Street. Nobody was injured but staff were left shaken.

CCTV, witness and forensic enquiries are ongoing at the scene as we look to establish the full circumstances, and support those affected.

Detective Inspector Gavin Mulcahy said: "Luckily no none was injured in the incident but it is appalling to think a man just doing his job is subjected to such threats, we will not tolerate this and will do all we can to find those responsible and put them before the courts.

"We are at the early stages of our investigation and we want to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident, or saw three men in the area or making off in a Ford Fiesta. Come forward and we will take positive action.

"Any small detail, be it CCTV, dashcam or a vehicle seen at speed in the area, could be key evidence, so let us know."

Anyone with information can contact @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, giving the reference 0898 of 14/3/20.
