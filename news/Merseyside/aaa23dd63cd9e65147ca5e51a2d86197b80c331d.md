We are continuing to appeal for help in finding a 51 year-old Wirral woman who is missing from home.

Carol Mighall was last seen on Borough Road in Tranmere at 7pm on Thursday 7th January.

She is described as a white female, 5ft 4in tall, of slim build and with a pale complexion. She has brown shoulder length hair, often worn in a ponytail.

When last seen she was wearing a khaki coloured parka-style coat with grey fur on the hood, blue jeans and black and white speckled trainers. She was also carrying a black handbag with a shoulder strap.

She is known to frequent Birkenhead and Liverpool city centre.

Anyone who has seen Carol or knows of her whereabouts is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @missingpeople on 116 000.
