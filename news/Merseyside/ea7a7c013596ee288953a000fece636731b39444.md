Yesterday (8th December) officers from our #OpTarget team in Speke conducted a warrant at a property on Burnage Close following information received relating to drug dealing.

They arrived at around 10am and forced entry into the property. Unfortunately no one was home but officers conducted a search regardless where they found a Taser disguised as a torch inside the kitchen extractor fan, a small amount of cannabis and a bag of blue tablets.

These were all seized and an investigation is ongoing.

If you have any information regarding the supply or distribution of drugs, we want to know about it. Contact us directly @MerPolCC or call @CrimestoppersUK completely anonymously.
