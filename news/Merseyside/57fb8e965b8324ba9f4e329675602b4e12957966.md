Lisa Conway, the mother of 22-year-old Patrick Conway, who tragically died following a collision in Stockbridge Village on Monday, 20 April, has issued the following words:

"Please anyone, if you saw the accident, tell the police. You don't have to give your name but I deserve to know how and why my son lost his life, then maybe I can get some peace.

"I have lost my baby, my world is falling apart. Please somebody help me and come forward with information, no matter how trivial, it could help piece together the last moments of his precious life."
