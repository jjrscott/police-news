We arrested a man and recovered a handgun after executing a warrant in West Derby yesterday (Friday 28 February).

Officers conducted the warrant, at a house on Bonsall Road, after 11am and recovered a handgun, a BB gun and ammunition.

The firearms and ammunition have been recovered for forensic analysis to establish if they are connected with any incidents in Merseyside.

A 34-year-old man from West Derby was arrested on suspicion of possession of a Section 1 firearm and possession of ammunition without a certificate. He was taken into custody for questioning, where he remains.

Detective Inspector Sabi Kaur said: "Every time we take dangerous weapons off the streets and arrest those we suspect of being involved in criminality, it makes our communities safer.

"These guns cannot now be used to cause fear and harm in those communities, and the people who carry and store such weapons will sleep less soundly knowing that we are out there seeking to seize weapons and bring offenders to justice every day of the year.

"We will now look into whether these guns are linked to any incidents involving firearms and take appropriate action.

"People involved in serious and organised crime have no place in our communities. Be assured if you tell us where those people are, we will take their guns off them and put them before the court where they will face a long time behind bars."

Anyone with information about those involved in gun crime, or who knows where weapons are being stored should contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre'.
