Detectives investigating an assault in January have issued CCTV images of three men they wish to speak to in connection with the incident.

It was reported that at around 3.10am on New Year's Day (Wednesday, 1 January), a 29-year-old man was assaulted by a group of men in the Glasshouse Pub on Mill Lane, Old Swan. The victim was taken to hospital for treatment after sustaining serious but non-life threatening facial injuries.

An investigation is ongoing and officers are keen to speak to the men pictured, as they could have vital information to assist the investigation.

Detective Inspector Phil Atkinson said: "We are carrying out a number of enquiries after a man was assaulted in the early hours of New Year's Day and would ask anyone with information to please get in touch.

"If you were in the Glasshouse pub and witnessed the incident, recognise the men pictured or have any further information, please let us know by contacting @MerPolCC with reference 20000003232 or Crimestoppers, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
