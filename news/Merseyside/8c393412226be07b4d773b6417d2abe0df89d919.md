Do you recognise these males? Detectives think they may have information following a burglary in Birkenhead in September.

At around midday on Tuesday 15 September, entry was gained to a home on Borough Road, Tranmere and cash and a gold necklace with a crucifix (pictured) were stolen. Enquiries are ongoing.

Detective Constable Tom Murphy said: "If you know those pictured or have any information about this incident, please come forward. Likewise if you have seen or been offered this jewellery online or in person, let us know as soon as possible.

"Any burglary is a distressing experience to go through but this necklace has particular sentimental value and we're determined to bring it back to the rightful owner."

Always call 999 if a burglary is in progress. You can also pass information via our social media desk @MerPolCC on Twitter or 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook with reference 20000558636, or call the independent charity @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111.
