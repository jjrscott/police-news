Detectives are appealing for information on what would have been the 21st birthday of Yusuf Sonko, today, Thursday 5 March.

Yusuf was fatally shot on Friday 2 June 2017 at the rear of shops on Lodge Lane, Toxteth. A number of men have been arrested and remain under investigation in connection with his murder and a Â£20,000 reward remains in place as we continue our enquiries.

The family of Yusuf are hosting two events in Toxteth this week to mark the occasion and celebrate his life.

On Thursday 5 March, a vigil will take place at Tiber Square on Lodge Lane between 5pm and 6.30pm, during which a number of speeches are planned.

On Saturday 7 March, a fundraising event will take place at Liverpool Caribbean Centre on Upper Parliament Street, with raffle prizes donated by the local community. All proceeds raised through ticket, food, and raffle sales will be donated to the local community village in Senegal which Yusuf last visited in February 2017. Children are welcome between 7-9 and the event will then continue until late.

Speaking ahead of these events, Detective Chief Inspector Mark Baker said: "These events are a poignant reminder of a life taken too soon. We stand alongside Yusuf's family in our determination to bring those who took his life to justice. As time passes, we share the family's frustration and belief that information still lies within the community in which they still live, and raising awareness is key to getting through to these people exactly what justice would mean for his family and the wider community, who share our resolve in removing those who use dangerous weapons on the streets.

"We know too that people who may hold the answers could now be in a different situation, live elsewhere, and feel that now is the time to come forward. If this is you, I want to assure you that there are many ways to get the information to us.

"We know that people don't always feel comfortable speaking directly to the police but there are other ways to help. Your information will be treated with sensitivity and, if you go via Crimestoppers, anonymously. Measures can be put in place to protect those who tell us what they know.

"Extensive enquiries continue day-to-day, and we continue to seek the whereabouts of Jason Curry, an individual with whom we still to speak as a priority. We believe that Jason, who also frequents Wrexham in North Wales and Cumbria, may have important information which could help us with our investigation and I would urge him, or anyone who knows of his whereabouts, to contact us as soon as possible."

Anyone who witnessed the incident or holds any information is urged to contact @MerPolCC or 101, or leave information anonymously with Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or online via https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously.
