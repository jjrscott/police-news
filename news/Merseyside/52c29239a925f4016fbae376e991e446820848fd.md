We have arrested a man following the reported robbery of a man in Dingle this morning, Tuesday 15 December.

At around 10.40am, officers were called to Dingle Lane to a call reporting that a man was assaulted by two men, and had a pedal bike stolen. The victim was seen injured and making off, and enquiries are ongoing to locate him.

A 31-year-old man from Everton was detained nearby and has been arrested on suspicion of robbery and taken to a police station for questioning. Enquiries are ongoing at the scene, including forensics and CCTV.

Detective Inspector Amy Smith said: "We're keen to speak to anyone who witnessed this incident, and to the victim, to ensure that he is safe and well. Our enquiries in the area are continuing.

"If you saw anything, live locally and have CCTV or dashcam to help us further, please come forward with reference 20000760268, either via @MerPolCC or anonymously through Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
