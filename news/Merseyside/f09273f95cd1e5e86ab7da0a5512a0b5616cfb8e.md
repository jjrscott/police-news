A man has been arrested following a firearms discharge in Bootle last night (Saturday 21 September 2019).

Shortly after 9.10pm, officers were called to Markfield Road to reports that damage consistent with a firearms discharge had been caused to the window of a house. Officers attended and later found the exterior wall of another house had also been damaged.

House to house, forensic and CCTV enquiries are continuing and community policing officers have been in the area to speak to local residents and offer reassurance.

An investigation was launched to establish the exact circumstances and a 23-year-old man from Knowsley Village has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and possession of a Class B drug (cannabis) with intent to supply.

Detective Inspector Andy McCourt said: "We want to trace a male seen on a bicycle who we believe was the intended target of this shooting.

"He is described as white, aged between 14-17, with long dark hair and what is described as a chubby face.

"It is believed this male sustained injuries, possibly as a result of falling off his bike in Malvern Road.

"We would ask that this person comes forward and speaks to us. I would also ask parents, who may have a child matching the description who returned home with injuries on Saturday night, to contact the police."
