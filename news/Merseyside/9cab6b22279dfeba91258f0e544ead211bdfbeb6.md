Officers carrying out continued activity targeting serious and organised crime across Merseyside have arrested two women and one man on suspicion of drug supply.

Following earlier warrants in Huyton, Dovecot, Everton and Kirkdale, officers carried out a further two warrants in Dewsbury Road, Anfield.

Suspected Class A drugs (pictured) were seized and three people were arrested as follows:
A 33-year-old woman from Old Swan; a 54-year-old man from Walton; and a 52-year-old woman from Anfield were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs. All three remain in custody for questioning.

In past 24 hours, 125 stop checks, 76 vehicle checks and 20 stop searches have also been carried out across the force.

Targeted Team Inspector Jon Coote said: "It's pleasing to see more drugs removed from the streets, and we'll continue to carry out such activity on a daily basis.

"Information from those residents who most feel the impact of serious and organised crime where they live can be absolutely vital in supporting this work. We stand alongside those people in our commitment to targeting those people and locations we suspect are involved.

"If you know anything about the storage or use of drugs, firearms and other weapons, let us know and these positive results will keep coming."
