Detectives are appealing for information after shots were fired at a house in Kirkby last night (Monday 25 November).

Shortly before 7pm officers were called to Delfby Crescent to reports of shots being fired at a property, causing damage to a wall but no injuries. An investigation is underway to establish the exact circumstances.

House to house, forensic and CCTV enquiries are being carried out in the local area.

Chief Inspector Kevin Chatterton said: "Thankfully nobody was hurt during this incident but this was clearly a reckless act and I would urge anyone who saw or heard anything to come forward as soon as possible to help us bring those responsible to justice.

"I would ask anyone who was in the area of Delfby Crescent tonight who saw anything suspicious to contact us. Similarly I would ask anyone in the area who has CCTV or a dash cam to check the footage as they may have captured something important.

"Merseyside Police remains committed to taking guns and weapons off our streets so they can't be used to cause fear and intimidation and information from the local community is vital in helping us to do that."
