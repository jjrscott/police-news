Detectives are appealing for members of the public to come forward after three people were assaulted during a disturbance in Kirkby in the early hours of this morning (Sunday, 12 July 2020).

At about 3am officers were called to a disturbance involving a group of men on Westhead Avenue, Kirkby. Patrols attended and on arrival found a 27-year-old man who had suffered slash wounds to his back, neck and face and a 22-year-old woman who had a cut to her head. Another man was found nearby with a stab wound to his upper arm.

It is believed that there had been a party at one of the properties on the road and a row has broken out, which was followed by a disturbance in the street about 20 minutes later. The 19-year-old man with a cut to his arm has refused medical treatment and the two others have been taken to hospital where they are being treated for their injuries. None of the injured parties, who are all from Kirkby, are co-operating with the police at this time.

Officers are appealing for anyone who has any information, or CCTV footage, which could help them with their inquiries to DM @Merpolcc, call 101 quoting reference number 0182 on 12 July, alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
