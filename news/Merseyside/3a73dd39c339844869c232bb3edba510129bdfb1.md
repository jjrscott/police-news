We can confirm that a man who absconded from Aintree University Hospital yesterday has been arrested last night, Thursday 26 March.

Following extensive enquiries, 30-year-old Patrick Garrett was located in the Manchester area around an hour ago, and was arrested on suspicion of absconding from custody. Garrett has been taken to a police station for questioning.

Detective Chief Inspector Cheryl Rhodes said: "It's really pleasing to have located Garrett the very next day after he escaped, and following a great deal of hard work from officers and staff across the force.

"We know that this is such an uncertain time for our communities, but one thing that won't be changing is our absolute commitment to tracking down those who try to evade justice.

"If you have any information about wanted people, always call 999 in an emergency, pass info via our social media desk @MerPolCC or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, and we'll keep producing these results."
