We are appealing for information following a fail to stop road traffic collision in Kirkby in the early hours of this morning, Wednesday, 30 October.

At around 00:15am, a call was received of a collision between a car and a cyclist on Roughwood Drive near the junction with Old Rough Lane. The cyclist, a man in his 50's, was taken to hospital with serious but non-life threatening leg injuries.

The driver of the car made off and extensive enquiries are ongoing to locate the vehicle and the driver.

Roads Policing Sergeant, Philip Mitchell said: "I would urge anyone with information on this incident to please get in touch. A man has been left with serious injuries and we are keen to speak to anyone who can help us establish the full circumstances and trace the driver and the vehicle.

"Although unconfirmed, we believe the car may have been a black BMW, and I would ask anyone who may have seen a car fitting the description in the area to contact us.

"Likewise, if you were passing in another vehicle at this time or live nearby, please check your dashcam or CCTV footage. I would also appeal directly to the driver themselves to please get in touch."

Anyone with information can contact our Roads Policing Unit on (0151) 777 5747, contact @MerPolCC with reference 19100630597 of yesterday, or @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111.
