****UPDATE 4.10pm - EOD have attended and the device has now been confirmed as not live. The incident is now being stood down and the road reopened. We thank residents and road users for their patience while it was resolved.****

We can confirm that a road closure is in place in Newton-le-Willows due to an ongoing incident this afternoon, Sunday 17 November.

At 1.40pm, officers were called to the canal at Newton Brook, near to Church Street and Southwood Road, after an unknown device was located. Enquiries are ongoing to establish the nature of the device.

A road closure is now in place on Church Street and we are asking local residents to stay indoors at this time and road users to avoid the area.

Thanks for your patience as we deal with this incident. More updates as we have them.
