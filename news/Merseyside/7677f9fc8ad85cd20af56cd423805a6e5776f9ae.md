Officers have authorised a Section 60 stop search order in the Croxteth area following last night's shooting and subsequent injuries sustained by a 12-year-old girl.

The order is in place between 2pm today (Friday 1 November) and 4am tomorrow (Saturday 2 November).

Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 allows a police officer to stop and search a person without suspicion.

The map is attached and the boundaries are East Lancashire Road, Lower House Lane, Oak Lane, Oak Lane North, Rear of Riveria Drive and Cubert Road, Parkview Road, Willow Way to East Lancashire Road and back to Lower House Lane.

Liverpool Community Inspector Graeme Rooney said: "The community will see extra patrols in the area today and tonight, to speak to the community and provide visibility. I would urge anyone with information on the incident to come forward and speak to us, either directly or via @MerPolCC, 101 or anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

"We will act on all information to remove those who cause harm from your streets."
