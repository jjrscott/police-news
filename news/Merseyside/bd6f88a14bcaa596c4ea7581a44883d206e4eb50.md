We arrested a man and seized cannabis and cash after officers attended a house in Thatto Heath to take a statement yesterday (Thursday 22 October).

When officers arrived at the address just before 7pm, six males were seen to make off on foot at the back.

The officers saw cannabis in the front room and heard the sound of floorboards being moved upstairs, and forced entry to the property.

A search of the house followed and bags of cannabis were found under the floor boards in an upstairs bedroom, along with scales.

A large quantity of cash was also found in a bag in the front room.

A 20-year-old man from Thatto Heath was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply a Class B drug (cannabis) and possession of criminal property. He was taken into custody to be interviewed.

Inspector Rob Budden said: "Our officers show every day that they will leave no stone unturned in their pursuit of offenders whose peddling of drugs on the streets causes so much harm in our communities.

"The officers who attended this property showed great alertness and as a result, illegal drugs have been taken out of circulation, a suspect is in custody and enquiries are ongoing to see what other information we can gather about drug dealing in Merseyside.

"While our officers are well trained in spotting the signs of criminality, you too can be our eyes and ears on the ground and if you suspect a neighbour or someone you know is involved in dealing drugs, please get in touch on Twitter by direct messaging @MerPolCC or by calling Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
