We are today, Monday 9th March, continuing to appeal for information following the assault and subsequent death of Terence Dunn in Norris Green.

On Tuesday, 24 September 2019 emergency services were called following the sudden death of 49-year-old Mr Dunn.

He had recently received medical attention involving surgery following an assault in Wapshare Road, Norris Green at around 3.40pm on Tuesday, 18 June. He was taken to hospital where he received medical treatment for leg and arm injuries caused by a golf club.

An investigation into Mr Dunn's death remains ongoing.

Detective Inspector Tracey Martin has today (Monday) appeared on BBC One's Crimewatch Roadshow where she made a public appeal for information.

DI Martin said: "Terry was well-known and liked in the community but it does seem that he was specifically targeted and we suspect the offender may have had a grudge against him and was trying to send a strong message.

"We have previously released footage of a man seen in the area who we still want to trace.

"We have also today released another image of another man (below), believed to be in his 70s, who we believe may live locally. We really need to identify and speak to this person.

"I would like to thank those individuals that have come forward so far, but I would encourage anyone who has not yet spoken to police, to please contact us. We are determined to find the person responsible and put them before the courts and any information could prove vital to helping us achieve this."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police CC.
