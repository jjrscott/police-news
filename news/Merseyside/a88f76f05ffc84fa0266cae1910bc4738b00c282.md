On Wednesday 29th July, officers arrested an outstanding wanted man in Portugal for sexual offences.

The 40 year old male who is a Portuguese national, who has been wanted since 2014 was located in the Algarve, Portugal.

He was arrested following an ongoing operation between Merseyside Police and the Portuguese authorities. Whilst under investigation for a sexual offence in 2014, the male fled abroad and has been on the run ever since.

Inspector Logan-Sherratt, currently in charge of Operation Hunted states "The arrest of this man shows that Merseyside Police will continue to look for fugitives regardless of where they flee to.

"We will work tirelessly to ensure wanted offenders are located and brought before the courts. Hopefully the arrest of this man will start to bring some closure to the victim of this terrible crime."

The man is currently awaiting an extradition hearing and will be brought back to the UK.
