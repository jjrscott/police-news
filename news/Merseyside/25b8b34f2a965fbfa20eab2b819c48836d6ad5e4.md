Merseyside Police is supporting this year's National Neighbourhood Watch Week, which runs until Saturday 13th June.

Neighbourhood Watch is a useful way in which communities can work together with the police to prevent, detect and reduce crime and antisocial behaviour.

In Merseyside we have over 2000 Neighbourhood Watch and HomeWatch schemes which maintain contact with members in person and currently by phone and via social media groups to make sure everyone is keeping safe.

During the Covid-19 pandemic members have also been involved in organising shopping, food and hot meal deliveries for vulnerable members of the community.

Coordinators and members make themselves available for support and assist their neighbours and work with the police to provide intelligence to the police and Crimestoppers to help reduce crime and antisocial behaviour in their area.

The message for this year's awareness week is to celebrate and thank neighbours and Neighbourhood Watch members for all their dedication, support and help over the past year in their communities and particularly during the Covid-19 crisis.

Sergeant Keith Burke, Citizens in Policing Coordinator for Merseyside Police said: "There is a misconception that Neighbourhood Watch is just about preventing crime. It so much more than that.

"Volunteers work to prevent fraud, raise awareness and due to COVID-19, we've seen a surge in neighbourliness as people look out for the vulnerable and talk to those next door more than ever before. We really value the work of Neighbourhood Watch.

"We can all play a part in protecting ourselves, our families, friends and neighbours from becoming a victim and reduce the fear of crime. By looking out for each other, we can help to protect people from harm.

"Being part of a Neighbourhood Watch Scheme builds a stronger community spirit and by knowing your neighbours, anyone suspicious becomes much more obvious.

"By working together, we can continue to keep Merseyside a safe place to live and work."
