We are appealing for information following a robbery at a shop in Southport on Monday 14 December.

At around 10pm, we received a reports of a robbery at First Stop Convenience Store on Hampton Road.

A male offender, armed with a lock knife, took around Â£350 from the till and then made off on foot from the shop.

The offender is described as a white male in his early 20's, around 5ft 10in tall. He was wearing a two tone grey tracksuit with his hood up, a black beanie, black trainers and black leather gloves. He also had a khaki green scarf across his face.

No members of staff or customers were injured during the incident.

An investigation is underway and CCTV and forensic enquiries are being carried out.

Detective Inspector Catherine Walsh said, "To be threatened at your place of work is despicable and we will be working to ensure that we do all we can to find those responsible and put them before the courts.

"Did you see a man running away from the shop on Hampton Road or did you capture something significant on your dash-cam? I would ask you come forward with any information so that we can take action."

Anyone who was in the Hampton Road area on Monday night with any information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 quoting ref 20000759413 or Crimestoppers, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
