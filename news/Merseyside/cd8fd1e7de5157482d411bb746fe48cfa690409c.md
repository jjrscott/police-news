Officers are currently in Aigburth following reports of an illegal rave this evening, Friday, 12 June.

At around 8pm, patrols attended Otterspool Drive after groups of people and music were reported in the area. DJ equipment has been seized and two people have been detained.

The majority of people have now dispersed and roads in the area have been closed, while officers remain in the area to turn away anyone planning to attend.

Superintendent Jonathan Davies said: "I again want to emphasise the significant risks that such gatherings pose to those involved and the wider community. This is not just due to the risk of catching or spreading coronavirus, but the safety concerns that could present from attending such an event in a dark and potentially unsafe location.

"Patrols will remain in the area and I strongly advise against travelling to Otterspool Drive if you were planning on it, as you will be turned away on arrival."

If you have information on this event, please contact @MerPolCC quoting ref. 750 of 12/6/20 or CrimestoppersUK, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
