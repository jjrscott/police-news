Officers have issued approximately 20 fixed penalty notices and turned over 100 cars away from Formby beach today, Saturday, 28 February.

Throughout the day, patrols have been in attendance along the coastal area following reports of large numbers of people present. Around 20 people were issued with Â£200 fines for breaching Covid restrictions, and over 100 cars were turned away from the area.

Some people were found to have travelled from as far as Leeds, Stockport, and Manchester.

Community Policing Superintendent Graeme Robson said: "This weekend, due to the good weather, we have seen a large increase in people travelling to the Formby beach area, some of whom had travelled a significant distance to get there.

"This is totally unacceptable and shows a complete disregard for the government guidance, which is in place to protect not only ourselves but others around us. To flagrantly flout the rules in this way is not only reckless and irresponsible, but can result in a substantial fine, as we have seen today.

"Individuals from as far as Leeds, Manchester and Stockport were found to have made the trip to Formby today, which is quite frankly astounding. Now more than ever people should be taking heed of the advice, so that infection rates can continue to drop, and we can meet the criteria necessary for easing lockdown in the upcoming weeks and months.

"We will continue to work closely with our partners in Sefton, and across the rest of Merseyside, to ensure the safety of our communities, and will take enforcement action where people refuse to follow restrictions. Current guidance states that people must only travel for essential reasons, and you must remain local.

"We will continue to have increased patrols in the area over the upcoming weeks and I would strongly advise people to check ahead before travelling to popular destinations to ensure they can socially distance while there, and to avoid it completely if it's not within your local area."
