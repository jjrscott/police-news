We are appealing for witnesses following a fatal collision on the M62 this morning, Thursday, 28 January.

At around 5.45am, it was reported that four vehicles were involved in a collision on the eastbound carriageway between junction five and six in Huyton.

Emergency services attended and an occupant of one of the vehicles, a woman in her 50's, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

Her next of kin have been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers at this time.

The driver of another vehicle has also been taken to hospital for assessment of injuries.

Road closures remain in place and motorists are advised to avoid the area.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has any CCTV or dashcam footage, is asked to contact the Roads Policing Unit on 0151 777 5747, @MerPolCC or 101 quoting ref. 21000058743.
