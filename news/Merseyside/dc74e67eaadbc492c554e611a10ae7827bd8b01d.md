We have arrested a man and seized cash and suspected drugs following an incident at a fishing lake in St Helens earlier this week.

At around 2.40pm on Tuesday 17 November, officers were called to the report of a suspected drugs transaction between a male who was fishing and the occupant of a vehicle at Alexander Park Fishing Lake on Alexandra Drive. Officers attended and detained a man, who grabbed a holdall and attempted to run off.

The man, his holdall and his tent were all searched and suspected cannabis, cocaine, cash and drugs paraaphendlia were seized (pictured).

A 27-year-old man from Huyton was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply drugs and possession of controlled drugs. He has been released under investigation as enquiries continue and all the items have been seized.

St Helens Targeted Policing Inspector Rob Budden said: "Thanks to a vigilant member of the public and a swift response from officers, this suspected drug supply location has been disrupted. Investigations continue but in the meantime we think this will serve as a strong deterrent to those looking to supply or purchase drugs from the location.

"We patrol in and around the Alexander Park area and across all the whole of St Helens, but should any members of the public see any similar behaviour or have concerns, get in touch and we will do the rest."
