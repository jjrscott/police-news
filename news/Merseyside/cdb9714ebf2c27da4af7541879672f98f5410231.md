We are appealing for information following reports shots were fired at a house in Kirkby last night, Monday 22 March.

Shortly before 10pm, officers were called to Whitefield Drive after it was reported shots had been fired at a house on the street. Patrols attended and damage consistent with a shooting was found to the front door of the house.

No one is reported to have been injured during the incident.

An investigation is underway and CCTV, forensic and witness enquiries are ongoing.

High visibility patrols have been stepped up in the area.

Detective Inspector John Fitzgerald said: "We are in the early stages of an investigation after shots were fired at a house in Kirkby last night, and are working to establish the exact circumstances.

"The use of weapons on our streets will not be tolerated and we know this will be an alarming incident for local residents. An extensive investigation is underway and we are determined to find the person responsible and remove firearms from our streets.

"I want to reassure the public that we are committed to tackling gun crime and we will continue to take action to protect our communities from individuals who use firearms with no thought for members of the public.

"If you saw or heard anything suspicious in Whitefield Drive or the surrounding area, or may have captured home CCTV or dashcam footage, please come forward as any information could be vital to the investigation."

Anyone who has any information is asked to contact @MerPolCC on Twitter, 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook or call 101 with reference 21000184019.
