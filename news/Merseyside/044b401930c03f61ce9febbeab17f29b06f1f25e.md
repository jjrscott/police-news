We have issued CCTV stills of a man we believe could have information that will assist an investigation into an assault in Liverpool city centre.

It was a reported a man was punched once to the face in an unprovoked attack in The Liffey bar on Renshaw Street at about 12.30am on 27 September this year.

The victim, a 28-year-old man, sustained bruising and damage to his teeth in the incident.

Detective Inspector Sean Kelly-Martland said: "This was a completely unprovoked assault in which a man visiting the city was struck to the face for no reason whatsoever.

"Our enquiries into who is responsible are ongoing, and we ask anyone who recognises the man pictured to contact us as we believe he could have information about the assault that could prove vital.

"People should be able to go out and enjoy the city's nightlife without fear of falling victim to an attack such as this, and we need your help to bring the offender to justice."
