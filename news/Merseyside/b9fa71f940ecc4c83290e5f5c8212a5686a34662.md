Can you help the Coroners Office find the next of kin for a Newton-le-Willows man who recently died?

56-year-old Anthony Brindley sadly passed away at his home in Rendel Close on Tuesday 5 May. His death is not being treated as suspicious. Mr Brindley may have a brother called Dave.

Anyone with contact details for next of kin are asked to contact the Coroners investigating Officer, Clair Sajewicz on 0151 777 3754 or via email at Clair.S.Sajewicz@merseyside.police.uk.
