We have issued CCTV stills of a man who may be able to assist an investigation into an assault on a member of door staff in Liverpool city centre last month.

It was reported the 48-year-old old man was punched and pulled to the floor before being kicked close to McCooley's bar on Fleet Street at about 1.55am on Saturday 21 September 2019.

Detective Inspector Jennie Beck said: "This was a vicious assault on the doorman who was simply trying to do his job. Nobody should be subjected to this level of violence when they are just trying to earn a living.

"We believe the offender was ejected from McCooley's club shortly before the incident, and appeal to anyone who may have witnessed any part of the incident or know who was responsible to contact police.

"If you recognise the man pictured, please get in touch as we believe he may have information that could prove to be a vital part of our enquires."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police CC. You can also call 101 quoting incident reference 19100541216 or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
