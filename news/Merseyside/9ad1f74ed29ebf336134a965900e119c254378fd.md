Officers have extended the Section 60 order in the Dingle area today, Thursday 21 January, following recent shootings in the area.

We will continue high visibility patrols in the area and encourage anyone with information to speak to us.

The Section 60 came into place at 16:01 yesterday (Wednesday 20th January) and will remain in place until 4am tomorrow (Friday 22 January).

The Order, under S60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, gives officers enhanced stop and search powers to stop males aged 14-50 in the area (pictured) and is designed to minimise serious violence in the area.

It covers the area of Dingle, bounded by and including; Parliament Street, St James Place, Park Road, Aigburth Road, St Michaels Road continued adjacent to the waterfront and bounded by the River Mersey.

Anyone who has any information which could help detectives with their enquiries is asked to contact our social media desk on Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre'.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
