Detectives are appealing for information after an injury shooting in Aintree this evening, Monday 22 February.

At around 8pm, a call was received of shots being heard in Greenwich Road.

A man in his 20s was found nearby with a hand injury and has been taken to hospital for assessment of his injuries. Evidence has been found of a gun having been fired.

Officers remain in the area to carry out house-to-house, CCTV and forensic enquiries and have closed Seeds Lane while this work continues.

Detective Inspector Jennie Beck said: "At this early stage, we are looking to hear from anyone in the vicinity of Greenwich Road who saw or heard this incident, or anyone making off on foot or at speed in any vehicle. We'll be in the area tonight to carry out extensive enquiries, so come forward if you know anything.

"A man has been injured tonight and this could have been even more serious, both for the victim and any passers-by, so tell us what you know and we'll take action. A witness to this incident has had his coat damaged by a gunshot, which is an absolutely frightening experience, and we will be supporting them fully as we investigate.

"Shootings on Merseyside have decreased significantly in recent months, thanks in no small part to information from those areas affected, whether given to us directly or anonymously. We are determined to find those responsible and remove them and their weapons from the streets."

Anyone with information is asked to contact our social media desk on Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' with reference 21000116629.

You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
