We are appealing for information after a safe was stolen in a burglary in Crosby on Friday evening (12 February).

We were called at 6.35pm to a report two males had entered a property on Hall Road East at around 6.30pm.

The offenders were described as wearing black waterproof clothing, possibly with white writing on, and black balaclavas.

The occupants of the house were unharmed.

Officers attended and an investigation, including house to house enquiries, is ongoing. The property will be forensically examined and CCTV opportunities are being explored.

Anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area, or has any information is asked to contact the social media desk @MerPolCC, call 101 quoting incident 21000094343 or you can call or the independent charity @CrimestoppersUK anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
