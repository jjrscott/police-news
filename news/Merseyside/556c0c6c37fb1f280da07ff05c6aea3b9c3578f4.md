Do you recognise this jewellery? It was seized in Crosby following the arrest of a man in August on suspicion of vehicle interference and handling stolen goods.

The man remains under investigation. We need to establish if the jewellery was stolen in any recent criminal offences.

Picture 1 is an image of distinctive Pandora charm bracelet.

Picture 2 is an image of two Vivienne Westwood skull and crossbones cufflinks.

Anyone who can prove ownership of these items is asked to contact @MerPolCC with reference 19100467089 or you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 with any information.
