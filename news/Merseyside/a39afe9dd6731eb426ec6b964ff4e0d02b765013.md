Detectives are appealing for information following a robbery in Liverpool on Sunday 22 September.

Just after 1.30pm, officers were made aware of an incident in the car park of the Chung Wah Supermarket in Hardy Street, to a report that a woman had been assaulted and robbed.

Two males on a motorcycle pulled a handbag from the woman who was walking in the car park. They made off towards St James Street and St George Street. The woman was left extremely distressed.

Detective Inspector Phil Atkinson said: "We're keen to hear from anyone who witnessed this incident.

"It is despicable to think that two offenders targeted a lone woman in this way, in daylight, and I know the wider community will share our disgust.

"I want to reassure the local community that we will take action on all the information you provide.

Anyone with information can contact us @MerPolCC, call 101 with reference 0511 or @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111.
