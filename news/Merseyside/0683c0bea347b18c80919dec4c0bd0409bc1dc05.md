Detectives investigating a serious assault in St Helens on Saturday, 13 June are continuing to appeal for information.

The incident happened at around 10.15pm, when emergency services were called to French Street at its junction with Thomas Street, Thatto Heath to reports a 33-year-old man had been assaulted. He was taken to hospital where he continues to be treated for a serious head injury. His condition is described as critical.

Detective Inspector Jackie Guinness said: "We are particularly keen to speak with anyone who was in the area at around 10.15pm who saw a grey Kia Sportage travelling in the area of Lugsmore Lane.

"We believe that following the attack, the offender(s) got into this car and then drove at speed along West Street, before over-shooting the junction at Lugsmore Lane, causing other drivers travelling along Lugsmore Lane from Prescot Road, to manoeuvre around it.

"Maybe you were driving this night and remember this car? We'd be especially keen to speak with anyone who has any dashcam footage and would ask you to get in contact.

"This victim in this case is in a critical condition and we are working hard to piece together the full circumstances, any information no matter how small could assist with our investigation and help us bring the person(s) responsible to justice."
