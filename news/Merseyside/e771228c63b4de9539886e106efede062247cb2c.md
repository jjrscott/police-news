We can confirm the pedestrian who sadly died following a collision in Lisburn Lane, Tuebrook last night (Tuesday, 1 December) has been named as 51-year-old Paul Scott from Huyton.

His family have issued the following tribute:

"We are the broken-hearted family of Paul Scott from Huyton, and previously Whiston and Breck Road.

"He has left a big hole in the lives of his sons Michael and Sean, ex-partner Sue, granddaughters Sophia and Dolcie, his mother Cathy, brothers Les and John and sister Lynn.

"Paul loved to cycle and go for long walks and shared these pleasures with his family. We would appreciate it if the family could be left to grieve at this time."
