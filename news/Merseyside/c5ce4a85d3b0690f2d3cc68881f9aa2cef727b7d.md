We're appealing for witnesses following an assault in Halewood on Monday afternoon (5 October).

At around 3.45pm, emergency services were called to Hawthorne Avenue to reports of a man in his 20s being found injured. He was taken to hospital for assessment of lacerations to his hand, arm and back.

Officers condcuted house-to-house, CCTV and forensic enquiries and are providing a high-visibility presence in the community.

Chief Inspector George Phillips said: "At this stage we're looking to establish exactly what happened and who was responsible. If you were around Hawthorne Avenue this afternoon and witnessed this incident, or saw or heard anyone making off on foot or in a vehicle, we want to hear from you.

"The use of knives and other weapons on our streets is completely unacceptable and we can and do act on all information we receive on their storage and use, to seize weapons and remove those who choose to carry them from the streets.

"If you don't want to speak to us directly, for whatever reason, please speak anonymously to Crimestoppers instead. They are completely independent of police. But however you get that information to us, make sure you do, as every last detail could be vital in tracking down those involved."

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has any information is asked to contact our social media desk @MerPolCC on Twitter or 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook quoting ref. 20000602864 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. You can also contact them via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
