We have charged a 45-year-old man with assault and racially aggravated public order following an incident at Al-Rahma Mosque, Mulgrave Street, last month.

Officers were called to the mosque at around 12.50pm, on Friday 11 December, following reports that a 41-year-old man had been assaulted with a bike lock. The victim had challenged an offender who was shouting racial abuse and making gun actions at worshippers as they were leaving the mosque.

Following police investigations into the incident, on Wednesday 20 January, Paul Anderson, of Duke Street, Liverpool City Centre, was arrested, taken into custody and later charged with Section 47 assault and S4a racially aggravated public order.

He has been remanded in custody to appear in court today (Thursday 21 January).
