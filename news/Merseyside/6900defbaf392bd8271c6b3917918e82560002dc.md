We have arrested a teenager and seized drugs following an incident last night, Monday 30 November.

At around 10pm, Matrix officers stopped a male on a pedal cycle in Netherfield Road North, Everton. A search led to suspected cannabis, paraphernalia and cash being found and the male was detained.

A 16-year-old boy from Walton was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class B drugs and remains in custody for questioning.

Superintendent Andy Rankine from Matrix said: "This arrest shows the value of stop search and this male will now be questioned. Our patrols across Merseyside are always alert to anything suspicious which warrants further interest or action.

"If you have any suspicions about drug dealing in your community, let us know and we'll keep taking this positive action and removing drugs and weapons from the streets."

Always call 999 if a crime is in progress. You can also report suspected drug dealing via @MerPolCC on Twitter, 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook, 101, or the independent charity @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111. You can also contact them via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
