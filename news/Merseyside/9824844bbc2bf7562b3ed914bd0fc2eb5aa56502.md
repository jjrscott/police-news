Officers issued over 20 fixed penalty notices after a house party in West Derby last night, Wednesday 17 March.

At around 5.50pm, police were called to reports of a large gathering at a house on Deyesbrook Lane where over 30 people were in attendance - in breach of Coronavirus regulations.

In total 21 people were given Covid fines. No arrests were made.

Chief Inspector Chris Barnes said: "This was another brazen and appalling example of people flouting the rules during the pandemic. Anyone at the party last night could have spread Covid-19 to others and put their community at risk.

"Coronavirus regulations are still in place - they apply to everyone, and they're there to protect our health.

"We are still in a national lockdown and people are only permitted to mix outdoors with one other person outside their household or support bubble.

"I'd like to thank everyone who continues to abide by the rules - and remind those who don't that we won't hesitate to issue a substantial fine when they put us all at risk."
