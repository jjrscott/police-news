We can confirm that emergency services are on the scene of a serious road traffic collision on the M57 today, Friday 1 November.

At around 6.15pm, reports were received of a collision between a pedestrian and a vehicle near to the northbound junction for Switch Island.

Officers are on the scene as we look to establish the full circumstances.

A road closure will be in place both northbound and southbound between Junction 6 for Kirkby and Junction 7 for Switch Island for a considerable time and road users are asked to avoid the area while the investigation is carried out.

Further updates will be issued when appropriate.

Anyone with information or who witnessed the incident is asked to contact @MerPolCC or 101 with reference 843.
