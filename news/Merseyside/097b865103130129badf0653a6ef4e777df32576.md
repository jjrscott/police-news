As part of #OpTarget officers from our Liverpool Local Policing Team have been working in the Kensington area of Liverpool (on 12th March) responding to community intelligence and targeting drug dealing as well as violent crime.

Officers conducted a number of search warrants at addresses on Needham Road and Judges Drive, both in Liverpool.

Whilst at these addresses the officers recovered what they believe to be a significant quantity of heroin (1 - 2kg), cash and a suspected torch disguised as a stun gun.

Five men were arrested for a variety of offences including possession with intent to supply drugs, possession of a prohibited weapon and possession of criminal property.

In addition to this, officers also implemented several roadside operations targeting illegal use of the road and reporting a number of motorists for road traffic related offences.

Community engagement was also a huge part of this operation and officers were on the ground encouraging the local community to provide further information to help them tackle crime and ASB in the area. If you want to report a crime or know who is committing criminal offences in your neighbourhood, get in touch via 101, DM @MerPolCC or contact @CrimestoppersUK anonymously.
