Please share and help us find missing teenager Lucy Murray from Southport.

16-year-old Lucy was last seen on Thursday 17 December in the Southport area.

Lucy is white, 5ft 10in tall, medium build with shoulder length, brown straight hair. She was wearing a black 'Canada Goose' jacket with fur trim, black leggings, and carrying small bag.

Lucy is known to frequent the Southport, Litherland and Liverpool City Centre areas.

We are becoming increasingly concerned for Lucy's whereabouts. Please call 101 with any sightings or information, or contact us via @MerPolCC on Twitter, 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook, or via the charity Missing People on 116 000.
