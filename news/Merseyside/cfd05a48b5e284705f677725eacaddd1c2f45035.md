Officers are currently in Garston following the discovery of a cannabis farm yesterday (Wednesday, 29 January).

Patrols attended the address in Clarendon Road after the farm was discovered at around 11.30am, and found 369 cannabis plants spread across four rooms, along with growing equipment.

The estimated annual yield of the cannabis farm would have been around Â£1.6m.

An investigation is underway and forensic and witness enquiries are ongoing in the area.

Cannabis dismantling team manager Matt Brown said: "An investigation is underway following the discovery of this farm and thankfully, this cannabis has now been seized and prevented from reaching our communities.

"Criminal groups involved in the growing of cannabis do not care about those communities. They think nothing of setting up potentially dangerous farms on residential streets, and are often involved in violence and other serious organised crime to try to protect their illicit trade.

"They will use any property they can to grow cannabis farms of various sizes - if you believe someone is using a property for the purpose of growing cannabis, I would encourage you to report it so we can take action. There is no place in our communities for criminal gangs that think setting up cannabis farms close to places we live, work and visit is acceptable."
