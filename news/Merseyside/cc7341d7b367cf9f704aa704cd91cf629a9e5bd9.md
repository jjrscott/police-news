We have arrested a man on suspicion of assaulting a police officer and driving offences following an incident in Huyton yesterday, Sunday 21 February.

At around 9.30pm, officers sighted a Ford Fiesta in Liverpool Road which showed no insurance. The vehicle failed to stop and was located a short time later in Calgarth Road. The suspected driver was detained on suspicion of drink driving and in doing so, reportedly assaulted an officer, who was taken to hospital with facial injuries.

A 28-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of Section 18 wounding; drink driving; driving without insurance and failing to stop. He remains in custody.

Knowsley Community Policing Area Commander, Superintendent Jennifer Wilson said: "Violence against officers protecting our communities is absolutely despicable and we're supporting our colleague after this attack.

"If you suspect that anyone you know is drink driving or driving otherwise illegally, tell us and we'll do all we can to keep these dangers from the road."
