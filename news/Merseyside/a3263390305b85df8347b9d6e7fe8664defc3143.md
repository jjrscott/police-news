Detectives are appealing for information following an attempted robbery in Parr, St Helens yesterday afternoon, Monday 14 September.

Around 2pm, officers were called to Schooner Wine on Concourse Way to reports of a man in possession of a machete demanding money. The man made off empty-handed. No injuries were sustained and the investigation is ongoing.

Detective Inspector Jackie Guinness said: "Although thankfully nothing was taken and no injuries were sustained, this will have been a distressing experience for the shopkeeper, who was nonetheless brave and quick to call police.

"To threaten those making a living in our communities is despicable, and we will take positive action to remove the person responsible from the streets, and see that they face justice.

"If you were on Concourse Way around 2pm and either saw anything, or live locally or were passing and have CCTV or dashcam, please come forward."
