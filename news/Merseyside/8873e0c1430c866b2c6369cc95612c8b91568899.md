We're appealing for information following a serious road traffic collision in Crosby in the early hours of this morning, Friday 5 February.

At around 3.40am, emergency services were called to Alexandra Court on College Road to reports of collision involving a Citroen and flats at the location. A man in his 20s has been taken to hospital with serious injuries. The flats have been assessed as safe following checks.

Initial enquiries indicate that the car is suspected to have been stolen from Holden Road at around 3.20am. It is believed that the car was stolen in a robbery where the owner was threatened, although not injured.

Officers remain at both locations and road closures are in place the following locations:
College Rd/Brook Rd; College Rd/College Rd North; College Road/Eshe Rd; Coronation Rd and Mersey Rd. Please avoid the area where possible as our investigations continue.

Detective Chief Inspector Gayle Rooney said: "We're keen to identify anyone else who was in this vehicle to ensure that nobody else has been left injured. Enquiries with hospitals are ongoing but if you can help, this a high priority.

"We're also investigating the allegation of robbery of this car earlier. If you live near to either location and saw, heard or captured anything which may assist, please contact us immediately."
