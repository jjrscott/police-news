We are appealing for information after vandals damaged an ambulance in Birkenhead on Friday (12 February).

We were called at around 3.20pm to a report youths had thrown a brick through the sunroof of the ambulance when it was parked near the YMCA on Whetstone Lane while attending an incident.

No crew or patients were onboard at the time.

The offenders are described as white males, aged around 12-15, with short hair. Both were wearing school uniform.

Chief Inspector Kim Carter said: "It is absolutely despicable to think that an ambulance could be targeted in this way. Thankfully no-body was in the ambulance or hurt during this incident, but it could have been so much worse.

"And the males who did this have risked taking a vital life-saving service off the roads at a time when, as we all know, our health services are under immense pressure due to the ongoing pandemic.

"I want to take this opportunity to remind parents to make sure they know where their children are, who they are with and what they are getting up to. We are in a national lockdown and the rules apply to everyone - you should only make essential journeys, and meet with one other person from outside your household or bubble for exercise locally.

"If you have any information on this incident that can help us identify those responsible, please contact us and we will do the rest."

If you have any information, please contact our social media desk on Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' with reference 21000093771, or call 101. You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
