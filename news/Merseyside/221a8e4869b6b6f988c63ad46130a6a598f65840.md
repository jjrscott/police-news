A man who raped and sexually abused five children in the 1950s, 60s and 70s has been jailed for 17 years at Liverpool Crown Court today (Friday 12 March).

Kevan O'Connor aged 75, of Rawlinson Road, Old Swan was convicted of 14 offences after trial.

O'Connor groomed and sexually abused his victims, in some cases over several years.

Detective Constable Claire McDonald said: "The bravery of the victims in coming forward and supporting a prosecution has meant that this man, who had ruined their lives, will now face justice and spend many years in prison.

"His vile actions has affected every area of their lives, and the emotional impact has been long lasting. They have been haunted by his assaults for decades and it cannot be underestimated how courageous they have been by facing him in court.

"I would urge anyone who has suffered sexual abuse in childhood, no matter how long ago, to seek support and consider reporting to Merseyside Police's Unity Team. You will be supported by specially trained and experience officers, and we will do everything in our power to make sure your attacker faces justice for their crimes.
