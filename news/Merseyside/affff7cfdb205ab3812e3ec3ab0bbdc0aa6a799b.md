Detectives investigating a racially aggravated assault in Everton have issued CCTV images of three males they believe could assist enquiries.

At around 9.30pm on Thursday, 13 August 2020, officers were called to Asda on Breck Road following reports two men and a woman had been assaulted. It was reported that a group of males made racially abusive comments towards the victims after hearing them speaking in a foreign language, before they were then assaulted by a larger group who joined the males outside the shop.

A number of the offenders were armed with weapons including bricks and the victims, all in their thirties, were taken to hospital for treatment to serious but non-life threatening injuries.

An investigation is ongoing and officers are keen to speak to anyone with information.

Detective Inspector Graeme Osborne said: "This was a violent and sustained attack on three innocent people, who were left with serious injuries including broken bones, and have been deeply affected by the incident.

"To subject another person to racial abuse and violence in this way is disgusting and intolerable, and we are carrying out a number of enquiries to locate those involved. We are particularly keen to speak to the three males pictured as we believe they may have vital information to assist the investigation, and would ask them, or anyone who recognises them, to please come forward.

"We also know a number of people were at Asda and in the surrounding area at the time so if you witnessed the incident, a group of youths in the area, or have any CCTV or dashcam footage, please let us know.

"Merseyside Police takes all reports of hate crime and violence extremely seriously and I want to ensure our communities that offenders will be dealt with robustly. Anyone who feels they have been a victim of a hate crime is encouraged to come forward and report it. You will be treated sensitively and reports will be investigated thoroughly."

Anyone who recognises the males pictured, or has any information, CCTV or dashcam footage in relation to this incident, is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 quoting ref. 20000485318 or Crimestoppers, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
