We're issuing images of three men who detectives think may have information following the assault of staff at an Aintree club in September.

At 2.10am on Sunday 20 September, officers were called to the Oldy Club on Ormskirk Road to reports of staff members being assaulted by unknown males at the main entrance. Glasses and bottles were thrown and two male members of staff sustained facial injuries.

CCTV, witness and other enquiries have been ongoing.

Detective Inspector Paul Gillies said: "If you recognise any of those pictured, please come forward. We believe that they may hold information to assist our investigation. Likewise, if you witnessed the incident at the time and have yet to make yourself known, do so.

"This was a disgraceful attack on people trying to go about their business in our community. Thankfully, and through good fortune alone, the victims didn't sustain more serious injuries. We're doing all we can to find those involved and put them before the courts."
