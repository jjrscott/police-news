We have charged two men with robbery and possession of an imitation firearm after a report a car and dogs were stolen from an address in Old Swan on Sunday afternoon (18 October).

Officers were called to Derwent Road West just after 2.25pm where it was reported a group of males had forced entry through a back door, with one carrying what appeared to be a firearm and another a knife.

The males demanded cash and jewellery while making threats, before leaving with a number of American Bulldogs and a car that was parked outside.

The car and several of the dogs were later recovered.

Lewis Prendergast, 23, of Island Road, Garston and Stephen Prendergast, 42, of Deane Road, Kensington were arrested and in the early hours of today (Tuesday 20 October) they were charged with robbery and having an imitation firearm with intent to commit an offence.

They were remanded in custody to appear at Liverpool Magistrates Court this morning.
