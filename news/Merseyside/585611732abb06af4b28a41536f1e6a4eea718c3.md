We can confirm that a Three-Year Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) has been issued to an Anfield woman convicted of various offences in Liverpool City Centre.

33-year-old Ann Marie Maughan from St Domingo Road was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison on Monday (28 October) after being found guilty of theft, possession of heroin and begging.

The CBO was issued on the same day (running to 27 October 2022) and prohibits Maughan from:

Entering the Georgian Quarter of Liverpool City Centre (see map)

Doing the following anywhere in Merseyside:
Acting anti-socially causing harassment, alarm and distress
Asking people for money
Remaining in shop premises if asked to leave by a member of staff

Community Policing Constable Adam Buckley said: "Criminal Behaviour Orders continue to be an extremely effective tool in tackling persistent offenders who have a negative impact on our communities, be it through anti-social behaviour, theft or other issues.

"The successful application for a CBO for Maughan shows this commitment. We work alongside our community leaders, businesses and residents, as well as support services, to ensure that those who continue to offend are offered the necessary support.

"However, to apply for such an Order is the result of a long pattern of behaviour adversely affecting those who live and work in the city."

Anyone with information on anti-social behaviour is asked to contact local officers, or pass information via @MerPolCC or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
