The family of Martin Decker, 69, who was found dead at his home address in Wirral on Sunday have issued a tribute:

Martin was the oldest of 6 children and he taught his brothers and sisters how to laugh, play and enjoy life.

His life was spent working hard on behalf of other people and for their benefit. He managed a team of lawyers at the CPS, all of whom loved and admired him, they would go the extra mile for him to meet his high standards.

Martin worked hard but played hard too. He loved travel and sport; he was so happy his beloved Tranmere Rovers Football Club have been doing so well this season.

He is loved by all and his passing will leave a massive hole in our lives which can never be filled. He will be dearly missed by his mother and all his brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews and all family members.
