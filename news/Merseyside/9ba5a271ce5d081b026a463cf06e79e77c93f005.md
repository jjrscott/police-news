We have issued CCTV images of a man we would like to speak following a robbery at an off-licence in Liverpool.

At around 10.20am on Tuesday 24th November a man entered Murphy's wines on Prescot Road in Fairfield, made threats of violence to the shopkeeper and demanded cash.

The man then ran away from the shop in the direction of a nearby park. The shop assistant was not injured but was left shaken by their ordeal.

We have issued CCTV images of a man we would like to speak to as we believe he has information which could be vital to our investigation.

Detective Inspector Sean Kelly-Martland said: "I would appeal to anyone who was in the area of Prescot Road on Tuesday morning who saw anyone or anything suspicious or anyone who recognises the male in the pictures to contact us.

"Shop assistants have a right to be able to go about their business without being threatened in such a manner and we are committed to finding the person responsible and bringing him to justice. I would urge anyone who has information which could help us to do that to come forward as soon as possible."

Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 2000713966.
