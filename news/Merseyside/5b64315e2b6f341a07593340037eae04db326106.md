Officers from our Cannabis Dismantling Team (CDT) have seized 90 plants and equipment after a cannabis cultivation found in Birkdale on Sunday, 29 November.

At around 1pm, officers were called to a premises on Aughton Road. A total of 90 plants and paraphernalia have now been dismantled and seized by our Cannabis Dismantling Team (CDT), and the property has been made safe.

A 32-year-old man from Birkdale was arrested on suspicion of cannabis production and has been released under investigation as enquiries continue.

Matt Brown, who heads up the CDT, said: "The identification, dismantling and making safe of such premises is absolutely vital for the communities wer serve. We'll continue to respond to information provided on all similar premises.

"Cannabis farms grown in residential, business or other locations cause a substantial risk of fire and flood, and we know that organised crime groups are involved in their production and the further harm caused by associated violent disputes.

"Nobody wants to live close to such risk, so keep aware of the signs, come to us with any suspicions, and we'll take action."

If you have any information about suspected drug production in your area, please contact @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. Always call 999 if a crime is in progress.

Some of the signs that cannabis is being grown are:

• Strange smells and sounds
• Frequent and varied visitors to a property, often at unusual times
• Gardening equipment being taken into a property, such as plant pots, fertiliser, fans and industrial lighting
• Windows are sealed and covered or the curtains are permanently closed
• Heat from an adjoining property
• Birds gathering on a roof in cold weather
• Individually these activities may seem commonplace, however, together may indicate something more suspicious
