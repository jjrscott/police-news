Merseyside Police can confirm that officers are in attendance at Formby beach today (Friday 26 February) following the discovery of a suspected unexploded ordnance device.

Officers were called around 5.30pm yesterday (Thursday 25 February) after the device was found by a member of the public.

The device has now been safely detonated by the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Team.

A cordon remains in place in the Victoria Road area while safety checks are completed.

We would like to thank the community for their patience while we dealt with the incident.
