Officers from our Roads Policing Unit are making a further appeal for witnesses following a fatal collision in St Helens Town centre on Thursday (19 November 2020).

At around 10.55am, emergency services were called to Bickerstaffe Street, Victoria Square in front of St Helens Town Hall after reports of a collision involving a bus and a female pedestrian.

The pedestrian was sadly later pronounced deceased in hospital.

The driver of the bus stopped at the scene and is assisting police with their enquiries.

The deceased woman has been formally identified as Audrey Williams, aged 63, from St Helens.

Audrey's family paid the following tribute: "Audrey will be sadly missed by her loving partner Stephen and their families."

Sergeant Ryan Lowry from the Serious Collision Investigation Unit said: "I pass my condolences to Audrey's family at this time.

"Our investigation into the circumstances of the collision are ongoing and specialist Roads Policing officers are supporting Audrey's family at this time.

"We would like to speak to anyone who may have been in the area of St Helens Town Hall at around the time of the collision. We would also ask anyone who was driving in the area at the time and has dashcam fitted to please check saved footage for anything that may help us with our investigation."

Anyone with information is urged to call the Roads Policing Unit on 0151 777 5747, message our social media desk @MerPolCC, or call 101 quoting reference number 20000703273.
