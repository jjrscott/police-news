We have charged a 33 year old Wirral man with drug offences today (Friday 19 March).

Daniel Wilson, 33, of Silverbeech Road, Poulton was charged with eight counts of Conspiracy to Supply Class A and B Drugs and one count of Conspiracy to Conceal/Disguise/Convert/Transfer/Remove Criminal Property.

He has been remanded in custody until Friday 16 April when he will appear at Liverpool Crown Court.

The charges are part of a national investigation into the supply of cocaine, and forms part of the Merseyside Police response to Operation Venetic: a national investigation into the use of encrypted mobile devices, commonly referred to as Encrochat.
