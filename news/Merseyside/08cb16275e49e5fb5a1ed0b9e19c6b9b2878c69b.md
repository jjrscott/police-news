Please share and help us in our continued enquiries to find missing Wirral man Abdul Ghaffet.

41-year-old Abdul was last seen at home in Pleasington Drive, Prenton last Monday, 15 March and we are increasingly concerned about his whereabouts.

Abdul is Pakistani, 5ft 10in tall, of medium build, with short black straight hair and stubble. His spoken language is Urdu.

We now believe Abdul have links to Liverpool as well as Wirral.

If you have seen Abdul or have any information, please contact us via our online form: https://www.merseyside.police.uk/ro/report/mp/v2/report-sighting-of-missing-person-form/

You can also contact us via @MerPolCC on Twitter, 101 or the charity Missing People on 116 000.
