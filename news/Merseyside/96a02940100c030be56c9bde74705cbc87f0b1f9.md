We have today, Tuesday 2nd March, arrested three males on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs.

The arrests come as part of a County Lines investigation with detectives from the force's Project Medusa working with colleagues from West Mercia Police to investigate the supply of Class A drugs between Merseyside and Shrewsbury and Whitchurch.

A warrant was executed at a property in Liscard this morning and a quantity of suspected Class A drugs have been seized.

The three males, all aged 19, are currently in custody where they will be interviewed by detectives.

Detective Inspector Gary Stratton said: "Today's warrant and arrests are just one example of the proactive work we are carrying out on a daily basis on the streets of Merseyside to tackle organised criminal gangs involved in County Lines drug dealing.

"We will continue to work with our colleagues in neighbouring forces to target these gangs and bring those responsible for the supply and distribution of drugs to justice."

If you have any information about County Lines activity in your area DM @MerPolCC or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. In an emergency always call 999.
