Officers from Merseyside Police Roads Policing Unit are appealing for witnesses following a collision in Halewood on Sunday 13th October.

At around 7pm, an off-road scrambler bike was in collision with a dog on the field near Wood Road, sadly resulting in the death of the 6-year-old Rottweiler.

The bike is reported to have come from the direction of the fields boarded by Wood Road and Leathers Lane.

Sergeant Ryan Lowry from the MATRIX Roads Policing Unit said: "We are keen to speak to anyone who witnessed the collision or witnessed the bike in the local area around the time of the collision.

"I would ask members of the public to check dash cam footage if they were driving in the area at the time and local residents and business owners to check CCTV systems for any evidence of the bike.

"The illegal use of off-road bikes can cause serious harm, distress and damage to those that live, work and visit our communities. We take all information seriously about the use or storage of illegal bikes and are committed to taking positive action on all information given to us."

Anyone with information on this incident or the use of illegal motorcycles can contact @MerPolCC, 101 quoting reference number 19100595541 or pass information to the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
