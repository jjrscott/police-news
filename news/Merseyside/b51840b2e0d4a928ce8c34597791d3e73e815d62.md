We are appealing for help to trace a 33-year-old man who is wanted after failing to appear at court for driving offences.

Jamie Charles Potter, from the Staffordshire area, is wanted after he was charged with using a motor vehicle without insurance and driving while disqualified on the M62 in August 2017, but failed to attend a hearing at Liverpool Magistrates Court.

Anyone who recognises Potter or knows of his whereabouts should DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111.
