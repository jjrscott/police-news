We are appealing for witnesses following a collision in Liverpool yesterday, Friday, 19 June.

At around 5pm, it was reported that a car had collided with a seven-year-old girl outside B&M on Edge Lane, causing minor injuries.

The driver of the vehicle, which is described as a small red car, is believed to have left the scene prior to the arrival of emergency services.

Enquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances and anyone who witnessed the incident or has any information is asked to contact police.

Constable Phil Williams from the Roads Policing Unit said "We are keen to trace the driver of the vehicle to assist our enquiries and would also ask anyone who witnessed the incident to please get in touch.

"Likewise, if you were in the car park and have any dashcam footage, or CCTV footage from the surrounding area, please let us know."

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has any information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 quoting ref. 20000357401 or Crimestoppers, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
