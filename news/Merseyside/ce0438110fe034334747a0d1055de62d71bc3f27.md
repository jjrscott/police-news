Officers from our Roads Policing Unit are appealing for witnesses to serious road traffic collision in Caldy, Wirral on Saturday 26 September.

At around 3.25pm, emergency services were called to Montgomery Hill to the rider of an orange Honda motorbike being found in the road with serious head injuries. He was taken to hospital and remains in a serious but stable condition. The victim was reportedly riding with a friend who was behind on a second motorbike but did not witness the collision.

Witness and CCTV enquiries remain ongoing.

Inspector Stuart McIver said: "We are keen to speak to anyone who saw the incident or any drivers in the area who may have dashcam footage of two motorcycles travelling from Hill Bark Road towards Column Road at around 3.25pm. Any footage or information could be vital in establishing what happened."
