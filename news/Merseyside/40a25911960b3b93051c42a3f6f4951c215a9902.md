We have today, Wednesday 14th October, welcomed the sentencing of two people for two attempted robberies in Liverpool in March this year.

Stuart Barnes, 44, and Emma Lewis, 36, both of Maritime Court, West Derby, pleaded guilty to the knifepoint robberies which took place at PRM News and Wine on Queens Drive and Blue Nile on Holt Road, Kensington, on March 30th this year.

Barnes was also charged and pleaded guilty to possession of a bladed article in a public place.

Barnes was jailed for five years, four months and Lewis was sentenced to two years, suspended for two years, and ordered to complete a nine-month curfew and a rehabilitation order at Liverpool Crown Court.

At around 8.55pm on Monday 30th March Barnes and Lewis entered PRM News and Wine. Barnes demanded money and got into a struggle with a male shop assistant who suffered cuts to his fingers. Nothing was stolen and Barnes and Lewis fled empty-handed.

A short time later, at 9.10pm, Barnes threatened a shop worker at the Blue Nile with a knife and demanded money. After a struggle Barnes dropped the weapon and left empty-handed on foot, again with Lewis.

Detective Constable Nicholas Glascott-Tull said: "Barnes and Lewis showed no regard for their victims when they attempted to carry out the robberies.

"Thanks to the bravery of the shop assistants in both stores the pair left empty-handed but their victims would have been left very shaken by their ordeal.

"Everybody has a right to feel safe when they go to work and nobody should have to be confronted with this in their workplace."
