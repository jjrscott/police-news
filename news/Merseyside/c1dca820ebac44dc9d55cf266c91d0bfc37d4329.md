Laura Hart, 34, will be marking her 12th anniversary as a Special this September, after joining in 2008.

Alongside being a fulltime Detention Officer with Merseyside Police, Laura decided to become a Special as she wanted to continue helping those living across Merseyside.

Laura says: "My favourite part of being a member of the Special Constabulary is knowing I have given something positive back to assist our communities as well as helping my colleagues and other police officers.

"I currently look after around 60 officers and I also work alongside Response and Resolution. I help officers with custody procedures during their 'custody role-play' days that I also set up a couple of years ago."

Laura recognises how important it is to continue helping fellow officers and staff where she can during the Covid-19 pandemic where the demand can be high and resources stretched. She will continue to provide advice, help police the streets of Merseyside and provide fundamental support as a Special Inspector.
