Two men have been arrested for drugs offences after a HGV lorry was stopped on Princess Way, Seaforth and found with 5kg of cocaine on board.

The first lorry was stopped at around 6:30pm on Friday 13th November. A search was conducted by our Dogs Unit, Boarder Force and the Port Police where five 1kg packages of cocaine were located.

The driver, 30 year old Andrew Cousins from Kilkeel in Northern Ireland was arrested for possession with intent to supply Class A drugs. He has since been charged and appeared at Liverpool Crown Court this morning (16th Nov) where he was remanded in custody until 14th December.

A second lorry linked to the first was also stopped nearby on Derby Road, Bootle where another 30 year old man from Kilkeel was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs. He has since been released on police bail until next month.

A joint investigation is ongoing.

Anyone that knows the whereabouts of drugs, how they are being transported from place to place and who is involved in this, should get in touch as a matter of urgency to keep our communities safe.
