Detectives are appealing for information following an ATM theft in Southport in the early hours of this morning, Sunday 25 October.

At around 2.10am, officers and Merseyside Fire and Rescue Services (MFRS) were called to WH Smith on Chapel Street after an alarm was activated. On attendance, it was established that access had been gained to an ATM machine with an explosive device used. An unknown quantity of cash was stolen. Officers remain at the scene this morning carrying out forensic, witness and CCTV enquiries.

Detective Inspector Tara Denn said: "This is an extremely reckless way to target any premises, one which puts members of the public who live, work and were passing nearby at risk of serious injury. The damage and inconvenience to the business is also significant.

"We have shown before in successful operations, regionally and nationally, that we will bring to justice those identified in such activity.

"If you saw or heard any suspicious activity in and around Chapel Street at around 2am, or if you live locally and have home CCTV or dashcam, please check and let us know. We will do all in our powers to remove these reckless people from the streets."

Anyone with information is asked to contact us via social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police CC with reference 20000646390.

You can also pass information via the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
