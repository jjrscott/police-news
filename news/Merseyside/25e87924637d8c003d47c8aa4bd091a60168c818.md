Merseyside Police have arrested a 29 year old man from Liverpool following a high value burglary in December last year.

The incident occurred in the early hours of the 10th December when an apartment in Liverpool was broken into and a Rolex watch, along with three pairs of trainers were stolen.

The man was arrested on suspicion of burglary and taken to custody for questioning.

Unfortunately the watch has not been recovered. If you know who has it, please get in touch so we can return it to its rightful owner.

Elsewhere, two stolen cars were recovered; one in Norris Green and the other in Vauxhall. Whilst in the Walton area, a man was stop searched on County Road and found in possession of a small kitchen knife. He was also arrested and taken to custody. #OpTarget
