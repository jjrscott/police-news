****Update: 5.40pm****

Following a road traffic collision in St Helens earlier today, the pedestrian has sadly been pronounced deceased. He is a 72-year-old man from St Helens.

His next of kin have been made aware and are being supported by specialist officers.

The road will be reopened shortly and we thank road users for their patience while the investigation is carried out.

We are continuing to appeal to anyone who witnessed the incident or has any CCTV or dashcam footage which may assist to contact @MerPolCC or 101 quoting log 377.

**Original appeal**

We can confirm that emergency services are in St Helens following a serious road traffic collision this afternoon, Monday 18 November.

At 12.15pm, we were called to Dentons Green Lane to reports of a collision between a Renault Clio and a pedestrian.

The pedestrian, a man in his 70s, will be taken to hospital for assessment of his injuries. The Renault Clio driver is helping with enquiries.

A road closure is in place on Dentons Green Lane to the junction of Bishop Road.

We would ask that road users avoid the area and find an alternative route.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has any CCTV or dashcam footage which may assist is asked to contact @MerPolCC or 101 quoting log 377.
