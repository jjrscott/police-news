Detectives are appealing for information after shots were fired in Everton last night, Monday 20 July.

At around 9pm, armed officers were called to Burleigh Road North to reports of damage being caused to the window of a house.

Evidence was found at the location to confirm that a firearm was used. Nobody was injured and a cordon is place up to Burleigh Mews off Burleigh Road North, and on Robson Street, as initial house-to-house and forensic enquiries are carried out.

Detective Inspector Amy Smith said: "Although nobody was injured, to fire a gun towards a home is incredibly reckless and could have resulted in tragedy. These are the early stages in our investigation and we're looking to find out exactly what happened and why.

"If you live locally and saw or heard anything suspicious around this time, or have CCTV or dashcam which captures those involved and any vehicles, come forward.

"Although we have seen recent reductions in serious violent crime, one gun fired is too many. We'd appeal as always to those communities affected to tell us what you know, let us take positive action and keep targeting those people who bring weapons onto the streets."

You can pass information via our social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre', with reference 1067 of 20 July.

You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
