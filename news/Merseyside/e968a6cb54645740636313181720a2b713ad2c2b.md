This morning (Thursday 18th February), detectives from the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit have arrested two men from Merseyside on suspicion of Conspiracy to Supply Class A and B Drugs and for Fraudulent evasion of a prohibition by taking out of the UK a controlled drug.

The two men, one aged 34 from the Wirral and the other aged 41 from West Derby, were arrested after officers carried out dawn raids, supported by Merseyside Police.

Several thousand pounds in cash was seized along with a small quantity of Class A drugs.

The arrests were part of the national Operation Venetic.

Both men remain in police custody for questioning.
