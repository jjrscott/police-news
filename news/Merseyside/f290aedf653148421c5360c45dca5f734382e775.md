Officers in Wirral have arrested four men and seized drugs and other items following an incident in Prenton yesterday, Wednesday 17 February.

At around 5.30pm, officers carrying out enquiries in Prenton attended an address on Woodchurch Lane. Two men were seen to make off from a top floor flat window and were chased on foot and detained. A further two men were found inside the address. Further searches resulted in suspected cocaine, cannabis, phones and other items being seized.

All four men were arrested on suspicion of possession of cannabis and possession with intent to supply Class A drugs, and taken to police stations for questioning. They have since been released under investigating pending further enquiries.

The men are:
A 22-year-old man from Seacombe
A 20-year-old man from Claughton
A 26-year-old man from Birkenhead
A 22-year-old man from Birkenhead
