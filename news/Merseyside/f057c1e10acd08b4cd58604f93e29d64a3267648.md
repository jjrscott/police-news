Detectives are appealing for information following an incident in Bootle last night, Sunday 3 May.

At shortly after 9pm, emergency services were called to Southport Road to reports of an Audi reportedly being rammed by a second car. Unconfirmed reports suggest that the driver of the second car made an attempt to run over an occupant from the Audi as he tried to exit. One man sustained minor facial cuts during the incident.

The road remains closed this morning pending further enquiries at the location and we would ask people to avoid the area where possible.

Detective Chief Inspector Gayle Rooney said: "At this stage, we are looking to establish exactly what happened and find those responsible. Thankfully, the occupants of the first car were not seriously injured, but the consequences could easily have been far worse.

"If you live locally or were passing by, share with us any information, dashcam or CCTV footage, so we can remove those involved from the streets. Southport Road will have been quiet other than this incident, so if you saw or heard anything suspicious around this time, we want to hear from you."

Anyone with information can contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre', with reference 20000255854\. You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
