We have charged a man with a number of offences after he was arrested in Toxteth on Friday (26 June 2020).

The man - who was a suspect in a number of offences - was seen by officers on patrol going into flats on Windsor Street at around 10.30am.

Officers searched the area, before detaining the man as he walked on nearby Park Road.

Ryan Gilbertson, 30, of no fixed address, was arrested and later charged with two Section 47 assaults, burglary, criminal damage, theft, coercive behaviour, and a public order offence.

He was released on conditional bail to appear at Liverpool Crown Court for trial on 27 July.
