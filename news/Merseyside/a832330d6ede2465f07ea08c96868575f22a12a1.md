Original Release

STARTS

Two men are being questioned by Merseyside Police on suspicion of conspiracy to supply class A drugs after three kilos of cocaine were recovered from a van in the West Midlands.

Officers from Merseyside stopped a van on the M42 near Worcester yesterday (Thursday, 16 July) and during a search they recovered three kilos of cocaine hidden in a hide within the vehicle.

The 54-year-old male from Rhyl was arrested in connection with an ongoing drugs investigation linked to the national Operation Venetic and he was brought to Merseyside where he is being questioned by detectives.

With support from North Wales Police four warrants were executed at addresses in Rhyl, Aigburth and Garston and a number of items were recovered including more than Â£10,000 in cash, a cash counting machine and a drugs press.

At an address in Aigburth a 32-year-old man was also arrested on conspiracy to supply class A drugs.

DI Lee Wilkinson, said: "We are committed to protecting our communities by relentlessly targeting those who are involved in all aspects of organised crime including the distribution and supply of illegal drugs and the and use of serious violence.
