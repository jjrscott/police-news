Merseyside Police are appealing for information after a stabbing in Toxteth last night (Tuesday 15 October 2019)

Officers were called just before 8pm to reports that a 17-year-old male had been stabbed on Boswell Street and sustained stab wounds to his back and chest. It is believe he was assaulted by one of two men following an altercation with the victim in the road.

The victim walked to Hartington Road, and he was taken by ambulance to hospital for treatment where he remains in a critical condition.

Officers are currently carrying out house to house, forensic and CCTV analysis.

Hartington Road and Boswell Street are closed at the time being and will remain closed as investigations continue.

Detective Inspector Paul Nilsen said: "I am sure the local community will be shocked and saddened to hear that a young man has been left in a critical condition by this brutal attack.

"I want to re-iterate the fact that Merseyside Police will not tolerate the carrying and use of knives as weapons.

"Incidents such as this cause huge pain and suffering not only for the victim, but also for their family and friends.

"The wider community suffers too - from the fear that something so awful could happen around the corner from them.

"We will keep on educating young people on the dangers of knives, and continue our significant efforts to rid our streets and of knife crime to prevent such attacks from happening again with stop searches, warrants, open land searches, dispersal zones and more.

"With the public's help, we can make Merseyside a safer place and I appeal to anyone who has any information in relation to this incident to contact police so we can find those responsible and bring them to justice."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police CC.
