We can confirm we are investigating an offensive tweet shared on social media yesterday (Sunday 3 November 2019).

A report was received following the Everton v Tottenham Hotspur match that the post was on Twitter.

Merseyside Police will not tolerate hate crime in any form and is working to identify and bring to justice anyone found responsible for committing a hate crime.
