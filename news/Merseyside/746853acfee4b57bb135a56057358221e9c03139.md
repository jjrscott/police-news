We are investigating following reports of a robbery in Old Swan today, Tuesday 1st December.

At around 12.05pm we were contacted following reports two males had robbed a security guard at Stoneycroft News on Derby Lane.

The men are believed to have made their escape in a Ford Kuga car. The car was later found burnt out in Doric Road. It is believed the males then made off in another vehicle.

The security guard was not injured during the incident but was left shaken by their ordeal.

CCTV, forensic and witness enquiries are being carried out in the local area and investigation is underway.

Detective Inspector Amy Smith said: "We are currently piecing together the events leading up to the robbery and would like to speak to anyone who saw the Ford car and its occupants in Derby Lane prior to the robbery. We would also like to speak to anyone who may have captured the vehicle on CCTV or dash cam in the area around Derby Lane or on Doric Road where it was found abandoned and set alight.

"This robbery took place on a busy road in broad daylight. We are sure there are people who would have been passing, either on foot or in car, who would have seen something out of the ordinary and it those people I would ask to come forward and speak to us. These are not victimless crimes and we are committed to finding the people responsible and bringing them to justice.

Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111 quoting log 390 of 1st December.
