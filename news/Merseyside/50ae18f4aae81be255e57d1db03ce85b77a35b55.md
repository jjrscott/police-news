We are appealing for information after shots were fired in Bootle last night (Tuesday 1 October).

At 10.10pm, police were called to Cornwall Road to reports of shots being heard in the area. Armed officers attended and found damage to a car and evidence in the street of a firearm having been discharged.

Officers remained at the scene last night and this morning to provide reassurance to residents, as well as carrying out house-to-house, forensic and CCTV enquiries.

Anyone with information to help our initial investigation is urged to contact @MerPolCC or 101 with reference 967, or you can tell Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, a charity completely independent of Merseyside Police.
