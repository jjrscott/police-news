Detectives are investigating following a suspected arson of a vehicle in Wallasey yesterday, Sunday 3 January.

At around 8.50pm, officers and MFRS were called to Rice Lane to reports of a car on fire, causing extensive damage but no injuries.

Enquiries are ongoing, including CCTV and witnesses.

Detective Chief Inspector Terry Davies said: "We initially believe that this was a deliberate, targeted and completely reckless attack, which could have easily resulted in serious injuries to people living nearby.

"If you live in the area and saw, heard or captured footage of anyone acting suspiciously around the time of the incident, please come forward and we will take positive action to remove those responsible from the community.

"You can either speak to us directly or anonymously via Crimestoppers, and be assured that we will treat all information with sensitivity and care."

Anyone with information, CCTV, dashcam or other footage is asked to contact us via our social media desk @MerPolCC on Twitter, 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook, 101, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, with reference 21000006745\.
