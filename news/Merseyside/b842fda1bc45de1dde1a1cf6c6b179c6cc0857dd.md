Officers descended on various areas of North Liverpool yesterday (5th August) as part of our continued activity to seek out dangerous people, remove weapons and drugs from our streets and support our communities.

Officers made up of our Targeted team, dogs section, community team and Local Intelligence Unit were joined by our local authority and other partners to carry out activity, reassure those living in the surrounding area and reduce crime and disorder.

The day began with officers utilising a gully sucker which enabled us to find a number of weapons hidden in the drains, including a heavy chain and a number of metal rods.

Officers then dispersed across the mapped area where they carried out uniformed patrols on foot, roadside operations and plain clothed patrols. This resulted in 44 people being stop searched, 17 of those who were either arrested for offences including breaching of a criminal behaviour order, possession of a controlled drug, drug driving and possession of an offensive weapon or given street cautions, again for drug offences.

Three drugs warrants were also executed at addresses on Stonehill Street, Makin Street and Harbell Street.

**Stonehill Street:** Officers forced entry into the address with the help of the dogs unit where they located a cannabis farm consisting of around 15 plants, a hydroponic setup, a large amount of dried cannabis and related drugs paraphernalia including scales, snap bags and phones.

In the occupants bedroom, officers also found a live incubator with approximately 36 cannabis saplings inside. The electricity was found to have been bridged, making the wiring hugely dangerous inside the property itself but this also posed risks to neighbouring houses.

The occupant, a 27 year old man, was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply drugs, production of Class B drugs, possession of a controlled drug and abstracting electricity.

**Makin Street:** The second warrant took place on Makin Street following intelligence suggesting that drug dealing was taking place at the property. Officers again forced entry into the home where they seized a small amount of cannabis. The occupant, a 19 year old man, was issued with a caution.

**Harbell Street:** The third and final warrant took place at a property on Harbell Street following more intelligence provided by the public suggesting drug offences were being committed. The address was searched, however nothing of note was found.

On foot, officers deployed to Bala Street and Hahnemann Road whilst roadside operations were carried out around the Townsend Lane, Stanley Road and Wilburn Street areas. During which a BMW was seized for having no insurance. A 34 year old man was also given a Cannabis caution after the car he was a passenger in was stopped and he was found in possession of three cannabis reefers and three bags of cannabis.

Following this, a Ford Transit Van was stopped on Islington for no insurance. Officers searched the van where they found an 8" knife in a cardboard box under the passenger seat so all three men, aged 19, 26 and 48 were arrested on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon.

On Bedford Road, a 29 year old was arrested after the Renault Clio he was driving was stopped. He was subject to a roadside drugs wipe which came back positive for cocaine. He was arrested for drug driving and taken to custody for questioning.

Teams of officers also conducted a number of open land searches along the Leeds and Liverpool Canal (from Eldonian Village to Bankhall) following intelligence received from the public that suggested drugs had been hidden in the area. Unfortunately we didn't find anything during the search but we are thankful for the public sharing information with us regardless.

Inspector Jordan Quinn said: "Op Target deployments come as a direct result from the community telling us what they know, where criminals are operating and where dangerous weapons are being stored. With this information, we can actively deploy to specific locations and carry out the activity needed to effectively police the area.

"Yesterday's results show the success of these deployments and we will continue to work with our partners and the public to keep everyone living in the area safe and free from criminal activity.

"If you have any information that you think would be useful in guiding future deployments, please get in touch - we must all work together to protect the more vulnerable members of society and bring those involved in gangs, drugs or other serious violence to justice."
