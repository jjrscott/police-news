Our officers have been stepping up patrols in the Kirkdale area following reports of issues with antisocial behaviour.

We have received reports of problems around the Commercial Road area, and in particular a grass embankment, where a number of males have been gathering causing issues by not taking notice of social distancing rules, travelling around in vehicles and throwing stones at passing cars.

A number were detained last weekend and seven, aged between 18 and 24, were reported for breaches of the COVID-19 legislation and will receive a fine.

High visibility patrols have also been stepped up in the local area.

A search of the area around Commercial Road by local policing officers deployed on Operation Target this morning recovered a Taser (pictured) which has also been seized.

Liverpool community policing Superintendent Diane Pownall said: "Behaviour such as this will not be tolerated. Everyone is expected to abide by the government guidelines on staying indoors and social distancing and I want to reassure the public that patrols will be stepped up in the area and we will be taking action where necessary.

"If you have information about antisocial behaviour in your area please DM @MerPolCC or call @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111."
