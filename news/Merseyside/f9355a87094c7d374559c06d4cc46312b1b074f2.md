Detectives investigating the murder of a 26-year-old man in the early hours of this morning (Friday, 26 June) are appealing for information.

Emergency services were called to the address on Oakham Street, Toxteth at around 6.15am. There they found the injured man, who was believed to have been stabbed.

The man is yet to be formally identified but his next of kin have been made aware. A Home Office Post Mortem will take place to establish the cause of death.

A cordon remains in Oakham Street, a full forensic search of the house is underway and CCTV from the area is being examined.

Detective Chief Inspector Richie Jones said: "We are in the very early stages of an investigation and are working to establish the full circumstances of the incident. We are speaking with a number of people who we believe were at the house at the time of the incident, in attendance at a party.

"At this time the motive for the attack is unknown and we are keeping an open mind. I understand this incident will cause much shock and concern for the local community but I want to reassure you, we are working hard to find the person(s) responsible for the tragic death of this young man.

"I would like to appeal to anyone who can assist with our investigation to get in contact. If you heard or saw anything suspicious in the Oakham Street or surrounding areas, or have any CCTV or dashcam footage, please contact us so we can investigate it thoroughly.

You can contact us with any information on Twitter at @MerPolCC, by calling 101 or @CrimestoppersUK, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
