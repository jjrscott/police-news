Officers from our Roads Policing Unit are issuing a further appeal for witnesses following a fatal road traffic collision in Bootle last month.

At around 8.15pm on Monday 12 October, emergency services were called to the northbound carriageway of Southport Road (A5038) close to the junction with Breeze Hill and the Mons public house, following reports of a collision between a black Mercedes and a male pedestrian in his 60s.

The pedestrian was sadly pronounced deceased.

Merseyside Police can now name the man as Peter Roberts, aged 63, from West Derby, Liverpool.

In a short statement, Peter's brother Bryan said: "He will be sadly missed by his Mum, three brothers and his children. He has been taken from us too soon. We miss you Bro."

The driver of the motor vehicle stopped at the scene and is assisting police with their enquiries.

Specialist Roads Policing officers are supporting the family of the deceased gentleman at this time.

Sergeant Ryan Lowry from the Serious Collision Investigation Unit said: "We would like to speak to anyone that may have been in the area at the time of the collision. Similarly if you have a dashcam fitted to your vehicle, and were in the area at around the time, please check saved footage for anything that may assist us in our investigation."

Anyone with information is urged to call the Roads Policing Unit on 0151 777 5747, message our social media desk @MerPolCC, or call 101 quoting reference number 20000618755.
