We are appealing for help to find a 17-year-old boy missing from home in Liverpool.

Ibrahim Alfadoon was last seen in Balmoral Road, Fairfield on Wednesday, 30 October and enquiries have been ongoing to locate him since.

He is described as a Middle Eastern male, around 5ft 10in tall, of slim build with brown hair and brown eyes.

Ibrahim is known to frequent areas of Toxteth and Manchester.

We are becoming increasingly concerned for Ibrahim's whereabouts and anyone who has seen him, or knows of his whereabouts is asked to DM @MerPolCC , call 101 or contact Missing People on 116 000.
