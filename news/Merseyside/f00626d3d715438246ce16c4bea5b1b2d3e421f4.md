 We are appealing for information following a burglary at a hotel in Frankby in the early hours of Sunday, 26 January.

It was reported that at some time between 1am and 8am, two unknown offenders wearing facial coverings forced entry to the Hillbark Hotel in Royden Park, before making off with a large quantity of alcohol.

Damage was also caused to a car parked at the premises.

CCTV, forensic and witness enquiries are ongoing and anyone with information is asked to contact police.

Detective Inspector Laura Lamping said: "An investigation is underway following a burglary in the early hours of Sunday morning and I would ask anyone who may have information to please let us know.

"If you saw or heard any suspicious behaviour in the area, a vehicle leaving the scene in the early hours, have any CCTV or dashcam footage or have heard anything since the incident, please get in touch. To target a business in this way is unacceptable and we know it can cause great distress to the victims. We are determined to find those responsible and put them before the courts, so if you have any information at all, please contact us."

If you have any information on the burglary, please contact @MerPolCC, 101 quoting ref. or @CrimestoppersUK, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
