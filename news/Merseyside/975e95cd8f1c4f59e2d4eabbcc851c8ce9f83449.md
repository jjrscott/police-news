We are appealing for information after a man was stabbed in Bromborough on Friday 29 May.

At around 10.50pm, the 23-year-old victim, was subjected to an unprovoked attack by a group of youths on Leverhulme Sports Field, off Tebay Road.

During the assault he was kicked and punched to the face and body, and slashed to the left hand and stabbed to the leg, sustaining a puncture wound.

He was taken to Arrowe Park Hospital for treatment and has since been discharged.

Officers attended the scene to conduct enquiries, speak to witnesses and seek CCTV opportunities.

Detective Constable Victoria Noakes said: "This was a shocking, unprovoked and sustained attack by a group of youths, and we are determined to find who is responsible.

"We believe there were a number of youths with the offenders and appeal to anyone who witnessed the incident to come forward.

"Knife crime has no place on the streets and open spaces of Wirral, and our work to disrupt the activities of those who use, carry and store weapons goes on.

"We continue to stop check people we suspect of carrying weapons, arrest them, executing warrants at their homes and search land wherever our intelligence and tip offs from the public lead us."
