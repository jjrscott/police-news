The operation targeted individuals involved in the use of firearms and supply of drugs across Merseyside and Sussex, with eight warrants executed at Merseyside addresses and one in Eastbourne, beginning shortly after 5am.

Those arrested during the warrants are as follows:

-A 29-year-old man from Liverpool was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs, possession of component part of a firearm, and conspiracy to supply firearms

Superintendent Diane Pownall said: "This morning's operation has resulted in a number of arrests and a quantity of suspected class A drugs seized, which now thankfully have been prevented from reaching our communities.

"Those involved in the supply of drugs and use of weapons have no regard for the lives they affect and the harm they can cause, and we are committed to pursuing those involved in serious and organised crime and bringing them to justice.

"We have recently seen a number of incidents involving firearms and this will not be tolerated by Merseyside Police, or the communities we serve. Criminals use such weapons to cause fear, intimidation or harm in our communities and we are putting significant resources into tackling gun crime on a daily basis.

"We are constantly working with other forces and partners to target offenders and take action, and information from our communities plays a vital part in this. Operations such as today's would not be possible without the help of the public in identifying these individuals, and I would like to urge anyone with information on criminality in your area to please come forward so we can act upon it.

"Officers will remain in the area throughout the day to continue searches of the properties, carry out land searches and high visibility patrols, and engage with the local community at sites in Penrose Street and Muirhead Avenue. I would encourage any members of the public in the area with concerns or information on criminality, to please visit the sites where officers will be waiting to welcome and assist you."

If you have information on the storage of weapons or use of drugs, please contact @MerPolCC, or 101. Alternatively, you can pass information to independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
