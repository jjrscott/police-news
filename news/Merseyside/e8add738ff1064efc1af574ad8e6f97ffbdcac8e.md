Wanted

05:00 23/12/2020

Have you seen this man? Trefor Watson, 37, is wanted on recall to prison.

He was given a three-year sentence for Section 20 wounding and released on licence on 4 December this year.

He was recalled to prison on 7 December after breaching the terms under which he was released, and once arrested will serve the remainder of his sentence.

Extensive enquiries have been ongoing to trace him since.

He has links to Stockport and Widnes.

Watson is white of large build, 5ft 8in tall, has green eyes, and has shaven hair.

We are issuing one wanted appeal per day for 12 days to support the work of our Force Fugitive Team, so help us track these people down before Christmas.

Anyone with information on Watson's whereabouts or any of our wanted people is asked to contact @MerPolCC or 101 with reference 20000744658.

You can also pass information anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. You can also contact them via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
