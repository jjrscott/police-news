We're issuing the image of tools stolen from a van in Southport earlier this month, in an effort to reunite them with their owner.

At some time between 8pm-midnight on Wednesday 5 February, entry was gained to a Vauxhall Vivaro van parked outside Coopers Bar in Leicester Street and DeWalt commercial power tools were stolen.

CCTV enquiries have been carried out but proved negative.

Inspector Beth Blake said: "This theft and all similar incidents cause massive inconvenience to those affected, people who are merely carrying out their daily business within our communities.

"If you witnessed it happening or have seen or been offered these tools since, please contact our social media desk @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and we will take action."
