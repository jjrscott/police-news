Merseyside Police is reminding parents, guardians and children to follow government guidelines while young people aren't attending school due to coronavirus.

A number of calls have been received reporting large groups of youths gathering in areas of Wirral, as well as other areas of Merseyside, and local officers are encouraging young people to practise social distancing and limit social interactions as much as possible.

Wirral Community Policing Superintendent, Gary O'Rourke said: "We understand this is a difficult time and that children may be increasingly bored if not attending school with their friends. However, now more than ever it's important that the Government's guidelines are adhered to so that children, their families, friends and the wider communities are protected.

"Limiting social interactions is key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 and although we understand how frustrating staying at home must be for young people, it is in the best interest of all.

"To parents and guardians, I would encourage you to reiterate the importance of social distancing to your children and if they must leave the house for any reason, please be aware of where they are going and who with. The current guidance is that having friends or family at your house should be avoided, as well as social mixing in the community. If you do go outdoors for a walk or exercise, you should ensure you stay at least two meters apart.

"We appreciate that these are uncertain and confusing times, especially for young people who may not fully understand the impact of coronavirus, but by following the advice given and sharing this with our children we can slow the spread and keep people safe."
