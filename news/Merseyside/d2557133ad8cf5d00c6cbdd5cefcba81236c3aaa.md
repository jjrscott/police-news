We can confirm that a five-year Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) has been issued to a woman banning her from entering Aldi, Co-Op, Wilko (Wilkinsons) or Tesco stores throughout the whole of Merseyside.

Terri Ann Dingle 34-years of no fixed abode but from the St Helens area, was issued with the order yesterday (Thursday, 6 August) at Liverpool, Knowsley and St Helens Magistrates Court, which runs until 2025. This follows a conviction on Thursday,28 May 2020 for two offences of theft and a public order matter.

Community Policing Inspector Matt Drennan said: "Criminal Behaviour Orders continue to be an extremely effective tool in tackling persistent offenders who have a negative impact on our communities, be it through anti-social behaviour, theft or other issues.

"The successful application for a CBO for Dingle shows this commitment. We work alongside businesses and residents, as well as support services, to ensure that those who continue to offend are offered the necessary support.

"However, to apply for such an order is the necessary consequence of a long pattern of behaviour adversely affecting those who live and work in the area, and we will continue to utilise them for the benefit of the community."

Anyone with information on anti-social behaviour is asked to contact local officers, or pass information via @MerPolCC or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. You can also follow St Helens Police on Twitter and Facebook for updates, advice and events.
