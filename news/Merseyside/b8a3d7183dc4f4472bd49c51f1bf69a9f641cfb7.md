We arrested a man and woman after a car was stop checked in Huyton Saturday (21 March).

Knowsley Targeted Officers on Tarbock Road stopped a Renault Clio with a woman driving and a man in the front passenger seat.

An officer noticed a smell of cannabis and following a search of the vehicle, located around Â£1,100 in cash.

Cannabis was seized during a further search of a property in Huyton.

A 23-year-old man and a 25-year-old woman, both from Huyton, were arrested on suspicion of possession of criminal property and possession with intent to supply Class B drugs (cannabis).

The 25-year-old woman was also arrested on suspicion of drug driving.

Both have been released under investigation and enquiries continue.

Inspector Jon Coote said: "Proactive policing and visible patrols not only give the public reassurance, they allow officers to observe any suspicious activity and act on it, conducting stop checks of vehicles such as this in order to keep people safe from the violence and exploitation often involved in the supply of drugs.

"Stop check are hugely important when it comes to taking dangerous people and drugs and weapons off our streets.

"No criminal should profit from misery while our wider law abiding communities work hard to earn an honest living. If you know someone involved in crime, please let us know so we can take them off our streets."

Please report all crime via our social media channels, calling 101 or in an emergency, always call 999.
