Detectives investigating a stabbing in St Helens at the weekend have arrested and charged a man in connection with the incident.

At 3.45pm on Saturday 19 October, emergency services were called to Farmfoods in Boundary Road to reports of an altercation in which the victim, a staff member, sustained a stab wound to his stomach. He has since been released from hospital.

Yesterday (Tuesday 22 October), following extensive enquiries, a man was arrested in Newton-le-Willows.

He will appear today (Wednesday 23 October) at St Helens Adult Remand Court in Derby Square, Liverpool.

Detective Chief Inspector John Williams said: "We will continue to thoroughly investigate all reports of knife crime, either their use or storage.

"If you have any information about people possessing or hiding any weapons, let us know directly or anonymously via Crimestoppers and we will take positive action to remove the threat from your streets."
