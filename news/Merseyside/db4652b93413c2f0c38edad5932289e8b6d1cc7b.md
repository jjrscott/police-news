Chief Constable Andy Cooke, said: "It was reported last week that I had self-isolated from work after developing Coronavirus symptoms, I can confirm that yesterday I found out I had tested positive for the virus.

"During my career I can count the times I've been off sick on one hand, so this wasn't an easy decision for me to make and in a way the outcome of the test proves the point.

"Despite having had the virus I have been able to continue to represent the force from home and have been working at both a regional and national level with Chief Officers, Government officials and representatives from other partnership organisations.

"My officers and staff are working hard to reassure and protect our communities and I believe it is incumbent on me in these unprecedented times of uncertainty to continue to support my officers and staff and ensure that the force is in a position to cope with the challenges ahead and keep the people of Merseyside safe."
