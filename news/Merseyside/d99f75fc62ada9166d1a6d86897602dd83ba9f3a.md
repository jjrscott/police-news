Officers from our Cyber Dependent Crime Unit have charged a Halewood man with fraud and computer misuse act offences as part of a continuing investigation.

26-year-old Aaron Brown of Stanford Crescent was charged with three counts of Fraud by False Representation; Unauthorised computer access with intent to commit other offences; and Unauthorised acts with intent to impair operation of or prevent/hinder access to a computer.

The charges relate to allegations where Brown illegally accessed a gaming website, resulting in the business being unable to operate. Further fraud allegations relate to online shopping and ticket fraud.

Brown will next appear at Liverpool Crown Court on Wednesday 27 January 2021.
