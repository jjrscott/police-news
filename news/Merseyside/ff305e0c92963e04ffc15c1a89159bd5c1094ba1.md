Officers have authorised a further Section 60 Order in Toxteth this afternoon following recent firearms incidents.

The order will be in place from 4pm today (Tuesday 11 August) until 5am tomorrow (Wednesday 12 August) and gives officers enhanced stop and search powers in a specified geographic location for a set period of time (pictured on map).

On this occasion, officers are authorised to search any males aged between 14-45.

The area covered is bounded by Upper Parliament St, Smithdown Road, Ullet Road, Park Road and back to Upper Parliament Street.

The Section 60 is authorised to allow officers to exercise the power through the night and to effectively keep the public safe and prevent any further incidents in the locality.

Community Policing Inspector Geoff Stewart said: "These orders are not about bothering the vast majority of law-abiding members of our communities, and are introduced when absolutely necessary.

"We're aware of the concern that serious incidents of violence and gun crime cause in any area, and in having this order in place, we are looking to protect the public, prevent any further incidents, and deter would-be criminals from operating."

"If you have any information about recent incidents, or any concerns, speak to our officers of tell us what you know and we'll keep taking the appropriate action."

Anyone with information on criminal activity in the area is asked to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. Always call 999 in an emergency.
