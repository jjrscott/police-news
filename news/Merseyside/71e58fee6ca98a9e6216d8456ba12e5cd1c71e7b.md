We are appealing for information following the burglary for these electric cutting tools from Belle Vale Community Fire Station last week.

At around 8.30pm on Tuesday 28 January, two high value electric tools were stolen from the station, on Childwall Valley Road. One is a cutting tool and the second a door spreader.

CCTV and witness enquiries are ongoing.

Detective Constable Dave McHugh said: "To steal life-saving equipment from an emergency service is beyond belief and I'm sure the community share our disgust that this has happened, and understand the inconvenience it causes.

"None of us knows when we will have to rely on the fire service so we're determined to find those responsible as soon as possible, and return this vital equipment.

"If you have seen or been offered such items, do the right thing and come forward. We will take positive action on all information you provide."

Anyone with information is urged to contact @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or online at https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously with reference number 20000061969.
