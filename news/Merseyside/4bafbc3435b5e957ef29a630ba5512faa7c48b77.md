We are appealing for information following reports of a stabbing in Anfield today (Sunday 7 February).

It was reported at around 4.45pm that a 43-year-old man was involved in an altercation with a group of youths outside Anfield Sports and Community Centre on Breckside Park near Lower Breck Road.

It is understood that, during the altercation, the man suffered a single stab wound to his chest. The offenders then made off from the scene.

The victim was taken to hospital to be treated for his injuries. He is currently in a stable condition.

CCTV, forensic and witness enquiries are ongoing

Detective Inspector Laura Parr said, "We are in the early stages of an investigation and initial enquires indicate that the victim was involved in an altercation.

"If you were in the Lower Breck Road area this afternoon and you saw, heard or may have captured anything on mobile phone or dashcam, please come forward and we will take action. As we have tragically seen, knife crime can have catastrophic consequences and while this man has not received life-threatening injuries, this incident will leave a significant impact nonetheless.

"We work hard to regularly remove from the streets dangerous weapons and those who carry them, so keep passing information on and we will do the rest."
