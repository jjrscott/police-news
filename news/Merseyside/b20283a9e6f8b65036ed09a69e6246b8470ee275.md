We are appealing for information following a burglary in St Helens in the early hours of Saturday 12 December.

At around 4am occupants of a house on Denton's Green Lane were alerted by their dog who was barking downstairs.

An unknown offender is believed to have entered the property and a stolen two laptops (a dark grey HP 640 G3 laptop and black 15.6" Lenovo Think-pad E580) and a Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact mobile phone.

An investigation is underway and CCTV and forensic enquiries have been carried out.

We have also issued a CCTV image of a man we want to trace as we believe he has information which could assist our investigation.

Detective Inspector Jackie Guinness said: "We are appealing for anyone who was in the Denton's Green area in the early hours of Saturday morning to contact us if they recognise this man or saw anything suspicious. Similarly it is vital that we find anyone who was driving or walking in the area who may have captured something, either on their mobile phone, or dash cam to get in touch.
