We have extended a Dispersal Zone in West Derby Village and Croxteth Hall Park following recent reports of anti-social behaviour.

The order runs from 6pm today (Friday 26th February) until 6pm on Sunday 28th February and officers will be in the area to provide a visible presence and deal with any incidents.

The Dispersal Zone covers the area bounded in the map.

The order comes under Section 34 of the Anti-Social Behaviour & Policing Act 2014, which gives police officers and police community support traffic officers powers to direct people they suspect are causing or likely to cause crime, nuisance or anti-social behaviour to members of the public to leave a designated area and not return for up to 48 hours.

Under the legislation, officers have the power to seize any item, including vehicles, used in the commission of anti-social behaviour.

Should a person who has previously been directed to leave the area return, an offence would be committed, which they may ultimately be arrested for.

Community Policing Sergeant Steve Hunter said: "We introduce Dispersal Zones to help reduce anti-social behaviour, and will be out on high visibility patrols out from this evening enforcing it.

"We are well aware of the significant impact this sort of anti-social behaviour can have on the vast majority of people in area who are law-abiding members of the community.

"The dispersal zone gives us the powers we need to deal effectively with people and I would urge anyone in the area with information about youths behaving anti-socially to let us know."
