Detectives in Wirral are issuing CCTV images of six men and one woman who may have information following a burglary at a Birkenhead restaurant in June.

Between 1 June and 15 June, entry was forced to Yiamas Greek Taverna on Borough Road and over this period, various items were stolen, including an intercom, kitchen equipment, cash and alcohol. Damage was also caused to stock, fixtures and fittings, all of which was discovered at a later date.

Detective Constable Tom Murphy said: "If you recognise any of the people pictured, come forward as we think they may have information to assist.

"This was a deplorable incident in which a popular restaurant in the community was broken into, damaged and looted of multiple items, over a number of days.

"For such a thing to happen while the owners were already going through the hardship of closure due to the pandemic makes it even more of a disgrace.

"We're determined to find those responsible and put them before the court, so if you saw anyone acting suspiciously at the location or have heard anything since, let us know and we will take action."
