We're reminding drivers to obey the speed limit following some reports of Merseyside road users driving at excess speeds.

Roads Policing Inspector Carl McNulty said: "With the roads understandably being clearer than usual, we're receiving some reports of people speeding. Thankfully, these haven't resulted in an serious collisions, but we want people to listen before it's too late. Our officers remain visible on the road networks and we'll be stopping people and enforcing driving laws as always.

"Don't be complacent: there is no excuse for breaking the laws of the road, at this or any time. Driving at high speeds endangers the lives of those driving and those of other road users and pedestrians.

"The last thing the NHS needs at this difficult time is anyone being admitted to hospital due to avoidable road traffic collisions. Help support their hard work by staying home and making safe journeys and only when absolutely essential."

Pass any information when safe to do so, either 999 in an emergency, or via our social media desk on Twitter and Facebook @MerPolCC, or anonymously through Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
