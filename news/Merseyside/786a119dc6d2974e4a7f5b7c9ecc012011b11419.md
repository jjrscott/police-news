Officers in Birkenhead will be setting up a dispersal zone on Friday (14 February) in the town centre.

The Dispersal Zone has been authorised to run for 48 hours from 5pm on Friday to 4.59pm on Sunday.

The order comes under Section 34/35 of the Anti-Social Behaviour & Policing Act 2014 which gives police officers and police community support traffic officers powers to direct people they suspect are causing or likely to cause crime, nuisance or anti-social behaviour to members of the public to leave a designated area for up to 48 hours.

The area covered (see map) is marked within the boundary bordered by the below roads and includes the road way up to the boundary for private dwellings and buildings: Park Road East/Conway Street/Argyle Street/ Argyle Street South/Elm Grove/Willmer Road/Balls Road East/Balls Road/Slatey Road/Park Road South/Park Road East.

If a person has been directed to leave the area and returns during the period of the dispersal notice, an offence will have been committed. Any breaches of this can lead to their arrest.

Community Inspector Tom Welch said: "We recognise the impact anti-social behaviour can have on individuals and communities, and we will be targeting people we suspect of being involved in this type of behaviour. People going about their legitimate daily business have nothing to fear.

"The dispersal zone gives us the powers we need to deal effectively with people and I would urge anyone in the area with any information on anti-social or criminal activity in their area to contact 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
