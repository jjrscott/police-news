Officers in Knowsley have introduced Dispersal Zones in Halewood and Huyton following recent reports of antisocial behaviour and disorder.

The orders will run from 6pm today, Wednesday, 4 November until 6pm on Friday, 6 November and officers will be in the area to provide a visible presence, deal with any incidents and reassure the public.

The Dispersal Zones have been introduced in response to recent reports of anti-social behaviour, which have caused significant concern to the local community. Reported incidents include young people gathering in large groups, causing damage, throwing items including fireworks and using abusive language. In Huyton, there has also been reports of youths causing nuisance within abandoned offices.

The Dispersal Zones cover the areas bounded as per the maps.

The order comes under Section 34 of the Anti-Social Behaviour & Policing Act 2014, and gives police officers and police community support traffic officers powers to direct people they suspect are causing or likely to cause crime, nuisance or anti-social behaviour to members of the public to leave a designated area and not return for up to 48 hours.

Under the legislation, officers have the power to seize any item, including vehicles, used in the commission of anti-social behaviour. Should a person who has previously been directed to leave the area return, an offence would be committed, which they may ultimately be arrested for.

Anyone who wishes to report anti-social or criminal behaviour can contact @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. Always call 999 in an emergency.
