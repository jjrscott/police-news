We've introduced a Dispersal Zone in and around Liverpool city centre and south Liverpool today, Saturday 14 November.

The order runs from 11am today (Saturday) until 00:01 on Sunday 15th November and officers will be in the area to provide a visible presence and deal with any incidents.

The Dispersal Zone covers the area bounded as per the map and includes the area within Mossley Hill Drive- Croxteth Drive- Aigburth Drive-Sefton Park Road-Upper Parliament Street-Grove Street-Low Hill-Erskine Street-Shaw Street-Prince Edwin Street-Scotland Road-Leeds Street-Princes Parade-Waterfront- Upper Parliament Street-Park Road-Ullet Road-Aigburth Road-Mossley Hill Drive.

The order comes under Section 35 of the Anti-Social Behaviour & Policing Act 2014, which gives police officers and police community support traffic officers powers to direct people they suspect are causing or likely to cause crime, nuisance or anti-social behaviour to members of the public to leave a designated area and not return for up to 48 hours.

Under the legislation, officers have the power to seize any item, including vehicles, used in the commission of anti-social behaviour.

Should a person who has previously been directed to leave the area return, an offence would be committed, which they may ultimately be arrested for.

The order has been brought in following a gathering last weekend which was in contravention of the Coronavirus legislation. This order has been authorised in order to protect lives, prevent the spread of Coronavirus and keep people safe.
