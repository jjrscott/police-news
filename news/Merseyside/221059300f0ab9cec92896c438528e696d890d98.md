A man has been charged after an incident at a supermarket in Liverpool on Monday (18 May).

Officers were called just before 10.55pm to a report a man had tried to leave Tesco Express on London Road with items without paying.

When challenged by staff, the man reportedly pushed a member of staff and made verbal threats suggesting he had a knife.

Jamie Lee Heady, 38 years, of no fixed address was arrested and later charged with assault, theft from a shop and threatening a person with a bladed article in public.

He was remanded in custody to appear at Liverpool Magistrates Court today (Thursday 21 May).

Chief Inspector Andy Creer said: "Operation Target, our force campaign to disrupt those involved in serious and violent crime, has continued throughout the lockdown period.

"People who bring violence or carry weapons on our streets are not welcome in Merseyside.

"Every day we conduct stop checks, and make seizures and arrests to stop people carrying knives and putting the safety of others - as well as themselves - at risk.

"If you have any information about someone in your community who is carrying or storing weapons, please contact us @MerPolCC on Twitter, 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
