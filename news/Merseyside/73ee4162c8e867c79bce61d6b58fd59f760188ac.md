We have issued a CCTV image of a man we would like to speak to following the theft of debit cards from a business in Bootle.

At between 3pm and 3.45pm on Wednesday 17th February an unknown person entered a garage on Canal Street and stole items from a locker including debit cards, a mobile phone and car keys.

Attempts were made to use the debit cards at businesses in Liverpool later that afternoon.

We have issued an image of a man we would like to speak to as we believe he could assist with our investigation.

Anyone who knows the man or recognises him, or the man himself, is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 21000105216.
