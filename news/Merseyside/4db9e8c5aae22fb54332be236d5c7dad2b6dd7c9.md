We are appealing for witnesses following a racially aggravated assault in Liverpool city centre on Sunday 30th August.

At around 4pm a 24 year-old man from the Salford area was assaulted by a group of five unknown males near a hotel in the Bold Street area of the city centre. The man suffered facial injuries during the assault.

The man was able to run away via Concert Square and Bold Street before making his way to Lime Street station where he was assisted by a male and female.

An investigation is underway and CCTV enquiries are being carried out in the local area.

Detective Superintendent Dave McCaughrean said: "This was a nasty assault and we are determined to find the people responsible and bring them to justice.

"I know Liverpool city centre would have been busy with people out eating and drinking on the afternoon of Bank Holiday Sunday, 30th August.

"I would appeal to anyone who was in the area around Concert Square or Bold Street at 4pm who saw anyone or anything suspicious to contact us as they may be able to assist with our investigation.

"I would also ask the male and female who assisted the man in Lime Street station to get in touch as they may have information which could help with our enquiries."

Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC or contact @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 20000526405.
