Merseyside Police are appealing for the public's help to locate a 20 year old man following a fail to stop road traffic collision in June.

The collision is reported to have happened on 2nd June at the junction of Childwall Valley Road and Craighurst Avenue, Liverpool.

The female driver of the first vehicle, an Audi A4, who was 34 weeks pregnant at the time, was left with bruises to her chest, shoulder and shin.

She was taken to hospital for treatment where she and the baby were checked over and confirmed as being okay. She has since had a healthy baby boy.

The driver of the second vehicle, a Ford KA, left the scene on foot without checking on the woman or exchanging details.

We are now appealing for the whereabouts of 20 year old Cristi Nicolae who we believe could have crucial information to help with our investigations.

Anyone that has seen Cristi, knows where he is or recognises him from the image should contact @MerPolCC quoting 19100283808.
