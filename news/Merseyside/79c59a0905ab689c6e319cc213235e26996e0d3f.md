We are appealing for information following an attempted burglary and criminal damage in Rainhill in the early hours of Sunday morning, 10 November.

At around 6am, a call was received that a suspected stolen Ford Transit van had driven into the front of a Mei's Garden Chinese restaurant on Warrington Road, causing significant damage to shutters and driven off. No entry was gained.

It was subsequently found in Arnside Road and forensically seized for further enquiries. The van is believed to have been stolen from Huyton earlier that day.

Enquiries are ongoing to trace the occupant of the vehicle and establish the circumstances.

St Helens Sergeant Steve Street said: "We are looking to establish exactly what happened, so if you saw or heard anything, were passing or hold CCTV or dashcam footage, let us know.

"This incident has caused significant damage to a local business, and all the stress and inconvenience that this will bring. We're determined to find those responsible and put them before the courts."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 with reference 19100656639.
