We have introduced a Dispersal Zone in St Helens this afternoon, Friday 11 December, after reports of anti-social behaviour.

The order runs from 2pm today (Friday) until 2pm on Sunday 13 December and officers will be in the area to provide a visible presence and deal with any incidents.

The Dispersal Zone covers the area bounded in the map and includes Chalon Way West, Chalon Way East, Shaw Street, Hall Street, Cansfield Street, Birchley Street, Cotham Street, Church Street, Ormskirk Street and Bridge Street.

It is a response to a number of reports on Wednesday and Thursday evening that youths were causing problems and threatening members of the public.

The order comes under Section 34 of the Anti-Social Behaviour & Policing Act 2014, which gives police officers and police community support traffic officers powers to direct people they suspect are causing or likely to cause crime, nuisance or anti-social behaviour to members of the public to leave a designated area and not return for up to 48 hours.

Under the legislation, officers have the power to seize any item, including vehicles, used in the commission of anti-social behaviour.

Should a person who has previously been directed to leave the area return, an offence would be committed, which they may ultimately be arrested for.
