We have arrested and charged a Wirral man wanted in connection with the robbery in Birkenhead earlier this year.

At 12.45pm on Wednesday 20 February, two men approached a man in his 20s near to Birkenhead Park Train Station on Duke Street after allegedly arranging to sell him a bike. The victim was punched and cash and a phone stolen, before the suspects made off.

20-year-old Michael Medway from Priory Road on Seacombe was circulated as wanted in connection with the offence.

Yesterday, Medway was arrested and has now been charged with robbery. He was also charged with unauthorised taking of a motor vehicle and fraud by false representation in connection with separate offences.

He was remanded in custody to appear today (Friday 27 September) at Wirral Magistrates Court.
