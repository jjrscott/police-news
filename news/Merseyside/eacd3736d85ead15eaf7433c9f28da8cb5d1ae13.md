We have arrested a man and recovered fireworks and drugs in Rock Ferry this afternoon, Friday, 30 October.

At around 4pm, officers carried out a warrant at an address in King Street, and recovered a significant amount of fireworks, cannabis and suspected cocaine.

A 22-year-old man from Rock Ferry was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A and B drugs and conspiracy to commit criminal damage. He has been taken to a police station for questioning.

An investigation is ongoing and anyone with information is asked to get in touch.

Chief Inspector Peter Clark said: "A large amount of fireworks and drugs, both with the potential to cause extreme harm, have been seized this evening and thankfully prevented from reaching our streets.

"We will continue to act upon all information from the public throughout the Halloween and Bonfire Night period and will take robust action where necessary.

"If you have information on the illegal storage or use of fireworks, the supply of drugs, or criminality in your area, please get in touch. We want to keep our communities safe, and put those intent on causing fear and harm before the courts."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
