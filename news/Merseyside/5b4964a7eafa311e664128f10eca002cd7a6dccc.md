We are issuing CCTV images of a man we believe could have vital information about an attempted robbery at a petrol station in Fazakerley.

At about 9pm on 17 July, a man entered the BP garage with his face covered and attempted to assault staff with a wooden plank. He made demands for cash before making off empty-handed.

Officers attended and forensic examination of the scene has taken place, as well as CCTV enquiries in the local area.

Detective Inspector Sean Kelly-Martland said: "We would like to trace the man pictured in the CCTV as we believe he has information which could assist our investigation.

"While there were no reports of anyone injured during this incident, staff were left extremely shaken and we are determined to find out who is responsible and bring him to justice."

Anyone who recognises the man pictured or has any information is asked to contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police CC. You can also call 101 quoting incident reference 19100387593 or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
