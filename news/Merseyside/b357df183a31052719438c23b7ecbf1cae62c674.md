We are appealing for information after a man was stabbed in Old Swan on Tuesday, 14 January.

At around 10.20pm, it was reported that four men had entered Tan City on Prescot Road demanding money, car keys and attempting to steal the till, before the shop assistant was stabbed.

The offenders, described as wearing facial coverings, dark clothing and gloves, made off in a black Mondeo in the direction of Tesco (Old Swan).

The victim, a man in his 40's, was taken to hospital for treatment to a non-life threatening wound to his torso.

CCTV, forensic and witness enquiries are ongoing and anyone with information is asked to contact police.

Detective Sergeant Adam Dagnall said: "An investigation is underway following the stabbing and I would appeal to anyone with information to come forward.

"If you witnessed any suspicious behaviour in the area, a car fitting the description making off from the scene or have any CCTV or dashcam footage, please let us know.

"Knife crime is unacceptable and this must've been a terrifying ordeal for the victim, who, by sheer luck has not sustained any life-threatening injuries. We are determined to find those responsible and put them before the courts."

If you have any information, please contact @MerPolCC, 101 quoting ref. 20000030838 or @CrimestoppersUK, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
