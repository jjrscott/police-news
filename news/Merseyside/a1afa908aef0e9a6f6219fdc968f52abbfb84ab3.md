We are appealing for information after a serious collision in Storeton on Sunday morning (28 March).

Emergency services were called to Lever Causeway at about 11.20am where it was reported a black VW Golf had been in collision with a tree.

Police, Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service and the North West Ambulance Service attended, and the three occupants received medical attention at the scene.

The driver, a man in his 20s, has been taken to hospital for further treatment and his condition is described as critical but stable.

A road closure remains in place on Lever Causeway while police continue enquiries, and motorists are advised to seek alternatives routes.

Anyone who saw the incident or was passing and has any dashcam footage or information is asked to contact us via @MerPolCC on Twitter with reference 253 of 28 March.
