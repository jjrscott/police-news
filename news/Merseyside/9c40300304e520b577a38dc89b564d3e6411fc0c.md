We are investigating following a man died in a collision in St Helens last night (Wednesday 17 June).

At around 10.50pm, emergency services were called to the eastbound carriageway of the East Lancs Road, at its junction with Green Leach Lane, where it was reported there had been a collision involving a grey Hyundai Tucson car and an HGV that was stationary at traffic lights.

The driver of the Hyundai - an 81-year-old man - was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

His next of kin have been informed and are being supported by officers.

The driver of the HGV, a man in his 50s, was unharmed.

A section of the eastbound carriageway of the East Lancs Road, and Green Leach Lane was closed while emergency services dealt with the incident. All roads have since re-opened.

Inspector Stuart McIver from the Roads Policing Unit said: "Enquiries into this incident are ongoing and officers are studying CCTV footage to establish exactly what happened.

"We are appealing for anyone who may have witnessed any part of this incident to contact police.

"We would be particularly keen to hear from any drivers who were in the area of the East Lancs Road near the traffic lights at the Green Leach Lane junction at about 10.50pm and may have caught anything on dash cam. Please take a look at any footage and let us know if you have captured anything as it could assist our enquiries."

We would ask anyone who witnessed the collision to call our Roads Policing Unit on (0151) 7775747 or pass information on to us on Twitter via @MerPolCC.
