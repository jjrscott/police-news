We have arrested a 47 year old man from Lancashire for driving offences and possession of an offensive weapon.

Officers on patrol yesterday (25th Feb) spotted a grey VW Golf being driven dangerously on Muirhead Avenue just after 4:30pm. They attempted to stop the car but as the car slowed, the three passengers jumped out and ran off.

The driver was detained and arrested at the scene following a search of the car where officers recovered a knife in the passenger foot well.

The driver was also drugs tested which came back positive for cannabis and cocaine. The car was therefore seized and the man was taken to custody for questioning.

Anyone that was in the area at the time of the incident and has dashcam footage or that knows anything about the other three people should get in touch quoting crime ref: 21000123444.
