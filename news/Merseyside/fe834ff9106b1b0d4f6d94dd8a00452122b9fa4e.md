We have arrested a man following an assault in Liverpool City Centre this morning, Tuesday 8 September.

At 8.35am, officers were called to St George's Place to reports of an altercation involving two men. On attendance, a man in his 40s was found with a wound to his face and taken to hospital for treatment.

A 57-year-old man of no fixed abode was detained at around 8.45am in Lord Street. He has been arrested on suspicion of racially aggravated Section 18 wounding with intent and taken to a police station for questioning.

Detective Inspector Simon Hurst said: "At this stage it is unclear what caused the man's injuries but we're keen to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident, or a man running off towards Liverpool City Centre. Thankfully the victim's injuries are not life-threatening, although to be assaulted in such a way will have been extremely distressing.

"We also believe that the victim received racial abuse after the assault, and I'd be keen to speak to anyone who heard or saw the assault taking place.

"This appears to be an isolated incident and there is no threat to the wider public. Although a man is in custody, our enquiries in the area continue and we will act on all information provided."

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has CCTV or dashcam which may assist, is asked to contact us @MerPolCC with reference 20000541459. You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
