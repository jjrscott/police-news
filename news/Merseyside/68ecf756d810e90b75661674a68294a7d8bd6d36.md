Detectives are appealing for information following an assault in Liscard, Wirral on Monday, 31st August.

At 5pm, officers were called to Earlston Gardens on Earlston Road to reports of a 14-year-old boy being assaulted by a group of youths. A member of the public confronted the males, who made off on bikes in the direction of Seaview Road. The victim suffered facial injuries.

CCTV and witness enquiries are ongoing.

Detective Inspector Laura Lamping said: "This will have been a shocking incident to both experience and witness and our enquiries are continuing to find out who was responsible. Although the victim was thankfully only left with superficial injuries, the psychological impact is harder to measure. We will be ensuring the victim is supported as we continue to investigate.

"If you were in the area of Earlston Gardens around 5pm and saw what happened or a group of teenagers riding off on bikes, tell us what you know. Likewise, if you have any CCTV images or dashcam or know who may have been involved, let us know."

If you were in the area and saw or heard anything, or captured CCTV, dashcam or other footage of anyone acting suspiciously, please come forward with reference number 20000524887 via our social media desk on Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre'.

You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
