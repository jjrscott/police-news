A man has been jailed for an assault in Liverpool city centre on 9 December.

We had been made aware of a video circulating on social media which appeared to show a man being assaulted outside the Tesco Express store on Dale Street on the evening of Wednesday 9 December.

Following enquiries, we arrested Theo Maulba, 24, of no fixed address on Friday 11 December and charged him with Section 18 assault and possession of a Class B drug (spice) in connection with the incident.

The man who was assaulted was later located safe and well.

Maulba appeared at Liverpool complex case adult remand court today (Monday 14 December) where he was jailed for 16 weeks.

Detective Inspector Jennie Beck said: "We welcome today's sentencing, which has seen a very swift resolution to an incident which understandably caused a lot of concern and distress to anyone who saw the footage.

"Maulba will now spend the festive season and New Year behind bars, and I hope he spends that time thinking very hard about his behaviour that night, and the impact it has had.

"Thankfully the victim was not seriously hurt, but his actions appalled and upset so many.

"He is now in prison and safe from hurting anyone else so mindlessly on our streets."

Det Insp Beck added: "Many people these days carry camera phones, and thankfully when people have captured evidence of crime on their phone, or on CCTV or dashcam, they have submitted it to the police and helped bring justice for victims.

"I would like to take this opportunity to ask people to consider sending us any footage they think may assist investigations into an incident before sharing it online, and allow us to carry out enquiries."

You can send footage by direct message on Twitter @MerPolCC or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, or online via https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously.
