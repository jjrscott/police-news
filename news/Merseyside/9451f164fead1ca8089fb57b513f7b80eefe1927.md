We can confirm an investigation is underway following shots fired in Litherland on Tuesday night (29 December).

At around 10.35pm, officers were called to Harrington Road to reports of gunshots being heard. Evidence was found of shots having been fired, although no injuries were reported.

House-to-house, forensic and CCTV enquiries have been carried out in the area.

Detective Inspector Steve Ball said: "These are the early stages of our investigation so we're gathering information and keen to speak to anyone in the area who may have seen or heard this incident tonight. Firing a weapon in a residential area is incredibly reckless and thankfully nobody appears to have been injured.

"We will act on all information provided to find those responsible and remove them and their weapons from our communities."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police CC.
