We have introduced a Dispersal Zone in Everton Park this afternoon, Saturday, 28 November.

The order runs from 2.15pm today (Saturday) until 00:00am on Sunday, 29 November and officers will be in the area to provide a visible presence and deal with any incidents. It has been introduced as we believe people may gather unlawfully in the area.

The Dispersal Zone covers the area bounded as per the map and includes the area within: Hayworth street, Everton Road, Plumpton Street, Parkside Street, Gregson Street, Kinder Street, College Street North, Shaw Street, Prince Edwin Street, Great Homer Street, Buckingham Street, Conway Street, Netherfield Road North, Hapton Street, Dukes Road, York Terrace and Northumberland Terrace.

The order comes under Section 34 of the Anti-Social Behaviour & Policing Act 2014, which gives police officers and police community support traffic officers powers to direct people they suspect are causing or likely to cause crime, nuisance or anti-social behaviour to members of the public to leave a designated area and not return for up to 48 hours.

Under the legislation, officers have the power to seize any item, including vehicles, used in the commission of anti-social behaviour. Should a person who has previously been directed to leave the area return, an offence would be committed, which they may ultimately be arrested for.
