We are appealing for information after a large quantity of play equipment was stolen from a business in Bootle.

We were contacted on Tuesday 26th May following reports that unknown offenders had broken in and stolen inflatable equipment from Activity for All in Maguire Avenue, Bootle, between 1st April and 26th May.

The equipment included a number of distinctive bouncy castles.

Anyone who has seen any of the equipment or has been offered it for sale or rent is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 20000302812.
