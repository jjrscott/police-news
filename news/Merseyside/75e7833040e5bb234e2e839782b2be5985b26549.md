We're appealing for your help to trace the next of kin of a man that sadly passed away in the Liverpool area.

Mr Gordon Richards, 75, died at his home address on Keith Avenue, Liverpool on 20th April.

His death is not being treated as suspicious, however the Coroner's Investigation Office is now keen to find his next of kin.

Anyone who can help should call Elise Fahey 0151 233 0132 or email Elise.Fahey@Liverpool.gov.uk
