Detectives are appealing for information following a robbery in Huyton on Tuesday, 3 November.

At 3.40pm, officers were called to Lordens Road to a report of the male driver of a black Ford Transit van delivering parcels in the area, when a BMW pulled in front of the van. Two men exited the BMW and assaulted the van driver.

One of the men drove off in the van, followed by the BMW and a third vehicle. The victim was left shaken but not seriously injured.

The van was found on Southdean Road a short time later and forensically recovered. Parcels had been stolen.

Detective Inspector Tony O'Brien said: "We're keen to speak to anyone who witnessed this incident, which took place in broad daylight on a main road. If you live in the area and have home CCTV or were passing and have dashcam, we want to hear from you. For someone to be targeted as they carried out their work is disgraceful and we will be doing all in our power to bring those responsible to justice.

"At this time of year, there will of course be an increase in delivery drivers across Merseyside, and opportunist criminals may attempt to target them. If you are a delivery driver, there are a few things you can do to reduce this risk, including fitting a tracker, installing dashcam, and always locking your vehicle during deliveries. Be alert and report anything suspicious to us, and we will continue to investigate all such incidents."

Anyone with information on this incident is asked to contact @MerPolCC on Twitter, or 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook. with reference 20000667722, or call the independent charity @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111. You can also contact them via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information. Always call 999 if a crime is in progress.
