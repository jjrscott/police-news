We have today, Tuesday 18th February, welcomed the sentencing of two men following a cash-in-transit robbery in Wirral in March 2018.

At around 1.20pm on Saturday 31st March 2018 two cash-in-transit security guards were approached by two males at the Tesco Express store on Liscard Road in Wallasey. The two males made off with a cash box which was later recovered

Warren Mortimer (below), 35, of Church Street, Wallasey, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to rob and was jailed for 10 years.

Simon McCarthy (below), 28, of Falkland Road, Egremont, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to rob and possession with intent to supply Class B drugs and was jailed for a total of eight years.

A third man, Liam McCarthy, 22, also of Falkland Road, Egremont, pleaded guilty to being concerned in the supply of Class B drugs and was given a 12 month suspended sentence.

Detective Inspector Nick Suffield said: "I am pleased that Mortimer and McCarthy are now behind bars where they belong.

"Robberies such as this are not victimless crimes. Security guards have the right to go about their daily business without fear and Merseyside Police is committed to finding the people responsible for offences such as this and bringing them to justice."
