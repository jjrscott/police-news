We have this evening, Friday 11th December, arrested a 24 year-old man on suspicion of s18 assault following an incident in Liverpool city centre.

We were made aware of a video circulating on social media which appeared to show a man being assaulted outside the Tesco Express store on Dale Street on Wednesday night, 9th December.

The man who was assaulted was later located safe and well.

The 24 year-old, from the Liverpool area, has also been arrested on suspicion of theft of a bike, possession of a controlled drug, criminal damage and handling stolen goods.

He is currently in custody where he will be questioned by detectives.
