We have issued a CCTV image of a male we want to speak to after a woman had her purse and mobile phone snatched in Tranmere.

The incident happened at around 9.20pm on Saturday 29th August on Borough Road.

The woman suffered a sprained wrist during the incident. CCTV enquiries have been carried out in the local area.

We have issued a CCTV image of a male on a bike who was seen in the area of Borough Road on the same evening.

The male who is white, of slim build and around 5ft 7in tall was wearing a distinctive blue jacket and riding a red mountain bike.

We would like to speak to this male as we believe he could assist with our investigation.

Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 20000521621.
