We have arrested a man and are continuing to carry out enquiries following an incident in Beechwood this morning, Wednesday 11 November.

At around 11.30am, officers were called to St Oswald's Avenue to reports of a male allegedly in possession of a firearm. Armed officers, supported by the National Police Air Service (NPAS) helicopter, located a male in a nearby garden. The incident was stood down but local enquiries remain ongoing.

A 20-year-old man from Kensington was arrested on suspicion of possession of a firearm and breaching a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) and has been taken to a police station for questioning.

Anyone who witnessed the incident can call 101 or pass information via @MerPolCC with reference 262, or anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
