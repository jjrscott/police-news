Merseyside Police is appealing for information in relation to the death of Kevin McLeod 23 years ago.

Merseyside Police is reviewing the investigation, on behalf of Police Scotland, and with guidance from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.

Kevin had gone out with a friend for the evening in Wick, Caithness, on Friday, 7 February 1997 and was last seen in the early hours of Saturday, 8 February. He was found deceased in Wick Harbour, at 11am on Sunday, 9th February 1997.

Kevin is described as 5ft 9in tall, athletic build with short brown hair and he was clean shaven. He was wearing a black sweatshirt with LEVI written in white across the chest, blue denim jeans and black Caterpillar boots. He wasn't wearing a coat even though it was a very windy February night.

Anyone who has any information, that has not previously been provided that may be relevant to assist the review, is asked to contact Merseyside Police Online via this link https://public.digital-policing.co.uk/merseyside/appeal/merseyside-police-appeal-for-information-in-relation-to-the-death-of-kevin-mcleod by attaching a word document, or typing in the additional comments section, quoting reference 20000072215.
