We are appealing for information after shots were fired at a house in Seaforth last night, Wednesday 5 February.

At 8.40pm, it was reported that gunshots had been heard in Harrowby Road. Officers attended and damage consistent with a firearms discharge was found to the door of a property.

House to house, forensic and CCTV enquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances and community policing officers will be in the area to speak to local residents and offer reassurance.

Detective Inspector Sabi Kaur said: "Thankfully there are no reports of any injuries, however to fire a gun under any circumstances is reckless and unacceptable and we will be carrying out a number of enquires in the area to establish exactly what happened and who is responsible.

"I would encourage anyone with information to please contact us. Did you see any suspicious activity in the Harrowby Road area at around 8.40pm, witness anyone making off from the scene, or have any CCTV or dashcam footage? Any information could prove vital to the investigation, so please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC on Twitter, call 101 with crime reference 1001 of 5 February, or you can contact @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111.

You can also send information or dash cam footage directly to our investigation team via the following link https://public.digital-policing.co.uk/merseyside/appeal/20000078528
