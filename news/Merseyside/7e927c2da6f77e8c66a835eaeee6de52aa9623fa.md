We arrested a man and woman after two warrants were executed at neighbouring properties in Norris Green yesterday (Thursday 26 September 2019).

Local Policing Teams carried out the warrants on Thursday morning and conducted a search of the houses.

Officers recovered a holdall containing heroin and cocaine, and seized cannabis from the kitchen and garden. Drugs paraphilia, cash and a stolen electric bike were also located.

A 35-year-old man from Newsham Park was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs, possession of a Class B controlled drug, cultivation of cannabis, handling stolen goods and possession of criminal property.

A 25-year-old woman from Norris Green was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs (cocaine and heroin), production of cannabis, theft and possession of criminal property.

They have been released under investigation and enquiries continue.

Targeted Policing Chief Inspector Steve Brizell said: "Every drug we seize prevents criminals from profiting from the exploitation of vulnerable people, and hits offenders in the pocket, where it hurts.

"We will continue to carry out warrants, and conduct stop searches and road checks to disrupt those criminals intent on bringing harm to our communities.

"Information from the community is a vital part of our efforts to combat people involved in the storing and sale of illicit drugs.
