Matrix and British Transport Police officers have recovered a firearm and a large quantity of ammunition following a search of a railway embankment in north Liverpool.

A search was conducted of the embankment close to Orphan Drive/Newsham Park in Tuebrook on Monday afternoon, 14th December.

During the search a large quantity of 260 Remington ammunition, a small quantity of what is believed to be revolver ammunition and a black stun gun were recovered.

A further search of the area was carried out yesterday and a handgun was recovered.

All the finds have been recovered for forensic examination and enquiries remain ongoing.

Detective Chief Inspector Matt Smith, from the Firearm Investigation Team, said: "The searches were carried out as result of intelligence we received in relation to ammunition being stored in the area.

"These recoveries show the importance of searching areas of open land regardless of where this may be. The recoveries will also prevent further firearms offences being committed on the streets of Merseyside."

Anyone with information on where firearms or ammunition is being stored is asked to contact Merseyside Police via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police CC, on 101 or the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
