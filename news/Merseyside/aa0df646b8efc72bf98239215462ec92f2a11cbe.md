We would like to remind people that under the COVID restrictions put in place on Thursday, 5 November, that gatherings (including protests) are not allowed during the lockdown period as gatherings pose a risk to public health.

Chief Superintendent Paul White, said: "We respect and support the right of people to demonstrate, but the current COVID-19 situation means that gatherings pose a risk to public health and now is not the time.

"For this reason, if you are thinking about holding a demonstration or protest then we strongly advise you to reconsider and think about other ways of making your voice heard. This could include, for example, using social media or holding a virtual event

"We will take action against any Individuals, or businesses, who fail to adhere to the current restrictions and are putting other people at risk."
