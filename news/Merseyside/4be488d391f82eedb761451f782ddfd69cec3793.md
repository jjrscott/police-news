Detectives are appealing for witnesses following a stabbing in the Anfield area last night, Tuesday 10 September.

At 10pm, emergency services were called to Sleepers Hill to reports of a man in his 30s having been stabbed by unknown men. He was taken to hospital for treatment to non life-threatening wounds to his arm, buttocks and leg.

The victim has discharged himself from hospital and is not co-operating with enquiries.

CCTV, forensic and witness enquiries continue this morning and detectives want to hear from anyone with information.

Detective Chief Inspector Cheryl Rhodes said: "We are still piecing together what happened last night and so urgently need to hear from anyone who was in the area and saw or has since heard anything. This initially appears to be a targeted attack, and thankfully the victim was not more seriously injured, but this is through luck alone.

"We think the suspects exited a dark car, possibly a VW, prior to the assault, so if you saw such a car near to Sleepers Hill around 10pm, get in touch. Home CCTV, dashcam or descriptions could be vital to our investigations.

"Knife crime devastates families and communities, both of victims and offenders. We are determined to find those responsible and remove them and their weapons from the streets."

Anyone with information can contact @MerPolCC or 101 with reference 19100512820 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
