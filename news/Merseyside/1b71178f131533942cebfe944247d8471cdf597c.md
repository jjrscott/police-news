Officers are appealing to the public for their help to find 32 year old Michael Lyons from Liverpool.

We'd like to speak to Michael in connection with a series of firearms offences as we believe he could have crucial information to help with ongoing investigations.

He is described as white, having fair hair, blue eyes and around 5ft8.

Michael's last known address was Kirk Street in Liverpool but we have had no luck finding him there.

Anyone that knows where he is or how we can get in contact with him should DM us @MerPolCC or you can get in touch anonymously via @CrimestoppersUK quoting ref: 19100322591
