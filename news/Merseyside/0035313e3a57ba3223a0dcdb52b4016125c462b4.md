Officers from our Roads Policing Unit are appealing for information following a fail to stop road traffic collision in Liverpool City Centre in December.

At around 4am on Monday 16 December, a woman in her 20s was leaning into a private hire taxi on Ranelagh Street when the driver made off, causing the victim to fall and break her leg.

The taxi is described as a grey Toyota RAV4, although CCTV and witness enquiries have so far been negative in identifying the vehicle or driver.

Roads Policing Inspector Stuart McIver said: "This was a serious incident which left the victim with a broken leg, and has caused her understandable distress.

"So far, our extensive CCTV and witness enquiries have unfortunately proved negative. We're therefore asking to speak to anyone who was passing or has heard any information since to come forward.

"Other vehicles will have in the area at this time, potentially including other taxis. If you have dashcam, CCTV or other footage and can provide a vehicle registration or anything else, let us know and we will take action."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or report online at https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously with reference 19100733437.
