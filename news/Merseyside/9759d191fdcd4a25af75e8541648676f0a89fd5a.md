Detectives are appealing for information after cars were damaged outside HMP Liverpool in Walton last night, Monday 21 October.

At 10.15pm, officers were called to HMP Liverpool on Hornby Road to reports of a white Audi pulling up outside, the occupants of which exited the car and threw bricks at parked cars, causing damage. Damage was also caused to a window of the building itself. The car made off in the direction of Rice Lane.

Enquiries are ongoing, including CCTV and vehicle checks, to identify the car and those responsible.

Detective Inspector Paul Nilsen said: "Our enquiries are ongoing to find this vehicle and identify those responsible. This was a despicable act of criminal damage which has caused distress and inconvenience to all of those affected, and we will be working closely alongside the prison to investigate.

"If you live locally to Hornby Road or Rice Lane or were passing by and noticed a white Audi driving at speed shortly after 10.15pm last night, check your home CCTV or vehicle dashcam and let us know. Any footage or sightings could be vital in finding those involved."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC or 101 with reference 1116 of 21 October, or you can pass information anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
