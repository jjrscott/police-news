A man and a woman have been sentenced following two dog attacks in Maghull in October.

At around 4pm on Friday 30 October 2020, two Saint Bernard dogs were reported to have escaped from their home address on Kenyon's Lane, Maghull.

While out, the dogs were reported to have attacked two dog owners and their dogs, in separate incidents, causing injury to both dogs and owners.

On Thursday 3 December, police executed a warrant and seized both St Bernard Dogs. Their owners, Gary Needham, 53, and Jeanette Storey, 52, of Kenyon's Lane Maghull, were interviewed by police and charged with eight counts of Having a Dog Dangerously Out of Control.

They appeared at Sefton Magistrates Court on Wednesday 13 January 2021 and pleaded guilty to all counts.

Earlier this month, Needham and Storey were sentenced to 16 weeks curfew, compensation to the victims and have been disqualified from having custody of a dog for 5 years.

Both dogs will also be destroyed.
