Detectives are investigating following an incident of sexual touching in Speke last Friday, 31 July.

At around 4pm, officers were called to David Lloyd Leisure Centre at Speke Aerodrome to reports of a disturbance between two men. Following enquiries, it was established that a few minutes earlier, a man had approached a woman sunbathing on grass near to the swimming pool, touched her inappropriately and whispered in her ear.

The suspect was challenged by members of the public and an altercation broke out between the suspect and a second man, before the suspect made off. Enquiries are ongoing to locate this man. He is described as white with a tan, of medium build, 5ft 9in tall, bald or shaved head, and wearing swimming trunks.

Detective Inspector Amy Smith said: "The victim was understandably left shaken and distressed by this incident, and we're determined to track down the man responsible and put him before the courts. If you were at the leisure centre last Friday, saw what happened and have yet to come forward, please do so.

"Thankfully other people at the location intervened to prevent further escalation, but this will still have been a traumatic experience, and we're supporting the victim at this time.

"We're reviewing any CCTV footage and if you were parked at the location and may have captured such a person making off on dashcam, please check as identifying his vehicle could also be key to this investigation."

Please pass any information with reference 20000453387 via our social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre'.
