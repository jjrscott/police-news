Detectives are urging car owners to be vigilant when de-icing their vehicles after a car was stolen in Whiston yesterday morning (Tuesday 9 February).

Shortly after 8am, officers were called to a house on Skeffington after it was reported an unknown offender had stolen a Black Nissan Qashqai. The vehicle had been left unattended with its engine running while its owner was de-icing the windows.

It is reported that the offender was a man in his 40s wearing a grey hoodie, who drove off in the direction of Pennywood Drive.

Following enquiries, officers from our Roads Policing Unit recovered the stolen vehicle at around 8.40am on Dursley, Whiston.

Constable Joshua Smith said: "We are urging car owners to be extra vigilant in the cold weather when de-icing their vehicle. Thieves are opportunists who will take advantage of a any situation - however brief those moments may seem.

"Thankfully this car owner was reunited with their vehicle shortly after this incident, but it still caused a great deal of understandable distress and worry.

"It serves as a stark reminder to all car owners in Merseyside: please don't leave your car unattended while the engine is running."
