We are appealing for help to locate a 24-year-old Bootle man we believe could have information about an assault earlier this year.

Detectives want to speak to Michael Christopher McDonagh as it is believed he may have information about an assault in Bootle on 21 May 2019.

Officers were called to Stand Park Avenue, close to our Lady of Walsingham social club, shortly before 6pm where it was reported a man in his 20s had been assaulted by another man. The victim, a 29-year-old man, was treated in hospital for a slash wound to the back.

Michael McDonagh is described as white, 5ft 9in tall, with ginger hair, often has a ginger beard, and is described as having a medium to large build. He has blue eyes.

Anyone who has seen him or knows of his whereabouts is asked to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 quoting incident reference 19100258449 or contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
