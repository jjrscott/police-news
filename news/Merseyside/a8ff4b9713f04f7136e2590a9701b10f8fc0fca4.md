We are appealing for help in locating the next of kin of a 69 year-old man who passed away in hospital.

Paul Howes, from Dingle Lane, Liverpool, sadly passed away on Tuesday 28th July.

There are no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death.

It is believed Mr Howes may have links to the Slough area.

Anyone who knows Mr Howes' next of kin or can assist is asked to email HMCoroner@liverpool.gov.uk or ring Jacqueline Gallagher on 0151 233 0413.
