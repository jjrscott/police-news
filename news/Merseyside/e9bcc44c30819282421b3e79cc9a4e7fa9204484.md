Detectives in Liverpool are welcoming the drug supply sentencing of a Kirkdale man at Liverpool Crown Court.

33-year-old Jonathan Naylor of Crocus Street was sentenced to three years and four months following a warrant in July. On Friday 3 July, a warrant in Crocus Street led to the seizure of large quantities of cocaine, heroin and cannabis. Naylor pleaded guilty and was sentenced on Friday 23 October.

Speaking after the sentencing, Detective Constable Nick Glascott-Tull said: "It is pleasing to see Naylor removed from the streets and I hope this deters others from drug supply, which causes significant harm within our communities. We have regular success in carrying out such warrants, in no small part to information from those who live in the area.

"If you suspect that drugs are being stored or supplied, you can come forward directly to police or anonymously through the independent charity Crimestoppers. We will keep taking positive action on all information you pass on."

You can pass information via our social media desk @MerPolCC on Twitter or 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook. You can also pass information via the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information. Always call 999 if a crime is in progress.
