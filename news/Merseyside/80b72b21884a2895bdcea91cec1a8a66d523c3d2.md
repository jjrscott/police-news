Last night (13th Dec), our #OpTarget team in Speke arrested a 34 year old man on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A and B drugs as well as production of cannabis after a warrant was executed at an address on Sutton Wood Road.

Officers had received information that suggested drugs and cash were being kept at the address, so at around 10pm they forced entry into the house and detained the man.

During a search, around 21 cannabis plants were located in the shed as well as four large sealed bags of cannabis and a large amount of white powder, suspected as cocaine.

The man was taken to custody where he spent the night and remains at this time.
