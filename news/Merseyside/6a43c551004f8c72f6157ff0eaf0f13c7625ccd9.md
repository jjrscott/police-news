We're appealing for information following a fatal road traffic collision in Tuebrook this evening, Tuesday, 1 December.

Shortly before 7pm, officers were called to Lisburn Lane following reports of a collision involving a Ford Fiesta and a pedestrian.

Emergency services attended and the pedestrian, a man in his 50's, was taken to hospital where he was sadly pronounced dead a short time later.

The driver of the car stopped at the scene and is assisting with enquiries. Officers are working to formally identify the man and inform his next of kin.

Road closures remain in place and anyone who witnessed the incident is asked to come forward.

Chief Inspector Col Rooney said: "Tragically a man has lost his life following a road traffic collision in Tuebrook this evening, and an investigation is underway to establish the exact circumstances.

"If you were in the area and witnessed the collision, or have any CCTV or dashcam footage, please let us know as it may assist our enquiries."

Anyone with information is asked to contact the Roads Policing Unit on 0151 777 5747, @MerPolCC or 101 quoting ref. 20000730961. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
