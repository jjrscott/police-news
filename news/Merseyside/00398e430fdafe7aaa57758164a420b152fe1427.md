Officers have fined 14 people who breached Coronavirus restrictions by attending a house party in Fairfield in the early hours of this morning (Friday, 5 March).

Shortly after 1am, police were called by members of the public who were concerned that a party was being held at the address on Prescot Drive.

Officers attended the house, where a large gathering was taking place inside. It is reported that a machete was thrown at police from an upstairs window, and a large number of people made off from inside the property.

Evidence of drug use was found inside the house, and a diary of 'party flat' bookings was seized by police.

A total of 14 people were issued with fixed penalty notices for breach of Covid-19 legislation.

Chief Inspector Chris Barnes said: "Unfortunately, the message still hasn't got through to some people about the danger Coronavirus poses to our communities in Merseyside.

"The brazen nature of these people is astounding - as is their selfishness to continue as 'normal', despite the sacrifices being made by the majority to help bring Covid numbers down and save lives.

"It is simple - a house party could mean that someone loses a loved one or a family member to Coronavirus in a few weeks' time. It is also likely to increase the pressure on our already stretched healthcare services.

"We will continue to take action where people are flouting the restrictions, because the safety of vulnerable people in Merseyside and our healthcare workers should be everyone's priority.

"We now have a roadmap out of restrictions, but rules remain in place and restrictions will only be lifted if everyone plays their part.

"In order to return to normality as soon as possible, I would appeal to our communities to adhere to the guidance and show respect to those on the front line who are dealing with the precarious Public Health situation."
