 We have charged a 18 year-old male with attempted GBH and making threats with an offensive weapon following an incident in Old Swan.

At around 11.15pm on Tuesday 23rd June two 20 year-old males were skateboarding close to Killarney Road when they were reportedly chased and threatened by a male armed with a kitchen knife. Their skateboards were also taken.

Both males suffered only superficial injuries during the incident.

Stephen Bennett, of Galemeade, Croxteth, has been charged with two counts of attempted GBH, two counts of making threats with an offensive weapon and two counts of theft from a person. He appeared in court yesterday, Thursday 25th June, and was remanded into custody to appear in court on 23rd July.
