As the weekend approaches, we are again urging our communities to stay at home to protect loved ones and prevent the spread of coronavirus.

With less than a week left of a month-long national lockdown, it's crucial that we abide by the rules for short time longer, before they change slightly when Merseyside is placed into Tier 2 next Wednesday, 2 December.

Currently any gatherings, including protests, should not be taking place and, in line with restrictions, people should not be making unnecessary travel journeys or meeting with groups of people outside their household or social bubble.

Over the weekend, officers across Merseyside will continue to target anyone flouting the rules and those involved in illegal gatherings.

Superintendent Chris Gibson said: "The overwhelming majority of people in Merseyside have done the right thing over the past few weeks and months, by complying with government guidance and in turn protecting their loved ones.

"We know how challenging these times are for everyone and we would like to thank those that continue to abide by the rules, it is greatly appreciated and doesn't go unnoticed.

"However, we know there is a minority that have chosen to ignore the restrictions, and I want to make it clear that we won't tolerate this. Not only is it unlawful, but it puts the health of others at risk, and we will continue to take action against those who flout the rules, using enforcement where necessary.

"I want to appeal to our communities to adhere to the guidance, and seriously reconsider before heading out anywhere this weekend that contravenes the restrictions. We continue to see a reduction in cases across Merseyside and it's vital that we don't undo all that hard work now. By all following the rules, we are doing our bit to keep our families, friends, vulnerable people in Merseyside and our key healthcare workers safe."

You can report any matters concerning COVID-19 and the current legislation to us @MerPolCC or through Merseyside Police's website https://www.merseyside.police.uk/.
