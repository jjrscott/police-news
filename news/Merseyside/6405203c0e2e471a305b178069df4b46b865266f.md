We can confirm that officers are investigating following graffiti found at a pub in Old Swan, reported yesterday, Friday 17 July.

At around 8pm, we were called to the Glasshouse on Mill Lane to reports of graffiti on the outside walls. CCTV and witness enquiries are ongoing.

Chief Inspector Col Rooney said: "Graffiti of this nature causes stress and inconvenience to businesses and residents, and we strongly condemn any messages which have the potential to incite hatred in our communities.

"We're keen to hear from anyone who saw anyone carrying out this criminal damage, or anyone who has seen, heard or recorded disturbances or anti-social behaviour near to this premises in recent days. Our enquiries are ongoing and we'll act on any information received to find those responsible."

Anyone with information is asked to contact us via @MerPolCC, 101 or call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111, or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information, providing reference number 1062 of July 17.
