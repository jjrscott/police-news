We have issued CCTV images of a man we want to trace following an attempted robbery in Walton.

At around 8.30pm on Wednesday 26th August a man and a wife were at the junction of Elm Road and Walton Village when they were approached by an unknown male. The male claimed to have a knife and made demands for money.

The victim was able to fend off the man before escaping in his car.

The couple were not injured but were left shaken by their ordeal.

We have issued CCTV images of a man we would like to trace as we believe he has information which could assist with our investigation.

Anyone who recognises the man or has any information about his whereabouts is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 20000515079.
