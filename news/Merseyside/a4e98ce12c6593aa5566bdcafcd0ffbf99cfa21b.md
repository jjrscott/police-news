Officers in Hoylake are introducing a Dispersal Zone this weekend as part of a continued response to reports of anti-social behaviour and nuisance in the area.

The Dispersal Zone covers the area shown on the map, and will last 48 hours, from 4pm on Friday 11 September to 4pm on Sunday 13 September.

Any persons aged 10 or over in a public place in this locality and has contributed or is likely to contribute to behaviour, which would cause members of the public in that locality, harassment alarm or distress may be directed to leave that area for a period of 48 hours. Should a person who has previously been directed to leave the area return, an offence would be committed, which they may ultimately be arrested for.

Community Policing Inspector Paul Harrison said: "Recently, we have been called to reports of youths gathering, cycling dangerously at traffic, running across the road and causing damage to vehicles, property and to play equipment in Queens Park. This behaviour causes distress and upset to those affected, and will simply not be tolerated.

"We're working closely with local councillors, businesses and residents on a daily basis to deal with these issues. However, I must also appeal directly to parents and guardians to keep taking responsibility for knowing the whereabouts of young people in their care. Do you know where they are and what they are doing? It's absolutely vital, especially with restrictions in place and rising Covid-19 case numbers, that large groups do not gather for any reason, and especially when it has an adverse impact on the lives of those locally. We all have a duty to protect each other, both from the pandemic, and from the harm caused by anti-social behaviour.

"This Dispersal Zone is not about bothering people going about their legitimate daily business, but an appropriate response to incidents and concerns raised in the community. It gives us the powers we need to deal effectively with people involved, and I would urge anyone in the area with any information about anti-social behaviour, nuisance or criminal activity in the area to make contact."

Anyone who wishes to report anti-social or criminal behaviour can contact 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. call 999 in an emergency. You can also follow @WirralPolice on Twitter and Facebook for updates and advice.
