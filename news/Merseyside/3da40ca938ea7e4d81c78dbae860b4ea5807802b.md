We are appealing for help in tracing the next of kin of a 45-year-old man who passed away in Liverpool.

Mark Fenton died on Thursday 26th March at his home in Blackburn Place, Liverpool City Centre.

His death is not being treated as suspicious.

Mr Fenton's father - Dave Fenton - was last known to be residing in Kirkby but has not been traced.

Anyone who can help is asked to contact Nicola Griffiths, Coroner's Investigation Officer, on 0151 233 0143.
