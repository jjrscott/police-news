We have seized a cannabis farm worth around £200,000 following a warrant in Wallasey yesterday, Thursday 9 October.

At around 1.15pm, officers carried out a warrant at a flat on Rake Lane leading to around 50 cannabis plants being seized in four rooms.

The electrical meter had been tampered with, and the location was made safe. Enquiries are ongoing to locate the occupants, in addition to CCTV and forensic enquiries.

Matt Brown, Manager of our Cannabis Dismantling Team (CDT), said: "This location is another example of homes being turned into a potential death trap for anyone the misfortune to live nearby. The meter had been crudely tampered with and could easily have caused devastation to neighbouring residents and businesses.

"Nobody wants to live next door to a magnet for fire, flood and serious violent crime so keep giving us information and we will take positive action to keep your streets safe."

Some of the signs that cannabis is being grown are:

• Strange smells and sounds
• Frequent and varied visitors to a property, often at unusual times
• Gardening equipment being taken into a property, such as plant pots, fertiliser, fans and industrial lighting
• Windows are sealed and covered or the curtains are permanently closed
• Heat from an adjoining property
• Birds gathering on a roof in cold weather
• Individually these activities may seem commonplace, however, together may indicate something more sinister

Anyone with information on suspected cannabis growing in their community can contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or come forward anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 and we will do the rest.
