We arrested two men after a man was assaulted in Whiston on Friday night (24 April 2020).

Officers were called to Cook Street after it was reported a 55-year-old man had suffered cuts to the head after being struck with an unknown implement during an altercation inside a property. He received treatment in hospital and was later discharged.

Two men, aged 32 and 34, both from St Helens were arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and causing actual bodily harm. They have been taken into custody for questioning.

Detective Inspector Yoseph Al-Ramadhan said: "Our enquiries into this incident are at an early stage but we believe the victim and suspects were known to eachother.

"We have conducted house to house enquiries in the area and questioning two men in relation to this incident, but if anyone has any information that might help us understand exactly what took place last night, I would ask them to contact us."
