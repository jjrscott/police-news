Members of the public are being urged to only contact our non-emergency 101 number when it is a police matter.

Since Prime Minister Boris Johnson broadcast details of the lockdown to the nation last night we have seen an influx of calls to our force contact centre.

While many of them are police-related matters an increasing number don't fit the criteria.

Examples include:

 * 'Can I go out and buy the kids Easter eggs?'

 * 'Can I go to church to practice the organ?'

 * 'I am moving house tomorrow. Can I still do this?'

 * 'I have bought a bed on ebay. Can I go and collect it?'

Chief Superintendent Claire Richards said: "We understand that we are currently in new and challenging times and people have genuine worries but the Force contact centre should not be used by people wanting to ask questions about Covid19.

"We are an emergency service who are here to deal with police-related matters. I would urge people to think before they pick up the phone. They could be blocking the line for someone who genuinely needs to speak to us.

"Anyone wishing to access the latest government information should go to https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus

"People can also use our website to contact us in a non-emergency. By going to www.merseyside.police.uk and clicking on the 'report' tab it is possible to report a crime, antisocial behaviour, fraud, lost or found property, a road traffic incident, a missing person, civil disputes and lost or stolen vehicles

"There is also information and advice available on the website in relation to firearms licensing, registering as an overseas visitor, or reporting suspicious behaviour.

"Our social media desk - which is staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week - is also available to take non-emergency reports. You can DM them via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre'.

"I would always ask people to dial 999 in an emergency situation."
