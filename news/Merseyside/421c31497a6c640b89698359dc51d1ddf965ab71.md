Detectives in Liverpool are appealing for information following a ram raid burglary in Old Swan last night, Monday 8 February.

At around 11.30pm, officers were called to Kathryns Clothes Shop on Prescot Road to reports of a vehicle ramming the front of the premises.

Damage was caused to the exterior and interior, and stock was stolen. The vehicle, a blue Honda CRV, was forensically recovered from the scene for examination. Officers remain at the location this morning to carry out continued enquiries.

Detective Inspector Paul Jones said: "We're keen to hear from anyone who saw this incident, or captured it or the vehicle in question in or around the area at 11.30 last night. Your CCTV, dashcam or other information could be the key to finding those responsible.

"For a local business to be targeted in this callous way is just awful, and we're supporting the owner as enquiries continue. It has caused damage, inconvenience and massive distress to a shop in our community which, like all businesses, is going through a hard enough time already. Come forward if you know anything and we will take action."
