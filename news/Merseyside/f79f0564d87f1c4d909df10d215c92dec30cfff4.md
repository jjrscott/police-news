Original statement:

We have arrested a woman and are appealing for information following a serious injury road traffic collision in Sefton this morning, Sunday 27 September.

At around 8.45am, emergency services were called to Lunt Road in Sefton Village, near to The Punchbowl, to reports of a woman cyclist in her 30s being found seriously injured in the road, believed to have been due to a collision with a vehicle.

She was taken to hospital by ambulance and is currently described as being in a critical condition. Her family has been made aware and are being supported by officers.

Enquiries are ongoing at the scene and road closures remain in place as we establish the circumstances.

A 23-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and failing to stop after a road traffic accident. She remains in custody at the time of writing.

Anyone who saw this incident, lives locally and has CCTV or dashcam, is asked to contact us via our Roads Policing Unit on (0151) 7775747, or pass information via our social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police CC with reference 20000585062.
