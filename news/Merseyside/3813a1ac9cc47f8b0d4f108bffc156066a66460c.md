Merseyside Police have discovered a cannabis farm this morning (30th March) above a shop in Liverpool.

Officers attended the flat on Childwall Valley Road after members of the local community raised concerns. Inside they found two 'growing rooms' with approximately 125 plants, both mature and some that had been cropped, worth around Â£500,000.

The electricity supply had also been tampered with but has since been made safe. Unfortunately no one was at the property and so no arrests have yet been made.

Sgt Burrell said "We are currently undertaking forensic analysis to work out who is responsible for the farm.

"We are thankful for the support we have already received by the shop owners and surrounding community and hope we can quickly identify those responsible.

"Tampering with electricity and being involved in the production of drugs puts others at considerable risk.

"Anyone that knows the owner of this farm should contact us quoting crime reference: 20000189825 or has any other information on those involved in drug crime should get in touch via social media or call CrimestoppersUK anonymously."
