Detectives in St Helens are appealing for information following the assault of two men last night, Monday 14 September.

Shortly after 8.15pm, officers were called to Crab Street by the ambulance service to reports of two men in their 30s being assaulted. Both victims were located with serious injuries to their legs and body, caused by unknown weapons.

They were both taken away by ambulance and are currently being treated in hospital.

CCTV and witness enquiries are being carried out.

Detective Inspector Jackie Guinness said: "At this early stage, it is unclear what happened but we initially believe that this was a targeted attack. If you saw or heard anything last night on Crab Street, be that the incident itself or any suspicious behaviour around 8.15pm, let us know and we will take positive action to find those involved.

"Likewise, if you live locally and may have captured something on CCTV or dashcam, check and tell us, what you hold could be vital to our investigation."

Pass information via our social media desk on Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' with reference 20000557024. Always call 999 if a crime is in progress.
