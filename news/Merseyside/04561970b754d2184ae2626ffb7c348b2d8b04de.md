We are appealing for witnesses after reports a man was assaulted in Anfield in the early hours of this morning, Thursday 3rd October.

Police received a call from ambulance crews at 2.10am. Patrols attended the area and a member of the public informed them that he had seen a male lying on the street outside a house on Faraday Street with a serious facial/head injury. The man had then walked off along Breck Road.

A short time later a further call was made by a woman who stated that her son had come home, to an address nearby, covered in blood. Patrols attended and the 54 year-old man told officers he had been attacked with a bladed weapon.

He is currently in hospital where he is being treated for his injury.

An investigation is underway and CCTV and house-to-house enquiries have been carried out in the local area.

Detective Inspector Sabi Kaur said: "I would appeal to anyone who was in the Breck Road/Faraday Street area in the early hours of this morning who saw anyone or anything suspicious to contact us.

"At this stage we believe the man was assaulted as he walked home after a night out. He suffered a considerable injury and remains in hospital.

"I would appeal to anyone who has any information to get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC or call 101 or @Crimestoppers anonymously quoting reference 19100570543.
