We have arrested a man and are appealing for information following a serious RTC in New Brighton last night, Sunday 14 March.

At around 8.50pm, emergency services were called to the junction of Victoria Road and Rowson Street to reports of a collision involving a Vauxhall Corsa and a Mercedes.

A male and female were taken to hospital for assessment of serious injuries. A 26-year-old man from Chester has been arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.

The road was reopened at around 5.50am. Our investigation is ongoing.

Inspector Stuart McIver from our Roads Policing Unit said: "If you were in the area and witnessed this collision or may have captured details on home CCTV, dashcam or other information, please let us know. Any small detail could be key to finding out exactly what happened."
