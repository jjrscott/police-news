We arrested a man and recovered two handguns after the search of a flat in Huyton yesterday (Wednesday 18 September 2019).

At around 3pm, officers carried out the warrant at the property on Primrose Drive.

Officers forensically recovered two firearms, ammunition, and drugs during the search.

A 49-year-old man from Huyton was arrested on suspicion of possession of a Section 1 firearm and possession with intent to supply a Class A drug (cocaine). He was taken to a police station to be interviewed and remains in custody.

Detective Inspector Tony O'Brien said: "Whenever firearms and drugs are seized it strikes a blow to those criminals who bring fear and violence into the heart of our communities.

"These two weapons are now out of circulation and cannot be used to threaten or cause injury or worse on our streets.

"I hope this action serves as a reminder to people who attempt to store or conceal firearms that we will use all available tactics to find those weapons and bring the people responsible to justice."

Anyone with information on where firearms are being stored is asked to contact Merseyside Police via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police CC, on 101 or the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information. In an emergency, always call 999.
