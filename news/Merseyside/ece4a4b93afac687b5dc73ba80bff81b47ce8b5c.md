We have introduced a Dispersal Zone in Liverpool city centre today, Thursday, 25 February.

The order runs from 3pm today until 14:59pm on Saturday, 27 February on Wednesday 30 December and officers will be in the area to provide a visible presence and deal with any incidents.

The Dispersal Zone covers the area bounded in the map and includes St Johns Lane, St George's Place, Lime Street, Ranelagh Street, Hanover Street, Canning Place, Strand, Brunswick Street, Cook Street and Victoria Street.

The order comes under Section 34 of the Anti-Social Behaviour & Policing Act 2014, which gives police officers and police community support traffic officers powers to direct people they suspect are causing or likely to cause crime, nuisance or anti-social behaviour to members of the public to leave a designated area and not return for up to 48 hours.

Under the legislation, officers have the power to seize any item, including vehicles, used in the commission of anti-social behaviour.

Should a person who has previously been directed to leave the area return, an offence would be committed, which they may ultimately be arrested for.
