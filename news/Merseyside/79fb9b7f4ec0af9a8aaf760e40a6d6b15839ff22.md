A 49 year-old man who was wanted on recall to prison has been arrested at Liverpool John Lennon Airport.

Officers attended at the airport at 12.20am today, Tuesday 7th July, and detained Mark Anthony Fitzgibbon.

Fitzgibbon, who is originally from the Liverpool area, was convicted of conspiring to supply Class B Drugs in 1999 at Teesside Crown Court and sentenced to eight years imprisonment. He was recalled to prison in 2004.

A spokesperson for Merseyside Police said: "We know Fitzgibbon was abroad for a while but like many fugitives he wrongly believed he could evade capture.

"There is no safe haven for fugitives and time is no barrier to the pursuit of justice.

"We will continue to work closely with our law enforcement partners across the world to pursue these individuals."
