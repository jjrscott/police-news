We are sharing crime prevention advice and reminding the public to look out for members of the community that may be at risk to scammers due to the current coronavirus situation.

As the elderly and vulnerable self-isolate, a number of incidents have been reported across the country involving criminals using coronavirus as an opportunity to take advantage of people's worries.

We would encourage you to share the below advice with your loved ones to prevent scammers over the upcoming weeks and months.

Local Policing Chief Superintendent, Matt Boyle said: "Although this is a time when the majority of people are pulling together and taking care of the elderly and vulnerable, incidents have been reported which involve criminals exploiting coronavirus for financial gain.

"Incidents such as phishing scams, bogus callers or doorstep scams have been reported, and I would encourage anyone with elderly or vulnerable family members, friends or neighbours, to advise them to remain vigilant share the below tips with them.

"We take all reports of fraud extremely seriously and we never want it to get to the stage where someone has fallen victim to scammers, so being alert and following safety advice is important for all.

Fraud prevention advice:

•Remember to close and lock the back door before answering the front door
• Always ask to see the identification of the person calling
• If you are in any doubt about the identification shown, phone the company they claim to represent and check - don't use the phone number they give you, look in the phone book for it

•Don't accept help from anyone charging for their services
•Don't give your bank card or pin number out
• Ask the person to wait outside while you check and never leave your front door open while you do so
• If the caller claims to be from the police he/she should have a warrant card and this can be checked by calling Merseyside Police on 101
• If the caller leaves and you are still unsure about their credibility, write down the details of the person and the registration number and type and colour of vehicle if you know it and contact us on 101
•Don't click on links or attachments in suspicious emails
•Do not respond to unsolicited messages asking for personal/financial information

If you suspect someone may be trying to scam you, report it to the police on 101 or call 999 in an emergency. Further fraud crime prevention advice can be found on the Merseyside Police website, or on the Action Fraud site at www.actionfraud.police.uk.
