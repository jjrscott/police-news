Officers are currently in St Helens following reports of a burglary in the early hours of this morning (4th May).

We were called to Parr Stock Road at around 3:30am following reports that a house had been broken into and a 36 year old man had been assaulted and another had been stabbed.

Two men are believed to have made off towards Ramford Street but were detained by officers a short time after. One was arrested on suspicion of burglary whilst the other, who had reportedly suffered a stab wound to his stomach, was taken to hospital.

Officers attended the address where five other men were arrested on suspicion of Section 18 wounding and taken to custody for questioning.

The man who was assaulted inside the house was also taken to hospital for further treatment. His injuries are not thought to be life threatening.

Please avoid the area if possible and remember to only make essential journeys. Anyone that has any further details that could help with our enquiries is urged to contact us quoting: 20000256251
