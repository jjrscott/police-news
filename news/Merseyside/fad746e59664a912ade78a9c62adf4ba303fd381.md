We are continuing to appeal for information six years on from the murder of a teenager in Wavertree.

Kevin Wilson was 17 years old when he was shot once in the back on the evening of Saturday 7th February 2015.

Officers had been called to the junction of Smithdown Road and Holmes Street at around 8.30pm where they found Kevin. He was taken to hospital but was sadly pronounced dead a short time later.

Since his death 13 people have been arrested in connection with his murder, however an investigation remains ongoing and detectives are urging anyone who may have information to get in touch.

Detective Chief Inspector Rachel Wilson said: "This was a cruel and senseless crime that has left a family devastated and still looking for answers six years on.

No murder investigation is ever closed and we remain determined as ever to find who was responsible for Kevin's death.

"We know the answers to solving this and bringing the killer to justice lies within our communities and I would ask that people put themselves in the shoes of Kevin's mum. How would they feel if they knew their loved one's killer was still free and walking the streets of Merseyside?

"There are people out there who know exactly what happened on that night and we need them to find the courage and do the right thing by coming forward and speak up.

"Any information, no matter how small could prove vital to our investigation and I urge people to share information with police, or anonymously through Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
