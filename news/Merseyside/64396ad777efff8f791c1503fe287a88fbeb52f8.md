Officers were called at 9am to Goldie Street, at its junction with Sleepers Hill, to a report a 36-year-old man, a 25-year-old woman and a 34-year-old woman had sustained leg injuries after being struck with pellets believed to have been shot with an air weapon. They have been taken to hospital for assessment.
