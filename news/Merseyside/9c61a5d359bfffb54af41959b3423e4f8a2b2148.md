We are appealing for information after a burglary at a jewellers in Southport on Thursday 12 March.

It was reported just after 2.30am, in Lord Street, that three offenders cut a hole in the shutters of the premises, smashed the window display and stole a substantial amount of watches. The offenders did not enter the store fully.

The offenders had their faces covered and were wearing gloves.

Detective Inspector Catherine Walsh said: "I would appeal to anyone who saw or heard anything in the early hours of Thursday morning to come forward and talk to us. Also, the offenders left in a car so you may have dashcam footage which would help with our investigation.

"If you saw anything suspicious, please get in touch and we will make every effort to find the offenders.

"Recent arrests, charges and court cases show that we will pursue anyone who targets businesses in Merseyside and brings fear to those who work there and visit them."
