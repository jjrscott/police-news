We are appealing for information following a road-related incident in Walton last night, Tuesday 8 September.

At 9pm, a report was received of a collision between a car and a scrambler bike on Bedford Road, near to Carisbrooke Road. Patrols attended and found no evidence to confirm the incident, but cordoned off the scene to enable further enquiries.

No injuries have been reported following checks with hospitals. CCTV, forensic and witness enquiries are ongoing.

Detective Inspector Phil Atkinson said: "At this stage it is unclear what happened, although we have information to indicate some kind of collision, but whether accidental or deliberate we don't yet know.

"If you were in the area around 9pm and saw or heard anything, or live locally and have CCTV or dashcam, please come forward and we will take the appropriate action."

Please come forward with reference number 20000543606 via our social media desk on Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre'.

You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
