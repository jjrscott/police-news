We are investigating after a quantity of designer coats were stolen during a burglary at a menswear shop in Maghull.

At around 7.45pm on Sunday 29th November three males wearing dark clothing and with their faces covered entered Ryat Menswear on Stafford Moreton Way and stole designer jeans, Prada T-shirts and a number of 'Moose Knuckle' coats.

An investigation is underway and CCTV and forensic enquiries have been carried out.

We are appealing for anyone who has any information about the burglary - or has been offered one of the coats for sale - to contact us.

Detective Inspector Paul Gillies said: "These coats normally retail for hundreds of pounds so I would appeal to anyone who has been offered one at a substantially reduced price to get in touch as they may have information which is vital to our investigation.

"I would also ask anyone who was in the area round Stafford Moreton Way on the evening of 29th November who saw anyone or anything suspicious to contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 20000726306.
