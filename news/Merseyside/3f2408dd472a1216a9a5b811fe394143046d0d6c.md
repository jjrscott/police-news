Armed officers have arrested a man in Fazakerley this morning following reports of a man armed with a gun and a knife making threats.

Officers were called to Haven Road, Fazakerley, just before 9am after reports that a man had threatened a man and woman with a gun and a knife and demanded the keys to their vehicle. They refused and the man left. It is also believed that the man threatened staff with a knife at a nearby shop just after this incident.

Armed officers responded to the calls and a male was arrested nearby on Longmoor Lane. He was found to be in possession of an imitation firearm and a knife was also found nearby. The man was arrested on suspicion of possession of an imitation firearm, possession of a knife and attempted robbery.

He has been taken to a police station where he will be interviewed by detectives.
