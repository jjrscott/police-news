Officers from our Wirral Targeted Team have arrested a man and woman on suspicion of drug supply following an incident in Tranmere last night, Tuesday 16 September.

Around midnight, officers on patrol in Elm Road saw a dark Vauxhall Astra in suspicious circumstances. The car was stopped on North Road and suspected heroin and cocaine were seized following searches of the car and occupants.

A 49-year-old man from Rock Ferry and a 50-year-old woman from Tranmere were arrested on suspicion of Class A drug supply. They were both taken to police stations for questioning and have since been released under investigation.

If you suspect that drugs are being dealt where you live, pass information via @MerPolCC or the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
