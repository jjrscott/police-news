We have issued a £10,000 fine for breach of coronavirus legislation after a house party in Orrell Park on Saturday (31 October).

Reports were received at 9.40pm from people concerned that a party was being held at the address on Albert Drive.

Officers attended and a 29-year-old man was subsequently issued with a fixed penalty notice to pay a £10,000 fine.

Targeted Inspector Ian Peacock said: "We have seen cases of coronavirus and hospital admissions rise sharply in recent weeks, and the Liverpool City Region was the first part of the country to be put on the 'very high' Tier 3 Covid alert level.

"Now as we enter a month of further national restrictions from midnight, it is more important than ever before that we all play our role in stopping the spread of coronavirus.

"Only if people abide by the restrictions will this period achieve its aim of supressing the virus, and help us get our lives back to normal.

"Those who host parties in which people from multiple households mix under one roof are very clearly breaching the legislation, risking the health of their loved ones and risk prolonging the very challenging time we are all facing."

Inspector Peacock added: "The overwhelming majority of people across Merseyside have demonstrated great civic responsibility and met the challenge posed by coronavirus with a huge amount of patience and understanding.

"This virus has impacted their birthday parties, weddings and funerals - but they have selflessly made great sacrifices for the sake of the NHS as well as the health of themselves and others.

"Our officers have encouraged people to comply with guidance and explained why it is so important. But when someone so brazenly flouts legislation to only meet indoors with your own household or bubble, it leaves us with no option but to take strong enforcement action.

"Where necessary we will not hesitate to do the same again, because the safety of vulnerable people in Merseyside and our key healthcare workers depends on it."
