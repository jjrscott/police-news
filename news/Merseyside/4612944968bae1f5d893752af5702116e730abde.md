We are appealing for witnesses following an aggravated burglary in Wirral last night, Thursday 19th November.

At 7.30pm the occupier of a house in Bedford Road, Rock Ferry, reported that four males had entered the house and forced the three occupants into an upstairs room. One of the males is believed to have been armed with a screwdriver.

The males have then taken a quantity of jewellery.

All the males were described as wearing dark clothing and footwear with black cotton gloves and black snood-like face coverings.

The males are believed to have left in a dark grey coloured car which drove off in the direction of Rock Ferry train station.

The occupiers of the house were left shaken by their ordeal.

An investigation is underway and house-to-house and CCTV enquiries have been carried out in the local area.

Detective Chief Inspector Gayle Rooney said: "We are appealing for anyone who was in the area around Bedford Road at 7.30pm who saw anyone or anything suspicious to contact us. Similarly it is vital that we find anyone who was driving or walking in the area who may have captured something, either on their mobile phone, or dash cam to get in touch.

"Merseyside Police is committed to finding the people responsible for committing crimes such as this and would urge anyone with information to come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 20000704197.
