We are appealing for information after a robbery in Southport last night (Friday 5 June 2020).

We were called at 8.45pm to a report two male offenders with their faces covered and carrying hammers had approached two 22-year-old men in Hesketh Park making threats.

They then stole a bike from one, and smashed both men's mobile phones with the hammers before heading out of the park towards Southport town centre.

No-one was physically harmed during the incident.

The bike is described as a blue and black pedal bike, with three distinctive hoops under the handle bars.

Detective Inspector Andy McCourt said: "Thankfully neither victim was harmed, but they have obviously been left extremely shaken by this ordeal, not to mention the inconvenienced after having their phones and a bike taken from them.

"We will act on all information given to us to bring the males responsible for this to justice, and I call on anyone who saw anything suspicious around Hesketh Park at 8.45pm on Friday to get in touch.

"If you have been offered a bike matching the description, or seen it since it was stolen, we also want to hear from you.

"We are making our own enquiries in the area, but information from the public could prove absolutely vital.

"Our green spaces are there to be enjoyed safely by people of all ages, without the fear of falling victim to an incident such as this, and we intend to keep it that way."

Anyone with information should contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre'. You can also call 101 quoting incident reference 20000327405 or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their website here: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously
