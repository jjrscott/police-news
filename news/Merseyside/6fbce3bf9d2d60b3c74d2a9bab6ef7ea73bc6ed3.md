Officers are appealing for information following an assault on two 14 year old boys yesterday (28th May) evening.

The incident is reported to have happened at around 6:50pm on the canal towpath near Glovers Lane, Netherton when the two boys and their friends were walking in the area.

As the group of friends approached a larger group of people, they were reportedly chased by four of them who were all wearing balaclavas. They caught up with the two victims and assaulted them, causing injuries to one of the boys head, neck and stomach and forcing the other to get into the canal.

The offenders are also reported to have stolen both victims shoes, one of their bank cards and the others phone and Apple Air pods.

The victims were later helped by a member of the public who kindly took them back to their home addresses.

One of the victims was later taken to hospital by his mother where he was treated for his injuries.

Detective Sergeant Alan Williams said: "This is the second incident we have seen this week where people have been assaulted in this area and have either been pushed into the canal or otherwise assaulted during completely unprovoked attacks which could have resulted in far more serious injuries or worse.

"We are continuing to carry out a number of enquiries and would ask anyone with information on either incident to come forward.

"Please also be reminded that government guidance is there for your own and other peoples safety - large groups should not be congregating together and intimidating other members of the public. It is vital that we work together to protect and support each other and I would urge anyone to come forward with information if you were in the area at the time of this incident and witnessed what happened or if you were the member of the public who kindly helped the two young boys, please let us know quoting 20000308728. Likewise, if you have any CCTV or dashcam footage please get in touch."
