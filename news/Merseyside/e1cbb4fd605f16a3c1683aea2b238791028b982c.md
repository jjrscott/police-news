We're appealing for information following a theft from a Kirkby school last week.

On Thursday morning (26 March), staff at Bluebell Park School in Cawthorne Close reported the theft of garden tools from the school grounds after entry was forced to a locked container. The items taken included a lawnmower, strimmer and hedge cutters.

The incident was believed to have happened at some time between 3pm on Wednesday 25 March and 6.45am on Thursday 26 March. CCTV enquiries are ongoing.

Knowsley Community Policing Inspector Peter Rexwinkel said: "The last thing one of our schools needs at the moment is the further inconvenience and stress of theft. Our communities are coming together to help in these difficult times so it is beyond belief that someone would stoop so low as to deprive on of our schools of vital equipment.

"If you heard, saw or captured anything suspicious last Wednesday night near to the school, have had such items offered to you or seen them for sale, do the right thing and help us to return them as soon as possible, and we'll put those responsible before the courts."

You can pass information via @MerPolCC or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, with reference 20000183252.
