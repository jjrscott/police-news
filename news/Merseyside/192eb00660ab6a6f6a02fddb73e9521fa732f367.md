We are appealing for witnesses after a man was hit by a car in the Bootle area yesterday afternoon, Thursday 14th January.

At around 2.20pm we received a report that a 44 year-old man had been hit by a white or silver coloured Vauxhall car in Bedford Road in Bootle. Damage had also been caused to a car parked on the same road and the wall of a property on nearby Cambridge Road during the incident.

The car and the man had both left the scene before the incident. The man was later traced to a property in Bootle where he complained of pain to his legs, body and head. He was taken to hospital to be checked over.

An investigation is underway and enquiries have been carried out in the local area.

Officers are keen to trace the vehicle involved - which is believed to be a silver or white coloured Vauxhall Astra or Vauxhall Corsa.

Detective Chief Inspector Simon Hurst said: "I would ask anyone who was in the area of Bedford Road or Cambridge Road yesterday afternoon who saw the collision or vehicle described prior to the collision taking place to contact us.

"I would also ask for anyone who was in the area who may have captured mobile phone, CCTV or dash cam footage to contact us as they may have captured something significant which could assist with our investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 21000028742.
