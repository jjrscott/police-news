We are welcoming the sentencing of two men for serious assaults in Liverpool City Centre in March this year.

At around 4am on Sunday 1 March, emergency services were called to Church Street to reports of two men being stabbed.

21-year-old Jason Medlicott was detained at the scene, and pleaded guilty to Section 20 wounding, affray and possession of a bladed article.

22-year-old Martin Stroud of Liverpool Road, Southport was arrested following a media appeal. He pleaded guilty to Section 18 wounding, affray and possession of a bladed article.

Stroud was sentenced to eight years and one month in prison at Liverpool Crown Court today, Monday 21 December.
Medlicott received an indefinite hospital order.

Speaking following the sentencing, Detective Sergeant Mike Astbury said: "These were brutal assaults of two young men, who could easily have sustained fatal injuries. As with all serious violence, the impact on these two victims and their families is significant, and continues to this day. We'd like to thank them for their support and strength through this investigation.

"Knife crime and other serious violence causes devastation in our communities. If you know or suspect anyone is storing, carrying or using weapons, please come forward and we act on all information to make the streets safer. Call 999 if a crime is in progress, or pass any information on via or social media desk @MerPolCC on Twitter, or anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
