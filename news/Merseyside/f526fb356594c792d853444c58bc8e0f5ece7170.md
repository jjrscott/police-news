We have issued a CCTV image of a man we want to trace following a burglary at a pub in Childwall.

At around 10.15pm on Wednesday 15th January an unknown male entered the staff locker room at The Childwall Fiveways Hotel on Queens Drive, Childwall. The male stole a member of staff's car keys and a wallet with cards in.

The car, a dark blue Vauxhall Astra, was stolen from the car park. The victim's cards were used at a number of locations in Liverpool including the Tesco store in Old Swan, McDonalds on Edge Lane, the Shell garage on Edge Lane and Rocket Wines on Queens Drive.

The car was later recovered.

Anyone who recognises the man or knows of his whereabouts is asked to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 20000033435.
