Officers investigating a road traffic collision have released a CCTV image of a man they wish to speak to in connection with the incident.

At around 9.30pm on Friday, 7 February, a man in his 70's was picked up by a Hackney cab on Great Charlotte Street, Liverpool to travel to Wirral. After exiting the Birkenhead tunnel, it was reported that the driver became lost and when the man attempted speak to the driver, he braked suddenly twice, resulting in the passenger colliding with the front seats and falling to the floor.

The cab driver took him to hospital where he was found to have sustained a serious ankle injury which required surgery.

Officers are keen to speak to the man pictured as he could have vital information to assist enquiries.

Roads Policing Sergeant Martin Mayne said: "This incident left an elderly man seriously injured and an investigation is ongoing to establish the full circumstances.

"The Hackney cab involved is described as mainly cream in colour but burgundy around the bottom third. I would ask anyone who remembers seeing a cab of this description, has any CCTV or dashcam footage, or recognises the man pictured, to please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC quoting ref. 20000088183 or the Roads Policing Unit on 0151 777 5747. You can also contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
