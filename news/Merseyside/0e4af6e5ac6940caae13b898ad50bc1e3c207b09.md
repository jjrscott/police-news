Detectives investigating incidents during a mass gathering in Liverpool City Centre on Friday 26 June have arrested a man on suspicion of theft.

On Friday 26 June, several thousand people attended the Pier Head, and a number of criminal offences were reported, including drug offences.

An extensive investigation is ongoing and as part of those enquiries, a 24-year-old man from Liverpool was arrested today (Friday 10 July) on suspicion of theft. He has been taken into custody to be interviewed.

We are continuing to appeal for the males pictured in the attached image, or, or anyone who recognises them, to come forward at the earliest opportunity.
