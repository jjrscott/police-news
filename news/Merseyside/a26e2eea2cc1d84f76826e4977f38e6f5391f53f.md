Officers in Sefton are appealing for information after the criminal damage of a car in Formby last month.

At some time between 10am and 2.45pm on Wednesday 12 February, an unknown offender caused more than Â£1,200 damage to a Range Rover Evoque (see photo) parked on the street.

Inspector Beth Blake said: "This was a completely unnecessary act of criminal damage to a vehicle parked in a residential area. Whilst we understand the frustration caused to residents by people who park in a way which obstruct others, this wasn't the case here.

"Whoever was responsible has caused inconvenience, distress and financial cost and we are determined to find them. If you have seen or experience a similar incident recently, let us know. Home CCTV, dashcam or mobile phone footage could be vital to stopping this person causing damage to any more cars locally.

"To those who are genuinely inconvenienced by illegal parking in our communities, you can speak to Sefton Council via their contact centre phone number 0345 140 0845 or via their online form https://forms.sefton.gov.uk/asboform/"
