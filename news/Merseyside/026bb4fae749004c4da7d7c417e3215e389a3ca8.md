Detectives have arrested a man on suspicion of murder following an incident in Everton on Saturday, 21 March.

Just before 8.30pm, a 22-year-old man from Everton was assaulted and found unconscious on Shaw Street at the junction with Langsdale Street. On the evening of the assault, the man was taken to hospital where he was treated for serious head injuries and sadly died on Sunday 5 April.

He has today been named as Hassan Haadi from Everton.

A 24-year-old man from Nottingham was last night arrested on suspicion of murder and taken to a police station for questioning.

A Home Office Post Mortem will be carried out today (Tuesday 7 April). The victim's next of kin have been informed and are being supported by detectives.

Officers are still trying to establish the circumstances surrounding the incident, which is now a murder investigation, and CCTV and house to house inquiries are being conducted.

Detective Chief Inspector Cheryl Rhodes said: "We have a man in custody for questioning but it's still absolutely vital that we speak to anyone who witnessed the incident, the aftermath, or has heard anything since.

"We know that a number of people witnessed the incident itself and the aftermath, some of whom kindly provided first aid to the victim. If this was you, or you know the people present, come forward as soon as possible with what you know, and we'll gather together the full circumstances of this tragic incident."
