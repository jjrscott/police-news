Officers are pleased to inform the public that we have made a second arrest in connection with a stabbing in Liverpool city centre last month.

The incident is reported to have happened in the early hours of 1st March when a group of men had been seen fighting close to River Island on Church Street at 4am, and a 19-year-old man sustained a stab wound to the chest during the incident. A second 19-year-old man who was cut to the face was treated in hospital. Both men have now been discharged.

This morning (24th March), on the back of intelligence received by the community, officers made a second arrest of a 20 year old man on suspicion of Attempt Murder. He was taken to custody for questioning.

This arrest follows the charging of Jason Thomas Medlicott, 20, of Leinster Road, Liverpool who was charged with two counts of Section 18 wounding, possession of an offensive weapon in a public place and affray. He is currently on remand awaiting trial.

If you have any information, please call 101 quoting incident reference 20000131788 or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
