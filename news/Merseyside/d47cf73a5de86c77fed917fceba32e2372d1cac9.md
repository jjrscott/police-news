We are appealing for witnesses following a road traffic collision involving a car and scrambler bike in Aintree this morning, Wednesday 27th January.

At 11.40am we received a report that the bike had been collision with a Vauxhall Corsa at the junction of Altway and Denstone Avenue.

The rider of the bike, a 24 year-old male, has been taken to hospital with a leg injury. The driver of the car was not injured and remained at the scene and is assisting with enquiries.

An investigation into the collision is underway.

Officers are keen to trace two other scrambler bikes which are believed to have been with the first bike and left the area before officers arrived.

It is believed they made off in the direction of Ormskirk Road.

Anyone who was in the area who saw the collision or saw the bikes in the area is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @MerPolTraffic quoting log 333 of 27th January.

We are also asking for motorists who were in the Altway/Ormskirk Road area around 11.40am today to check their dash cam to see if they captured anything significant.
