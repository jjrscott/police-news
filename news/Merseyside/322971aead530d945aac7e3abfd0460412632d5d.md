Detectives are issuing images of males who may have information following a robbery at an off licence in Huyton last month.

At around 6.15pm on Friday 30 October, four males entered All in One convenience story on Woodlands Road and made threats to a female member of staff. She was pushed and cash and cigarettes were stolen.

CCTV, and witness enquiries have been ongoing.

Detective Inspector Jackie Guinness said: "Although the males pictured are wearing coverings, we're hopeful people may recognise them from their clothing or may have seen the incident itself and not yet come forward.

"This was a frightening experience for the member of staff present, threatened while working within the community. We'll continue our enquiries to find those responsible and put them before the courts. If you were in the area and saw, heard or captured anything, please let us know."
