Detectives have charged a teenager with attempted robbery and criminal damage following an incident in St Helens last week.

At around 9.30pm on Thursday 18 March, a report was received of a male entering Nutgrove Minimart on Nutgrove Road and making demands that the shopkeeper opened the till.

A rock was also reportedly thrown, causing damage to the shop window. No injuries were caused or items stolen and the suspect made off.

Following enquiries, a 17-year-old male from Thatto Heath was arrested. He has now been charged with attempted robbery and criminal damage and will appear at Merseyside Adult Remand Court this morning, Monday 22 March.
