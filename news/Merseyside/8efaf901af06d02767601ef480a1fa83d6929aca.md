We have arrested and charged a man with drug offences following an incident in Dingle yesterday, Tuesday 12 May.

At around 3pm, officers were on patrol in Mill Street when they sighted a man on a pedal bike acting suspiciously. He was detained and searched, and found to be in possession of wraps of heroin and crack cocaine.

24-year-old Thomas O'Hara of no fixed abode has been charged with two counts of possession of Class A drugs and conditionally bailed to appear at Liverpool Crown Court on Tuesday 28 July.
