Officers have launched a murder investigation after a man was stabbed this afternoon (13th April).

We were called to Vincent Road, Liverpool at 2:30pm to reports that an 18 year old man had received stab wounds to his chest.

North West Ambulance Service attended and the man was taken to hospital where he sadly died.

His next of kin has been made aware and specialist officers are supporting them at this time.

A 17 year old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and has been taken to custody for questioning.

Anyone that witnessed the incident is urged to please get in touch via @MerPolCC, calling 101 or reporting anonymously via CrimestoppersUK quoting log 378 of 13th April.
