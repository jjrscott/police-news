Detectives are issuing the images of ten males who may have information to assist the investigation into violent disorder on the night of LFC being presented with the Premier League trophy, Wednesday 22 July.

The males pictured were in the area of Townson Street and Walton Breck Road on the night in question.

At around 11.25pm, disorder broke out between groups in the area, which included fighting and bottles being thrown. The groups dispersed a short time later and extensive CCTV and witness enquiries have been ongoing since.

A total of nine arrests were made on the night for unrelated offences including affray and drug driving.

Detective Chief Inspector Cheryl Rhodes said: "Although there was a large gathering of supporters on the night, very few incidents were reported outside the ground and in the wider Anfield area.

"However, it has since come to light that there was a flashpoint involving a small number of people at around 11.25pm during which punches were thrown, and objects were launched between groups of people intent on causing trouble.

"Those and any violent incidents cause fear, danger and damage the reputation of this city, and will never be tolerated.

"As our appeals and twenty plus arrests from the earlier Pier Head disorder demonstrate, we will carry out thorough and patient enquiries to find those responsible and put them before the courts.

"Large gatherings bring the risk of more lockdown measures in the city and beyond, so work with us and celebrate when the time is right."
