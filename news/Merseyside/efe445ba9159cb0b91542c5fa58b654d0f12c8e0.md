We were called to a house in Birkenhead in the early hours of today (Thursday 30 July) to reports a boy had fallen from a second floor window.

Emergency services attended a house on Derby Road at about 12.25am and the boy, aged two, was taken to hospital for treatment to a serious head injury.

His condition is described as stable and is not believed to be life-threatening.

Officers are speaking with the family and conducting house-to-house enquiries in the local area to establish the circumstances.
