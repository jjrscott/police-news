Detectives have charged two men with drug supply offences following activity yesterday, Wednesday 9 September.

In the morning, a warrant was carried out at an address on Church Road, Formby, and a man arrested and taken in for questioning. Devices and other documentation were seized.

40-year-old Alan Hodgson of Church Road has now been charged with supply of cannabis; ketamine; heroin and cocaine; and possession of Class A and B drugs.

Yesterday evening, officers attended an address in Whiston to carry out separate enquiries. A man later attended at a police station and was arrested.

33-year-old Mathew Badibanga of Manorwood Drive has now been charged with supply of cocaine; heroin; cannabis and amphetamines.

Both men are appearing at Liverpool Magistrates Court this morning, Thursday 10 September.

Both charges are linked to the ongoing national investigation Operation Venetic.
