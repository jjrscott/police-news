Detectives investigating an assault in Waterloo in July have issued a CCTV image of a man who may be able to assist enquiries.

At around 1am on Sunday, 12 July, officers were called to Church Road following reports a man had left the Lion & Unicorn Pub, before punching another man who was stood outside.

The offender made of on foot and the victim, a 38-year-old man, was taken to hospital for treatment to serious but non-life threatening facial injuries.

An investigation is underway and detectives are keen to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident or has any information.

Detective Inspector Cat Walsh said: "This was an unprovoked attack which resulted in a man sustaining serious injuries which required surgery, and I would ask anyone with information to please come forward.

"We recognise that the CCTV image isn't of great quality, however we are particularly keen to speak to the man pictured as he may have vital information to assist our investigation, and would ask him, or anyone who recognises him, to let us know.

"Further CCTV and witness enquires are ongoing and we know a number of people were in the pub and the surrounding area at the time, so if you recognise the man pictured, or have any further information, or dashcam or CCTV footage, please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 quoting ref. 20000408383 or Crimestoppers, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
