We have arrested two men and seized suspected crack cocaine and cannabis following an incident yesterday afternoon, Wednesday 13 January.

Shortly after 1pm, Matrix officers stopped two men in a blue Ford Transit on Thatto Heath Road, St Helens. A search of the vehicle found Class A and B drugs and a large hunting knife, which were seized by officers.

Two men, aged 32 and 35, from St Helens were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A and B drugs. They are both currently in custody where they will be questioned by detectives.

Detective Inspector Yoseph Al-Ramadhan said: "Thanks to reports from the public and the swift action of our officers, drugs and dangerous weapons have now been removed from the community and cannot be used to cause harm on our streets.

"If you have any suspicions about drug dealing in your area, let us know and we'll keep taking positive action to stop potential drug dealers in their tracks."

Always call 999 if a crime is in progress. You can also report suspected drug dealing via @MerPolCC on Twitter, 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook, 101, or the independent charity @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111.
