We are appealing for information following a burglary in Rainford sometime between Tuesday evening on 21 April and Wednesday afternoon on 22 April.

It was reported at around 1.45pm that two electric bikes had been stolen from a shed during a burglary at a house on News Lane. It is believed they were taken some time between 9pm on Tuesday and 1pm on Wednesday.

The bikes stolen are a black Gant electric V6.8 bike and a small child's electric bike.

Community Inspector Matt Drennan said: "Any burglary is a despicable act which violates a person's property, where they have every right to feel safe, and deprives them of something which may hold great sentimental as well as financial value.

"But in this case The Gant bike was provided to the victim so that he could embark on a bike ride for charity which makes it all the more upsetting.

"We are determined to return the bikes to their rightful owner and bring the person or people responsible to justice.

"If you witnessed anything or have heard who may be responsible please get in touch.

"We are also appealing to anyone who may have been offered the bikes for sale to do the right thing and contact police as soon as possible."

Anyone with information should contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre'.
