Officers from our Roads Policing Unit are appealing for witnesses following a fatal road traffic collision in Bootle on Monday, 12 October.

At around 8.15pm, emergency services were called to the northbound carriageway of Southport Road (A5038) close to the junction with Breeze Hill and the Mons public house, following reports of a collision between a black Mercedes and a male pedestrian in his 60s.

The pedestrian was sadly pronounced deceased.

The driver of the motor vehicle stopped at the scene and is assisting police with their enquiries.

Specialist Roads Policing officers are supporting the family of the deceased gentleman at this time.

Sergeant Ryan Lowry from the Roads Policing Investigation Team said: "We are keen to speak to anyone who witnessed this collision or may have been in the area at the time of the collision especially if your vehicle is fitted with a dashcam which may have captured vital evidence.

"Specialist officers are supporting the family of the deceased gentleman at this time and I request anyone that may be able to assist to contact us as soon as possible."

Anyone with information is urged to call the Roads Policing Unit on 0151 777 5747, message our social media desk @MerPolCC, or call 101 quoting reference number 20000618755.
