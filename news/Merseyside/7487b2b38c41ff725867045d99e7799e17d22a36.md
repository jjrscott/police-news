Officers from the Birkenhead local policing team will be introducing a 48-hour Dispersal Zone for a third weekend from today in response to recent anti-social behaviour and criminality in the area.

It came into place today, Friday, 2nd October at 12pm and will run until 12pm on Sunday, 4th October.

The order comes under Section 34 of the Anti-Social Behaviour & Policing Act 2014, which gives police officers and police community support officers powers to direct people they suspect are causing or likely to cause crime, nuisance or anti-social behaviour to members of the public to leave a designated area for up to 48 hours. It is a response to recent reports of anti-social behaviour and criminality in the area.

Should a person who has previously been directed to leave the area return, an offence would be committed, which they may ultimately be arrested for.

The area covered by the order is show on the attached map.

Community Policing Sergeant Alan McKeon said: "A dispersal zone has been put in place for a third weekend in row, in response to recent reports of anti-social behaviour in the Birkenhead area.

"We will continue to proactively target those involved in anti-social behaviour and criminal activity and will have extra patrols in the area shown on the map throughout the weekend.

"I want to reassure the local community that we are solely targeting individuals involved in anti-social behaviour, and law abiding members of the public do not need to worry. Together with partners, we are committed to ensuring Wirral remains a safe place to live, work and visit.

"I would like to encourage people to continue to report incidents of anti-social behaviour or criminality to us, so we can continue to take action."

Anyone who wishes to report anti-social or criminal behaviour can contact 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. call 999 in an emergency. You can also follow @WirralPolice on Twitter and Facebook for updates and advice.
