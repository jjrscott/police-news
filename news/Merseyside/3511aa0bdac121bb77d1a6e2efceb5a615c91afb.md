We are appealing for witnesses following a fire at premises in Thatto Health.

We were contacted on Saturday 4th January to reports of a fire at a training barn at Thatto Heath Crusaders Club on Close Street. Damage was caused to an external wooden cladded wall.

No-one was in the building at the time and there have been no reports of any injuries.

It is believed that the fire started between 4.35pm and 4.50pm. Four males, two of who are believed to have been on mountain bikes, were seen in the area at the time.

The fire is being treated as suspected malicious ignition and an investigation is underway.

CCTV and forensic enquiries are in the process of being carried out and detectives are appealing for anyone who was in the vicinity of Close Street who saw anyone or anything suspicious to contact us either by DM @MerPolCC, calling 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting log 651 of 4th January.
