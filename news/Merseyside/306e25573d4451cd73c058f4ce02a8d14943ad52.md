This weekend the four Premier League clubs of Manchester and Liverpool play each other in our two city-regions.

Today Manchester United, Everton, Manchester City and Liverpool have come together to support Hate Awareness Week in Greater Manchester.

Merseyside Police is united with Greater Manchester Police, our four great North West clubs and the Mayors of Greater Manchester and the Liverpool City-Region, in condemning the racist abuse that too many players, officials and supporters continue to encounter, most recently on social media platforms.

We stand shoulder to shoulder in saying there in no room for racism, hate or any form of discrimination in our beautiful game. It should not happen and it must stop.
