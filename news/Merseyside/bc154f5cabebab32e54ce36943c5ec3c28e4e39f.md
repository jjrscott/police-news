We are appealing for information following an incident in Walton on Sunday, 20 October.

At around 8.30pm a report was received that four male offenders, described as wearing dark clothing and facial coverings, had entered a property on Dane Street and shot two men inside.

Emergency services attended and two males, both in their 20's, were found to have suffered gunshot wounds to their legs.
They have been taken to hospital for treatment to their injuries, which at this stage are not thought to be life threatening.

Extensive enquiries are being carried out to establish the full circumstances patrols have been stepped up in the area to gather information and provide reassurance.

Chief Inspector Peter Clark said: "This is a shocking incident during which two people have received gunshot injuries and enquires are underway to find those responsible.

"The investigation is in it's very early stages and we are keeping an open mind, but at this stage we believe the attack to be targeted.

" A scene will remain in place and patrols will remain in the area to carry out enquiries and provide reassurance to the local community.

"Dane Street is a residential area and an incident such as this is appalling and unacceptable. Gun crime will not be tolerated by Merseyside Police and I would urge the public to please come forward with any information they may have, no matter how small. If you saw or heard any suspicious behaviour this evening, anyone making off from the scene, or have any CCTV or dashcam footage, please get in touch."
