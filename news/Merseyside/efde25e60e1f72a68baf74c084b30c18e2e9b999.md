Wanted

05:00 20/12/2020

Have you seen this woman? Sarah Thompson, 38, of no fixed address is wanted on recall to prison.

She was given an 11-month sentence for Section 20 wounding and released on licence on 15 October this year.

She was recalled to prison on 3 November after breaching the terms under which she was released, and once arrested will serve the remainder of her sentence.

Extensive enquiries have been ongoing to trace her since.

Thompson is white of slim build, 5ft 4in tall, has blue eyes, long brown hair, and speaks with a Liverpool accent.

We are issuing one wanted appeal per day for 12 days to support the work of our Force Fugitive Team, so help us track these people down before Christmas.

Anyone with information on Thompson's whereabouts or any of our wanted people is asked to contact @MerPolCC or 101 with reference 20000667437.

You can also pass information anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. You can also contact them via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
