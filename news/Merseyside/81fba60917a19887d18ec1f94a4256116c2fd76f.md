We are appealing for information following a report of an assault in West Derby this afternoon, Friday, 31 January.

A report was received just before 2.30pm that a man had been found with serious injuries in Eaton Road. A man in his 50's suffered serious injuries to his head and chest and spine and was taken to hospital where he remains in a critical condition.

Reports suggest he may have been assaulted by males in dark clothing.

CCTV opportunities are being explored and enquiries into the incident are ongoing.

Detective Inspector Jennie Beck said: "Unfortunately the victim has suffered serious injuries as the result of this assault, we believe during the incident he was possibly kicked in the head and chest. We are in the early stages of this investigation but think the victim was assaulted at a bus stop on Eaton Road, then walked down towards 'Bobbers' where he collapsed outside in the street.

"It is shocking to think this could happen on a busy road in broad daylight, so there must be witnesses who might have been in the area at the time, either on foot or in a car or bus. We are also interested in any dascham or mobile phone footage.

"We take assaults like this seriously and the only way we can find out exactly what happened here today is if the community tell us what they know."

Detectives are appealing to anyone who has any information to DM us @MerPolCC or call 101 quoting crime reference number 0542 of 31/1/20 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, or DM @CrimestoppersUK.
