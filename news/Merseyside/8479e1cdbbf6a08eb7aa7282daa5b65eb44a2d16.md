We are appealing for information following an assault in Liverpool City Centre last night, Wednesday 16 December.

At around 5.30pm, a 31-year-old man arrived at the Royal Liverpool Hospital with a suspected stab wound to his head.

It is believed from initial police investigations that the man sustained the injury during an assault on Hatton Garden, near to the Richmond Hotel.

The man is being treated in hospital for his injuries and is in a critical but stable condition.

An investigation is underway to establish the full circumstances and anyone with information is asked to get in touch.

Detective Inspector Sean Kelly-Martland said "We are in the early stages of an investigation I would like to reassure the local community that officers are carrying out CCTV, forensic and witness enquiries.

"As we work to piece together what happened I would urge anyone who witnessed the incident, any suspicious behaviour in the area, or has any CCTV or dashcam footage, to please contact us.

"A young man has been left seriously injured in this assault and we will work tirelessly to locate whoever is responsible and bring them to justice."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC on Twitter, 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook or call, 101 quoting ref. 20000764507.

You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
