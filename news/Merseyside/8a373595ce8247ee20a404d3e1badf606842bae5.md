We can confirm two Liverpool fans were reported to have been assaulted in Naples earlier today (Tuesday 17 September).

At around 6pm local time (5pm GMT), it was reported a number of males on scooters approached the fans at a bar in the city before assaulting them.

Two men from the UK, aged 26 and 46, sustained superficial cuts and grazes to the head and were treated at the scene before continuing to attend the match.

Local police area aware and Merseyside Police are working with police colleagues in Naples to assist in the policing of the Champions League fixture tonight.
