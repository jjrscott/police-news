At around 11.10pm, a report was received that gun shots had been heard in the Beechwood Drive area. Officers attended and found damage consistent with a firearms discharge to a house on the street. A second house was also found to be damaged however enquiries are on-going to establish the cause.

A short time later damage consistent with a discharge was also found to a car in Crutchley Avenue.
