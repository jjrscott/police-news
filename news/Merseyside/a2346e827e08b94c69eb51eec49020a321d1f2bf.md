Registered nurse Claire Price, 46, always wanted to join the police force as a child.

Her dad persuaded her not to, and Claire embarked on a 28-year career in the NHS where she currently works in the Emergency Care Improvement Support Team (ECIST) with NHS England and NHS Improvement.

But Claire never gave up on her dream to pull on the uniform, and after starting training last August, she was attested as a Special Constable in January.

She has already assisted with a murder investigation, worked alongside local policing, response and resolution, and supported with high visibility patrols during the Covid -19 pandemic, and is loving life as a Special.

Claire said: "I am at a stage in my life when I have the time to give something back to the communities, use my life skills and help make a difference.

"I just love that I'm able to do it. I have been fortunate to date to work alongside a fantastic team of regular and special officers."
