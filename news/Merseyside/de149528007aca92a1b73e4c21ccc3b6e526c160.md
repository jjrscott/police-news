Do you recognise this man? Police believe he may have information which could help with their investigation into a robbery on Gores Lane, Formby, on Saturday 24 October.

At around 12.15pm, it was reported that an Amazon delivery driver was assaulted and his van stolen.

The white VW transit van was later abandoned in the car park at Freshfield train station.

As part of ongoing enquiries into the incident, officers have issued these images and ask anyone who knows the man pictured to come forward.

Following our investigations so far we understand that the man pictured may have links to the Knowsley area.

Detective Inspector Cat Walsh said, "Although thankfully not injured, this will have been a shocking experience for the victim. To be assaulted while you are working is despicable and we will do all we can to find those responsible and bring them to justice.

"We are keen to speak with the man pictured as we believe he can help us establish what took place.

"If you are the man pictured, recognise him, witnessed the incident, saw this vehicle making off or being abandoned at Freshfields station, please let us know. Your CCTV, dashcam and other footage may be vital to help us with our investigation."

Anyone who recognises the man pictured or has any information is asked to contact @MerPolCC on Twitter, 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook or call 101 quoting reference 20000645097.
