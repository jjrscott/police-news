An investigation is underway following reports a male and a female were injured in Croxteth last night, Thursday 31st October.

We were called at 7.50pm following reports that shots had been fired at a black VW Golf as it travelled along Sceptre Road. A short time later the car was in collision with a 12 year-old female pedestrian. The driver of the car left the scene.

Shortly after the incident a male presented at hospital with a non-life threatening facial injury.

The female pedestrian was taken to hospital for treatment to her injuries. Her injuries are described as serious but not life threatening and she remains in hospital in a stable condition.

An investigation is underway and house-to-house and CCTV enquiries are being carried out in the local area.

Chief Inspector Mark Everard said: "This investigation is in its very early stages and enquiries are being carried out to establish exactly what has taken place.

"I would appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of Sceptre Road last night who saw anyone or anything suspicious or captured anything on dash-cam footage to contact us as they may be able to assist with the investigation.

"Firearms have no place on the streets of Merseyside and we are committed to finding the people responsible for using them and bringing them to justice."

Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting log 977 of 31st October.
