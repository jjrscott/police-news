Detectives investigating the robbery of a delivery driver in St Helens in March have charged a man.

At around 10.15am on Thursday 14 March, a delivery driver was returning to her van after making a delivery in Ullswater Avenue, when a male offender pulled her away and drove off in the vehicle. The woman was left uninjured but very shaken.

Following enquiries, 32-year-old Kevin Andrews from Wigan has been charged with robbery and will next appear at Liverpool Magistrates Court on Tuesday 5 November.
