We have arrested and charged a Rock Ferry man with charity fraud offences as part of an ongoing Wirral investigation.

56-year-old John Forsyth of Old Chester Road was charged today (Tuesday 12 January) with three counts of commiting fraud by false representation and one count of possessing an article for use in fraud.

The charges relate to three allegations between October and December last year, in which occupants of homes on the Kings Hill Estate, Bromborough reported suspicious charity collections.

Forsyth has been released on conditional bail to appear at Wirral Magistrates Court on Monday 22 February.
