We are appealing for witnesses after a series of cars were damaged in Wirral between Wednesday 30th October and Thursday 31st October.

Officers received reports that around a dozen cars had damage caused to windscreens, windows and wing mirrors including those parked in the Lake Place, Groveland Avenue, Cable Road and Charles Road areas of Hoylake over the two nights.

It is not clear if any of the incidents are linked or if the same person or people are responsible.

Wirral Community Policing Inspector Paul Harrison said: "Considerable damage has been caused to a number of vehicles in what can only be described as mindless acts of vandalism.

"This type of behaviour is not acceptable and it cannot be dismissed as just a bit of fun. A number of people will have been left out of pocket and greatly inconvenienced by the actions of a minority.

"I would appeal to anyone who was in the Hoylake area on Wednesday or Thursday night who saw anyone or anything suspicious to contact us.

"I would also appeal to motorists and taxi drivers to check their dash cam footage as they may have information which is vital to our investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
