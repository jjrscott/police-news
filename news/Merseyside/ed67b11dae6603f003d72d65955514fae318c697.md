Two men arrested after £3k over 30 mobile phones seized following stop check.

Officers from our Op Target team in Sefton were on patrol at around 7:30pm yesterday evening (21st December) in Altcar when they became suspicious of a parked car.

The car drove off after spotting the police car, however officers located it and two men inside, a short time after on Cabins Lane. A search took place where officers found around £3000 and 36 new and boxed mobile phones.

The men, aged 27 and 30, both from the Manchester area were arrested on suspicion of drugs offences, money laundering and possession of criminal property. They were taken to custody for questioning and later released pending further investigation.

Targeted Inspector Dave Uren said: "Our proactive policing patrols prove to be highly successful and help us target people involved in serious crime, whether that's drug dealing, gun crime, robberies, knife crime, assaults and murders. Our teams are trained to spot those involved in crime and piece together wider and more serious investigations.

"Any information you have that could lead us to the conviction of a dangerous person will be acted on, so please get in touch and help us keep our communities safe." #OpTarget
