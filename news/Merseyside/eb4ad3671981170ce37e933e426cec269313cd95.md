*UPDATED, 4.25pm on Wednesday 19 January - the witness has come forward, thanks for sharing this appeal and we continue to appeal for information.*

At around 3.50am on Sunday 8 December, a woman in her 20s was assaulted in Pop World on Wood Street. She sustained cuts to her head and door staff intervened. Extensive enquiries have been ongoing to trace those responsible.

Detective Constable John Causton said: "We'd like to speak to this woman to gather any information about this incident. She is potentially a witness to what happened.

"I'd also ask anyone else in Pop World that night who saw the incident or knows who was responsible to come forward.

"Thankfully the victim was not more seriously injured but this was a shocking attack, which has left physical and psychological scars. We're determined to find the person who did this, and your information may be vital.

"We work closely with licenced premises across Liverpool to ensure that people can enjoy the nightlife of the city safely. Help us keep it that way."

You can pass information via @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, with reference 19100716939.
