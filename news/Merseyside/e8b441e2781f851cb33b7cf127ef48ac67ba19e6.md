We are appealing for information after a man was assaulted in Liverpool city centre on Sunday (20 December).

It was reported the victim, a 38-year-old man from Liverpool, had been spat at and assaulted by three men on Basnett Street at about 5.40pm.

The offenders made off on foot before patrols arrived.

The man suffered cuts and bruising to his head, and is receiving the support of officers.

Enquiries were carried out in the local area to trace the men, and CCTV footage from across the city centre are being looked at.

Detective Inspector Lynsay Armbruster said: "This was a shocking attack and we have launched a full investigation to identify and bring to justice those responsible.

"This incident not only left the victim hurt, it also left a number of bystanders shocked and upset at what they saw.

"We have spoken to some witnesses, but are keen to speak to anyone we haven't yet spoken to who witnessed the incident.

"It is believed the offenders may be from the Manchester area, and could have travelled in that day, and we are also keen to hear from anyone who might know who they were or where they went."

Det Insp Armbruster added: "Liverpool city centre has a hard-earned reputation for being a safe place for people to enjoy a meal and drinks, but people should not be making unnecessary journeys from Tier 3 areas , and we are working with licensing teams in locally authorities to ensure coronavirus legislation is adhered to and so that we can help manage the spread of coronavirus in Merseyside."

Anyone who can assist the investigation is asked to DM @MerPolCC or message Merseyside Police Contact Centre on Facebook, quoting reference 20000772434. You can also pass information anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, or contact them via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
