Detectives investigating a burglary at student accommodation in Liverpool last December have charged a man in connection with three offences.

At around 5am on Friday 27 December 2019, entry was gained to Plato House on Greek Street and items including a television, DVD player, parcels and a hoover were stolen from the communal area. It is believed that those responsible returned later in the night so remove some of these items.

Following enquiries including forensic tests, 42-year-old Paul Mottram of Anfield Road in Anfield was arrested yesterday (Sunday 29 March) and has been charged with three counts of burglary.

He will appear at Liverpool Magistrates Court today, Monday 30 March.

Enquiries into this incident continue.
