We are continuing to investigate the unexplained death of a woman in Liverpool on Sunday 28 February.

At around 9.05am, officers were called to an address in Walton Road following reports of concern for the safety of a 37-year-old woman. Emergency services attended and she was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

Detectives investigating the sudden death are asking people not to speculate about the incident as further enquiries are carried out.

Detective Chief Inspector Paul Speight said: "The death of the woman is currently being treated as unexplained. The results are the post mortem were inconclusive and further tests will now be carried out to establish the cause of death.

"A 34 year-old man was arrested and interviewed and he has now been released on bail.

"I would ask people not to speculate about the circumstances of this woman's death while the investigation is ongoing as it can be hugely distressing for family and friends."

Anyone who could assist with enquiries is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111.
