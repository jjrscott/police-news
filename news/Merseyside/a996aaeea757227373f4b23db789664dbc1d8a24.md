We have arrested two men on suspicion of drug offences following a stop search in Southport on Monday, 22 March.

At around 3.20pm officers on patrol in Bath Street witnessed a suspected drugs transaction between two men.

The men were searched under the Misuse of Drugs Act and a significant amount of suspected Class A drugs was recovered.

A 25-year-old man from Birkenhead and a 51-year-old man from Birkdale were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply a Class A drug. They have been taken into custody for questioning.

Sefton Targeted Policing Inspector, Raymond Mavrakakis said: "Thanks to the swift response from our officer patrols, this suspected drug deal has been disrupted. Investigations continue but in the meantime we think this will serve as a strong deterrent to those looking to supply or purchase drugs.

"We patrol in and around the Southport area and across all the whole of Sefton, but should any members of the public see any similar behaviour or have concerns, get in touch and we will do the rest."

If you have any information about suspected drug dealing in your area, please contact @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. Always call 999 if a crime is in progress.
