We are appealing for witnesses after a man was shot and injured in Birkenhead this afternoon, Tuesday 26 November.

At 4.10pm, emergency services were called to the junction of Balls Road East and Borough Road to reports of shots being fired. It is initially believed that the passenger of a motorbike fired shots, before two motorbikes were ridden off towards Prenton Park.

Casings have been found at Shell Garage.

A short time later, a man was admitted to hospital with non life-threatening shoulder and leg injuries.

A road closure is in place at Balls Road and Borough Road and road users are advised to avoid the area.

Chief Inspector Kevin Chatterton said: "It is vital that we gather information about this incident as soon as possible. For shots to be fired on a main road during the afternoon is breathtakingly reckless and we're determined to find those responsible and remove them and their weapon from the streets.

"Did you see the shots fired, bikes ridden at speed away from the location, or have captured anything on CCTV, dashcam or other devices? Let us know, now.

"We understand the concern that such incidents have within our communities, especially in the light of other recent shootings in Merseyside. Across the force, our officers are working tirelessly to keep communities safe and remove weapons from those who choose to store, carry and use them. This work will not stop.

"Only today, local policing officers seized drugs and weapons including a firearm following a day of action in Birkenhead. Information from those communities affected by violent crime really does make a difference. If you keep telling us what you know, we'll see positive results. Stand together alongside us, and we'll all see how strong communities can be when they come together."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC or 101 with reference #634 of today. You can also pass information anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
