We're appealing for the publics help to identify the man in the CCTV.

Detectives investigating a burglary in Aintree earlier this month are issuing the image of a man who they think may have information.

At around 11.20pm on Sunday 1 September, entry was gained to a house on Bull Bridge Lane and keys were stolen for a Ford Fiesta and Mazda CX-5, which were stolen, along with a wallet and handbag, and cash cards. Both cars have since been recovered.

Detective Constable Peter Sloan said: "We think the man pictured may have information to help our investigation. If you recognise him, come forward and we will take the appropriate action.

"To be a victim of burglary is an extremely distressing experience, especially in this case when the occupants were upstairs as their home was invaded. We are determined to identify those responsible and bring them to justice."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC or 101 with reference 19100493972 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Note - 28-year-old Lewis Parry from St Paul's Close in Kirkby has been charged in connection with this offence and will next appear on Thursday 3 October at Liverpool Crown Court.
