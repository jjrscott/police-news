We are appealing for information following an injury shooting in Huyton this afternoon, Tuesday 1st September.

At 3pm, armed officers were called to Hathersage Road to reports of a shotgun being fired in the street. A woman in her 30s was taken to hospital for treatment to a minor facial wound. The victim is not initially believed to have been the target.

Officers will remain in the area to carry out forensic, CCTV, house-to-house and witness enquiries, and to speak to the local community.

Detective Chief Inspector Matt Smith of our Firearms Investigation Unit said: "We understand and share the disgust and disbelief that those in the community will feel to hear that such an incident has happened. For a gun to be fired in a residential area in broad daylight is awful, but thankfully the victim's injuries do not appear to be serious.

"Nonetheless, this will have been a horrific experience and we'll be speaking to her at the earliest opportunity to find out how she is.

"At this early stage, we are looking to speak to anyone who saw the incident, or saw or heard anyone acting suspiciously in the area around 3pm. You may live locally or been passing the area. Your information, dashcam or CCTV could be vital in finding out what went on and who was responsible.

"We're committed to acting on all information around gun crime and serious violence, both to put those involved before the courts, and to remove dangerous weapons from the streets. Tell us what you know and we'll take positive action."

If you have information about this incident, get in contact with reference 20000526785 via our social media desk on Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre'.

You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
