We are appealing for information after a burglary was reported at a house in Woolton today (Friday 20 September 2019).

At 2.55pm, police were called to the incident on Menlove Avenue where it was reported two men had forced entry to the house via a rear door, stealing items and damaging a front window.

They then left carrying two large bags, before driving away in a white Fiat Scudo van.

The offenders are described as one man who is white, 5ft 6in tall, with a shaved head and large build. The second man was white, around 5ft 10in tall and of slim build. Both wore high vis vests.

The van - which had smashed windows - was later abandoned on High Street, Woolton and the offenders are reported to have made off on foot after retrieving items from the back of the van.

A number of items have been recovered from the van by officers, including jewellery, purses and a camera.

Detective Inspector Jennie Beck said: "We believe this van was driven erratically following the incident, and had smashed windows, so would have been very distinctive to any passers-by and motorists.

"If you saw anything suspicious or were driving in the area between 2.55pm-3.20pm and might have dashcam footage, please contact us as you could have vital evidence that may help us bring those responsible to justice."

Anyone with information or dashcam footage is asked to contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police CC. You can also call 101 quoting incident reference 19100537604 or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
