We are appealing for information following reports of criminal damage in Newton-Le-Willows on Monday, 22 March.

At around 7.40pm, it was reported that three vehicles on Cross Lane had been damaged. It is believed that each of the cars had one of their windows smashed between 6pm-9pm that evening.

Nobody was injured during the incidents.

Inspector Robert Budden said: "We do not tolerate any anti-social behaviour on our streets. Everyone in Merseyside has the right to feel safe and protected where they live, and residents should be able to park outside their homes without fear of harassment or damage to their property.

"I would urge anyone who was in the Cross Lane area on Monday evening who may have seen or heard anything suspicious to come forward so we can find those responsible."

Anyone with information is asked to contact us via @MerPolCC or 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook or call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111, or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information with reference 21000183562.
