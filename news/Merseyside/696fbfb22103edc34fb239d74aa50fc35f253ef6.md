Two men have been charged after two guns were found during a day of action in Birkenhead in November last year.

Local Policing Team officers were carrying out a day of community activities on 26 November 2019, with partner agencies Regenda Housing and Wirral Council, in response to anti-social behaviour issues at flats on Penrith Street.

The officers conducted a search of the ground and located two firearms in undergrowth. One was a viable shotgun and the second was an air-powered rifle.

After further enquiries, two men were arrested and have now been charged in connection with the firearms.

David John Glass, 44 years, of Newling Street, Birkenhead and Lee Martin, 49 years, of Penrith Street, Birkenhead have been charged with possession of a Section 1 firearm. Martin has also been charged with breach of a Section 21 order.

They have been remanded in custody to appear at Liverpool Magistrates Court today (Wednesday 20 May 2020).
