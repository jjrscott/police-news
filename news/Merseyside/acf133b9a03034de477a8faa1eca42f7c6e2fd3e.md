Updated News Post

We are continuing to appeal for information following the injury shooting of a teenager in Prescot on Monday 20 January.

At 4.50pm, emergency services were called to Station Road to the report of the 17-year-old male being shot. He was taken to hospital with an injury to his abdomen. He remains in hospital in a stable condition.

CCTV, witness and forensic enquiries have been carried out and an investigation remains ongoing.

We also appealing to anyone who was in the vicinity of Station Road or the Cables retail park between 4.30pm and 5pm on that day who may have captured something on their dash-cam to contact us as they may have information which is vital to our investigation.

Detective Inspector Sabi Kaur said: "The area around Station Road and the retail park would have been busy that afternoon and drivers may not have realised they have captured something significant on their dash-cam.

"It is important of us that members of the community come forward with information so that we can take positive action. Action in recent weeks and months has brought down the number of shootings on our streets, and key to this is information from those communities affected."

You can contact us directly via @MerPolCC, by calling 101 or the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or report online at https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously.
