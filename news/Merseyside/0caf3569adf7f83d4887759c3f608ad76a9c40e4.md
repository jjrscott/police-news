We have arrested two men, one of whom has been charged, following the pursuit of a suspected stolen car in Anfield yesterday, Thursday 19 September.

At around 4pm, patrols sighted a suspected stolen Kia Seed on County Road. The car failed to stop and drove off at speed, causing damage to parked cars. It was abandoned on Muriel Avenue and two men were pursued on foot to Anfield Cemetery. Found in the car was a knife and cannabis. The car was recovered for forensic enquiries.
