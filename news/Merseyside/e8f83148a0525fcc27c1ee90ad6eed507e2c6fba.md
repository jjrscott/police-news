A third Section 60 order has been authorised in the Toxteth area this evening.

The order will begin at 4pm today (Monday 22 June) and conclude at 4am tomorrow (Tuesday 23 June).

The order follows recent tensions in the area including an incident on 19th June on Windsor Street where a group of people had been seen fighting just after 5pm. Following this, again on 19th June, at around 6:40pm, officers were called to reports of an assault where a man had self-presented at hospital with suspected stab wounds.

The order is specifically designed to minimise serious violence in the area and gives officers enhanced stop and search powers in a specified geographic location. On this occasion, in the area shown in the map (Upper Parliament St, Smithdown Road, Ullet Road and Park Road).

Anyone with info on crime being committed should contact @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK anonymously.
