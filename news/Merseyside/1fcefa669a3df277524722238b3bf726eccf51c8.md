A man has been charged with drug supply offences following a drugs warrant in Liverpool yesterday, Wednesday 6 November.

Following a warrant carried out in Everton, a 50-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of drug supply offences. Stephen Ryan from St Domingo Vale has now been charged with possession to supply cocaine and heroin.

Ryan has been kept in custody to appear at Liverpool Magistrates Court this morning, Thursday 7 November.

A 47-year-old woman from Kirkdale, arrested on suspicion of drug supply following a separate warrant, has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Targeted Team Inspector Jon Coote said: "Our warrants and disruption activity will continue in the coming days. If you hold any information about suspected drug supply or other serious and organised crime where you are, come forward and we will keep taking this positive action."
