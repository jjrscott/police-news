We are appealing for information following a serious assault in Kensington on Thursday, 25 June.

At around 7.30pm, officers were called to Boaler Street following reports the victim, a 52-year-old man was approached by a man and woman who briefly spoke to him, before the man punched him causing him to fall to the floor.

It is believed the offenders first appeared from an alley way on Boaler Street and made off on foot in the direction of Mansell Road.

The victim was taken to hospital for treatment to a serious head injury and remains in hospital in a stable condition.

An investigation is ongoing and anyone with information is asked to contact police.
