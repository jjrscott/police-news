Yesterday (13th Feb) officers were deployed to the Kirkdale, Anfield, Tuebrook & Toxteth areas carrying out a variety of policing activity.

The aim of these deployments were to reassure local communities, reduce crime and disorder, disrupt organised crime groups, gain intelligence and improve road safety.

As a result of the operation, 86 stop searches were carried out, 16 people were arrested for various drugs offences and lots of further intelligence was submitted to officers.

On the roads, two vehicles were seized and numerous traffic tickets were issued during a wider roads operation, along with over 40 cars which were stopped and a taxi believed to have been stolen was recovered parked near Netherfield Road.

Inspector Jordan Quinn said: "We hope that by proactively policing these areas, the public feel more inclined to speak to us about what concerns they have and how we can target criminals, take dangerous weapons and substances off our streets and keep our neighbourhoods as safe as they can be.

"Thanks to all those who took the time to speak to us yesterday. It is off the back of your feedback and our continued investigations that we are able to solve the problems that you identify.

"If you could take a minute to complete the following anonymous survey: https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/L8FEB2020 \- You can tell us what you want to see more of, your opinion on these style of deployments and where you'd like us to focus on next. This way, we can tailor our policing activity to fit your needs." #OpTarget
