We can confirm the motorbike rider who sadly died following a collision on New Chester Road, Wirral, on Friday, 19 March, has been named as 18-year-old Liam Houghton, from Rock Ferry.

His family have issued the following tribute:

"Liam was a free spirit, he had a heart of gold and he'd go out of his way to help others.

"He'll be missed by so many, life will never be the same again our jigsaw will always be missing a piece.

"A much loved son, brother, uncle, grandson and friend has been taken from us far too soon. The house feels so quiet and empty without you here with us."

The family have asked for privacy as they grieve for their loss.
