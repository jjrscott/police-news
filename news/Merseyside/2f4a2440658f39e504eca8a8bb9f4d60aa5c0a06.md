Detectives are issuing images of a man and woman we think may have information following the assault of a man in Walton last December.

At around 4.25pm on Friday 18 December, a homeless man in his 40s was sat outside Booze and More on County Road. He was kicked and punched by two people from a group outside, resulting in him sustaining injuries to his back, head and arm, which required hospital treatment.

CCTV and witness enquiries are ongoing.

Detective Constable Matthew Carlson said: "We think the man and woman pictured may have vital information to assist our enquiries, so if you know who they are please come forward.

"This was a brutal and unprovoked attack which caused the victim distress and injuries which left him in hospital. Violence will never be tolerated and we will take action to find those responsible and put them before the courts."
