We arrested three people on suspicion of drugs offences after a man on a bike was stopped by officers in St Helens.

Officers on patrol on Baxters Lane, on Saturday 24th October, saw a 41 year-old man on a pedal cycle without lights and asked him to stop. The man was searched under the Misuse of Drugs Act. A quantity of suspected drugs was recovered and the man was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs.

A nearby address was also searched.

A 21 year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs, possession with intent to supply Class A and B drugs and possession of a Class B controlled drug.

A quantity of white and brown powder and cannabis was discovered in the property and a 25 year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A and B drugs and possession of a Class B controlled drug. A number of mobile phones and a quantity of cash was also seized.

All three arrested have been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

St Helens Inspector Rob Budden said: "We are committed to keeping the communities of St Helens safe.

"I would ask anyone who has information about criminality, including drug dealing, in their neighbourhood to contact us so that we can take action."
