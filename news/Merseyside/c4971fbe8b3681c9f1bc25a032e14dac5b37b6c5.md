Officers from our Matrix team have yesterday (7th January) arrested three people in connection with drugs offences.

The three men were stopped whilst driving on Speke Boulevard at around 4:40pm. Whilst searching the car, officers recovered a large amount of cannabis.

The driver, a 22 year old man and two passengers, both 17 year old men, were all arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply a controlled drug.

A further search was conducted at all three addresses where at one home, connected to one of the 17 year olds, officers recovered a number of weapons and white powder, suspected as cocaine. This resulted in the man being further arrested for possession with intent to supply Class A drugs.

All three were taken to custody where they remain at this time as the investigation continues.

PSI Paul Dykhuizen said: "This is a great proactive arrest and shows what recoveries can be made following a stop search.

"We work continuously with the public and our partners to ensure that young people are not enticed into committing crime and I would urge anyone that has information on those involved or are worried that someone they know may be being exploited by a criminal gang, to please reach out to us.

"We are here to support those in need, protect and educate young people and try and deter them from getting involved in a criminal lifestyle, because sooner or later they will face serious consequences."#OpTarget
