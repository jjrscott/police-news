Detectives are appealing for information following a jewellery burglary in Old Swan in September.

On Thursday 24 September, the occupants of a house on Broad Green Road returned home to entry having been gained and gold jewellery was taken. CCTV and witness enquiries have been ongoing and we are now issuing images of the jewellery.

Detective Constable George Easterbrook said: "This jewellery has significant financial and sentimental value to the victims, who were understandably distressed to have had their home broken into while they were out. We're committed to doing all we can to identify and put before the courts those offenders who put victims through this ordeal, and in continuing to see burglaries decrease across the force.

"If you recognise any of the items, have been offered them for sale or know where they are, please let us know and we can reunite them with their rightful owners. Likewise, if you live in the Broad Green Road area and captured any images or footage from CCTV on that day, please check and let us know."

Always call 999 if a burglary is in progress. You can also pass information on this incident via our social media desk @MerPolCC on Twitter or 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook with reference 20000579628, or call the independent charity @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111. You can also contact them via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information. #OpCastle
