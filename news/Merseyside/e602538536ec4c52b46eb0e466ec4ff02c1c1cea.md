We have arrested and charged a 17-year-old male in connection with an investigation into County Lines drug dealing in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria.

Following a joint investigation by Merseyside Police and Cumbria Police, officers executed a warrant at an address in Clubmoor on Friday, 27 November, and seized a large amount of suspected crack cocaine and heroin.

The investigation is part of the ongoing Project Medusa, an operation led by Merseyside Police set up to tackle County Lines drug dealing and child criminal exploitation.

A 17-year-old male from Liverpool has been arrested and charged with conspiracy to supply class A drugs and human trafficking offences, and remanded into custody.
