Two men, aged 25 and 56 have been arrested for drugs offences following a vehicle stop check on Lind Street, Liverpool yesterday evening (13th October).

Officers were on patrol at around 6:30pm when they became suspicious of a Ford Galaxy driving in the area. The car was stopped and searched where officers found a significant quantity of cannabis hidden in a rucksack. The driver was also drug tested at the scene, where he tested positive for cocaine.

Two warrants were consequently executed at addresses on Emery Street where further drugs, evidence of cannabis cultivation and pepper spray was recovered, as well as at a property on Westminster Road where a small amount of drugs were located.

The 56 year old man was arrested on suspicion of drug driving, possession with intent to supply Class B, possession of a controlled drug and production of cannabis, whilst the 25 year old was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class B, production of cannabis and possession of a S5 firearm.

Both men spent the night in custody and have since been released under investigation.
