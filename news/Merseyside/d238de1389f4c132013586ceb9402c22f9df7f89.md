Officers have arrested two people and seized drugs and cash following a warrant in Netherton yesterday, Monday 1 June.

At 11.15am, entry was forced to a premises on Poulson Drive and suspected cocaine and cannabis seized, along with around Â£5,000 cash and other paraphernalia.

A 52-year-old woman and an 18-year-old man, both from Netherton, were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply drugs and taken to a police station for questioning. They have been released under investigation as enquiries continue.

Targeted Policing Sergeant Daniel Kirwin said: "These drugs have the potential to cause serious harm and attract violence to the area, and our investigation continues. Throughout lockdown, we've continued to act on the information we receive to target those we believe are causing harm in your community. Be alert of what is happening where you are, keep coming forward with what you know and we'll do the rest."

If you suspect that drugs are being stored or supplied in your community, pass information via our social media desk on Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre'.
