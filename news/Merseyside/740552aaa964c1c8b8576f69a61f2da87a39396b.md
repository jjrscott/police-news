We have released photographs of gold jewellery we would like to trace following reports of a burglary in Knotty Ash.

Between 8pm and 10pm on Tuesday 8 September 2020, unknown offenders forced entry to a family home on Newenham Crescent and stole cash along with items of gold jewellery, including necklaces, bracelets and rings.

Officers have carried out forensic enquiries and a CCTV search is ongoing.

Detective Constable George Easterbrook said: "This incident has understandably caused a great deal of distress for the family, who have had a number of sentimental jewellery pieces stolen belonging to adults and children in their household.

"We would ask anyone living in the Knotty Ash area to come forward if they have information, dash cam or CCTV footage which could help our investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting incident number 20000540975 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their online form: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information-online.
