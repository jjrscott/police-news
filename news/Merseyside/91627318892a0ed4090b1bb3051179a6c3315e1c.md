We are investigating after a man was assaulted in Liverpool city centre last night, Friday 13th November.

We were called at 7.25pm following reports a 21 year-old man had been assaulted on Water Street and suffered lacerations to his head. He was taken to hospital for treatment for his injuries which are not believed to be life threatening.

An investigation is underway and CCTV enquiries are being carried out.

Detective Inspector Phil Atkinson said: "It is believed the man was in the company of another male and they were walking down towards the Strand when a fight broke out. The second male is believed to have walked off down Convent Garden towards Tithebarn Street.

"Enquiries are ongoing to establish what has led up the incident and I would appeal to anyone who was in the area of Water Street at around 7.25pm last night who saw anything or has any information to get in touch."

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has any information which could assist the investigation is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK quoting reference 20000691418.
