Detectives are appealing for information following an injury shooting in Liverpool this evening, Sunday 10 January.

At 8.20pm, armed police were called to Ashover Avenue, Dovecot to reports of a man in his 30s being found with gunshot wounds to his legs. He was taken to hospital for assessment of his injuries. Initial enquiries suggest that the victim was shot in the area of Queens Drive and Lowerson Road, Clubmoor.

Officers remain in both areas to carry out initial enquiries, including house-to-house, forensics and CCTV to establish the circumstances.

Detective Chief Inspector Rachel Wilson said: "In this very early stage of the investigation, we're keen to speak to anyone who was in either area at the time and saw this incident, or anything suspicious. Your information, CCTV, dashcam or other footage might prove vital as we find out exactly what happened.

"Firearms incidents have decreased in recent months, and we're determined to keep reducing them for all of those communities affected. Tell us what you know and we'll take positive action to remove those responsible and their weapon from the streets."

You can contact us by DM via our social media desk on Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' with incident reference 748.

You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
