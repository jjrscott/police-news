We have arrested a woman on suspicion of assaulting a police officer following an incident in Earlestown on Tuesday 2nd February.

At around 1.35pm, officers on patrol in Market Street challenged a woman who was not wearing a mask in Wilko's. The woman refused to supply details or any exemption, and reportedly bit an officer, resulting in them receiving hand injuries.

A 46-year-old woman from Ashton-in-Makerfield was arrested on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker and breaching Covid requirements.

She has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Community Policing Chief Inspector Paul Holden said: "Our police officers and staff work tirelessly, carefully protecting themselves and those we serve, in order to keep all our communities safe. To see colleagues assaulted or threatened when carrying out these vital duties is absolutely sickening. We're here to keep those essential shop workers and follow customers safe from people who flagrantly ignore and abuse the rules.

"I'd continue to ask everyone to please consider their own safety and that of their loved ones. These laws apply to all of us, and the infection rates remain high in St Helens, so it's more important than ever that we all adhere to them.

"There are reasons to be hopeful, and to believe these frustrating times will look brighter soon. Progress is being made with vaccinations but we still need to do everything we can to protect our communities, the NHS and our own frontline staff. We'll not hesitate to keep taking action when we believe people are flouting the rules."
