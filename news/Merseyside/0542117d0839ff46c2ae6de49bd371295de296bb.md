Can you help? Liverpool and Wirral Coroner's Office is appealing for the family of a man from Tuebrook who recently passed away to come forward.

Lee Rudd, 44 years, lived in Newsham Drive and sadly died in the Royal Liverpool Hospital on Sunday 17 November.

His death is not being treated as suspicious.
