Police are appealing for information following a fire in the Dingle in the early hours of this morning (Sunday 7 February).

At around 1.40am police received a report that a front door of a house on Beaufort Street had been deliberately set alight by two men.

One of the men was reported to have made off from the scene on an electric bike and the other made off on foot.

They are described as of slim build, wearing masks and hoods. One was wearing a black jacket with a shiny emblem and another was wearing light coloured tracksuit bottoms.

Nobody was present at the address at the time of the incident and damage is not believed to have spread beyond the front door of the property.

The incident is being treated as arson and CCTV and witness enquiries are ongoing.

Detective Inspector Amy Smith said, "Thankfully no-one was injured during this incident, but the consequences could have been far worse for the neighbours if the fire had spread.

"If you witnessed the incident or saw anyone acting suspiciously in the area, we would urge you to come forward. Likewise, if you have any CCTV or dash cam footage that could assist with the investigation, please let us know so we can take action and find those responsible."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC on Twitter, 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook, call 101 or the independent charity @CrimestoppersUK anonymously, on 0800 555 111, with reference 21000081390.
