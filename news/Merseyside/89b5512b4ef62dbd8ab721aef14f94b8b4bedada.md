Officers in Liverpool are appealing for the public to be vigilant following the theft of a car containing a large quantity of prescription medication.

The car, described as a black Jaguar F-Pace, was reported stolen from an address in Childwall at around 8am this morning (Monday, 27 July.)

The car contained a large quantity of prescription medication, and officers would like to remind members of the public that taking medication which is not prescribed for them can be harmful and can even prove fatal.

Officers would urge anyone who has seen this car to DM @MerPolCC or call 101, quoting reference 177 of 27 July. Anyone who comes across the medication is asked to hand it into their nearest pharmacy, or police station.
