We are appealing for witnesses after a man was stabbed in Netherton on Saturday, 4 January.

Around 9.10pm, emergency services were called to Sarahs Croft, following reports that a 19-year-old man sustained a stab wound to his leg after being attacked by two men on electric bikes.

The victim was taken to hospital for a non-life threatening injury where he was treated for a superficial cut and discharged.

CCTV, witness and forensic enquiries are ongoing in a bid to identify the offenders and anyone with information is asked to come forward.

Detective Inspector Catherine Walsh, said: "An investigation is underway to establish the full circumstances of this assault and we are keen to hear from anyone with information.

"If you were in Netherton and saw or heard anything suspicious on Saturday night or have dash-cam footage of the incident, the offenders or the victim, please get in touch."

Anyone with information, dash-cam or CCTV footage is asked to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 quoting reference 20000009484 , or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
