We are welcoming the sentencing of a St Helens man to prison for the assault of his ex-partner last June.

21-year-old Liam Connolly of Lapwing Close in Newton-le-Willows was sentenced to two years and two months for assault at Liverpool Crown Court yesterday, Monday 10 August.

In the early hours of Thursday 2 June, 2019, Connolly broke into the home of his former partner by smashing the window, and then assaulted her. The victim sustained a fractured jaw and cuts and bruises.

Connolly was arrested following enquiries and was charged with Section 18 assault and criminal damage.

Speaking after the case, Detective Inspector Leanne Hobin said: "Connolly is a dangerous person with a history of violence. We share the victim's relief and satisfaction that he has now been dealt with by the courts, and I'm sure our wider communities feel the same.

"The victim has shown immense bravery in supporting this prosecution and can hopefully sleep easier in the knowledge that Connolly will be behind bars. To be a victim of such frightening violence, and then go through the additional stress of a court case, is extremely tough and we continue to support her as she comes to terms with the events of last June.

"We have specially trained officers who will be with you every step of the way, if you or someone close to you can find the courage to come forward.

"There is plenty of help out there to anyone who may be suffering domestic abuse of any kind and together with partner agencies, we will do all that we can to make you safe.

"Domestic abuse can happen to anyone. Likewise, I would ask everyone to look out for your family members, friends or neighbours that may be suffering, as by contacting us you could be helping someone who is too afraid to help themselves. Everything you tell us is taken extremely seriously and will be investigated thoroughly.

"We want you to know that we are here to help, so please talk to us."

If you have any non-urgent information on domestic abuse - if you are a victim or believe someone you know is a victim - you can contact direct message @MerPolCC on Twitter, 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook or contact @CrimestoppersUK, anonymously on 0800 555 111. Always call 999 in an emergency.
