Officers in Garston yesterday (13th August) arrested a 48 year old woman, 45 year old man and 17 year old teenager for multiple offences following an incident on Chesterton Street.

Just before 7pm, plain clothed officers spotted what they believed to be a drugs transaction taking place. They approached the 17 year old male who was detained and subsequently arrested on suspicion of being connected in the supply of a Class B drug.

Following this, officers attended at the property to conduct a search where they located the other man and woman, both of whom were consequently arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A and B drugs and possession of ammunition without a certificate. Cannabis plants and other drugs paraphernalia were recovered and seized.

All three were taken to custody for questioning.

Sergeant Hamilton said "Plain clothed officers are hugely successful when it comes to identifying offenders. Along with this, we use a variety of tactics to seek out criminals and take dangerous substances and weapons off our streets."

If you have any information regarding someone who is connected with the distribution of drugs or is in possession of any illegal weapons, please get in touch @MerPolCC #OpTarget
