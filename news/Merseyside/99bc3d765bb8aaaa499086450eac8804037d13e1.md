Officers have charged a 52 year old man with affray and possession of a bladed article.

Our #OpTarget team arrested Terrance Gibney, from Liverpool following a stop check on Monday 14th December after he had reportedly threatened two other people with a knife outside the YMCA on Leeds Street.

The knife was seized and he was taken to custody where he was charged and appeared at court today (15th December).

Here, he pleaded guilty to the offences and was bailed to appear at Liverpool Crown Court in January.

Anyone that knows someone carrying a knife or other weapon should get in touch, they are dangerous and those that carry them are putting their own and other people's safety at significant risk.
