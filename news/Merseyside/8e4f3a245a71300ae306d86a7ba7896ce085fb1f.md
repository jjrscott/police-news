We're urgently appealing for the public's help in tracing John Hartless, who is missing from home.

John, aged 73, is missing from his home in Waresley Crescent, Walton, and was last spoken to at around 9.30pm on Tuesday, 2 March.

He is described as a white male, around 6ft tall, of stocky build, with a pale complexion and short grey hair.

It is believed John was last seen wearing dark tracksuit bottoms and a pale blue t-shirt with black slippers. He also wears glasses.

We are becoming increasingly concerned for John's whereabouts and anyone who has seen him is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 or the charity missing people on 116 000.
