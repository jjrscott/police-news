Twenty-one 21 people who breached coronavirus legislation by holding a party at a house in Kensington last night (Friday, 2 October) have been fined.

Calls were received shortly before 11pm from people concerned that a party was being held at the address on Cotswold Street, Kensington.

A total of 21 fines were issued with fixed penalty notices for breach of Covid-19 legislation. A small amount of drugs was also recovered and a man will be interviewed in relation to the find at a later date.

Chief Inspector Karl Baldwin, said: "The Liverpool city region is currently in a really precarious position in relation to the potential spread of Covid-19 and we have seen the numbers of those tested positive rising sharply. As a result the region has been put in special measures by the Government and from 3am further restrictions have been placed on the area. Sadly, some people are not recognising the critical position the region finds itself in and through their ill-thought out actions are inadvertently putting others at risk.

"The overwhelming majority of our communities are being really responsible in what are difficult and for many anxious times. They are selflessly making huge sacrifices for the sake
of the NHS as well as the health of themselves and others.

"Unfortunately last night these people did not show any understanding, or respect for others, and flagrantly ignored Government and went against the guidance to only meet indoors with your own family, or bubble.

Chief Inspector Baldwin, added: "We will maintain our common sense approach in the days and weeks ahead, encouraging the people our officers meet on patrol to respect the restrictions and explaining to people why they are so important. And where people are flouting the restrictions we will take action, on Friday evening alone we have issued 29 separate fines to people who have been holding parties and gatherings in breach of the Government guidance."

"I would appeal to our communities to adhere to the guidance to keep your loved ones and ours safe.

"The safety of vulnerable people in Merseyside and our key healthcare workers should be everyone's priority, and I hope everyone now understands the risks to themselves and others of not listening to government advice. In order to return to normality as soon as possible, we need to work together and follow that advice."
