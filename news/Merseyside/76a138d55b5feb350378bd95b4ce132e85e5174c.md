We have arrested three teenagers following an incident in the early hours of this morning (Tuesday 26 January) in St Helens.

At around 3am, officers were called to Frodsham Drive to reports of suspected stolen Peugeot colliding with a lamppost. The car made off and was abandoned on Park Road a short time later, with three occupants making off.

Officers supported by the National Police Air Service (NPAS) helicopter searched the area.

A 14-year-old boy and a 15-year-old boy were detained nearby and a second 15-year-old boy was detained later following enquiries.

They are all in police stations awaiting questioning on suspicion of aggravated unauthorised taking of a motor vehicle.
