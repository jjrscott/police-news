Detectives investigating the 2019 murder of James Taylor in Liverpool have arrested two more men following activity this week.

At around 8pm on Thursday 7 February 2019, emergency services were called to Addison Street, near to Liverpool City Centre, to reports of shots being fired. 34-year-old James was pronounced deceased at the scene.

Since the murder of James, a total of 17 people have now been arrested in connection with the investigation, and who remain under investigation. This week, the following people were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder:
A 26-year-old man from Anfield
A 43-year-old man of no fixed abode

In addition to the arrests, two men from the Salford area (a 50-year-old and a 34-year-old) voluntarily attended for interview.

All four men have been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Detective Chief Inspector Rachel Wilson, who is leading the investigation, said: "These arrests are a result of extensive enquiries that continue two years on from the brutal murder of James, a father-of-six whose death continues to cause devastation to his family and his friends.

"As time moves on, and we continue to make progress in the investigation, we're hopeful that people who still hold information will keep coming forward. You may now be in a different situation and now feel more confident in speaking up. Please do so, for James's loved ones, and to make all our streets safer.

"If you're still feeling fearful about repercussions, we do understand, but there are ways to tell us in confidence. We'll deal sensitively with anything you tell us."
