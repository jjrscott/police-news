Officers in Wirral are introducing a Section 60 order in Tranmere and Rock Ferry this evening (Tuesday 16 February) following incidents of assault and criminal damage yesterday (Monday 15 February).

The Section 60 will begin at 6pm today and remain in place until 4am tomorrow (Wednesday 17 February).

The Order, under S60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, gives officers enhanced stop and search powers to stop males aged 16-50 in the area (pictured) and is designed to minimise serious violence.

The area covered by the order is bounded by Bedford Avenue, Rock Ferry on to Bedford Road, to New Chester Road, the A41 to Borough Road, on to Storeton Road and Mount Road and Bedford Avenue.

Community Inspector Tom Welch said: "Following assaults and criminal damage in the area covered by this order, we have introduced this Section 60 in order to prevent further incidents.

"We regularly patrol Tranmere and Rock Ferry, and I hope the people who live there will welcome the fact they will see more of our officers out in force this evening.

"Officers will not be troubling people going about their business and if you see us in the street then please do come and say hello, and feel free to share any information or concerns you may have, and we will take positive action."
