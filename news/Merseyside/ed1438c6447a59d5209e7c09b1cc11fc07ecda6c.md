Detectives are appealing for witnesses following an injury shooting in Walton last night (Thursday, 7 November 2019).

A report was received at about 9.50pm from a member of the public stating that a man had been shot.

Emergency services attended and paramedics provided treatment at the scene to the 43-year-old victim, who had suffered a gunshot wound to his back, which is not believed to be life threatening. He has been taken to hospital where he is being treated.

Officers believe the incident occurred by the roundabout at the top of Richard Kelly Drive near to Queens Drive and the offender is believed to have been on foot.

Crime scene investigators are carrying out forensic examinations at the scene and house-to-house inquiries are underway. Officers will also be looking at CCTV from the area in a bid to identify the offender, who was not seen by the victim.

High visibility patrols have be stepped up in the area to reassure the local community.

Detective Inspector Paul Speight, said: "I would like to reassure the local community that we will be doing possible to find the person responsible. The force is committed to tackling gun crime, but we can't do it on our own. We need people from the community who may have any information which could help us to contact us. The area around Richard Kelly Drive is always busy, if you saw anyone acting suspiciously please call. Any information provided will be acted upon. Help us to put this person where he belongs - behind bars. If you have any information at all, which may help us piece together the evidence we require, please call."
