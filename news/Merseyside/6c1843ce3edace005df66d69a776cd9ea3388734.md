We are today, Tuesday 13th October, appealing for information on the six month anniversary of the murder of Kyle Whitley.

Eighteen year-old Kyle was fatally stabbed in Vincent Road, Litherland, on the afternoon of Monday 13th April this year.

He was taken to hospital by ambulance but sadly died.

A murder investigation remains ongoing. To date five people have been arrested in connection with Kyle's murder and remain under investigation.

We are appealing for anyone who was in the area of Vincent Road, between 2pm and 3pm on 13th April who haven't already spoken to us to get in touch as they may have information which is vital to our investigation.

We are also asking for anyone who was in the surrounding area who may have captured something on CCTV or dash-cam camera to contact us.

Detective Chief Inspector Mark Baker said: "This was horrific assault carried out in broad daylight and which led to the untimely death of an 18 year-old man.

"Our investigation into the murder remains ongoing and we remain committed to finding the person responsible for Kyle's death.

"It has obviously been a distressing six months for Kyle's family as they try to come to terms with what happened and I would ask anyone who has any information which could help get them the answers they are looking for to come forward and speak to us."

Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC or contact @Crimestoppers anonymously quoting reference 20000215637.
