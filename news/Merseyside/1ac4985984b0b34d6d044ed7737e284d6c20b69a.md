ORIGINAL

We are appealing for witnesses following an incident in which a passenger on a bus in St Helens suffered a serious head injury.

At around 1.10pm today, Saturday 22nd February, an elderly woman had been on an Arriva bus on Borough Road when it is believed a white van stopped suddenly infront of the bus causing the bus driver to brake.

As a result the woman sustained a head injury and had to be taken to hospital where she is currently in a critical condition.

The van did not stop at the scene and we are appealing for the driver of the van, or anyone who saw the incident to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or the Roads Policing Unit on 0151 777 5747 quoting log 438 of 22nd February.
