Officers are appealing for any information in regards to a shotgun that was found by an eight year old child this afternoon (21st June).

We were called at around 2:20pm following reports that a young boy had found a loaded shotgun in a fenced off area outside an electrical generator along Kingsheath Avenue, Knotty Ash.

Armed officers were deployed to the scene and have completed a further search of the area. The incident has now been stood down.

Chief Inspector Peter Clark said: "On this occasion, the young boy has been extremely lucky that he hasn't come to any harm after finding this gun. He managed to take the weapon to his grandmas who rightly called the police straight away - but it sends shivers down my spine to think what could have happened. It is hugely worrying that whilst children are out playing, that they can find such a dangerous weapon like this.

"I would urge anyone that has seen someone acting suspiciously to get in touch with us. It is not safe at all to handle guns, store, use or hide guns. If you know who this might belong to, get in touch quoting crime ref: 20000361262 and if you know anyone involved in criminal activity, let us know."
