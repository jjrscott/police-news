Wanted

12:39 15/01/2021

Have you seen this man? 32-year-old Michael Sands from Crosby is wanted on recall to prison.

Sands was released from prison on 27 October 2020 after serving part of a sentence for manslaughter. He was jailed following an incident in Netherton on 5 June 2010 which led to the death of 18-year-old Neil Murphy.

Sands has since breached the conditions of his licence, which has now been revoked and a prison recall issued.

He is white, 5ft 7in tall, of medium build, with short brown hair, facial hair and blue eyes. He speaks with a Liverpool accent.

He is known to have links to the Sefton area particularly Netherton, Bootle and Crosby.

Anyone who believes they have seen Sands recently is asked to contact @MerPolCC on Twitter or call 101 quoting reference 20000789643. You can also pass on information anonymously via the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously
