Detectives investigating the knifepoint robbery of a bike in Litherland earlier this week have arrested a teenager.

At around 7.30pm on Monday 22 February, the victim, a 13-year-old boy, was walking with friends near to the canal bridge close to Sefton Street, towards Tesco. The group were approached by three males, one of whom reportedly produced a knife and made threats. The victim's bike was taken and the males made off.

Following enquiries, a 15-year-old boy from West Derby was arrested on suspicion of robbery and taken to a police station for questioning. He has been released on conditional bail.

The suspected stolen bike has also been recovered.
