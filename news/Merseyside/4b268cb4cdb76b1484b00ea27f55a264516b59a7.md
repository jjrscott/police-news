We are aware of footage circulating on social media today (Saturday 20 March) which shows a man dressed in a police uniform who appears to be acting suspiciously.

We received reports of this at around 4.20pm in Costcutters on Cemetery Road, Southport, and outside Tesco on Liverpool Road where he was reported by a member of the public to be drinking from a bottle of alcohol.

Officers attended the scene and established that the man was not a police officer and he was subsequently detained.

The man, aged 37, from Birkdale, was arrested on suspicion of drink driving, impersonating a police officer and possession of an offensive weapon

He has been taken into custody and will be questioned by police.

We would like to reassure the community that the man in the video footage is not a serving police officer and stress that he has now been arrested for his actions.

If you suspect anyone is driving under the influence of drink or drugs, please contact us on 999 if a crime is in progress, or pass information via @MerPolCC on Twitter, 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook, or the independent charity @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111. You can also contact them via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
