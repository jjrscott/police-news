This is a handgun found by a member of the public in Halewood last week.

The gun was found in woods off Hever Drive, forensically examined and found to be a modified, viable, Section 5 firearm.

Community Policing Chief Inspector Phil Mullally said: "Every firearm and other weapon we seize from the streets makes our communities safer. All types of viable and imitation firearm have the capability to cause fear, distress and harm to those who are shot at, threatened or accidentally come across them in public spaces.

"We act on information from local residents to take such positive action so I would encourage anyone who knows where firearms and other weapons are being stored, carried and used to let us know and we will do the rest.

"You can contact us via our social media desk @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, a charity which is completely independent of police."
