We have issued CCTV images of two men we would like to speak to following an assault in Prescot.

At around 7pm on Tuesday 21st July a 43 year-old man was on Station Road, close to Cables Retail Park, when four men got out of black Ford Focus car and started to assault him. It is believed some of the offenders may have been armed with bricks.

The man was able to make his escape and run towards the retail park.

He suffered swelling to his head and cuts and grazes to his face.

An investigation is underway and enquiries have been carried out in the local area.

We have issued CCTV images of two men we want to trace as we believe they have information which is vital to our investigation.

Detective Sergeant Leanne Toole said: "This was a nasty and unprovoked assault. It would still have been light when it happened and I am sure the retail park and surrounding roads would have been busy.

"I would ask anyone who was in the area that night who saw anything or captured anything on dash cam footage to come forward.

"I would also ask anyone who recognises the men, or the men themselves, to come forward and speak to us."

Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 20000431050.
