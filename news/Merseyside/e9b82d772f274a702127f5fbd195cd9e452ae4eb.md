We're issuing an image of an electric bike recently stolen during a robbery in Islington on Wednesday 29 January.

At around 1.30am, the owner of the orange and black KTM electric mountain bike (pictured) - a 48-year-old man, who uses it to help with mobility issues - was assaulted on William Henry Street by three males.

The offenders then took the bike.

Enquiries are ongoing to reunite the electric bike with its owner.

Detective Constable Christopher Cook said: "We would urge anyone with information about this incident to get in touch.

"This theft has deprived the owner of a vital means of going about his day-to-day activities, causing disruption and distress.

"If you have seen the bike, know of its whereabouts or have been offered it for sale, please get in touch with us.

"You may have seen a group of males acting suspiciously in the Islington area in the early hours of Wednesday, or the bike may have been offered to you sale.

"If you have any information of the whereabouts of the bike, please get in touch and help bring justice to those responsible."
