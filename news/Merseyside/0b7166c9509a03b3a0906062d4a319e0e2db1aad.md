Do you recognise this man?

We are investigating the assault of a man in Huyton and believe this man could have information that may assist our enquiries.

A report was received at about 3.45am on Thursday 5 December 2019 that a 59-year-old man had been assaulted in a doorway at Knowsley Heights on Primrose Drive.

It was reported he was awoken at 3.30am before being struck to the head with poles or bars by a group of men after he came to the door.

The victim sustained injuries to his head and arms, and was treated at Whiston Hospital for fractures to his arm and face and lacerations to his head.

Detectives are exploring the possibility that it was a case of mistaken identity.

A 34-year-olod man from Huyton was arrested on suspicion of Section 18 wounding and later released under investigation.

Detective Constable Louise Wood said: "This was a nasty, unprovoked attack and while we have arrested one man, we are keen to make progress with this investigation so that all those responsible are brought to justice.

"We are appealing for anyone who recognises the man pictured to contact us as we believe he could have information that may prove a vital part of our enquiries."
