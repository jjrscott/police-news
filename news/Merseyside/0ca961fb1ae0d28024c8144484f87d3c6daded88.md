Officers in Southport have arrested two men and seized drugs and cash following an incident yesterday, Sunday 12 July.

At around 4.50pm, officers sighted a vehicle of interest on Lord Street and requested the vehicle stopped. The driver stopped but a second occupant ran off towards Hoghton Street. He was pursued and detained.

The driver was also detained. Following searches, more than 150 wraps of suspected heroin and crack cocaine were seized.

A 36-year-old man and a 29-year-old man, both of no fixed abode, were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply drugs, and taken to a police station for questioning as enquiries continue.

Southport Community Policing Inspector Graham Fisher said: "We respond to all information about suspected drug dealing and possession, which has such a devastating impact within our communities.

"If you know anything about people, locations or vehicles you believe to be involved in such activity, come forward and we will continue to take positive action and reduce the harm of drugs on our streets."
