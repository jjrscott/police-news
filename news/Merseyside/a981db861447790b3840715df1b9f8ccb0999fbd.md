Op Target patrols descended on the Walton area where they seized a revolver and ammunition amongst other things.

Yesterday (17th December), teams came together to conduct a warrant on an address on Albany Road following intelligence suggesting a cannabis farm was being grown at the location.

They forced entry into the property as one person attempted to escape from the back of the property. Luckily officers were already waiting to catch him.

The 53 year old man was detained and taken back inside the property whilst a 32 year old man managed to make off but was eventually caught on the Loop Line.

Inside the property, officers found a cannabis farm comprising of around 40 plants, a quantity of dried cannabis, white powder, one live firearm; an Ekol Arda 4mm Flobert and associated bullets as well as a blank firer and other rounds of ammunition.

Both men were arrested on suspicion of drugs and firearms offences and taken to custody where they currently remain.

Inspector Geoff Stewart said "There is no doubt in my mind that regardless of whether a weapon is live or not, they are used to cause fear in our communities. The recovery of this live firearm means we have potentially saved a life and prevented further acts of serious violence."
