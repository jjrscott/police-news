Detectives investigating a fatal road traffic collision last week in Stockbridge Village are issuing a renewed appeal for information today, Wednesday, 29 April.

At around, 2.30pm on Monday 20 April, emergency services were called to Waterpark Drive to reports that a black Vauxhall Astra and a white Honda scrambler bike had been involved in a collision. Two 22-year-old men were taken to hospital. The second man is now in a stable condition.

A 27-year-old man from Huyton arrested last week on suspicion of attempted murder has been released on conditional bail pending further enquiries.

Detective Inspector Tony O'Brien said: "Our extensive enquiries continue and we particularly want to speak to a van driver who may have witnessed the collision or recorded vital dashcam footage. If this was you, please come forward as soon as possible.

"We still want to ensure we have heard from anyone else who saw the collision or aftermath, and who may have vital information or evidence to assist, be that dashcam, home CCTV or footage from any other device. What you think is trivial could be the key to establishing exactly what happened in this tragic incident, so let us make the assessment and take the appropriate action."

We'd urge anyone with information to contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre'.

You can also call 101 quoting incident reference 20000228977, or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
