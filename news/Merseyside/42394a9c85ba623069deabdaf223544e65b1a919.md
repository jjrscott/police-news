We are appealing for help in locating 33 year-old Steven Cargin.

Officers investigating allegations of stalking and harassment would like to speak to him as they believe he has information which could assist their investigation.

Cargin, whose last known address was in the Huyton area, is described as a white male, 5ft 9in tall, of proportionate build, with dark brown hair and blue eyes.

Anyone who has seen Cargin or knows of his whereabouts is asked to DM @MerPolCC or contact @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111.
