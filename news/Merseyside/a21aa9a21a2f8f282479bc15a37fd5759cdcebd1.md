We recovered a Taser-type device yesterday (Saturday 9 November) after receiving reports it was being stored at a property in Tranmere.

Officers attended the address after receiving a call at about 8.35am and seized the electronic conductive device - known as a Taser - which was designed to look like a torch.

A 20-year-old woman from Tranmere was arrested on suspicion of possession of a Section 5 firearm and interviewed. She has been released under investigation.

Chief Inspector Pete Clark said: "This is yet another example of how crucial the public can be in our work to combat the use of weapons in Merseyside.

"We will act on all reports of them being stored in our communities, and are grateful for those who brought this Taser to our attention.

"Every weapon taken out of circulation represents a step forward in our efforts to prevent them being used to threaten, intimidate and hurt people in Merseyside."

If you know where a weapon is being stored, DM @MerPolCC on Twitter, message 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook, call 101 or contact independent charity @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111.
