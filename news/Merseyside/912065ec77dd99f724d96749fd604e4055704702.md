Detectives investigating disorder in Liverpool City Centre last month are issuing a fourth set of images of people we wish to speak to.

The photos circulated today show fives males who were near the junction of the Strand and Brunswick Street on the night of Friday 26 June.

Since the incidents, a total of 22 people have been arrested for incidents including affray, disorder and criminal damage.

Detective Chief Inspector Cheryl Rhodes said: "Thanks to everyone who has come forward so far with information, which has led to more than 20 arrests to date.

"We'll keep issuing these images and appeals to identify suspects and witnesses as we continue to go through the evidence. These particular people were in and around Jurgen's Bierhaus at the junction of the Strand and Brunswick Street on the night of the disorder, so if you know them, contact us with the photo number and we'll do the rest.

"These large gatherings put unnecessary strain on all of the emergency services at this time, put the safety of those attending at risk. They also significantly raise the chances of more lockdown measures to be reversed in certain areas, which would affect everyone in Merseyside."

Come forward with the reference number if you know anyone pictured, let us know by emailing Operation.Precinct@merseyside.police.uk or anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
