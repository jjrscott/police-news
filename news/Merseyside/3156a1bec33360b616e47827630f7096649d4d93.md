The family of Paula Leather, who died at her home address in Prescot on Monday, have this evening, Thursday 19th November, issued the follow tribute:

Our gorgeous Mum has sadly been taken away from us in the most tragic of circumstances.

Paula was beautiful inside and out; so kind, so loving and she was the person that was there for everyone. She was the mum of Jason, Jessica and Matthew and the proudest nanny to her first grandson.

Paula was devoted to siblings Karen, Ian and Peter, to her large loving family and to her wonderful friends. She was a beautiful soul within her community with a smile to light up the world.

Mum will be missed beyond words but the life, the love and the memories we shared together will live on forever.

Please respect our privacy at this time.

As a family and in the memory of our beautiful mum Paula, we would like to take this opportunity to raise awareness to the support out there if you are experiencing domestic abuse or to those affected by it.
