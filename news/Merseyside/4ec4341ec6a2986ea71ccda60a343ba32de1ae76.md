Detectives investigating the assault of a jogger in New Brighton last month are today, Tuesday 16th February, appealing for a woman who was also running in the area to get in touch.

At around 7.10am on Tuesday 12th January, officers received a report that a man in his 50s had been struck on the head with a piece of wood by two males near to the Black Pearl on New Brighton promenade.

The man was taken to hospital with a serious head injury but has since been released and continues to recover at home.

It is believed that prior to the assault a woman was seen running around 50m-100m ahead of the man and may have seen the two males with the wood.

Detectives are now appealing for her to come forward.

Detective Inspector Darren Taylor said: "We believe that there were number of people around the New Brighton prom area that morning. In particular we believe that a woman was running ahead of the victim and may have side stepped away from the two males who were in possession of the wood.

"We would ask that woman to come forward to speak to us as we believe she may have information which is vital to our investigation."

The woman, or anyone who knows her, or anyone who witnessed the incident and hasn't yet come forward is asked to DM @MerPolCC or contact @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 21000023545.

 * Two 15-year-old males were arrested on suspicion of Section 18 assault and have been released under investigation as enquiries continue.
