Officers were called to the Loopline near Wapshare Road, Norris Green on Friday afternoon (9th October) following reports that ammunition was being hidden nearby.

Officers from our #OpTarget team conducted an open land search where they located over 50 rounds of live ammunition hidden in Tupperware boxes.

All items were seized and taken away for further forensic examination.

Detective Inspector Sabi Kaur said: "This is a great find and I'd like to thank the members of the public who reported their concerns to us which ultimately led to the recovery of this ammunition.

"It is so lucky that we have found this now and that it hadn't fallen into the wrong hands. This recovery is part of our ongoing efforts to keep the Loopline and surrounding area safe and I'd encourage anyone with information on who this ammunition might belong to or how it came about being hidden here, to get in touch.

"In this case, the ammunition has been sent off for forensic analysis and we will be viewing local CCTV footage in a bid to identify those responsible.

"Anyone with information on this recovery, should contact us @MerPolCC quoting: 20000612092. Alternatively, if you know where other weapons or dangerous substances are being hidden, please don't hesitate to get in touch with us." #OpTarget
