We are issuing the CCTV image of a man who may have information following the burglary of a cargo handling business in Walton.

At around 12.10am on Wednesday 1 January, a report was received of entry being gained to Tiptrans on Parkinson Road. Upon arrival, alarms had activated and it was found that packages had been stolen and damage caused.

Items including crowbars were found near to the premises and forensically seized. CCTV and witness enquiries have been ongoing.

Detective Constable Chris Cook said: "We would like to speak to the man pictured as he may have information to assist these enquiries.

"A number of packages were stolen and damage caused in this incident. We are working closely with the business to find those responsible and put them before the courts.

"If you live locally and saw anyone acting suspiciously around this time or have home or business CCTV, please let us know and we will take action.

"All crime against local businesses causes distress and inconvenience to those who work hard in our communities. Pass any info via @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 with reference 20000003166."
