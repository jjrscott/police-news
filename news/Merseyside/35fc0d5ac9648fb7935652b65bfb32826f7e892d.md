Merseyside Police can confirm a fourth man has been charged in connection with the murder of Stephen Maguire.

Patrick Moogan, 34 years of no fixed abode appeared at Liverpool Magistrates Court this afternoon, Wednesday 23 September, charged with murder, kidnap, robbery and possession of a firearm and ammunition.
