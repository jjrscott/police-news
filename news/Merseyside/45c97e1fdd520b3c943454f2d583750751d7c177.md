We have arrested a man today (Friday 17 January 2020) on suspicion of assault after incidents in Eccleston in the past week.

At around 10.30pm on Friday 10 January, a man in his 40s was walking his dog near to Bobbies Lane and Griffin Close when he passed a man. The man ran up to him and punched the victim in the stomach, before running away.

A further incident occurred at around 9.30pm on Sunday 12 January on Church Walk, in which a man in his 40s was walking his dog and was approached by a man who told him to stop his dog barking. The man then ran towards the victim and pushed him, before again running off.

A 19-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of assault and has been taken to a police station in Merseyside to be interviewed.
