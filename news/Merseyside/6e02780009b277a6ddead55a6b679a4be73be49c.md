We were called at 3.10pm today, Wednesday 18 March, to reports the body of a male had been found in woodland in Wirral.

Officers attended at Vyner Road North in Prenton and found the male close to the junction of Boundary Road. He was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

The cause of death at the moment is being treated as unexplained.

Enquiries are ongoing to identify the male and contact his next of kin.
