25-year-old Shaun Done of Holmestead Close has now been charged with Conspiracy to supply cocaine and cannabis; Conspiracy to convert criminal property; and Possession of criminal property. He was remanded in custody to appear yesterday, Wednesday 11 November at Liverpool Magistrates Court, and has been further remanded in custody until his next appearance.
