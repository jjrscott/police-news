We are appealing for help to reunite an electric bike with its owner after a burglary in Prenton.

It was reported two males forced entry to a window at the back of a house on Ladyfield at about 2.20am on Tuesday 8 September.

The offenders stole an electric bike from the kitchen and left the scene. It is believed they may have been on a motorbike or moped.

The stolen electric bike is an all black Falcon v2, with RockShox BoXXer front forks and black Magura MT7 brakes with lime green colouring.

Anyone who has seen or been offered the bike since 8 September can DM us on Twitter via @MerPolCC or message us on Facebook at 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre'. Alternatively, call 101 quoting incident reference 20000541163 or contact the independent charity @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their website: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously
