A Dispersal Zone is in place in the Fazakerley area following an increase in reports of antisocial behaviour.

Since Saturday, 25th July, we have received numerous reports from locals residents of groups of youths causing a disturbance, throwing stones and damaging cars and property in the area.

The order comes under Section 34/35 of the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime & Policing Act 2014, which gives police officers and police community support traffic officers powers to direct people they suspect are causing or likely to cause crime, nuisance or anti-social behaviour to members of the public to leave a designated area for up to 48 hours.

The dispersal zone will be in place until 6pm tomorrow, Thursday 30th July, and will include the following area: junction of Fazakerley Road and Rice Lane (A59) turning left on Crescent Road turning right at the footpath near to the "Cake Kitchen" and joining the footpath behind the area known as Rice Lane Recreation Ground. Following the footpath North, the boundary turns left using the MerseyRail line as the northern boundary of the dispersal zone. Follow the rail line towards the Rawcliffe Road Bridge. Turn left on Rawcliffe Road and re-join the junction of Rice Lane.

Community policing Inspector Andrew Lloyd said: "We're aware of the significant impact that anti-social behaviour can have on individuals and communities, and we will be targeting people we suspect of being involved in this type of behaviour in the area.

"To the vast majority of law-abiding members of the community, I just want to remind them that this order is not about bothering people going about their legitimate daily business."
