We are appealing for information after an attempted robbery was reported at a Post Office in Speke this morning (Thursday 19 March).

Officers were called just before 10am to the Post Office on South Parade after a report two men had entered the premises and attempted to force entry to the hatch.

Staff closed the hatch and the offenders left empty-handed. They reportedly left the scene in a blue Audi car.

The offenders were described as being around 6ft 2in in dark clothing, with one wearing a navy blue Parka. One was reported to have been carrying a pole.

Anyone with information should contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre'.
