We have charged three men after a man was assaulted in Tarbock Green on Sunday morning (26 July).

We were called to private land off Netherley Road at 7.20am where it was reported a man had been threatened with a knife by three men. Another man then approached the three men and it was reported he too was threatened before being chased to the junction of Netherley Road and Ox Lane.

A blue Citroen Picasso car was then driven at the victim on Ox Lane, striking him, before the same three offenders left the vehicle holding a sickle, a spade and a hammer. One threw the hammer towards him and the offenders then assaulted him with the sickle and spade while making further verbal threats.

Officers attended, detained three men and recovered a sickle, hammer and spade for forensic examination.

The victim, a 50-year-old man, sustained a gash to the head, a broken arm and puncture wounds to his arm. He was taken to hospital where his condition is described as stable.

Nathan Buckley, 19, of East Dam Wood Road, Speke was charged with Section 18 wounding with intent and possession of a Class B controlled drug (cannabis)

Paul Stephen Dunn, 32, of Andover Way, Halewood was charged with attempted murder, possession of an offensive weapon, assault of an emergency worker and possession of a knife or sharp pointed article

Anthony Graham, 52, of West Derby Road, Tuebrook was charged with attempted murder, possession of an offensive weapon and dangerous driving

All three were remanded in custody to appear at Liverpool Magistrates Court today (Monday 27 July).
