We have issued CCTV images of a man we want to trace following an attempted robbery at shop in Walton.

At around 3.40pm on Thursday 23rd July an unknown male entered H&T pawnbrokers, on Walton Vale. He waited in the store for five minutes and asked staff to see a watch. When he was unable to produce any identification he left the store.

At around 4.05pm the same man returned and produced a crossbow from a carrier bag. He grabbed a member of staff and made threats and demanded cash.

The male then left the shop empty-handed and ran up Orrell Lane where he collected a bike from Orrell Park railway station and left the area.

The member of staff was not injured but was left shaken by their ordeal.

An investigation is underway and CCTV enquiries have been carried out in the local area.

We have issued images of a man we would like to speak to as we believe he could have information which is vital to our investigation.

Detective Constable Josh Banks said: "Thankfully in this instance nobody was injured but the man clearly had no regard for anyone else's safety.

"This would have been a busy time of day on a busy road and I am sure that someone must have seen something.

"I would ask anyone who witnessed anything, or who recognises the man or know of his whereabouts, to get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to call 0151 777 1481 or DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 20000435469.
