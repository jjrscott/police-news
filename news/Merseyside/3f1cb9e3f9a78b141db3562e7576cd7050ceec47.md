We have issued CCTV images of a man we would like to speak to following a robbery in Liverpool city centre.

At around 11.55pm on Sunday 1st September 2019 a 32 year-old man was in Liverpool city centre when he got talking to another male in a bar on Hardman Street. Both men left the bar at the same time to go home and walked to Roscoe Street, towards Liverpool College, in order to get a taxi.

As both males got to the street the male, without warning or provocation, pushed the victim to the floor. He then began to punch him repeatedly to his body and head before pinning him to the floor and taking cash, bank cards and a mobile phone from his pocket.

As the man tried to stand up the male kicked him to the knee, knocking him once again to the floor before making off along Berry Street.

The man suffered two black eyes, swelling and bruising to his face and a torn ligament in his left knee.

We have issued CCTV images of a man we would like to speak to as we believe he has information which could assist our investigation.

Detective Inspector Phil Atkinson said: "This was a nasty, unprovoked assault which left the victim with injuries which required ongoing treatment. He was also left very shaken by his ordeal.

"I would appeal to anyone who recalls being in the vicinity of Leece Street/Hardman Street that night or has any information which could assist us to come forward.

"I would also ask anyone who recognises the male pictured to come forward and speak to us."

Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 19100494320.
