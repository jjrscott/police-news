Detectives are appealing for information following a stabbing in West Derby tonight, Saturday 26 September.

At 5.45pm, emergency services were called to the loop line (near to Asser Road) to reports of a 15-year-old male being found with a stab wound to the arm. The victim was taken to hospital with non life-threatening injuries and is described as stable.

Enquiries are ongoing to establish the circumstances, and forensic enquiries and searches are ongoing.

Detective Inspector Gavin Mulcahy said: "Thankfully the victim was not more seriously injured, but we have all seen the catastophic consequences of knife crime, and this will have been an extremely distressing experience. We're determined to find who was responsible and put them before the courts.

"At this early stage, we are looking to speak to anyone who was near to the loop line and Asser Road from around 5.30 this evening. We believe that a man wearing a black puffer jacket was riding a moped at this time, and we'd like to identify and speak to him as a matter of priority. If you were passing by and saw anything, including someone making off on foot or in a vehicle, come forward. Your CCTV, dashcam or other information could be vital."

Please contact us now via our social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police CC with reference 783.

You can also pass information via the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
