We are appealing for witnesses after a man was assaulted and had his off-road bike stolen in Wirral.

The 22 year-old was walking with his bike in the area of Eastham Rake at around 4.25pm on Tuesday 1st September when he was approached by two unknown males.

One of the males punched him to the face causing him to fall to the floor. He was then punched and kicked while on the ground. The two males then took his bike.

Both of the males were wearing dark clothing and had their faces covered.

Anyone who has any information or recognises the bike is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 20000527361.
