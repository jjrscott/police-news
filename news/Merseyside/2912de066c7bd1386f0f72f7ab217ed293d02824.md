We are continuing to appeal for information following the death of 26-year-old Dre Estridge in Toxteth.

Emergency services were called to an address on Oakham Street, Toxteth, at around 6.15am on Friday 26th June where they found Dre with a single stab wound to the chest. Sadly, he later died as a result of his injury.

To date two people have been arrested in connection with the murder.

A 45-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of murder and has been released on bail.

A 25-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. He is currently in custody where he will be interviewed by detectives.

Detective Inspector Jennie Beck said: "We are currently following a number of lines of enquiry and speaking to a number of people who we believe were in the house at the time of the incident."

You can also contact us with any information at @MerPolCC, 101 or @CrimestoppersUK, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
