We are appealing for information following reports of fires being started deliberately on Crosby beach yesterday (Sunday 7 March).

At around 6.50pm yesterday, police receive reports that several large fires had been lit in the sand dunes on the beach.

Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service (MFRS) attended and extinguished the fires.

No reports were made of anyone injured.

Enquiries are ongoing to identify who was responsible for starting the fires.

Community Policing Inspector Duncan Swann: "Starting fires deliberately in the manner we saw in Crosby last night is utterly irresponsible, putting our communities at risk and placing an unnecessary strain on our already overstretched emergency services.

"Thankfully the fire service extinguished the fire before anyone was harmed, but this reckless disregard for people and property is simply not acceptable in Merseyside and we are determined to identify those responsible.

"If you know anything about this incident, please come forward as your information could help assist us with enquiries.

"Whether you contact us directly or anonymously through the independent charity Crimestoppers, your information will be acted upon."

Anyone with any further information on this incident is asked to contact us by DM via our social media desk on Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre ' with reference 0783 of Sunday 7 March.

You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
