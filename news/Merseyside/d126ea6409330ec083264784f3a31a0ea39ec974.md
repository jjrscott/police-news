Just under £100k in cash was seized by Liverpool #OpTarget officers during a stop check yesterday morning (20th January).

Officers on patrol stopped a white BMW on Park Street at around 9am. The driver, a 34 year old man from Liverpool, and his car were searched.

Inside the car, officers recovered around £94,000 inside a shopping bag. The man was arrested on suspicion of money laundering and taken to custody.

Following this, a search of a property in Toxteth was conducted where officers seized a quantity of suspected counterfeit cigarettes and tobacco.

Liverpool Targeted Inspector Leigh Price said: "Proactive policing and visible patrols not only gives the public reassurance, but this allows us to identify those involved in crime more easily.

"Our Op Target teams are specifically tasked with locating those involved in serious violence and associated crimes - this can be done through roadside operations, open land searches, plain clothes patrols and of course stop checks; which are hugely important when it comes to taking dangerous people and weapons off our streets.

"No criminal should profit off our wider law abiding communities or use vulnerable people for their own financial gain. Therefore, if you know someone involved in crime, please let us know so we can take them off our streets."

The man has since been released under investigation until later this year.

Please report all crime via our social media channels, calling 101 or in an emergency, always call 999.
