We are appealing for information following reports of a stabbing in New Ferry yesterday (Wednesday 10 February).

Emergency services were called to an address on New Chester Road at around 7.30pm to reports that a man had been stabbed in the neck.

A 21-year-old man was found with a single stab wound to the neck following an altercation which is believed to have happened at a property in the area of Beaconsfield Road.

The man was taken to hospital to be treated for his injuries which are not believed to be life threatening.

CCTV, witness and forensic enquiries are ongoing.

Detective Inspector Matt Caton said, "We are in the early stages of an investigation into the incident. If you were in the Beaconsfield Road area last night and saw or heard anything suspicious I would urge you to come forward as you may hold information which will help our enquiries.

"As we have tragically seen, knife crime can have catastrophic consequences. While this man has not received life-threatening injuries, this incident will leave a significant impact nonetheless.

"We work hard to regularly remove from the streets dangerous weapons and those who carry them, so if you have any information about this incident then please pass information on to us and we will do the rest."
