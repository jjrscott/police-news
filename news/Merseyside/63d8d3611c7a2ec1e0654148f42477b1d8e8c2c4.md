From today (Monday 9 November), officers from Merseyside Police will be joining police forces up and down the country to support a week long national operation; #OpSceptre.

The operation aims to target those carrying weapons, reduce these offences, raise awareness of the dangers of knife crime, and provide young people with more positive alternatives to crime.

Across Merseyside, we will be carrying out a variety of policing activity including open land searches, stop searches, high visibility and plain clothed patrols, weapon sweeps as well as working with our partners and local schools.

Chief Inspector Andy Creer said: "This concentrated week of action is dedicated to tackling knife crime, but we will also spend a lot of time talking to the wider public and educating young people about the dangers carrying a knife can lead to. We hope that this intervention activity along with our proactive policing can deter them from getting involved in this sort of criminality and provide them with appropriate advice and support to seek more positive futures."

The week will also see officers visit retailers and provide them with the guidance they need when it comes to the responsible sale of knives.

Ch/Insp Creer continued: "We want to protect those living in Merseyside all year round and this week of action only amplifies our efforts. During these unprecedented times, it makes us even more determined to support the public and encourage our communities to work together as well as looking out for teenagers who may be being influenced into carrying knives and other weapons.

"Knife crime remains one of our force priorities, and together with our local authority partners and Violence Reduction Partnership, we aim to effectively make a difference in our community.

"Unfortunately this year due to Covid-19 restrictions, some of our intended activity has had to be scaled back so I am asking for our communities to pull together and take action - we need your help to share our message and encourage you to talk openly with neighbours, family members, friends and work colleagues to ensure that we prevent anyone from carrying or using a knife.

"In addition to this, our collaborative #BladeFree campaign (https://www.ourmerseyside.org/themes/bladefree/) provides a hub for young people to find exciting clubs and activities in their area to ensure they are steered away from crime. We are always looking for supporters and hope that whether you are a member of the public, run a club or volunteer at a community centre, you too can get involved."
