Officers in Speke have arrested a man and seized drugs and a suspected stolen quad bike following a warrant yesterday, Monday 8 June.

At around 10am, a warrant was carried out at a property in Dam Wood Road, leading to a man being detained. Bags of cannabis and other paraphernalia were found, as well as a 'Big Bear' quad bike. The bike is suspected of being stolen in a burglary in Sandbach, Cheshire.

A 19-year-old man from Speke was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply cannabis and handling stolen goods. He has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Community Inspector Jon Smith said: "Drug supply causes significant harm in our communities, both to those who use controlled drugs, but also the serious and violent crime it attracts to an area.

"We have good results from information provided by those most affected, so keeping working with us to pass on information if you suspect such activity where you are. We'll listen, and take positive action to remove those people and their drugs from the streets."
