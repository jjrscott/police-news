We are appealing for witnesses after a 28 year-old man was assaulted in St Helens yesterday, Thursday 18th March.

The man is believed to have been on Concourse Way at around 4.35pm when he was assaulted by a male. It is believed a weapon may have been used during the assault. He was taken to hospital with a serious head injury.

It is believed the man knew his assailant.

An investigation is underway and house-to-house and CCTV enquiries have been carried out in the local area.

Detectives are appealing for anyone who was in the vicinity of Concourse Way yesterday who witnessed the assault or has any information which could assist the investigation to get in touch.

Detective Inspector Leanne Hobin said: "I would ask anyone who was in the area or who was driving past and saw anything or believes they captured something on their dash cam to get in touch as they may be able to help with our enquiries."

Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 21000173757.
