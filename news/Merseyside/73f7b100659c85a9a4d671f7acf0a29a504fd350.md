Detectives are appealing for information following a robbery in Walton in the early hours of this morning, Monday 21 October.

At 2.40am, emergency services were called to Walton Road to reports of a man in his 40s being found unconscious near to The Thomas Frost Wetherspoon. He was taken to hospital with serious head and facial injuries and is being assessed.

Officers remain at the scene conducting CCTV, forensic and witness enquiries as we look to establish the circumstances.

Detective Inspector Phil Atkinson said: "This was an appalling attack which has left a man seriously injured. We initially think this may have been a robbery for the victim's bike but we're looking to piece together what happened and keen to speak to anyone who may have been passing in a vehicle or on foot and seen anything.

"Do you have home or business CCTV, or have heard any other information? Please come forward and we will take action."

Anyone with information can contact @MerPolCC or 101 with reference 19100610249. You can also pass information anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
