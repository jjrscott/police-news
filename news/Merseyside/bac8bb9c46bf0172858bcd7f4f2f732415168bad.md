Can you help Liverpool and Wirral Coroner's Office trace the next of kin for Liverpool man James Cutts, who passed away on Christmas Day?

Mr Cutts, 83, sadly died at his home address in Emerson Street, Toxteth on 25 December 2020. There are no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death.

It is believed Mr Cutts may have next of kin in Manchester and Bangor, North Wales.
