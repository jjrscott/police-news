We are appealing for information after a cyclist was seriously injured in a collision with a van in Speke on Thursday 28 May.

A Boardman Comp pedal bike was in a collision with a white Citroen Berlingo van on Renaissance Way at about 3pm.

The cyclist, a 67-year-old man, was taken to Whiston Hospital suffering from a head injury, but transferred to the Walton Centre after his condition deteriorated. His condition is described as critical but stable.

The driver of the van, a man in his 50s, stopped at the scene and has assisted police with their enquiries.

Sergeant Martin Mayne said: "We have spoken to a number of members of the public who came to the cyclist's aid immediately after the collision, but are appealing for anyone who may have seen the collision itself to come forward.

"If you were in the area at the time and may have captured any part of the incident on dashcam, or the bike or van immediately before it, please check your footage and let us know if you see the van or the cyclist, or anything significant."

If you have any information, please contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre'. You can also call 101 quoting incident reference 20000308258 or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
