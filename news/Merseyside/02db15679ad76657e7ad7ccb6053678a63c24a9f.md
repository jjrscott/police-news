We are aware of footage showing a flare at the Dixie Dean statue outside Goodison Park.

The footage appears to show a flare on the statue on Spellow Lane, and enquiries are ongoing to establish the exact circumstances.

On Friday, Merseyside Police and Merseyside Fire and Rescue Services (MFRS) seized more than 100 smoke grenades and flares from address in Alscot Avenue, Aintree, and a 36-year-old man was questioned in relation to possession of Class A drugs.

Merseyside Police Acting Chief Inspector Robert Ross said: "Flares can cause serious injury to people and damage to property, and seizures like Friday's show our determination to prevent them being used irresponsibly and from causing serious injury and distress.

"We will continue to work with all our emergency services and take action to keep people safe.

"I would urge anyone who knows who is responsible for putting a flare on the Dixie Dean statue, a focal point for so many people at times of celebration and grief, to contact us."

Anyone with information on this incident, or the storage and possession of flares and smoke bombs, is asked to contact @MerPolCC or 101. Alternatively, you can pass information anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
