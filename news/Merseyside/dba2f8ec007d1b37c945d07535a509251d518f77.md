We're appealing for information following an attempted business burglary in Southport last night, Tuesday 16 February.

At around 9.20pm, officers were called to Screwfix in Old Hall Farm Business Park to reports of alarms being activated. It is initially believed that males attempted to gain access but were spooked by the alarm and made off empty handed.

Sergeant Chris Hughes said: "If you have any information on this incident, please come forward and we will take action.

"Businesses across Merseyside are having a tough enough time operating safely and successfully at the moment, and the last thing anyone needs is the added inconvenience of a break-in.

"It's great to see such attempts ending in failure, thanks to security processes in place, and we'll now investigate fully to find those responsible and put them before the courts."
