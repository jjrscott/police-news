We are appealing for witnesses after a 17 year-old male was robbed at knifepoint in Aintree.

The teenager was walking along the canal on Ormskirk Road at around 5.10pm last night, Monday 7th September. As he approached what is known locally as the Wally Steps, close to Sports Direct, he was approached by two males.

One of the males produced a knife and demanded the teenager's phone. The victim handed over the phone. The males then assaulted the victim and took his bag and threw it into the canal.

One of the males is described as around 5ft 11in tall. He was wearing a black coat, black pants, black trainers and a black balaclava covering his face and spoke with a Liverpool accent.

The second male is described as tanned, around 6ft tall and wearing a green coat, black pants and black trainers. He wore a red bandana covering his face which at one point he removed and he had a black beard.

Detective Inspector Cat Walsh said: "I would appeal for anyone who was in the area around Ormskirk Road around 5pn last night who saw anyone or anything suspicious to contact us as they may have information which is vital to our investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 20000540619.
