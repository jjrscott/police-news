We are appealing for witnesses following a confrontational burglary at the home of an elderly woman in St Helens in the early hours of this morning, Wednesday 28th October.

At around 5.30am the pensioner woke to a male shining a torch in her face. She asked who the man was.

The man searched rooms in the property, in Huncote Avenue, and stole a purple leather purse containing credit and debit cards and a quantity of cash.

The woman was not injured but left shaken by her ordeal.

The male is described as stocky build, around 5ft 8in tall and wearing black clothing. He is described as having a 'gruff voice'.

Detective Sergeant Leanne Toole said: "I would appeal to anyone who was in the area around Huncote Avenue this morning who saw or witnessed anything suspicious to contact us.

"I would also ask for anyone with CCTV or dashcam footage to check their cameras in case they have captured something significant.

"Thankfully the woman was not hurt but this must have been a shock for her to be woken in her own home in such a way. We are determined to capture this person and bring him to justice."

Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 20000652630.
