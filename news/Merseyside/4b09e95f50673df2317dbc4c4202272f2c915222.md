A Section 60 stop and search order has been authorised for the Anfield and Everton area in advance of tonight's Champions League game at Anfield.

The order began running at 12pm today (Wednesday, 27 November) and will conclude at 1am tomorrow (Thursday, 28 November). It gives officers powers to stop and search people in the area shown on the attached map (Section 60 will be in place from Priory Road to Breck Road, Right along Breck Road then left onto Belmont Road to the junction with West Derby Road. Turn right on West Derby Road and continue along Islington to Scotland Road. Continue on Scotland Road, Kirkdale Road, Everton Valley and Walton Lane back to Priory Road).

Section 60 is a power under the Criminal Justice and Public Order 1994 that allows police officers to stop and search. Where a Section 60 is in place, it means we can search anyone in a certain area, for example, when there is evidence that serious violence has taken place or may take place.

The force put the Section 60 in place after other forces raised concerns about the behaviour of Napoli fans travelling from other parts of the country to Liverpool.

The force has also received a number of reports from members of the public who reported that Napoli fans were armed with golf clubs in the city centre. Officers responded to the reports and a significant number of flags and flag poles have been seized.
