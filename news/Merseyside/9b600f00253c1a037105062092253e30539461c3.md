We are issuing the image of a woman who may have information following a racially-aggravated assault in Aintree last week.

At around 4.15pm on Wednesday 14 October, a security guard at Boots at Racecourse Retail Park challenged a man and women who were suspected of shoplifting at the store.

The woman became aggressive and was asked to leave. The woman eventually left and attempted to re-enter, at which point she spat and racially abused the security guard. The woman left and was seen to go towards Ormskirk Road.

Hate Crime Coordinator Kate Gore said: "We believe the woman pictured may have vital information to assist our enquiries.

"This attack understandably left the victim distressed and worried. To spit into someone's face is abhorrent, especially in the current climate of Covid 19, with equally disgusting racial abuse directed at the victim. We will not tolerate assault or abuse of people carrying out their daily work in our communities."
