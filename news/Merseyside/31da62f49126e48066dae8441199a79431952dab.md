The family of Paul Morgan, who was killed following an incident in Toxteth on Saturday, 19 September, have issued the following tribute.

His partner, Lisa Robinson, said: "Paul was a devoted father to his four children, Ben aged 16, Kaitlyn aged 15, Summer aged 13, and Rhys aged 11.

"Anyone that knew Paul would agree that he was never without a smile, and always had a story to tell. Paul worked on building sites around Liverpool, and was a massive LFC supporter.

"He was my loving partner for over 20 years, and we all love and miss him so much."
