Officers have arrested three people following a drugs warrant in Knowsley.

The pre-planned warrant was carried out just before 11am yesterday morning (12th Feb) on Mardale Road.

During the search, officers located and seized over 100 items, all believed to be stolen including alcoholic beverages, electrical goods, perfumes and handbags.

A van parked at the property was also searched where dried cannabis plants were found inside.

A 26 year old woman and two men, aged 29 and 49 were all arrested on suspicion of handling stolen goods and cannabis cultivation.
