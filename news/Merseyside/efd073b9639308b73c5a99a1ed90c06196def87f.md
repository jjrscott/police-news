We have charged a man after an incident in Liverpool city centre in the early hours of Sunday (1 March).

It was reported a group of men had been seen fighting close to River Island on Church Street at 4am, and a 19-year-old man sustained a stab wound to the chest during the incident. His condition is now described as serious but stable. A second 19-year-old man who was cut to the face was treated in hospital and later discharged.

Jason Thomas Medlicott, 20, of Leinster Road, Liverpool has been charged with two counts of Section 18 wounding, possession of an offensive weapon in a public place and affray.

He has been remanded in custody to appear at Liverpool Magistrates Court this morning (Tuesday 2 March).
