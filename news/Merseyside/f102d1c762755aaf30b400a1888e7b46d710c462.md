We have arrested six people and recovered a suspected handgun at an address in Toxteth yesterday (Thursday 11 March).

At around 7.45pm officers attended an address on Corinto Street, Toxteth, following reports a male was in possession of a firearm.

Two males were detained in a Mercedes outside the address and two further males and a female were detained in the garden of the property.

Following a short foot chase, officers also detained a male on nearby Pickwick Street.

Five men were arrested on suspicion of Possession of a Firearm: two aged 23 and 50 from Toxteth, one aged 26 of no fixed address, one aged 24 from St Helens and one aged 31 from Walsall

One female, aged 45, from Halewood was also arrested on suspicion of Possession of a Firearm.

All six have been taken to police stations for questioning.

A suspected handgun was recovered in a garden near to the address.

Officers remain at the scene while forensic enquiries are ongoing.

Detective Chief Inspector Matt Smith said: "This latest recovery means there is one less firearm on our streets that could be used to cause fear, intimidation or harm.

"The force is committed to tackling those involved in serious organised crime, particularly those involved in gun crime, and has dedicated significant resources into taking weapons and offenders off our streets.

"I would urge anyone who has any information on gun crime and the misery it can cause communities to come forward and let us know. We will act on all information and together we can make a real difference."
