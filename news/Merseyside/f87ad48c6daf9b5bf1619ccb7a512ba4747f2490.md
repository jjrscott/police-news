We can confirm officers attended Liverpool John Lennon Airport this morning (Saturday 21 September 2019) following reports of a suspicious item.

At around 10.15am, a suspicious item was seen on a plane due to fly out of the airport, and the captain requested passengers disembark so that airline staff could search the plane as a precaution.

No items that posed any risk to passengers were discovered and at around 11am they were allowed to re-board the flight, which is continuing its journey.
