We are appealing for information following an attempted s18 assault and criminal damage in Halewood on Monday 27th April.

At 8pm a male reported that he had been hit by a car on Roseheath Drive and suffered minor cuts and bruising to his ankle. The male jumped into an adjacent car park to get away at which point the driver of the car is reported to have driven into the car park, got out of his car and made threats towards the male.

The injured male left the area and went to a nearby property in Marsden Road. The driver of the car is believed to have followed him to the property where he caused damage to a window and a car parked outside and made further threats. He then left the area in a blue BMW, which is believed to have been on cloned plates.

The driver of the car was wearing dark clothing and a baseball cap and had facial hair.

CCTV and house to house enquiries have been carried out and an investigation is underway.

We are appealing for anyone who was in the area around Roseheath Drive/Marsden Road who may have seen anyone or anything suspicious to contact us as they may have information which is vital to the investigation.

Anyone which information is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 20000244316.
