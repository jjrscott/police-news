We have issued CCTV images of five men we want to trace following large scale disorder outside a Liverpool pub.

Officers were called to the Hare and Hounds public house in West Derby Village at around 1.20am on Sunday 12th January 2020.

A 31 year-old man is believed to have been drinking inside the pub earlier that evening with a group of friends. An altercation took place outside the pub in which he suffered a head injury and was taken to hospital.

We have issued images of five men who we believe could assist with our investigation.

Detective Inspector Phil Atkinson said: "Maybe you were in the area of the Hare and Hounds pub that night and witnessed this incident or recognise any of the men pictured.

"I would ask anyone who has any information to come forward and speak to us."

Anyone who recognises any of the men or has information which could assist the investigation is asked to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 20000024678.
