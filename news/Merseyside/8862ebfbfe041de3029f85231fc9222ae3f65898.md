We are appealing for the public's help in tracing the next of kin of a man who recently died in Formby.

82-year-old John Patrick Bradley, previously of Wolsey Street, Bootle, sadly died at Formby Manor Care Centre on Saturday, 3 October 2020.

There are no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death.

Mr Bradley was born in Portlee West, Antrim, and it is believed he may still have family in Northern Ireland.

Anyone with information that could assist is asked to contact Sefton Council 0151 934 4566 or email paul.mcnulty@sefton.gov.uk.
