Detectives investigating an indecent exposure incident on Jubilee Road, Litherland have issued CCTV stills of a man they believe may have information that could assist enquiries.

A woman, aged 18, was walking with a friend after getting off a bus on Hawthorne Road at around 9pm on Friday, 9 September, when they were followed by man through the subway under Church Road. When they reached Jubilee Road the male exposed himself and made obscene comments.

Inspector Beth Blake said: "The woman was not hurt but was left extremely shaken by the incident. This is an upsetting thing to happen but the woman did the right thing by contacting the police.

"Thankfully, this type of incident is rare and unusual and I would like to reassure people it is being dealt with seriously.

"I am keen to hear from anyone who recognises the man in the CCTV images, as we believe he could have information that may prove vital to our ongoing enquiries."

Anyone who recognises the male is asked to contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police CC. You can also call 101 or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information-online/
