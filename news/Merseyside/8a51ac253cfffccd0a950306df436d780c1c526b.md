ORIGINAL

We can confirm officers are in attendance in Wallasey today, Friday, 28 February, following a report of a man, armed with a knife, making threats.

Officers are currently in Darlington Close, having been called at 11.55am, and a number of neighbouring properties have been evacuated. It is believed that the man had forced his way into the property and that it is domestic related.

There are road closures in place in the Darlington Close, Darlington Street, Church Street, Water Street and Union Street area while the incident is ongoing and we advise people to avoid the area at this time. Children and staff from Egremont Primary school have been evacuated and taken to a place of safety.

Officers are at the scene with specially trained negotiators.

We would like to thank residents for their patience while police attend the incident.
