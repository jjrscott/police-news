We are in attendance in Everton following a suspected gas explosion (Thursday 21 November).

A report was received around 9.15am that there had been an explosion in a residential building in Thomaston Street.

One woman has received severe burns to her body and has been taken to hospital for treatment.

The house has been evacuated and an adjoining house has also been evacuated as a precaution.

Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service attended just before 9.15pm with three engines and administered first aid at the scene.

The building has been declared as unsafe at this time and CADENT are in attendance at the scene and have turned the gas supply to the two houses off to make the area safe.

Enquiries into the incident are ongoing.
