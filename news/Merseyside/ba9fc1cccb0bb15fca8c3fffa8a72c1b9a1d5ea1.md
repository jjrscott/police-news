We are welcoming the sentencing of four men to a total of 124 years in prison following the murder of Stephen Maguire in Birkdale in March.

They were sentenced today (Wednesday 16 December) following a trial at Liverpool Crown Court.

Emergency services were called to an address in Guildford Road shortly after 11.35pm on Monday 16 March to reports that a man had been shot. The victim, 27-year-old Stephen Maguire, was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead a short time later.

28-year-old Karl Corson of Columbine Close, Melling was sentenced to life with a minimum of 33 years in prison.
21-year old Ryan Smith of Colquitt Street, Liverpool City Centre was sentenced to life with a minimum of 32 years in prison.
35-year-old Patrick Moogan of Willow Way, Croxteth was sentenced to life with a minimum of 30 years in prison.
22-year-old Jack Higgins of Sedgemoor Road, Norris Green was sentenced to life with a minimum of 29 years in prison.

Speaking after the sentencing, Detective Chief Inspector Rachel Wilson said: "It is pleasing to see today's outcome, with these four men brought to justice for their involvement in what was the brutal killing of Stephen, in his home address. They will now spend a considerable portion of their lives in custody.

"We hope that these sentencings provide at least some comfort to Stephen's family and friends as they continue to deal with their grief at his sudden and tragic loss.

"This has been a complex and comprehensive investigation and we're grateful for all of those people who have come forward with information and assisted, which has allowed us to bring about a successful prosecution.

"Criminals involved in gun crime have no regard for anyone else and Stephen Maguire paid the ultimate price for the reckless and violent actions of others.

"Today's outcome demonstrates Merseyside Police's commitment to tackling gun crime and putting offenders behind bars. We have seen reductions in gun crime over recent years, and working with those communities affected we can continue to bring to justice those who bring dangerous weapons onto our streets. I would urge those communities who suffer from violent crime to keep providing information, and stand with us against the use of firearms and violence across Merseyside.

"Do you know who is carrying weapons or where they are being stored? DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 so we can take keep taking action."
