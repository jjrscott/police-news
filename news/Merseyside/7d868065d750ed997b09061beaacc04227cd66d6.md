Detectives are appealing for witnesses after a woman was found injured in the Fairfield area on Saturday morning, 8 June.

At around 10.45am, a woman in her 30s reported that she had woken in Newsham Park with no recollection of how she came to be there. She was taken to hospital for assessment and not found have to have any serious injuries, although medical enquiries are ongoing.

Forensic, CCTV and witness enquiries continue into the circumstances, and to establish if any crime has taken place.

Detective Inspector Chris Smith said: "At this stage it's unclear exactly what has happened, but if you were passing or live around the junction of Shiel Road and Penlinken Drive, and Orphan Drive, we want to hear from you as soon as possible.

"Did you see anything suspicious or capture anything on Friday night or into Saturday morning on home or business CCTV, or dashcam? A small detail could help us piece together the timeline of this incident, and find anyone else who may have been involved."
