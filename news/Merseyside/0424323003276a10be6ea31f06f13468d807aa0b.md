Detectives investigating a business burglary in West Kirby last month are issuing the CCTV image of a tattooed man who may have information to assist enquiries.

At around 2am on Monday 8 June, offenders broke into Harris Opticians on Banks Road and stole a large amount of designer glasses.

Enquiries have been ongoing and we would like to speak to the man pictured, who may hold vital information.

His arm tattoo (shown in the second photo) is described as a half sleeve on his left arm.

Detective Constable John Molyneux said: "This incident resulted in a significant financial loss and distress for the owners, at a time where all our local businesses are in the midst of economic hardship. We will continue to support our business communities, find those responsible and put them before the courts.

"If you recognise this man or saw, heard or captured any footage on the night, please come forward and we can take action."

Please pass any information with reference 20000331525 via our social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre'.
