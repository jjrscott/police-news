We are appealing for witnesses following reports shots were fired in the Toxteth area today, Thursdasy 6th July.

Officers attended in Gibson Road at 3.35pm and found damage to a Volkswagen car consistent with a firearms discharge.

There are no reports of anyone being injured at this time and nobody has come forward to speak to officers.

An investigation is underway and house-to-house and CCTV enquiries are being carried out in the local area.

It is believed a green motorbike with two males on it was seen in the area at the time of the incident and enquiries are ongoing to trace the bike and its occupants.

Chief Inspector Derek Riley said: "We have not been made aware that anybody was injured during this incident but obviously such a reckless act could have had more serious consequences.

"I would appeal to anyone who was in the area around Gibson Road at around 3.30pm today who saw anyone or anything suspicious to contact us as they may have information which is vital to the investigation.

"I would also appeal to any motorists in the area who may have captured anything significant on their dashcam to get in touch as they may be able to help with our enquiries.

"We remain committed to removing firearms from our streets and we need the public's help to find the people responsible for using them."

Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111 quoting log 682 of 6th August.
