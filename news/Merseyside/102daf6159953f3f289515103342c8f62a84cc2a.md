The family of a man who died following a road traffic collision on the M57 earlier this week have issued a tribute.

Lee Davis, 37, who is originally from Stockport but had been living in the Liverpool area, sadly passed away on Monday afternoon (7th December) after the car he was driving left the southbound carriageway of the motorway.

An investigation into the collision remains ongoing.

In a statement the family said: "Lee Davis, 37, was a loving father to two beautiful girls, 1 and 8, and his heartbroken fiancee. He was such a caring and hardworking man, sadly taken from his family too soon in a tragic accident, without opportunity to see his girls grow up. They will now have to rebuild their world without their daddy in it.

"Lee was deeply loved by all his family and friends, and will be dearly missed by everyone."
