Detectives are appealing for information following a robbery on Langsdale Street last night (Thursday 4 February).

At around 10.15pm, officers were called to reports that two men with their faces covered had approached a food delivery driver at the junction of Salisbury Street.

The suspects threatened the driver with a firearm and demanded his car keys. After taking his wallet and phone, the two men made off in the driver's blue Toyota Auris.

The first suspect is described as a white male wearing a face covering with skeleton markings, aged between 20-30, of slim build, around 5ft 7in tall, and wearing black with a hood up.

The second suspect is described as a white male of slim build wearing a black face covering, aged 20-30, wearing black with a hood up.

CCTV, witness and forensic enquiries are ongoing.

Detective Inspector Jennie Beck said: "While thankfully he was unharmed, this incident was incredibly distressing for the victim - who was accosted after delivering essential items to a customer during a pandemic. It's a disgrace that anyone who is supporting our communities and trying to earn a living has been unable to do so without being threatened with violence.

"I would appeal to anyone who was in the area around the junction of Langsdale Street and Salisbury Street last night who saw anyone or anything suspicious to contact us.

"I would also particularly ask anyone who was driving past who may have a dash-cam footage to check it to see if they captured anything significant. Please get in touch as you could hold information which is vital to our investigation."

Anyone with information on this incident can contact us by DM via our social media desk on Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' with reference 21000076354.
