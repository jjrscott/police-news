Officers from our Roads Policing Unit are appealing for information following a fail to stop road traffic collision in Southport yesterday, Thursday 1 October.

At around 4pm, it was reported that a car had collided with a dog and its owner on Bispham Road. The dog, a Cavapoo, sadly later died from its injuries and the owner suffered injury to their hand.

The driver of the vehicle, which is described as a dark coloured hatchback car, is believed to have left the scene without leaving any contact details.

Enquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances and anyone who witnessed the incident or has any information is asked to contact police.

Constable Phil Williams from the Roads Policing Unit said: "We are keen to trace the driver of the vehicle to assist our enquiries and would also ask anyone who witnessed the incident to please get in touch.

"Likewise, if you have any dashcam footage, or CCTV footage from the surrounding area that may assist us identifying the vehicle involved, please let us know."

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has any information is asked to contact our social media desk @MerPolCC on Twitter or 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook quoting ref. 20000594765 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. You can also contact them via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
