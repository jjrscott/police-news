We are appealing for information after an arson at a house in Everton we believe could be motivated by hate.

At about 2.20am on Monday 10 February, an offender poured an unknown substance onto a door on Goodison Road and set fire to it.

The occupier extinguished the fire with water before the arrival of emergency services.

Detectives believe the occupant of the house may have been targeted due to his nationality, and he has received the support of the force and partner agencies such as the Anthony Walker Foundation and Daisy UK.

A forensic examination of the scene has taken place and police and Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service have attended to provide advice and reassurance.

Anyone with information should contact police as we believe he may have information that could prove vital to our enquiries into this incident.

Detective Constable Dominique Walker said: "This was a frightening and completely unacceptable attack on the very place the victim has every right to feel safe and secure.

"It is appalling to think that in 2020, someone could have been subjected to such an upsetting incident simply because of the country they were born in.

"We have specialist officers and have drawn on our partner organisations to ensure the victim is fully supported.

"Merseyside has a deserved reputation for being a warm and welcoming place, and the wider community will be shocked and saddened to hear this man has been subjected to this incident.

"I want to call on those people to stand with us to help put a stop to discriminatory behaviour of all kinds.

"If you know who might be responsible for this attack, please contact police and we will make every effort to bring the offender to justice."

Anyone with information should contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre'. You can also call 101 quoting incident reference 20000087738 or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their website here: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously
