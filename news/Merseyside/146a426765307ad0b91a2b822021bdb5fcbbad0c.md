A 27 year old man from Liverpool has been arrested on suspicion of burglary, assault emergency worker, possession of a bladed article and road traffic offences following a road traffic collision on Monday night (10th August).

The incident occurred when a Honda Civic car, amongst other items, were reported to have been stolen at some point between 9:30pm on 9th August and 5am on 10th August by an unknown person from an address on Matthews Avenue, Litherland.

Following this, at around 9:30pm on 10th August, officers were involved in a short police pursuit with the stolen Honda Civic. The Honda then collided with another car near the junction of Eden Vale/Glover Lane, Seaforth.

The driver of the Honda made off from the scene but was detained nearby on Sherborne Avenue, where he was arrested.

D/Inspector Catherine Walsh said "This man has put other road users at significant danger by driving in such a dangerous way. It is therefore vital that we appeal for witnesses to ensure we can investigate thoroughly.

"Thankfully, the driver and passenger in the other car sustained non-life threatening injuries, but they are obviously extremely shaken by the incident, as the outcomes could have been so much worse.

"If anyone has information on this incident and could help with our investigations, please get in touch quoting crime reference: 20000475352"
