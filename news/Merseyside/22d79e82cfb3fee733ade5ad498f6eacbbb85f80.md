We have issued CCTV stills showing two men we believe may have information that could assist enquiries into the illegal riding of mopeds in St Helens in recent weeks.

It was reported they were ridden on West End Road, Haydock at about 8.30pm on Wednesday 18 September 2019, and officers are investigating a number of other similar incidents.

Inspector Neil Birkett said: "We have had a number of reports in the past few weeks of mopeds being ridden illegally and anti-socially in the St Helens area.

"We know what a menace such behaviour can be for people living locally, and appeal for anyone who recognises the men pictured as we believe they could have information that will help us investigate these issues."
