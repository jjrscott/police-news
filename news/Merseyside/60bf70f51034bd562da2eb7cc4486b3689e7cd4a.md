The female passenger who passed away following an incident on a bus in St Helens has today, Monday 24th February, been named as Margaret Coates.

Mrs Coates, who was aged 90 and from the Thatto Heath area of St Helens, passed away on Saturday night in hospital after suffering a head injury while on a bus on Borough Road on Saturday afternoon.

Her family have today expressed their thanks to the people who came to Mrs Coates' assistance on the bus and also the staff at Whiston Hospital for the "kind and sensitive" way in which they cared for her.
