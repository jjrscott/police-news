Merseyside Police have issued a CCTV still of a man who may be able to assist with an investigation into the theft of two charity tins and food on Saturday, 26 October.

The incident happened on Liverpool Road, Ainsdale at around 10.30pm. One of the items stolen was a charity tin for the Royal British Legion's Poppy Appeal.

Sergeant Jenni Bowman said: "Any type of stealing is unacceptable, but to take from a charity is absolutely despicable and I'm confident members of our community will be just as angry.

"If anyone has any information which may help us to identify this individual please come forward. We will act on all information and bring those responsible to justice."

Anyone with information should contact @MerPolCC quoting 19100624754, call 101 or contact @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111.
