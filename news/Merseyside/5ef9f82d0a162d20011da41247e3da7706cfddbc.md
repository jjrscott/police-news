Original:

We are investigating tonight, Monday, 25 November, following reports of a firearms discharge in Kirkby.

Officers were contacted just before 6.45pm to reports that a 31-year-old man and 35-year-old man had both received gunshot wounds in the Market Tavern, Newtown Gardens.

The men were treated at the scene and have both been taken to hospital for further treatment.

An investigation is currently underway and house-to-house and forensic enquiries are being carried out in the local area.

Chief Inspector Kevin Chatterton said: "The investigation is currently in its early stages and we are working to establish what has happened.

"I would appeal for anyone who was in the area around Newtown Gardens in Kirkby Town Centre, this evening who has seen anything to contact us a matter of urgency as they may have information which is vital to this investigation.

"I want to reassure the public that we are committed to tackling gun crime and we will continue to take action to protect our communities from individuals who use firearms with no thought for members of the public."

Information from the public is vital, anyone with information is asked to contact us by calling 101 or DM us @MerPolCC quoting ref 0803 of 25 November, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
