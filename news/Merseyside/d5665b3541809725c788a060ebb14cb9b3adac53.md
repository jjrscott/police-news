Joint warrant with the Ministry of Defence Police leads to three arrests as together, we crack down on serious crime across Merseyside.

Merseyside #OpTarget officers assisted the Ministry of Defence Police to conduct the warrant on Appleton Road, Anfield at 6:30am yesterday morning (16th Dec) in relation to drugs offences.

During the search of the property, a large quantity of white powder was located, which has now be forensically identified as cocaine. This had an estimated street value of over Â£75,000.

Three people, two women and a man, were arrested at the property for drugs offences - the 22 and 57 year old women have both been released under investigation whilst the 26 year old man, Jacob Bullen from Liverpool was arrested and has since been charged with possession with intent to supply Class A drugs.

He appeared at Liverpool Magistrates court this morning (17th Dec) where he was remanded in custody until 14th January.

The Ministry of Defence Police investigation is ongoing and officers from Merseyside will assist in any way we can to bring those involved in criminality to justice.
