We are appealing for information following a suspected arson in St Helens yesterday (Tuesday 9 March).

At around 4.50pm on Tuesday, emergency services were called to reports of a fire at a building on Hardshaw Street.

Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service extinguished the fire and nobody was injured.

Enquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident, but it is currently being treated as suspicious.

Detective Inspector Jennie Beck said: "At this stage we believe the fire was started deliberately.

"Thankfully the fire service extinguished the fire before anyone was harmed, which is extremely fortunate considering it took place in such a busy area. This reckless disregard for people and property in our community is simply not acceptable and we are determined to identify those responsible.

"If you know anything about this incident and saw anything or anyone suspicious when out shopping in St Helens yesterday afternoon then please come forward as your information could help assist us with enquiries."

Anyone in the area with information, CCTV or mobile phone footage can contact us on Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' with reference 21000151848.

You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form.
