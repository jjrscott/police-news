Detectives are investigating following an assault in Walton this evening, Sunday 12 January.

At around 6.30pm, emergency services were called to Inglis Road to reports of a man in his 20s being reportedly stabbed and having an unknown substance thrown in his face.

The victim was taken to Aintree Hospital for assessment of his injuries and to establish the nature of the substance.

Medical staff have now confirmed that the substance does not present any wider risk to others. It is initially assessed as being a household substance, which has caused the victim a minor facial injury.

A cordon is in place at the scene of the assault as detectives conduct house-to-house, forensic and CCTV enquiries.

A cordon was also in place at the hospital while their own medical assessment was made. This has now been removed and we thank members of the public for their patience and understanding.

Chief Inspector Mark Everard said: "These are the early stages of our investigation into what appears to be a targeted attack.

"If you were in or near to Inglis Road at around 6.30pm and saw or heard anything, come forward right away and we will take positive action.

"This is clearly a serious assault and our focus is now on establishing the exact circumstances to bring those responsible to justice."

Anyone with information can contact @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 with reference number 702.
