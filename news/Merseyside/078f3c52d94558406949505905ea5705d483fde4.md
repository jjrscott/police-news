We're issuing images of two men who detectives think may have information following an aggravated burglary last month in Everton.

At around 8.30am on Monday 11 January, entry was gained to a home on Cowley Road and the occupant was assaulted while attempts were made to gain his bank details.

The suspects left with bank cards, possibly in a vehicle, although enquiries are ongoing.

A 38-year-old woman from Walton has been arrested on suspicion of Section 47 assault and remains on conditional bail.

Detective Constable Rachel Fairhurst said: "This was an appalling and we believe targeted attack on a vulnerable person at home.

"One arrest has been made but we're keen to speak to the men pictured, who may be able to assist in our investigation.

"Likewise, if you live in the area and saw anything or anyone suspicious on the Monday morning in question, please let us know and check your CCTV and dashcam in case it unearths vital information. The victim is being supported while we do all we can to find those responsible and put them before the courts."
