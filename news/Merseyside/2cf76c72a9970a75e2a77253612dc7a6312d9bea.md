Officers charged a man with drug and firearm offences in Liverpool yesterday, Tuesday 16 March.

Gavin Jones, 42, of Houlgrave Road, Kirkdale, was charged with conspiracy to supply Class A drugs, conspiracy to possess a Section 5 firearm, and converting criminal property.

Jones has been remanded in custody to appear at Wirral Magistrates Court this morning (Wednesday 17 March).

The charge is part of a national investigation into the supply of cocaine, and forms part of the Merseyside Police response to Operation Venetic: a national investigation into the use of encrypted mobile devices, commonly referred to as Encrochat.
