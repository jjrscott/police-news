Detectives investigating the murder of James Taylor in Liverpool last year have arrested two more men.

At around 8pm on Thursday 7 February 2019, emergency services were called to Addison Street, near to Liverpool City Centre, to reports of shots being fired. 34-year-old James was pronounced deceased at the scene. He had been parked in Addison Street waiting to pick up his daughter from Marybone Youth and Community Association in nearby Fontenoy Street.

This week, a 49-year-old man of no fixed abode and a 28-year-old man from Vauxhall were both arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder James. They were questioned and released under investigation pending further enquiries. Eight more men remain under investigation.

Detective Chief Inspector Rachel Wilson said: "Since our recent appeals one year on from the brutal murder of James, we have received more information from the community, and these two arrests are a further indication of the progress being made.

"I'd like to thank everyone who has come forward so far but if you are yet to do so, be assured that what you know could be the key to putting those responsible before the courts. If you're fearful about repercussions, we understand, but there are ways to get information to us anonymously, and we will deal sensitively with anything you tell us."
