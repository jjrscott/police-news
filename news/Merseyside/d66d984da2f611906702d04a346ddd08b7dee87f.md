We are appealing for help to find a 34-year-old man from Liverpool.

Officers investigating reports of threats to kill and criminal damage would like to speak to Joseph Burdett as he may have information which could assist them.

He is described as white, 5ft 10in tall, of heavy build with blue eyes and fair colour hair. He speaks with a Liverpool accent.

He has links to the L4 and L9 areas of Liverpool.

We are issuing one appeal per day for 12 days to support the work of our Force Fugitive Team, so help us track people down before Christmas.

Anyone with information on Burdett's whereabouts or any of our wanted people is asked to contact @MerPolCC or 101 with reference 20000667437.

You can also pass information anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. You can also contact them via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
