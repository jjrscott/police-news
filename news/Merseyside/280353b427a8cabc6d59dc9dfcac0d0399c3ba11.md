Detectives have launched a murder inquiry after a man was fatally stabbed in New Brighton this evening (Wednesday, 1 January 2020).

Officers were called to Rakersfield Road at 10.25pm by paramedics who were treating a 52-year-old man for a stab wound. The man was taken to Arrowe Park Hospital where he died a short while later.

Just over an hour later a 39-year-old man from New Brighton was arrested on suspicion of murder. He has been taken to a police station where he will be questioned by detectives.

Crime scene investigators are carrying out forensic examinations at the scene and house-to-house inquiries are being conducted in the area.

A Home Office Post Mortem will be carried out to establish the cause of death.

Anyone who has information, or who may have seen something, which could help our detectives with the investigation is asked to DM MerPolCC, or call 101 quoting reference 1132 of Wednesday, 1 January 2020.
