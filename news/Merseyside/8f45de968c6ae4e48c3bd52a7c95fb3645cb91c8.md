We are appealing for information following a serious road traffic collision in Netherton last night, Thursday 26 September.

At 8.40pm, emergency services were called to Park Lane to reports of a collision between an Audi and a male pedestrian in his 30s, who was crossing the carriageway. The pedestrian was taken to hospital where his condition is described as serious.

The driver of the Audi, a 29-year-old man from Litherland, was arrested on suspicion of drug driving and dangerous driving. He has been taken to a police station for questioning. CCTV and witness enquiries are continuing today and we want to hear from anyone with information.

Inspector Stuart McIver from our Roads Policing Unit said: "We need to hear from any witnesses to this collision as soon as possible, so if you haven't already spoken to police, please do so now. Our officers are looking to establish the exact circumstances of this incident, which has left a man with serious injuries.

"We are also specifically appealing for the driver of a dark coloured vehicle seen at the time of the collision to come forward.

"Anyone with dashcam, home CCTV or other footage could hold the key to our investigation so let us know."

Anyone with information can call our Roads Policing Unit on (0151) 777 5747 or email RPIU@merseyside.police.uk or contact our social media desk @MerPolCC or 101 with reference 19100556981. You can also pass information to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
