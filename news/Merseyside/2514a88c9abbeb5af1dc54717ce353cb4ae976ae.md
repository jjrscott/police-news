A 51 year old man from Liverpool has been arrested following a warrant at an address in Croxteth.

Officers undertook an MDA warrant yesterday morning (5th Feb) on Redruth Rd. Once inside they found a cannabis farm consisting of around 15mature plants worth around Â£60,000 as well as growing equipment.

The occupier was consequently arrested on suspicion of multiple drugs offences and for abstracting electricity. He was then taken to custody for questioning.

Chief Inspector Phil Mullally said: "Growing cannabis is a criminal offence and those supplying this are putting themselves and others at serious risk.

"Taking drugs off our streets is a crucial part of our Op Target activity. This warrant comes as a result of ongoing concerns in Towerhill, Kirkby and we will continue working with the public and our partners to gain further intelligence, arrest criminals and ensure our communities are kept as safe as they can be."

Anyone with information on the cultivation of cannabis or other criminal offences should get in touch, please call 101, DM @MerPolCC or contact @CrimestoppersUK anonymously. #OpTarget
