We have charged a 28 year-old man with possession of a firearm.

Troy Hackett, of Glegside Road, Kirkby, was arrested in the Runcorn area on Friday 18th December. He was taken into custody and charged with possession of a s5 firearm following the recovery of a weapon at a property in Liverpool last month.

He was refused bail and will appear in court in the new year.

Knowsley Community Policing Inspector Peter Rexwinkel said: "We know that gun crime can devastate our communities and Merseyside Police is committed to acting on intelligence to find out who is using weapons and where they are being stored.

"I would continue to ask people to come forward with information. They are our ears and eyes and their information can prove vital to us being able to take weapons and the people who use them to cause fear or intimidation off our streets."

Anyone with information about gun crime in their area can DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111.
