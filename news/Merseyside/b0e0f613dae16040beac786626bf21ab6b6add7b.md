15-year-old Ben (pictured above and below) was last seen in the Blackpool area on Tuesday 9 March and extensive enquiries have been ongoing to find him, including a previous appeal.

He is described as white, 5ft 2in tall, of slim build, with short dark brown hair, a pale complexion, hazel eyes that sometimes appear blue and speaks with a Liverpool accent.

When last seen, Ben was wearing a black bubble coat, black tracksuit bottoms, black trainers and a black cap.

He is known to frequent the Norris Green area.
