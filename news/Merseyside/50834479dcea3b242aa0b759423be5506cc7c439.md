Detectives are appealing for information following a cash in transit robbery in Halewood yesterday, Monday 24 February.

At around 2.30pm, offices were called to Cookhouse pub and carvery on Mackets Lane to reports of a security guard being approached from behind. A cash box was stolen, but no threats were made or injuries caused.

CCTV and witness enquiries are ongoing. The men are believed to have been wearing dark clothing.

Detective Inspector Phil Atkinson said: "At this stage we are keen to speak to anyone who saw this incident, or these men making off on foot or into a vehicle. The cash box was taken without force but we know that offenders are often armed and willing to cause fear and injury.

"If you have any CCTV or dashcam, let us know and we will take action. The smallest detail could be the key to finding those responsible and removing them from the streets."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 with reference 20000119260.
