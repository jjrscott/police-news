We are appealing for witnesses following a knifepoint robbery of bikes from teenagers in Southport last Friday night, 7 February.

At around 8pm, a teenage boy and teenage girl were in Kings Gardens when they were approached by two males, one of whom was in possession of a knife.

Demands were made for their bikes, and the girl was punched in the leg, before the offenders rode off on the bikes in the direction of Morrisons.

Both offenders were described as wearing masks and worker or combat pants.

The bikes stolen were a silver Boardman MHT 8.8 Eagle mountain bike (pictured) with a distinctive mug guard, and a grey/orange Voodoo 'Bantu' mountain bike. CCTV and witness enquiries continue.

Detective Inspector Catherine Walsh said: "Thankfully neither of the victims were seriously hurt, but to be threatened with a knife and assaulted is an extremely distressing experience and we are working closely with the victims and local community to find those responsible.

"Were you in the park around that time and saw anyone acting suspiciously, or witnessed two people matching this description riding these bikes shortly after 8pm, in the direction of Birkdale.

"Home CCTV, dashcam or mobile phone images or footage could be vital in putting these people before the courts, so pass us any detail and we will take action."

You can pass information via @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, with reference number 20000083187.
