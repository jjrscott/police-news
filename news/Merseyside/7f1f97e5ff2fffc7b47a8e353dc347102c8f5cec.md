We can confirm that three people have been arrested and drugs and a quad bike seized following warrants in the Sefton Park area this morning, Friday 24 July.

At around 7.20am, officers carried out warrants at Sydenham House. Quantities of suspected cannabis, MDMA and nitrous oxide were seized, in addition to a suspected stolen quad bike.

An 18-year-old man from Sefton Park; an 18-year-old man from Wavertree; and an 18-year-old woman from Formby were arrested on suspicion of possession of Class A, Class B and psychoactive substances; and handling stolen goods.

They have all been taken to police stations for questioning.

Inspector Charlotte Irlam said: "The activity this morning has removed harmful drugs from circulation, which causes significant damage to individuals and can attract serious violent crime to our communities. We know from speaking to residents just how welcome this activity has been, and thank them for their patience while we were in attendance.

"If you have any information on suspected drug dealing or vehicle crime where you are, please come forward and we will take positive action, just like today."
