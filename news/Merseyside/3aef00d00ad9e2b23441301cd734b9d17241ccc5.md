We are appealing for information after an RTC in Childwall this evening, Wednesday 24 March.

At around 5.25pm, emergency services were called to Childwall Valley Road to reports of a collision outside the Shell Petrol Station involving an Audi A1 and a Volkswagen Passat private hire vehicle. One passenger has been taken to hospital to be checked over as a precaution.

The drivers of both vehicles stopped at the scene to assist.

The road has now reopened.

A Roads Policing spokesperson said: "These are the early stages of our investigation and we're working to establish exactly what happened in the lead-up and aftermath of this incident.

"We would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident, or was driving or passing the location at the time and thinks they may have captured anything of note, either on CCTV, dashcam or other devices."

You can contact @MerPolCC on Twitter or 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook, with reference 804 of 24/03.
