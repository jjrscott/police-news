We are appealing for information after a report of criminal damage to a car in the Northwood area of Kirby yesterday (Sunday 14 February).

It was reported that on Bigdale Road at around 5.40pm, four male youths had jumped onto a silver Ford Fiesta and smashed the windscreen.

The youths are then believed to have made off on foot in the direction of Daleside Road.

One youth was wearing a black jacket, a grey under jacket and black trousers; one was wearing a black jacket and grey jeans; one was wearing a white puffa jacket with black panels and one was wearing a light grey tracksuit with a stripe down the side.

CCTV and witness enquiries are ongoing.

Community Inspector David Morgan said: "We do not tolerate any anti-social behaviour on our streets. Everyone in Merseyside has the right to feel safe and protected where they live. We know the nuisance that can be caused by wanton acts of criminal damage such as this and, although not injured, the victim was left extremely shaken by the incident.

"I would urge anyone who was in the Northwood area of Kirkby last night who may have seen or heard anything suspicious to come forward so we can find those responsible and bring them to justice."

If you have any information about this incident, please contact our social media desk on Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' with reference 21000097828, or call 101.

You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
