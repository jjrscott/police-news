We are appealing for witnesses following an incident in which two men were assaulted in Fairfield.

At around 9.25pm on Monday 27th April a man was walking along Rawlins Street, close to the junction of Edge Grove, when he had stones thrown at him by an unknown male.

He was in the same area again later that night with another man when both men were confronted by four males and assaulted. It is believed the four males used weapons included a baseball bat, a chair and a bottle.

One of the men suffered a cut to his ear and the second suffered swelling to his face and head including a chipped tooth during the assault.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or thinks they may have captured it on dash cam or CCTV footage is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 20000244402.
