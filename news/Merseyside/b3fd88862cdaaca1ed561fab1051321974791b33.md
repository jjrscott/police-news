Detectives have launched a murder investigation following the death of a man in Toxteth in the early hours of this morning (Friday, 26 June).

At around 6.15am, Police were called by the Ambulance service to an address in Oakham Street, to reports a man, believed to be in his 20s, had been stabbed.

The victim was pronounced dead at the scene.

The victim's family have been informed and will be supported by specially trained officers. The man is yet to be formally identified and a Home Office Post Mortem will take place to establish the cause of death.
