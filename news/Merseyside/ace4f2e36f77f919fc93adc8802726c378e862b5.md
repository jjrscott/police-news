We can confirm we responded to an incident in Wavertree this morning, Friday, 11 October.

Officers received reports of an assault and a possible firearms discharge as two loud bangs were heard in Rokesmith Avenue just before 1am. It is reported a group of males wearing face coverings attended at an address and assaulted a male.

Investigations have so far revealed no evidence of a firearms discharge at this stage.

Enquiries are ongoing into establishing the facts at this early stage, with one man taken to hospital with superficial wounds caused by an assault.

A scene is in place in Rokesmith Avenue, Barnet Close and Acton Way, while officers carry out witness, forensic and CCTV enquiries with a further search of the area in daylight.

Detective Chief Inspector Cheryl Rhodes said: "We are in the very early stages of our investigation and we are trying to establish exactly what happened. We would appeal to anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area around 1am this morning to talk to us.

"If you have any information, including dash cam footage then please come forward to help in our investigation."

Anyone with information can contact @MerPolCC or 101 with reference 0029 of 11/10/19 or come forward anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
