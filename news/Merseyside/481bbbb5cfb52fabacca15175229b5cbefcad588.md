Detectives investigating a shooting in Huyton on Tuesday afternoon (1 September) are continuing to appeal for witnesses after a man was admitted to hospital with leg injuries.

At 3pm, armed officers were called to Hathersage Road to reports of a shotgun being fired in the street.

A woman in her 30s, who happened to be nearby at the time of the incident and was not believed to have been the target, sustained a minor facial wound after a shotgun pellet struck her. She was treated in hsopital before being discharged from hospital the same day.

A 37-year-old man later presented at hospital and following enquires, officers believe he was the target of the discharge. He was treated in hospital for injuries to his legs consistent with a shotgun discharge and discharged last night.

Officers remain in the area carrying out forensic, CCTV, house-to-house and witness enquiries, and to speak to the local community.

Detective Chief Inspector Matt Smith of our Firearms Investigation Unit said: "This incident is a very clear illustration of the harm that can be done when a firearm is so recklessly used on the streets of Merseyside.

"To fire a shotgun in broad daylight on a residential street always carries the risk of causing injury to completely innocent bystanders and sadly in this case, that has happened.

"Thankfully no-one has been seriously injured in this incident, but the result could easily have been far worse.

"This will have been a terrifying incident not just for those injured, but for all those living on the street and we will do everything in our power to bring those responsible to justice to make our communities safer.

"You can help us by coming forward with information on this incident, and on anyone you suspect may be storing firearms.

"If you saw the incident, saw or heard anyone acting suspiciously in the area at about 3pm, or were passing in a car and have dashcam you may have information that could prove vital to our enquiries.

"We act on all information on gun crime and serious violence. Tell us what you know and we will put those involved before the courts, and remove dangerous weapons from the streets."

Officers are continuing to appeal for information and anyone who can help with our inquiries is asked to contact our social media desk on Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' quoting the reference number 20000526785.
