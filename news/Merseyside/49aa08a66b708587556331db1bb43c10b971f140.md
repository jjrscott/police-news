We recovered a firearm in Kirkby this morning (Monday 25 February).

A report was received at around 9.20am that a shotgun had been discovered in undergrowth off Leyburn Close in Southdene.

Officers attended and the firearm, which was in a black rucksack, has been removed safely and taken for forensic examination. A scene remains in place while enquiries continue in the area.

Detective Inspector Jackie Guinness said: "An investigation is now underway following the recovery of this weapon and I would ask anyone with information about who stored it there to come forward.

"Another dangerous weapon has been removed from the hands of criminals, and enquiries will be carried out to establish whether it is linked to any incidents involving firearms.

"I want to reassure the public that we are continuing to work tirelessly to pursue those involved in serious and organised crime. They have no place in our communities and it is vital that people continue to come forward with information so we can put them before the courts.

"If anyone has any information about this recovered firearm, those involved in gun crime, or who knows where weapons are being stored, please get in touch."
