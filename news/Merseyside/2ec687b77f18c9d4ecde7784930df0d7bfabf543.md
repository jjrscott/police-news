Officers supporting a South Wales Police operation carried out a warrant on Marsden Rd in #Halewood yesterday morning (4th Feb) as part of our continued efforts to stop drugs being supplied and used across the region.

On arrival, officers managed to gain access to the address where a 20 year old man was found and arrested on suspicion of Conspiracy to Supply Class A Drugs.

During a further search of the property, a small amount of cannabis, a BB handgun, a bat and a samurai sword were seized and taken to be destroyed.

As part of the same operation, a 33 year old woman was also arrested again on suspicion of Conspiracy to Supply Class A Drugs from an address on Boundary Farm Road.

Both people arrested are now being dealt with by South Wales Police.
