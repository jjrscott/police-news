We are appealing for witnesses after a 27 year-old man was assaulted and had his watch stolen in the early hours of Sunday 28th June.

We were contacted following reports that the man had been walking to his car in the Beaumont Street area of Toxteth at around 4.30am when he was assaulted by four males wearing masks and armed with knives. His designer watch was also stolen.

The man suffered stab wounds to his buttocks and head during the incident. He was taken to hospital for treatment for his injuries which are not believed to be life-threatening.

An investigation is underway and house-to-house and CCTV enquiries have been carried out.

Detective Sergeant Richie Shillito said: "I would appeal to anyone who was in the area around Beaumont Street around 4.30am who saw anyone or anything suspicious to contact us. Similarly I would ask for anyone who captured anything significant on dash-cam footage to get in touch as they may have information which is vital to our investigation.

"The investigation is in the early stages but we are determined to find the people responsible for this assault and robbery and I would urge anyone who knows anything to come forward."

Anyone who witnessed the incident is asked to DM @MerPolCC or contact @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 20000377145.
