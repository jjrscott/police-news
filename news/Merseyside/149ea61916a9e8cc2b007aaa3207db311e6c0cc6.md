Do you know where this man is?

Khalid Saif, 43, from Tuebrook is wanted on a recall to prison.

Saif was released from prison after serving part of a sentence for possession of a bladed article in public. He was jailed for 23 weeks on 7 November following an incident in London on 20 May 2019.

Saif has since breached the conditions of his licence, which has now been revoked and a prison recall issued.

Originally from Syria, Saif is described as 5ft 6in tall, of medium build, with black hair and brown eyes.

It is believed he may be sleeping rough in the London area.

Anyone who believes they have seen Saif recently is asked to contact @MerPolCC on Twitter or call 101 quoting reference 2000047549. You can also pass on information anonymously via the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously
