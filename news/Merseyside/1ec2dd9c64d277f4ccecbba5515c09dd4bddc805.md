Officers are continuing to step up patrols to prevent the illegal use of scrambler bikes and motorbikes and remove them from our streets.

After a number of reports of offenders riding illegally, patrols including police motorbikes and quad bikes from the Roads Policing Unit, the Dog Section and community officers have been deployed to key hotspots to deter riders, reassure the community and apprehend anyone reckless enough to ride illegally in Merseyside.

In the past week a number of scrambler bikes, motorbikes and quad bikes have been seized by police and their riders arrested, including the following:

• On Wednesday (8 April) night, a 27-year-old man was arrested after a stolen motorbike was ridden around Liverpool. He was tracked from 8.10pm in Walton with the assistance of the National Police Air Service helicopter and together with the Roads Policing Unit, Dog Unit and other officers, the bike was stopped using a stop stick and the rider arrested on Long lane, Walton

• A scrambler bike rider was arrested during the incident after he seen with no helmet and pursued on foot in woods near Kirkby Valley Golf Club

• Earlier on Wednesday, at 3.40pm, an off road bike with two males on board was seen by patrols on Dakin Walk, Kirkby. The passenger got off the bike and ran off before being pursued on foot by officers and detained shortly after on Ashfield Crescent. A 34-year-old man from Kirkby was arrested on suspicion of three counts of burglary and has been released on conditional police bail

• A stolen Honda CBR was recovered on Brook Hey Drive, Northwood, Kirkby on Sunday (5 April) after officers responded to reports of a bike being hidden

• A scooter stolen in St Helens was recovered on Knowsley Lane, Knowsley Village on Monday (6 April) and the rider arrested after he attempted to make off. He was arrested on suspicion of driving with no insurance and otherwise than in accordance with a licence, as well as on suspicion of an unrelated racially aggravated assault

• A Suzuki Scooter was found abandoned in Carr Lane Woods, Prescot on Thursday (9 April)

• After receiving a number of reports of scrambler bikes in St Helens on Sunday (5 April), the Roads Policing Unit was deployed, assisted by the National police Air Service, and one male arrested and two bikes seized

• After a report of a scrambler bike and quad bike riding dangerously in the Hillfoot Road area of Hunts Cross on Tuesday (7 April), the vehicles were abandoned in woodland in Speke and recovered by officers

Superintendent Gary O'Rourke said: "Our officers share the frustration felt by the public when scrambler bikes are ridden illegally, often dangerously and at speed.

"We are determined to make sure those who put themselves and others at serious risk of injury or worse are brought to justice, and the vehicles they use taken off them.

"We have had great success in the past seven days taking vehicles off the street and bringing offenders to justice.

"Officers in Birkenhead on 27 March detained the rider of a KTM scrambler bike at traffic lights after they stopped behind him. The rider was unaware of the presence of one officer who left his police vehicle and approached him from behind on foot, before detaining him as he tried to ride off. The 27-year-old man from Birkenhead was arrested on suspicion of stealing a motor vehicle, dangerous driving, failing to stop and drug driving.

"I hope this illustrates that our officers will stop at nothing, and do everything in their power to stop such people from blighting our roads and open spaces."

Supt O'Rourke added: "We have seen a reduction in general calls to the police, which means we have been able to put more officers on the streets to proactively stop criminals from engaging in anti-social behaviour such as the riding of scrambler bikes.

"We will continue to make use of our strong relationship with City Watch, whose CCTV cameras keep an eye on our roads and whose mobile camera can be sent to parks and open spaces, helping us gather evidence and track the movement of the bikes.

"Information from the public has proved a vital part of our efforts to remove these vehicles, and with more people at home respecting instructions to limit travel, I call upon anyone who realises people near them are storing illegal bikes to get in touch.

"And if you see anyone riding one of these bikes, putting themselves and other road users in danger and increasing the risk of putting pressure on the NHS at a very challenging time, please let us know and we will take action."
