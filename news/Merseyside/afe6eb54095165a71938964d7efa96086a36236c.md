We have issued images of three people we believe could have information that may assist an investigation into an assault in Southport in December.

At about 2.30am on Saturday 15 December, a group of people entered the Istanbul Kebab Shop, West Street, Southport.

A short time later a man and woman entered and after a brief conversation with the group, the man was assaulted by two of the group who kicked and stamped on him, causing bruising. A third person assaulted the female victim, who was also left with bruising.

The two people who assaulted the man then attacked a member of staff, leaving him with a facial injury.

We are appealing to anyone who recognises the two men and one woman pictured to get in touch, as we believe they may have vital information that could assist our enquiries into this incident.

If you know who they are, please contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre'.
