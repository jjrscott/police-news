Yesterday (3rd December) officers in Knowsley attended an address on Grantham Road, Kirkby where two men, aged 58 and 24 were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of a controlled Class B drug.

A search of a property resulted in the recovery of cannabis bush, cash and drugs paraphernalia.

In addition to this, a number of designer clothing, shoes, a Rolex watch, a PS5, XBOX and high end televisions were seized under Section 47 Proceeds of Crime Act.

Both men were arrested at the scene and taken to custody for questioning. They have since been released under investigation.

PC Emma Terry said: "Criminals are using illegal profits to live extravagant lifestyles and it is not fair on our hard working and law-abiding members of the community.

"We will do everything we can to put a stop to criminals living in this way and will continue to investigate all crime reported to us.

"Anyone with information should please get in contact with us via social media @MerPolCC, contacting @CrimestoppersUK or calling 999 in an emergency."
