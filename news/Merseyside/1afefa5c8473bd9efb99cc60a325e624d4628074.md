Detectives investigating an assault in Liverpool city centre have issued a CCTV image of two males they believe may be able to assist enquiries.

It was reported that at around 2.10am on Sunday, 19 July 2020, a 23-year-old man was assaulted by two men on Slater Street. He was hit with a glass bottle, causing a serious but non-life threatening facial wound which required hospital treatment.

An investigation is ongoing and detectives are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

Detective Inspector Phil Atkinson said: "This nasty assault left a man with a serious facial injury and although a few months have passed, we know Slater Street and the surrounding area was busy at time, and a number of people would've witnessed the incident.

"We are appealing for anyone with information to get in touch and are particularly keen to speak to the males pictured, as we believe they may have vital information to assist the investigation. If you recognise them, witnessed the incident, or have any information, please let us know.

Anyone who recognises the males pictured or has any information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 quoting ref. 20000424635 or Crimestoppers, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
