We can confirm a man has been arrested as part of an investigation into child sex offences.

At around 6pm yesterday, Monday, 22 February, officers arrested a man following the stop check of a vehicle on Dryden Road, Liverpool. The arrest follows a joint investigation with North West Regional Organised Crime Unit (NWROCU) into sexual communications with a child.

A 30-year-old man from Knowsley was arrested on suspicion of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and was taken for questioning. He has been released under investigation pending further enquiries and an investigation is ongoing.
