A man and woman have been arrested after officers recovered a submachine pistol from a loft in a house in Everton yesterday (Saturday, 15 February).

A warrant was executed at about 2.30pm at a house on Patmos Close and during an extensive search of the property officers found the lethal weapon.

A 28-year-old man and a 25-year-old woman from Everton have been arrested and taken to a police station on Merseyside where they are being questioned by detectives.

Detective Chief Inspector Rachel Wilson, said: "The force is committed to tackling those involved in serious organised crime, particularly those involved in gun crime, and has dedicated significant resources into taking weapons and offenders off our streets.

"This is a significant recovery of an extremely dangerous weapon and as a result our streets are safer today.

"We will continue to use all the powers available to us, including stop and search, in our pursuit to put those involved in serious organised crime before the courts and behind bars."
