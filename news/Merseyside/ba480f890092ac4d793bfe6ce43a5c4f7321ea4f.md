We have seized a cannabis farm worth around £250,000 following a drugs warrant earlier this week in Prenton, Wirral.

At around 4.20pm, entry was gained to a home on Elmswood Road, within which were 60 cannabis plants across three upstairs rooms, with an estimated annual yield of £240,000. The electricity had been bypassed and was made safe.

Officers from our specialist Cannabis Dismantling Team (CDT) searched the address and subsequently recovered the plants and equipment.

Matt Brown, who heads the CDT, said: "This farm was a particular danger to neighbouring properties, given that the electricity had been bypassed in a complex way. Thankfully it has now been made safe, but set-ups like this carry a very real threat of fire and flood, as well as attracting those involved in serious, violent crime.

"I'd encourage anyone who suspects that cannabis is being grown in their communities to get in touch, either directly to police or anonymously via Crimestoppers, and we will make your street safe."

Some of the signs that cannabis is being grown are:

• Strange smells and sounds
• Frequent and varied visitors to a property, often at unusual times
• Gardening equipment being taken into a property, such as plant pots, fertiliser, fans and industrial lighting
• Windows are sealed and covered or the curtains are permanently closed
• Heat from an adjoining property
• Birds gathering on a roof in cold weather
• Individually these activities may seem commonplace, however, together may indicate something more sinister

Anyone with information on suspected cannabis growing in their community can contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or come forward anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 and we will do the rest.
