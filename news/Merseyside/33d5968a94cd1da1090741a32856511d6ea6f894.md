We are issuing CCTV images of three females and one male who we believe could have vital information that would assist an investigation into an assault outside McDonalds in Walton.

The incident was reported to have happened at around 9.30pm on 23 July.

After a verbal altercation inside McDonalds on County Road, a 23-year-old woman was assaulted by a small group of teenage girls nearby, on Walton Road.

The woman sustained bruising and swelling to the face after the attackers punched her and pulled at her hair.

Anyone who recognises the people pictured or has any information is asked to contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police CC.
