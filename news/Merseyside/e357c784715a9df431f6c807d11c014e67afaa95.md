Detectives have arrested a man following a stabbing in Wirral last night, Thursday 7 November.

At 9.10pm, officers were called to Thompson Street in Tranmere to reports of a man in his 30s sustaining a single stab wound to his leg. The victim was taken to hospital for treatment of the non life-threatening wound and has since been discharged.

Following enquiries, a 20-year-old man from Tranmere was arrested a short time later on suspicion of Section 18 wounding and possession of cannabis.

He has been taken to custody to be questioned.

Detective Inspector Nick Suffield said: "Although a man has been promptly arrested in connection with this incident, we are still keen to speak to anyone who saw the incident take place or has heard anything since, and has yet to contact us. We want to establish exactly what happened and why.

"Come forward, either directly or anonymously via Crimestoppers, and we will continue to take positive action against those we suspect are involved in violent crime, which has no place in our communities."

Anyone with information who has yet to come forward is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
