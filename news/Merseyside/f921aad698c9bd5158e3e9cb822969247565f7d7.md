We are appealing for help to identify two males we believe could have vital information that could assist detectives investigating an assault in Waterloo on Sunday 13 September.

It was reported at about 1.30am that a man was punched to the face following a verbal altercation outside Parnells Cafe and Sports Bar on South Road.

The victim sustained facial injuries and a wound to the back of his head as he fell into the road, and lost consciousness.

Detectives are keen to speak to the two males pictured as they believe they could have information that would help them with their enquiries.

If you are the males pictured or know who they are, please contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre'. You can also call 101 quoting incident reference 20000552836, or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
