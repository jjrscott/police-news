We are appealing for information after a bike seat was thrown at a man at Asda in Birkenhead on Saturday evening (21 March 2020).

It was reported at 8pm that a group of up to five youths had approached the man before one threw the bike seat in the foyer of the supermarket on Grange Road, which struck the man's head leaving a gash which required hospital treatment.

Community Inspector Tom Welch said: "We are aware that there has been an issue in Birkenhead with youths behaving in an anti-social manner, congregating on bikes.

"We have responded to this by putting more officers on patrol in key areas, backed by the Government funded Operation Target, which has also enabled us to carry out warrants, land searches, stop searches, roadside stops and more.

"In this incident, we believe the offender was with a group of around four others on bikes. While we are still exploring CCTV opportunities and appealing for information to help us bring the offender to justice in this case, we are following some strong lines of enquiry and we did make significant arrests over the weekend during Operation Clear.

"On Saturday, officers on foot in the Birkenhead area near to Asda used stop search powers and arrested three people for drugs possession as well as possession of stolen goods, and this activity will continue to ensure anyone engaging in illegal and anti-social activity faces justice for the harm they cause in the heart of our community."
