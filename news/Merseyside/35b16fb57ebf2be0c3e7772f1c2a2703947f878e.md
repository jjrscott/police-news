Officers from our Cyber Dependent Crime Unit, with assistance from the Matrix, executed a search warrant on Astley Road in #Knowsley today following an investigation into PayPal account hacking.

A 15 year old boy, who is suspected of hacking a number of UK PayPal accounts during 2020, was arrested on suspicion of Section 1 of the Computer Misuse Act 1990.

Several high value goods were seized from the address including an iPhone 11, iPhone 8, Apple Watch, Samsung phone, Apple Airpods, an iPad, a Sony mobile phone and a mini motorbike

The suspect has been interviewed and released under investigation.

To reduce your chances of being a victim of this type of crime we recommend that PayPal users set up two factor authentication on their accounts - https://www.paypal.com/us/smarthelp/article/how-do-i-enable-2fa-(two-factor-authentication)-for-my-paypal-powered-by-braintree-user-faq3500
