We have arrested and charged a Walton man with drug offenders following an incident in Kirkdale yesterday, Tuesday 10 September.

At 2.55pm, officers saw a man leaving the Britannia Pub on Latimer Street. The man ran back into the pub and was detained and searched.

Suspected cocaine and cannabis was found, in addition to cash.

20-year-old Georgie Dobie from Sparrow Hall Road in Walton has now been charged with intent to supply cocaine and possession of cannabis.

Dobie will appear this morning (Wednesday 11 September) at South Sefton Magistrates Court.
