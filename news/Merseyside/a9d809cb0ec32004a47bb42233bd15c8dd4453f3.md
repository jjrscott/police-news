Wanted

12:39 03/03/2021

We are appealing for help in finding a 22 year-old wanted on recall to prison.

Kieran Gregory, who is originally from the Bootle area, was released from prison in November 2020 after serving a sentence for possession of drugs with intent to supply.

He is wanted on recall to prison after failing to abide by the conditions of his licence.

He is described as a white male, 6ft tall, of proportionate build, with light brown hair and blue eyes.

Anyone who has seen him or knows of his whereabouts is asked to DM @MerPolCC or contact @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111.
