We arrested three people following a ram raid burglary in Southport last night, Friday 12 February.

Just before 10.20pm, officers were called to Flannels clothing store on Tulketh Street to reports of a vehicle ramming the front of the premises.

Damage was caused to the exterior and interior, and a number of Canada Goose and Moncler coats were stolen.

It is believed the offenders used a black Ford Kuga, reported stolen earlier the same day from Bowering Park Road between 2.30-3.30pm.

At 11.45pm, a black Audi A3 car was seen by patrols on Ince Road in Thornton and stopped by the officers. During a search of the car, a number of Monclear coats with tags on and Flannels coat hangers were found and seized, and the occupants of the car detained.

A 24-year-old man from Fairfield, a 23-year-old man from Croxteth and a 20-year-old woman from Liverpool city centre were arrested on suspicion of burglary and handling stolen goods. They have been taken into custody to be interviewed.

Officers remain at the location this morning to carry out continued enquiries.

Detective Inspector Chris Smith said: "It is terrible to think that anyone could target a shop in this way, especially at such a challenging time for businesses.

"This ram raid has caused significant damage and huge inconvenience to a shop in our community, and we are keen to hear from anyone who saw the incident, or captured the vehicle in question on CCTV or dashcam in or around the area at 10.20pm last night.

"We are also keen to hear from anyone who may have seen people acting suspiciously around 2.20-3.30pm in the Bowering Park Road area, when the black Ford Kuga we believe was used by the offenders was stolen."
