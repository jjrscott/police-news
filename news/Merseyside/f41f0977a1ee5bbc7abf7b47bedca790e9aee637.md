Merseyside Police is joining our partners in supporting the national domestic abuse campaign 'You Are Not Alone', which aims to spread the message that there continues to be support available for victims and survivors of domestic abuse despite the current restrictions in place due to the Covid-19 outbreak.

Detective Superintendent Sue Coombs said: "Protecting our most vulnerable communities is one of the Force's priorities and we realise that being able to support and advise victims of domestic abuse has never been more important that it is now.

"I want people to feel reassured that despite the current uncertainties our work continues as normal and our officers will continue to investigate allegations and support victims.

"We are working closely with local domestic support organisations and charities to ensure that services and ongoing support are available to anyone that needs it during the lockdown period, including access to refuges.

"No one should have to deal with domestic abuse alone. We're supporting the Government's #YouAreNotAlone campaign and over the coming weeks we'll be sharing information about how we, and the many local domestic abuse services in your area, can offer help and support."

Mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson said: "To anyone out there who is struggling with an abusive partner, please make contact with us and we will get you the help you need to get you out of the situation you find yourself in."

Liverpool City Council's Cabinet Member for Communities, Cllr Liz Parsons, said: "Because of coronavirus I am at home self-isolating to stay safe but if home is not a safe place for you then we want you to know that you are not alone.

"If you are suffering from any form of abuse, it's never ok and you do not have to stay at home if it is not safe to be there.

"We want you to know that we are here to help, so please talk to us."

 If you have any non-urgent information on domestic abuse - if you are a victim or believe someone you know is a victim - you can contact direct message @MerPolCC on Twitter, 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook or contact @CrimestoppersUK, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
