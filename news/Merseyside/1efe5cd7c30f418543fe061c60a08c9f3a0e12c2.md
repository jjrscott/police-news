We have issued images of three men we believe may have information that will assist detectives investigating an assault in Liverpool city centre.

It was reported a 38-year-old man from Liverpool had been spat at and assaulted by three men on Basnett Street at about 5.40pm on Sunday (20 December).

The offenders made off on foot before patrols arrived.

The man suffered cuts and bruising to his head, and is receiving the support of officers.

Enquiries were carried out in the local area to trace the men, and CCTV footage from across the city centre is being looked at.

Detective Inspector Lynsay Armbruster said: "This was a shocking attack and as part of our enquires we have located images of three men we would like to speak to.

"We believe they have information that could help our enquiries into the assault, and help us to bring justice for the victim.

"If you are one of the men pictured, or recognise them, please get in touch, and we will do the rest."

Anyone who recognises the men is asked to DM @MerPolCC or message Merseyside Police Contact Centre on Facebook, quoting reference 20000772434. You can also pass information anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, or contact them via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
