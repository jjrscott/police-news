We have arrested two people and recovered a quantity of drugs and cash following the stop-check of a vehicle in St Helens on Friday, 9 October.

At around 4.30pm, a vehicle in a car park on Blackbrook Road came to the attention of patrols in the area.

A search of the vehicle uncovered a quantity of white powder, and officers arrested a 35-year-old man from St Helens on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of class A drugs and driving without insurance, and a 25-year-old woman from St Helens on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of class A drugs.

During the subsequent search of a property in Bolton Avenue, officers recovered a large amount of cash, a number of mobile phones, suspected cocaine, cannabis and steroids.

The man and woman were further arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply a controlled drug of class A, B and C and possession of criminal property.

They have both been released under investigation as enquiries continue.

Anyone with information on the supply of drugs in your area is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 or @CrimestopperUK, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
