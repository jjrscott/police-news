Officers have arrested a 41 year old woman yesterday (11th April) for multiple drugs offences including possession with intent to supply drugs and drug driving.

The woman was stopped on Church Road, Liverpool after officers spotted her driving in a dangerous way.

She was tested at the roadside for drugs which returned a positive result for cocaine. The car was then searched and she was found to be in possession of over 1000 containers suspected of being used to distribute cannabis.

The woman was arrested for drug driving and on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of cannabis.

An additional search of her house in Dingle was carried out where officers went on to find a large amount of cannabis disguised as 'legal high' worth around £7000-£8000, a large quantity of money hidden in the fridge and drugs paraphernalia.

The woman was subsequently arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class B drugs and possession of criminal property.

Sgt Steve Passey said: "This woman clearly thinks she is above the law by actively being involved in drug crime and driving whilst under the influence of cocaine, putting herself and others at considerable risk.

"It is pleasing to see a large amount of drugs that have now been taken off the streets of Merseyside and I would urge anyone that knows someone involved in drug crime or any crime for that matter to please get in touch so we can keep Merseyside safe." #OpTarget
