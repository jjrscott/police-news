Detectives in Wirral are appealing for information, after a man was shot with what is thought to be a pellet gun this evening (Thursday, 13 August.)

The incident is thought to have happened sometime between 6.20pm and 6.50pm, when the man was walking along Borough Road with a friend when he felt something hit the back of his neck. His injuries aren't thought to be serious but he has been taken to hospital.

Detectives are appealing for anyone who was in the area at the time who may have seen a dark coloured car, possibly blue or black to get in contact. Officers would be particularly keen for anyone who may have any dash cam footage of this area around this time, to get in contact.

CCTV from the area is being examined and the scene will be forensically examined. Detectives would urge anyone who can assist with this investigation, to contact @MerPolCC or call 101 quoting reference 1024 or @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111. You can submit any footage via the following link
