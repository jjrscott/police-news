We have arrested a man following a firearms discharge in Kirkby earlier this week.

On Monday 23 March it was reported that a shot was fired at a house on Whitefield Drive.

Nobody was injured but there was damage to the front door of the house consistent with a firearms discharge.

Following police investigations, a 21-year-old man frim Kirkby was arrested in connection with the incident yesterday (Thursday 25 March).

He has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Detective Inspector John Fitzgerald said: "Our streets are made safer with every arrest we make in connection with firearms and our arrest yesterday shows that we will not tolerate weapons and those who use them to create fear in our communities.

"We are committed to taking weapons off our streets and, rest assured, if you tell us about any suspected possession or offences we will take action and put those responsible before the courts."
