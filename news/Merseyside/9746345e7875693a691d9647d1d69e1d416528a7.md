Detectives have arrested three people and are appealing for information following a stabbing in Old Swan this afternoon, Friday 12 February.

At around 3.10pm, emergency services were called to Davidson Road to reports of a man in his 20s being assaulted. The victim was taken to hospital via ambulance for assessment of serious injuries.

Two men and one woman were arrested a short time later on suspicion of Section 18 wounding with intent. They have all been taken to police stations for questioning.

Officers remain in the area to carry out forensic, house-to-house and witness enquiries.

Detective Inspector Jennie Beck said: "Although we have arrested three men in connection with this serious assault, we're keen to speak to anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious in the area this afternoon. Your information, home CCTV, dashcam or other images could be vital as we continue to investigate.

"We take positive action on all you tell us, so speak directly or anonymously and we'll do the rest."
