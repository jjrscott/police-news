Officers from our Matrix team yesterday (3rd Dec) recovered a firearm whilst conducting an open land search around Spinney Woods in Stockbridge Village.

The 9mm pistol was found wrapped up in a black plastic bag & has now been forensically examined. Enquiries are ongoing to establish who the owner is & why the gun has ended up here.
