Do you recognise these two males?

We believe they may have information that could help detectives investigating an assault in Southport on 30 August this year.

It was reported a male and female were assaulted in an unprovoked attack on Waverley Street at around 1.10am that day.

The male victim was knocked unconscious and the female was knocked to the ground, damaging her teeth.

Later that day, a 19-year-old man from Southport was arrested on suspicion of two counts of assault and possession of a Class B drug (cannabis). He has been released under investigation.

As part of ongoing enquiries, officers have issued these images and ask anyone who knows them to come forward.

Detective Inspector Paul Gillies said: "This was a nasty and unprovoked assault that left two people with injuries. While the injuries will heal, they were left extremely shaken by the incident.

"Our enquiries are progressing well, and we have made an arrest. But we are keen to gather more information, and we believe the two males pictured can help us establish what took place.

"If you are the males pictured, recognise them, witnessed the incident, or have any information, please let us know.

Anyone who recognises the males pictured or has any information is asked to contact @MerPolCC on Twitter, 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook or call 101 quoting reference 20000521950.
