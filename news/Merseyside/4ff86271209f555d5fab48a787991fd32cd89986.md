We can confirm that enquiries are ongoing following a suspicious incident in Walton reported on Monday 7 September.

At around 3.15pm, officers were informed of an alleged attempt to lure an 11-year-old boy into a white van on Walton Vale, close to the Windsor pub. The incident is believed to have happened earlier, around 2.50pm, and reportedly involved a man in the van asking the boy and friends to view an iPad.

No physical contact was made and the incident is being treated as suspicious circumstances at this stage.

The van is described as small, white and with no writing on the sides. No further description of the suspect was provided. Liaison has taken place with the boy's school.

Community Policing Inspector Jon Smith said: "We take all such reports very seriously, and have carried out various enquiries. We'd still like to speak to anyone who was in the area at this time and saw a white van near to the Windsor pub, or lives locally and captured a registration number or images of the vehicle, and we will take the appropriate action.

"The boy did exactly the right thing by immediately getting home and informing an adult, and I'd encourage anyone who experiences similar to do the same. Always call 999 in an emergency."
