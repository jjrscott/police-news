Last night (18th Feb) officers on patrol stopped a taxi driver on Garswood Road, St Helens during a routine stop check.

He, along with the passenger, were both searched under the misuse of drugs act, where hidden inside a can of de-icer, officers found numerous bags of suspected Cannabis. Then officers found a can of Lynx Africa containing a number of bags of white powder, suspected as being cocaine.

Also found in the taxi were a number of phones and a quantity of cash.

The driver, a 38 year old man from Newton-Le-Willows was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply drugs and drug driving, whilst the passenger, a 25 year old man from Haydock was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply drugs.

Both men were taken to custody for questioning and the council have been contacted around the drivers taxi licence.

Supt Tami Garvey-Jones said: "Taxi drivers have a duty of care to those they are driving around the region and being under the influence of drugs heavily effects their judgement and driving ability and puts passengers and other road users in huge danger.

"If you know someone taking drugs, supplying them or carrying them, then let us know. This shouldn't be tolerated by anyone, whether in St Helens or elsewhere. Contact @MerPolCC or call 101 with any information." #OpTarget
