We're appealing for information following a burglary in Garswood in the early hours of this morning (Thursday 4 March).

At around 2.55am it was reported that a car, a grey Kia Sportage, had been stolen from a property on Kinross Avenue.

It was further reported that, after taking the car, two males dressed in dark clothing and wearing balaclavas, returned to the property and took a PlayStation 5 with two controllers, a grey Berghaus jacket, keys, a laptop bag, handbag, a Ted Baker purse and bank cards.

The offenders then made off in a white BMW in the direction of Langholm Road and Station Road.

CCTV, witness and forensic enquiries are ongoing to find the stolen items and those responsible.

Detective Inspector Sue Hinds said: "Nobody has the right to violate the security and safety people should feel in their own home. While nobody was injured during the incident this morning, the victims remain extremely shaken and I want to reassure the community that we are committed to finding the people responsible and bringing them to justice.

"We are in the early stages of the investigation into the incident on Kinross Avenue this morning and I would urge anyone in the Garswood area at the time who saw anyone or anything suspicious to contact us.

"You may have been driving along nearby and captured either the blue Kia or a white BMW, or anything else on dashcam. If so, I would urge you to check it and let us know if you see anything suspicious.

"Through Operation Castle Merseyside Police is committed to finding the people responsible for committing crimes such as this and we would urge anyone who saw anything to come forward as the information you hold could be vital to our investigation."
