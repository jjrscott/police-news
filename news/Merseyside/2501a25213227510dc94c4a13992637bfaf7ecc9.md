We are investigating alongside Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service (MFRS) following a suspected arson in Birkenhead on Saturday, 10 October.

At around 4.55am, officers attended Little Theatre on Grange Road West following MFRS reporting a fire at the location. Entry is believed to have been forced to the location before the fire was started deliberately in a prop room of the theatre.

Forensic, CCTV and witness enquiries are ongoing and we'd like to hear from anyone with information.

Wirral Inspector John Fitzgerald said: "This fire has caused significant damage to a popular community theatre and we share the disgust of those locally, and their determination to find those responsible. This is a difficult enough time for our businesses, without the added stress and upset that such a disgraceful attack brings. It is heartening to hear that so many people have contributed to raising funds as a result and meanwhile, we'll continue to work alongside MFRS to investigate.

"Did you see anything in the early hours of Saturday, or capture anyone acting suspiciously on home CCTV, dashcam or other devices? Any small detail could prove the key, so tell us what you know and we will take action."
