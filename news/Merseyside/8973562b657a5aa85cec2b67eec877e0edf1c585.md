We are appealing for information following a hate crime in Prenton, Wirral on Saturday 31 October.

At around 8.10pm, officers were called to Popadom Indian Takeaway on Townfield Close to reports of a large group of youths inside, who were asked to leave by staff due to anti-social behaviour. They reportedly became racially abusive before leaving.

CCTV and witness enquiries are ongoing. The suspect who was reported as being responsible for the racial abuse is described as white, male, with long curly brown hair and wearing all dark clothing.

Detective Inspector Christian Vaughan said: "This was a disgraceful incident in which a group of youths were causing trouble before racially abusing a member of staff. We're keen to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time or saw a group of youths near to the shops on Saturday night or in recent days.

"Your description, CCTV or dashcam could be vital in dealing with those responsible. This incident understandably left the member of staff who was targeted extremely distressed and fearful. We will not tolerate assault or abuse of people carrying out their daily work in our communities."

Anyone with information can contact our social media desk @MerPolCC on Twitter, or 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook. with reference 20000661536, or call the independent charity @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111.
