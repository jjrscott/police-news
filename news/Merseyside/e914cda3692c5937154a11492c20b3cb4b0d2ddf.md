Officers are carrying out a search at a Huyton park following an injury firearms discharge on Monday, 21 October 2019.

Officers were made aware of the shooting after a 17-year-old male from Huyton self-presented at hospital with a gunshot wound to his thigh, which is not believed to be life threatening.

It is believed that the victim had been walking through Woolfall Heath Park at about 9.30pm when three males approached him from behind. The males shouted to the victim and as he turned round he was hit to face and then shot in the leg.

The male was taken to hospital by a relative.

Officers are currently searching Woolfall Heath Park and house-to-house inquiries are being carried out. Officers will also be looking to establish if there is CCTV which could help them identify the offenders.

Detective Inspector Sean Kelly Martland, said: "The investigation is in its early stages and the motive for the attack is currently unknown. Detectives are working to establish the full circumstances leading up to the incident.

"I would appeal to anyone who may have been in the area at the time of the incident, or who witnessed anyone acting suspiciously in the area shortly before the attack to come forward. We are also interested in anyone who may have been seen acting suspiciously in, or around, the park prior to the incident at 9.30pm.

"Merseyside Police is relentless in its pursuit of those who use firearms on our streets and we will be using every resource available to us to identify the offenders, put them before the courts and behind bars. There is no place for people like this in our communities and I would urge anyone who has any information which could help us to identify the offenders and bring them to justice to come forward."
