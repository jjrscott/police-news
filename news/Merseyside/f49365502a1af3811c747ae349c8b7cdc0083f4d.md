We have issued CCTV images of two males we want to trace following a robbery at a shop in Prescot last night, Wednesday 23rd December.

At 8.50pm two males entered the Co-op Late shop on Warrington Road. They threatened the female shop assistant before stealing a quantity of cash and cigarettes.

The assistant wasn't hurt but was left shaken by her ordeal. The two males made off on foot.

We have issued CCTV images of two men we would like to speak to as part of our investigation.

Detective Inspector Tony O'Brien said: "I would ask anyone who was in the vicinity of the Co-op store on Warrington Road at around 9pm last night who saw anyone or anything suspicious to contact us.

"Although the CCTV is not the clearest I am hoping that someone may recognise the clothing or build of the two men in the CCTV images and come forward with information which could assist our investigation.

"Shop assistants should be able to go about their business without being threatened in such a manner and we are determined to find the people responsible and bring them to justice."

Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 20000779778.
