We are appealing for witnesses following a serious road traffic collision in Bootle last Tuesday, 12 November.

At 8.20pm, emergency services were called to the junction of Marsh Lane and Irlam Road to reports of a collision between a Seat Leon and Ford Fiesta.

The driver of the Fiesta was taken to hospital with a serious injury and following treatment is in a serious but stable condition. Other occupants of the vehicles sustained minor injuries. CCTV, forensic and witness enquiries have been carried out.

Roads Policing Constable Jon Riley said: "We think a large group of people were in the area around the time of the collision and may have seen what happened. We need to speak to them all, and gather any information, CCTV or dashcam that hasn't already been passed on.

"In addition, we need to specifically speak to the driver of a white car who drove down Marsh Lane following the incident, past the Salisbury public house and back towards the scene."

Anyone with information is asked to contact our Roads Policing Unit on (0151) 7775747, or pass information via @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, with reference number 19100662622.
