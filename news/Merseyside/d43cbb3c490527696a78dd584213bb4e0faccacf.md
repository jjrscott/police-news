We are appealing for witnesses after reports a man was assaulted during a dog attack in Sefton Park.

At around 5pm on Thursday 21 January, a 54-year-old man and his German Shepherd were bitten by two large bulldogs near the Oasis in the Park Cafe.

It is reported the man was punched and kicked in the head by the owner of the bulldogs as he tried to split the dogs up.

The bulldogs are described as brown / beige and were with two males in their 40s, wearing black. It is reported that one male wore a black coat, white hat, blue jeans and black trainers.

It is believed that the bulldog owners are regulars in Sefton Park.

Detective Inspector David Uren said: "We know a number of people were in the park at the time and witnessed this attack. I would urge anyone who saw the suspects and has any information to come forward.
"Likewise, if anyone has CCTV or dash cam footage from the surrounding area - please get in touch to help us identify the two males involved."

Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 21000044554. Always call 999 if a crime is taking place.
