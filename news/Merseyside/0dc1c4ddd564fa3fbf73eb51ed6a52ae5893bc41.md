We are appealing for information after a mobile phone telecommunications mast was set on fire in Mossley Hill shortly before midnight last night (Tuesday 26 May).

Emergency services were called to reports of a fire at 11.55pm between Rathmore Avenue and Templemore Avenue, near Brodie Avenue.

It was reported a male in dark clothing had been seen at the base of the mast shortly before the fire started. He then left on an electric bike.

Officers attended alongside Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service and an investigation has been launched.

CCTV opportunities are being explored in the local area, and house to house enquiries have been carried out.

Detective Sergeant Richie Shillito said: "These are challenging times for everyone, and members of the public are more dependant than ever on technology such as mobile phones to keep in touch with their friends and family. For many vulnerable people isolating and shielding, it is their only means of contact with the outside world.

"People may also need to use their phone to contact the emergency services, and extremely reckless acts like this could leave them with no signal and put someone's life at risk."

Officers are appealing to anyone who may have witnessed anyone acting suspiciously or who has any information which could assist the investigation to DM @MerpolCC on Twitter, message Merseyside Police Contact Centre on Facebook, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 20000304498.
