We are appealing for information following an injury discharge tonight in Huyton, Monday, 27 January 2020.

Police were called to Wimborne Close just before 9pm to a report damage had been caused to the front of a house that was occupied at the time. Police attended and a 19-year-old male was found soon after at a nearby property with non-life threatening injuries to his torso consistent with a firearms discharge.

The victim has been taken to hospital for treatment.

House to house enquiries are underway and officers will be looking at CCTV from the area in a bid to identify the offenders.

Chief Inspector Mark Everard said: "It is not acceptable to use firearms recklessly in a residential area and we are doing all we can to find those responsible. We can only find the offenders with the help of our community and we ask anyone with information to speak to us and help us keep firearms out of our neighbourhoods.

"Any information may help us, no matter how small it is so please help us identify those responsible."

You can contact us @MerPolCC, 101 quoting reference 0982 of 27 January, or @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111.
