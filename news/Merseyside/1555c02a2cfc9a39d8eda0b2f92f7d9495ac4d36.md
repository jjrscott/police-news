We're appealing for witnesses following an armed robbery at a post office in Birkenhead yesterday, Tuesday 7 April.

At around 12.40pm, two men entered the Post Office in Old Chester Road, Dacre Hill armed with a baseball bat and crowbar and stole cash after threatening staff. No staff members were injured but were left extremely shaken.

The men were in dark clothing, with hoods up and facial coverings, wearing gloves.

CCTV, forensic and witness enquiries are ongoing and detectives want to hear from anyone with information.

Detective Chief Inspector Paul Nilsen said: "All key workers are heroes who are putting themselves at risk to keep the rest of the communities going in this difficult time. To be threatened in such a distressing way is absolutely disgusting, and we are absolutely determined to do all in our power to find those cowards who targeted them, and put them before the courts.

"Tell us what you know, and if you live nearby or were passing and saw or heard anything. We'll act on all information provided, and take those involved off your streets."

You can pass information via @MerPolCC or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, with reference 20000204258.
