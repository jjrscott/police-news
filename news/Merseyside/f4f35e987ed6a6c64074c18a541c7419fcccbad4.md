A midnight raid in Bootle has resulted in an arrest of a man in his 50s as well as the recovery of a gun which was found hidden in his garden shed.

Officers descended on the property on Chester Avenue this morning (16th Feb).

They entered the home, detained the 52 year old occupant and commenced a search. Whilst in the shed, officers found a handgun wrapped in a tea towel which was hidden underneath a piece of carpet. Along with this, a magazine containing three 9mm rounds of ammunition and two bags of suspected cocaine were seized.

Armed Response Officers attended and forensically recovered the gun which was then taken away for further investigation.

The man was arrested on suspicion of possession of a firearm without certificate and possession of a Class A drug. He remains in custody at this time.

Sefton's Superintendent Graeme Robson said "This is a great result and I am extremely thankful that another weapon has been taken off our streets before someone could have been seriously injured or killed by it.

"Owning any weapon puts you and the wider public in significant danger and I continue to ask our communities to do the right thing and report anyone they know that might be storing or using one.

"We have in the past seen guns ruin lives here in Merseyside and if we do not act now and get them off our streets, whilst educating young people that this isn't normal behaviour, it will be too late and we cannot risk another life being taken away as a result of gun crime.

"Help us make our streets a safer place for all." #OpTarget
