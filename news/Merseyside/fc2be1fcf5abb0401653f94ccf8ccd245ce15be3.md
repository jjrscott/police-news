We are appealing for help in identifying the next of kin of a 74 year-old man who passed away in Liverpool.

The man sadly passed away from natural causes at his home address in Balmoral Court, Tuebrook, on Monday 3rd February.

There are no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death.

The man could not be formally identified but it is believed that he is Roy McArthur.

Anyone who knows the whereabouts of the next-of-kin of Mr McArthur is asked to contact Coroner's Investigation Officer Simon Knuckey on 0151 233 0134 or email simon.knuckey@liverpool.gov.uk
