We are issuing CCTV images of a man we wish to speak to after an assault and criminal damage in a wine bar in Heswall in December 2019.

At around 10.15pm on Wednesday, 11 December, a man was involved in an altercation between a man and a woman inside The Blind Pig.

The offender reportedly hit the man and pushed the woman and then also threw a chair through the window causing significant damage.

Witness and CCTV enquiries have been ongoing and detectives would like to speak to the man pictured to assist with their enquiries.

Detective Inspector Nick Suffield said: "This was a disgusting incident in which two customers enjoying their evening were the subject of an assault which was distressing. The offender also caused criminal damage to the premises which is unacceptable and we will do all we can to solve this awful incident.

"Merseyside Police takes all reports of crime, criminal damage and violence extremely seriously and I want to reassure local businesses that we are determined to find those responsible and ensure Wirral remains a safe place to live, work and visit."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 with reference 19100725132 or @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111.
