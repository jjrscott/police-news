We are appealing for witnesses following an attempted robbery at a shop in Wirral.

At around 9.55pm last night, Wednesday 25th March 2020, two males entered the All in One Express Shop on New Chester Road in New Ferry. One of the males is believed to have been armed with a handgun.

The males made demands for cash and cigarettes from the shop assistant but fled empty-handed.

Nobody was injured during the incident and nothing was stolen.

One of the males was wearing a black coat with the hood up and a dark coloured balaclava with a bag over his shoulder and an orange glove on his left hand. The second male was also dressed in black clothing with his hood up and also wearing a balaclava.

An investigation is underway and house to house and CCTV enquiries have been carried out in the local area.

Detective Inspector Nick Suffield said: "Although nothing was taken the shop assistant was left shaken by his ordeal.

"This type of behaviour will not be tolerated and we are committed to finding the people responsible for this and bringing them to justice."

Anyone who has information, video, pictures or dashcam footage can submit to this to the investigation team via the following web address:
