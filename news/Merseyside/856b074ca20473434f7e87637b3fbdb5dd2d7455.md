We're issuing images of suspected stolen items as part of a theft investigation in Woolton Village.

A number of recent thefts have been reported from gardens in the area, with items including plants, plant pots, ornaments and an artificial lawn reported stolen. Enquiries have led to a warrant being carried out and a number of items seized.

A 39-year-old man will be voluntarily attending for interview in connection with the matter.

Community Policing Sergeant Andy Fielding said: "Our enquiries have identified the owners of a number of items we suspect to be stolen, but we're keen to hear from anyone who recognises these as their own, or belonging to someone they know, and has yet to come forward.

"Likewise, if you believe you may have had items stolen locally from your garden which aren't pictured, let us know."

You can pass information on via our social media desk @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, with reference 20000372499.
