Detectives have released an image of a unique gold keepsake they would like to trace following a burglary in Walton on Thursday 18th February.

The keepsake - a 5cm long gold frog - is of sentimental value to its owner.

Detective Constable Richard Whates said: "We're keen to trace this item and return it to its owner after it was taken from his home last month.

"The frog belonged to the owner's late wife and is of huge sentimental value.

"Please, if you are offered this item or know of its whereabouts - get in touch with us."

If you have any information, contact Merseyside Police on 101 or DM @MerPolCC on Twitter, quoting crime reference 21000105688.
