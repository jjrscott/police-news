Do you know these two men?

We believe they may have information that could assist an investigation into the theft of hundreds of pounds worth of cosmetics from Boots at Racecourse Retail Park, Aintree.

It was reported two men entered Boots just after 3pm on 30 June and placed the items inside their coats before leaving the store.

The items stolen included Estee Lauder Lancome products.

Anyone who recognises the two men pictured or believes they may have been offered the products since 30 June can DM us on Twitter via @MerPolCC or message us on Facebook at 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre'. Alternatively, call 101 quoting incident reference 20000288875 or call @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111.
