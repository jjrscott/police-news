Updated News Post

Two men have been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage at the Philharmonic Hall in the early hours of this morning (Monday, 31 August).

At about 5.45am officers were called to reports of a concern for safety of a man, believed to be drunk, who had climbed the outside of the building up to a ledge housing the Philharmonic sign, shortly after a report was received that the man had taken the letter 'L' from the sign and run off with a group of other men.

Police searched the area and chased a group of men, one in possession of the stolen property, and two men, an 18-year-old from Giffnock in Scotland and a 19-year-old from Aigburth, were arrested on suspicion of criminal damage.

They have been taken to a police station where they will be interviewed.
