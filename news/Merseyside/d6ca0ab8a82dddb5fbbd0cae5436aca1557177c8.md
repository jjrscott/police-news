We are appealing for information following the suspected arson of a car in St Helens on Friday 12 February.

Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service (MFRS) and officers were called to Chandlers Way at around 10.10pm to reports of a black BMV M140i on fire. A white Fiat Punto in a nearby car park had also been damaged.

MFRS extinguished the fire and nobody was injured.

It was reported that a man wearing a black bubble coat and green hi-vis trousers ran from the scene carrying a green petrol canister.

Enquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances.

Detective Constable Roy Bromilow said: "This investigation is ongoing, and we are keen to speak to anyone with information.

"If you were in the area at time of the incident or saw anyone acting suspiciously in the area, please let us know. Likewise, if you have any CCTV or dashcam footage that could assist with the investigation, please get in touch so we can take action and find those responsible."

Anyone in the area with information, CCTV or dashcam can contact us on Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' with reference 21000094790.

You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form.
