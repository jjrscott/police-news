Merseyside Police has been granted a full closure order against a property in Kirkdale.

On Thursday 13th September Merseyside Police was successful in obtaining the closure order on 12 Fonthill Road, at Liverpool Magistrates Court.

Community Policing Inspector Graeme Rooney said: "We can confirm that a full closure order has been put in place at an address on 12 Fonthill Road.

"The order was applied for by the local policing team in response to issues with drugs, gang activity and anti-social behaviour.

"We used this power in an effort to reduce the level of crime reported in the area and to allow the local residents of Kirkdale to enjoy the quality of life they are entitled to. Today we are sending out a very clear message to the community that criminal behaviour will not be tolerated.

"We will continue to target offenders and any properties associated with them who continue to cause problems for the community, and we will do this using all lawful powers available to us in order to make the area a safer and more peaceful place to live."

Anyone with information on criminality in their community is asked to contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police CC. You can also call 101 or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
