Officers from the Huyton Community Team have carried out an open land search today, Friday 12th February, in the area of Woolfall Heath Park and Alt Park.

During the search, officers located what appeared to be a bag of grenades hidden in the undergrowth. In order to maintain public safety, officers established a cordon until the items could be properly identified.

The items turned out to be paintball grenades however, they still had the potential to cause injury or fear if in the wrong hands. The items have now been removed and the cordon stood down.

During the search a number of knives were also located and seized.
