We are issuing CCTV stills of a man detectives believe may have information following a sexual assault in Anfield in November.

At around 11.40am on Friday 20 November, it was reported a woman was sexually assaulted on Breck Road.

A man had made inappropriate comments towards the victim in a shop on the road before she left the store.

The woman got into the driver's seat of her car, at which point the man reached into the vehicle and sexually assaulted her.

She then drove away and reported the incident to police.

The woman was left distressed by the ordeal and continue to receive the support of specialist officers.

Detective Inspector Sean Kelly-Martland said: "We'd like to speak to the man in these CCTV stills as soon as possible. He could have vital information that may help this investigation.

"If you recognise him, or these images jog your memory about any suspicious behaviour you may have seen that morning, please do let us know.

"This was an extremely traumatic experience for the victim, and we are working hard to make sure the man responsible is removed from our streets and brought to justice.

"We are still keen to speak to anyone who was in the vicinity and may have seen anything suspicious.

"If you were driving in the area at the time and have dashcam, please check to see if you might have caught anything suspicious. If you have home CCTV and live in the vicinity, please check any footage and let us know if you have anything you think may help our enquiries."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police CC.
