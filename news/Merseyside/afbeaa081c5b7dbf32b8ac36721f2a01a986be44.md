Do you recognise this man?

We believe he may have information which could help detectives investigating an assault in Waterloo in November 2020.

At around 3.40pm on Friday 27 November, it was reported a man in his 50s had been assaulted near to his home on Willoughby Road.

The victim was spat at by an unknown man before being hit in the face, resulting in two black eyes and a broken nose.

As part of ongoing CCTV and witness enquiries, officers have issued an image and ask anyone who knows the man to come forward.

Inspector James Halpin said: "This was a nasty assault which left a man needing hospital treatment. He has understandably been left shaken and upset by this incident.

"We are keen to gather more information, and we believe the man pictured can help us establish what took place back in November.

"If you are the man pictured or you recognise him, if you witnessed the incident or have any information, please let us know."

Anyone who recognises the man pictured or has any information is asked to contact @MerPolCC on Twitter, 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook or call 101 quoting reference 20000722155.

You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form.
