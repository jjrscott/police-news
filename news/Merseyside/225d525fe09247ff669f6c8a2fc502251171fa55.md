We are appealing for information after an attempted armed robbery at a post office in Thornton on Wednesday 11th March.

It was reported at 4.55pm, in The Crescent, that two males started to smash the front window with what looked like a mallet or hammer as a cash machine was being filled by a member of staff. After a few attempts the offenders left the scene empty handed in a grey Ford Focus and made off towards Moor Lane. The vehicle was later recovered on Seven Acre Road at the junction with Edge Moor Drive.

The offenders were wearing face coverings and both were in dark clothing.

Detective Inspector Catherine Walsh said: "Thankfully nobody was harmed during this incident, but it will have been distressing for staff in the post office and anyone who witnessed it.

"The staff in the post office are simply trying to earn a living and this kind of behaviour is despicable and we will do all we can to find the offenders and put them before the courts.

"If you were in the area, near the post office in The Crescent just before 5pm or you might have been driving past and could have dashcam footage of the incident or saw anything suspicious, please get in touch and we will make every effort to remove the males responsible from the streets.

"Recent arrests, charges and court cases show that we will pursue anyone who targets businesses in Merseyside and brings fear to those who work there and visit them."
