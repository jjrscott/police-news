Detectives have arrested three men following an assault in Liverpool City Centre in the early hours of yesterday morning, Sunday 3 November.

At around 5.50am, a report came in of a man being attacked on Renshaw Street. Officers attended and stopped three males in nearby Newington, who were detained.

The victim, a man in his 40s, was taken to hospital with a head injury.

A 23-year-old man from Roby was arrested on suspicion of Section 18 assault and possession of cocaine.

A 23-year-old man from West Derby was arrested on suspicion of Section 18 assault and possession of cannabis.

A 19-year-old man from Haydock was arrested on suspicion of Section 18 assault.

All three were taken to police stations to be questioned and have since been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Detective Inspector Jennie Beck said: "These three men remain under investigation but we are still keen to speak to anyone who saw this attack or holds any information. The victim sustained a nasty head wound which required treatment, and could easily have been far more serious.

"We want to know exactly what happened and why, so tell us what you know or what you saw and we will take action."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC or 101 with reference 19100640691 or you can pass information anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
