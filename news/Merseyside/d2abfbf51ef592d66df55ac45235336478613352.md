Detectives are appealing for information after two men were injured in a large-scale disturbance in Prenton, Wirral last night, Sunday 20 October.

At around 9.35pm, officers were called to Holm Lane, near to the White Swan Hotel, to reports of a fight involving men, some of whom were described as having weapons.

Shortly after, a call was received reporting two men attending hospital with injuries. A man in his 20s sustained a non-life threatening stab wound to the back, and a second man also in his 20s sustained a minor head wound.

Officers remain at the scene carrying out CCTV, forensic and witness enquiries.

Detective Chief Inspector Robbie Moss said: "At this early stage, we are still looking to establish exactly what happened, and who was involved.

"This violent incident appears to have involved several people, thankfully none of whom have sustained critical injuries, but we are determined to find those responsible and put them before the courts.

"Given the time and location, we think there are likely to be witnesses who have yet to come forward with what they know, so please do so. Were you in or close to the White Swan last night, or passing by? Whether you hold dashcam, CCTV, other footage or have just heard anything since, let us know."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC or 101 with reference number 1011 of 20 October. You can also pass information anonymously via Crimestoppers 0800 555 111.
