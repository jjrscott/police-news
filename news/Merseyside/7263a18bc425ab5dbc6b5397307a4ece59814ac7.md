Officers have welcomed the sentencing of a 34 year old man after he was caught earlier this week carrying an axe near McColls on King Street, Birkenhead.

Christopher Kelly of New Chester Rd, Rock Ferry was arrested on 23rd March on suspicion of an offensive weapon after officers received reports that he had been seen in the store with the axe.

He was detained and the axe was found hidden in a bush.

He appeared at court on 25th March where he was sentenced to 6 months in prison.

Keep on telling us if you know where weapons are being hidden or if someone is carrying one - it is frightening and unnecessary and we'll do all we can to take them off our streets. #OpTarget
