Officers yesterday (21st Jan) arrested a 29 year old man on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A and B drugs following a warrant at an address on Harcourt Street, Birkenhead.

They attended the property just before 9am and detained the man inside. During a search of the property, officers located 45 wraps of suspected Class A drugs hidden in cereal boxes along with a small amount of cannabis and cash.

He was taken to custody where he was questioned and later released under investigation.

Inspector Chris Lucan-Pratt said: "If you know someone involved in drug crime, please get in touch. Dealing or using drugs can often lead to serious violence and we must work together to protect our communities from these substances." #OpTarget
