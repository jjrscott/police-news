**Updated - BMW have confirmed this is an BMW X4**

Detectives investigating a robbery in Kirkby on Sunday are issuing an image of the suspected vehicle involved as we reappeal for information.

At 4.15pm on Sunday 18 October, men were working on an ATM machine outside William Hill Bookmakers on Glovers Brow when a black BMW X4 stopped nearby. Two men exited the vehicle and ran towards the ATM, demanding cash and making off with cassettes. A third man, driving the car, is not believed to have left the vehicle. The car was seen to drive off towards Kirkby Station.

Detective Inspector Tony O'Brien said: "Our enquiries into this incident are continuing and we're sharing the image of this vehicle to assist in finding any more witnesses, or identify anyone else who may have captured the car driving off, either on home CCTV, dashcam or other devices.

"Likewise, if you were in or around Glovers Brow on Sunday afternoon and saw the incident itself or have heard anything since, let us know and we will take action."
