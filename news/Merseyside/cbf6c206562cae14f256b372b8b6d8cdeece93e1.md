Detectives from Operation Castle, our ongoing response to burglary offences in Merseyside, have charged a Walton man with conspiracy offences as part of an ongoing investigation.

Officers attended an address and arrested a man yesterday, Monday 18 January. Items were seized from the address.

18-year-old Carl Power of Wilburn Street has now been charged with conspiracy to commit burglary and conspiracy to steal motor vehicles; relating to offences in various locations between September 2019 and January 2020. During these offences, vehicles were reportedly stolen, some of which remain outstanding.

Power was also charged with aiding and abetting with dangerous driving in relation to an offence last September in the Sleepers Hill area.

He was kept in custody to appear at Wirral Adult Remand Court today, Tuesday 19 January.
