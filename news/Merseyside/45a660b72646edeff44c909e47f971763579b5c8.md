We are appealing for information after a car containing a wheelchair and a disability buggy was stolen from a driveway in Bootle on Monday (20 January 2020).

A report was received at 10.20pm that the car had been taken from the drive on Markfield Road sometime between 5-10pm, and that it was believed offenders had searched the car earlier in the day.

The car stolen was a black Ford S-Max, with the registration number MV17 XUZ.
Community Inspector Duncan Swan said: "We would urge anyone with information about this incident to get in touch.

"The wheelchair, disability buggy and car that have been stolen provide a lifeline for two children. Their theft has deprived them of an absolutely vital means of going about their daily lives, causing significant disruption and distress to the whole family.

"This will affect their quality of life hugely and I am appealing to the offenders to search their conscience, do the right thing, and find a way of returning the wheelchairs and car.

"I also want to appeal to anyone who knows the whereabouts of the car or wheelchairs and may have been offered them for sale, to contact us.
"You may have seen anyone acting suspicious in the area of Markfield Road on Monday evening. If you can help in any way, please get in touch and help us bring the offenders to justice and return some normality to the lives of this family."
