We are appealing for information after two 13-year-old boys were robbed of their bikes in Calderstones Park on Wednesday 28 October.

The boys were in the park near the Cromptons Lane entrance on at about 3.50pm when they were approached by a group of four or five males with their hoods up and wearing scarves concealing their faces.

The offenders pushed the boys over and took their bikes, a blue Giant mountain bike and a black, grey and rose gold Carrera mountain bike (see image).

Detective Constable Julie Bolton said: "While the teenage victims were thankfully not injured during this incident, they were left extremely shaken by what happened.

"Fortunately, a woman passing by acted as a Good Samaritan and came to their aid after the incident, comforting the boys and staying with them until further help arrived, and I want to take this opportunity to thank her.

"Our parks and open spaces are there to be enjoyed by people of all ages, especially in the challenging times we currently face, and people should be able to visit them without the fear of being attacked in this way.

"Incidents such as this are extremely rare and I can reassure people that we are doing everything we can to trace and arrest the offenders, and are appealing for the public to help us find them."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police CC. You can also call 101 quoting incident reference 20000653881, or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
