Officers from our specialist burglary team, Op Castle, have today (16th October) welcomed the sentencing of a 34 year old man who committed nine burglaries in one night across the Wirral earlier this year.

James Sanders, 34, from Liverpool was today sentenced to 6 years behind bars after he was found guilty of nine counts of burglary.

Sanders went on his burglary spree in the early hours of Tuesday 24th March this year, having been released from prison only a week earlier.

"It was only through CCTV that Sanders was identified when he tried to remove the camera from one of the victim's properties!" D/Inspector Steve Ball explained.

Sanders committed seven burglaries and two attempted burglaries, six in Eastham, one in Bromborough, one in Rock Ferry and one in Prenton. After being identified through CCTV and forensic examination, he was arrested on 25th March and found guilty earlier this month of all offences.

DI Ball added: "At the time of these burglaries, the public were already concerned in regards to coronavirus, and for the added threat of someone trying to or actually breaking into your home and stealing your belongings, only multiples the fear and anger those living on the Wirral must have felt.

"I am pleased that Sanders was arrested swiftly and thanks to a thorough investigation, has today been brought to justice.

"I hope this also shows the public the importance of home security and how this can really help in our investigations, bringing offenders to justice and returning stolen property.
