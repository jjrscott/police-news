We are continuing to appeal for witnesses after a man was assaulted on a Wirral street.

The 27 year-old man was discovered at the junction of Beckwith Street/Duke Street in Birkenhead at around 4.45pm on Tuesday 4th August, and was taken to hospital with a serious head injury. He is currently in intensive care.

An investigation is underway and CCTV and house-to-house enquiries have been carried out in the local area to establish the circumstances of what happened.

Detective Inspector Tara Denn said: "Enquiries are ongoing to establish the circumstances of what happened prior to this man being found in the street with a serious head injury.

"We believe that he was assaulted and I would appeal to anyone who was in the area on Tuesday afternoon and saw anything suspicious to contact us.

"The junction of Duke Street and Beckwith Street would have been busy with traffic at the time of day and the area is frequented by taxis and delivery drivers.

"I would ask anyone who thinks they may have captured the assault on mobile or dash-cam footage to get in touch as they may be able to assist with our investigation."

Anyone who was in the area who saw anything is asked to DM @MerPolCC or contact @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 20000462598.
