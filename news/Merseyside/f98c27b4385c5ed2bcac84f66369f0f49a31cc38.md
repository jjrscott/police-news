We have charged a male after reports a motorbike was being ridden in an anti-social manner in Sutton Leach on 12 May.

An off-duty police officer spotted a male riding a small red motorbike with no helmet on Leach Lane heading towards Clock Face at around 12.10pm on the 12 May. The male also appeared to be using a mobile phone to film while riding.

Following an investigation, a 16-year-old male was interviewed and has been charged with using a handheld mobile phone whilst driving; driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence; driving without third party insurance; driving without due care and attention and failing to wear protective headgear.

He is due to appear at South Sefton Magistartes Court on 14 October.
