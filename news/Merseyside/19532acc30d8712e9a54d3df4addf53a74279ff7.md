Can you help? Liverpool and Wirral Coroner's Office is appealing for the family of a woman from Anfield who recently passed away.

52-year-old Denise Valerie Griffiths-Abbott, also known as Denyze, lived in Walton Breck Road and sadly died yesterday, Thursday 14 November.

We are not treating her death as suspicious.

Anyone who can help the coroner identify or trace any potential next of kin should call Karen Gregory 0151 233 0989 or email karen.gregory@liverpool.gov.uk.
