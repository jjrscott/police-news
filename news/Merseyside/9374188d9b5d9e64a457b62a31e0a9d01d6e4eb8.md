Do you know this man? We would like to speak to him in connection with an assault which took place in Birkenhead in the early hours of Sunday 29th December 2019.

At around 1.15am a 30 year-old man became involved in a verbal altercation with two men inside the Prenton Park pub on the junction of Borough Road and Temple Road. A scuffle broke out and the 30 year-old man left the pub.

A short time later, and further down Borough Road, he became involved in a further altercation with the same two men who are then believed to have left and got into a vehicle which had been parked outside the pub.

A few minutes later the man was struck by a car at the junction of Borough Road and Temple Road. Two males were then seen to approach the man and assault him as he lay on the floor. They then made off.

The man suffered a fractured wrist and cuts and bruises to his body.

We would like to trace members of public who were in the Prenton Park pub who may have seen the earlier altercation or the assault who haven't already come forward and spoken to officers.

We would also like to speak to the man pictured as we believe he could have information which is vital to our investigation.

Anyone who recognises the man or has any information about the incident is asked to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact @Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 19100759616.
