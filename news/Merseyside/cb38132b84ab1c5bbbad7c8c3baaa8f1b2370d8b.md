**Jennifer Margaret Dowd**

_14 th December 1988 - 6th October 2020_

Jennie was a beloved wife, daughter, granddaughter, sister, aunt, friend and colleague. At only 31 years old, she was on a bright career path in the NHS, embraced life's wild and wonderful sides and fought vociferously for equality and fair representation in many fields.

Jennie was working as a Senior Project Manager in the Royal Liverpool Hospital at the time of her death. She had completed her Postgraduate Diploma in Healthcare Leadership with Distinction the year before while participating in the NHS Graduate Management Training Scheme.

During the coronavirus pandemic lockdown earlier in the year, Jennie was proud to be part of a team that rolled out a testing programme for homeless people in Merseyside which led to over 60 people being put on treatment plans for HIV and Hepatitis C. Many of Jennie's colleagues have noted that she always put people and patients at the centre of all her work.

In 2015, Jennie moved to Cape Town, South Africa, to complete a Master's degree specialising in Gender Studies at the University of Cape Town. Soon after arriving, Jennie met her wife, Sam, and in September 2016 they returned to Jennie's hometown of Liverpool. They were married in 2019.

Jennie loved the outdoors and spent as much time as she could with her young nieces.

Jennie's family is extremely grateful to the Emergency Department at Aintree University Hospital as well as the Walton Centre for their exceptional care of her. She made an indelible impression on everyone she met and will be sorely missed.
