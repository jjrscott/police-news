We have issued a CCTV image of a man we would like to speak to following a road traffic collision in Liverpool city centre.

At around 5.50am on Monday 9th December 2019 a female pedestrian was in collision with a white Ford Transit Connect van on Old Hall Street.

The male driver of the van initially stopped at the scene but failed to provide any details before leaving the scene.

The 48 year-old pedestrian was taken to hospital where she was treated for concussion, cuts and bruises and a fractured finger.

We would like to speak to the man pictured as we believe he may have information which is vital to the investigation.

We have also issued a picture of the van which was involved in the collision.

Do you recognise the man or the van or do you have any information which could assist with our enquiries? DM @MerPolCC or call the Roads Policing Unit on 0151 777 5747 or 101 quoting reference 19100723486.
