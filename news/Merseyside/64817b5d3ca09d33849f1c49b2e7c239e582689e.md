Detectives in Sefton are issuing the image of a man who may have information following an assault and criminal damage last weekend in Litherland.

At around 1pm on Saturday 20 June, a 19-year-old man was riding his bike in Ford Lane when two men arrived in a blue Peugeot 308 car. They got out of the car, assaulted him and damaged his bike. The victim received minor injuries.

A 35-year-old man from Bootle was arrested on suspicion of affray and has been released on conditional bail.

CCTV and witness enquiries are ongoing.

Detective Inspector Catherine Walsh said: "This was a shocking assault which took place in daylight on a busy road, and was witnessed by a number of bystanders, all of whom I'm sure share our determination to find those involved. We think that it was a targeted attack but are keeping an open mind as to the motive.

"We believe that the man pictured may hold information to assist us, so if you recognise him please come forward. If you witnessed the incident and have not spoken to us, please do so."
