We arrested a 17-year-old male last night (Monday 29 June) on suspicion of the murder of Dre Estridge, 26, in Toxteth.

Emergency services were called to an address on Oakham Street, Toxteth at around 6.15am on Friday 26 June where they found Dre with a single stab wound to the chest. Sadly, he later died as a result of his injury.

Yesterday evening, a 17-year-old old male from Wavertree was arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in police custody for questioning.

Last night's arrest brings the total arrested in connection with the murder to three.

A 45-year-old woman from Wavertree who was arrested on suspicion of murder and a 25-year-old man from Allerton arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender have both been released on bail.

Detectives are continuing to appeal for information following Dre's death.

Detective Inspector Jennie Beck said: "While we have made significant progress in our investigation, and arrested three people, we continue to appeal to the public for any information they might have about what happened

"We have spoken to a number of people who we believe were in the house at the time of the incident, but are keen to speak to anyone else who may have witnessed anything or heard about the incident since.

"A young man has lost his life, and for Dre's sake and the sake of his family, it is vitally important that we establish exactly what happened and bring all those responsible to justice. Information from the public can play a huge part in making sure that happens."
