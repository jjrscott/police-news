Detectives are appealing for information following an assault of two men in Southport on Saturday night, 15 August.

At around 9.40pm, officers were called to Butts Lane to reports of two men in their 30s being found in the street, having reportedly been assaulted outside the Thatch and Thistle pub.

Both men were taken to hospital for assessment of cuts to their heads and other minor injuries. CCTV and witness enquiries continue to establish the exact circumstances.

Detective Inspector Catherine Walsh said: "We're looking to speak with anyone who was inside or near to this pub on Saturday night, and who may have seen, heard or captured any of this incident.

"Thankfully the victims have not sustained serious injuries but this is through good fortune alone, and we're keen to find out what happened as we continue the investigation. We initially believe that the suspects and victims are known to each other.

"Violence on our streets will never be tolerated, and we will take positive action to find those responsible and put them before the courts."

Anyone with information can contact @MerPolCC or call 101 with reference 20000489906. You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
