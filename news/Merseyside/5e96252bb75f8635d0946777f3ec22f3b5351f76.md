We have arrested two women after reports a small group of women were assaulted in Sefton Park on Tuesday (2 June).

A report was received at about 8.45pm that four women had been assaulted by three other women in the park close to Sefton Park Road. It was reported the victims - aged 18-19 - were slapped, kicked and had their hair pulled, sustaining minor injuries.

Officers attended and two women were detained nearby.

Witnesses have been spoken to and CCTV enquiries undertaken.

A 27-year-old woman from Cressington and a 31-year-old woman from Liverpool city centre were arrested on suspicion of two counts of Section 47 assault and one of Section 39 assault. They have been released under investigation, and enquiries are continuing.
