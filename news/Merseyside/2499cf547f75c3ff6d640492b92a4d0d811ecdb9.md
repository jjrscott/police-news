Some good news to share. After recent thefts from vehicles in Aintree and other areas, a man was arrested by officers last night, Wednesday 1 April.

At around 11pm, a call was received reporting a man being seen trying car door handles in Aintree. Officers detained him on Bradfield Avenue.

A 37-year-old man from Fazakerley was arrested on suspicion of theft from a motor vehicle and has been taken to a police station for questioning.

Community Policing Sergeant Chris Taylor said: "This man will now be questioned in connection with this incident and others, and I want to thank the community for the call, for listening to our advice about vehicle security and being alert.

"Criminals are more conspicuous than ever at the moment, so let's work together to stop them operating and remove them from the streets, both for the safety and peace of mind of our communities, and to protect the NHS."
