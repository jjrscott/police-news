We are appealing for information after shots were fired at a house in Huyton.

Officers were called to a property in Brookwood Road at 4.20pm on Monday 1st February following reports shots had been fired from a handgun by two males riding on a scooter in the direction of a house.

The house was empty at the time and there were no reported injuries. Damage was caused to fencing and a window.

An investigation is ongoing and house-to-house and CCTV enquiries have been carried out in the local area. It is believed the attack was targeted.

Detective Inspector John Fitzgerald said: "We are appealing for anyone who was in the area of Brookwood Road on Monday afternoon who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.

"The house was empty at the time but it is unacceptable for someone to fire a gun with no regard for anyone's safety.

"I would ask anyone who was driving in the area to check their dash cam to see if they captured anything which could assist us and help bring identify the people responsible.

"We believe that the two young males involved were dressed all in black and riding a scooter. They came from the direction of Glade Road and continued along Brookwood Road.

"I would ask anyone who believes they saw the bike or has any information about the two males to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111 quoting 624 of 1st February."
