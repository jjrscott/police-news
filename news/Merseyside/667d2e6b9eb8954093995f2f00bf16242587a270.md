At around 8.40pm last night (Tuesday 23 March), we received reports of a loud bang in the Knowsley area.

Emergency services attended Tarbock Woods, off Coney Lane, Huyton where a bonfire had been lit.

Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service (MFRS) sent one fire engine to the scene and crews extinguished the fire using a hose reel jet. It is believed the loud bang heard could have been as a result of accelerants being thrown onto the fire.

No injuries have been reported.

Enquiries are ongoing to identify who was responsible for starting the fire.

Chief Inspector Phil Mullally said: "Starting fires deliberately and reckless behaviour with flammable products in the manner we saw last night is utterly irresponsible, putting our communities at risk and placing an unnecessary strain on our already overstretched emergency services.

"Thankfully the fire service extinguished the fire before anyone was harmed but this reckless disregard for people and property is simply not acceptable in Merseyside and we will not tolerate it under any circumstances.

"I'd also encourage all parents and guardians of young people to know where they are, who they are with, what they are doing and making sure they are abiding by Covid rules.

"If you know anything about this incident, please come forward as your information could help assist us with enquiries.

"Whether you contact us directly or anonymously through the independent charity Crimestoppers, your information will be acted upon."

Anyone with any further information on this incident is asked to contact us by DM via our social media desk on Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre ' with reference 0891 of Tuesday 23 March.
