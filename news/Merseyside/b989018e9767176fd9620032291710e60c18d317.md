Detectives are appealing for information following a robbery in West Derby yesterday afternoon, Tuesday 11 August.

At around 2.35pm, officers were called to the Co-op on Darley Drive to reports of a security guard being approached by two males on a motorbike, one of whom took a cassette containing cash. The guard was not assaulted or injured but was left very shaken by the incident.

Enquiries are ongoing, including CCTV and forensics.

Detective Inspector Amy Smith said: "Robberies of security guards are not victimless crimes and this will have been a distressing experience for the guard. If you were in the area and saw this incident or saw or captured any footage of a motorbike driving off at speed, let us know and we will take action.

"We have seen a significant fall in cash-in-transit robberies in recent years in Merseyside and just yesterday saw a 16-year prison sentence handed out to a one such offender. Part of this success is the close work we do alongside businesses and security companies to ensure they have security measures in place, and have CCTV and other recording equipment to deter offenders and secure evidence against those who do carry out such robberies.

"Our message to anyone thinking of carrying out such an offence is clear - don't, because we will do everything in our power to find you and bring you to justice."

Direct message @MerPolCC on Twitter or message 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook if you have any information, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, with reference 20000478982.
