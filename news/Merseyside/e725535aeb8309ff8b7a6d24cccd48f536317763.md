We have issued CCTV images of male we want to speak to following a burglary at a house in Huyton.

Between 00.45am and 8am on Monday 13th May unknown offenders have entered a house in Bardley Crescent and stolen a wallet and a wristwatch before making off in the owner's black BMW.

The victim's bank card was later used at the Shell garage on Smithdown Road and the car was recovered a day later.

We have issued CCTV images of a man who we believe could assist with our investigation.

Anyone who recognises the man or has any information which could assist the investigation is asked to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
