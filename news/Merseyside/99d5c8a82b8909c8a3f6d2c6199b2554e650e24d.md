We can confirm that a 22-year-old man involved in a serious road traffic collision in Stockbridge Village on Monday has died. Specialist officers are supporting his family.

At around, 2.30pm on Monday 20 April, emergency services were called to Waterpark Drive to reports that a black Vauxhall Astra and a black and white Honda scrambler bike had been involved in a collision. Two 22-year-old men were taken to hospital. One remains in a serious condition.

A 27-year-old man from Huyton arrested on suspicion of attempted murder has been released on conditional bail pending further enquiries.

Detective Inspector Tony O'Brien said: "Although a man has been arrested in connection with this serious and tragic incident, our enquiries continue. We still want to hear from anyone who witnessed the collision, recorded anything on dashcam or home CCTV, or has since heard anything. What you feel is a small detail could be vital as this investigation moves forward."
