Detectives investigating the assault of a man in Prescot earlier this month have issued a CCTV image of a man they would like to speak to.

At 10.25am on Sunday 19th July emergency services were called to Eaton Street to reports of a man in his 40s having been assaulted, possibly with a machete. The victim was taken to hospital after suffering injuries to the neck and leg.

Detectives would like to speak to this man as they believe he could assist with their enquiries.

Detective Sergeant Leanne Toole said: "I would appeal to this man or anyone who recognises him to contact us as we believe he has information which is vital to our investigation.

"We are also keen to speak to anyone who saw or heard anything, or were passing by Eaton Street and Hope Street and have CCTV or dashcam, to come forward."
