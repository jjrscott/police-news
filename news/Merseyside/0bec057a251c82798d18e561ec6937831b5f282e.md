We have today welcomed the sentencing of a 27 year-old man for rape.

Michael Robert Woodfine, of no fixed abode but who was previously living in the Sefton area, pleaded guilty to three counts of rape and one count of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity when he appeared at Liverpool Crown Court on Friday 6th November.

He was jailed for six years followed by a further year on licence. He was also given a Sexual Offences Prevention order and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register.

Detective Constable Emma O'Toole said: "I am pleased that Woodfine will now spend a number of years behind bars.

"I want to take this opportunity to reassure people that Merseyside Police will provide every help and support to all victims of this type of crime.

"Anyone who has suffered a sexual offence - if you can find the courage to come forward and speak to us, no matter how long ago it occurred we will deal with you sensitively and make sure that reports are properly and thoroughly investigated."

People can call officers in the force's specialist Protecting Vulnerable People unit on 0151 777 3803. Information can also be passed to Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
