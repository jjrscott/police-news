Merseyside Police has today (Friday, 19 March) welcomed the sentencing of Scott Beveridge.

Beveridge, 27 years, of Amanda Road Fazakerley was sentenced to three and a half years after he pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply, possession of criminal property and a domestic violence incident. His arrest came following a warrant by Merseyside Police Operation Medusa, who were investigating a county line into Blackpool, in November of last year, where quantities of cash and drugs were recovered.

Project Medusa, is a Merseyside-led initiative, which uses different types of operational activity and tactics to effectively disrupt and in turn bring down the County Lines Organised Crime Groups who are responsible for the widespread distribution of illegal drugs in other parts of the country.

Detective Inspector Gary Stratton said: "The sentencing of Beveridge shows our commitment to putting those criminals involved in these County Lines, behind bars.

"Project Medusa is committed to the relentless in pursuit of criminals who are intent on causing harm in our communities through the sale of illicit drugs in other parts of the country. We will work with police forces and authorities across the country to make sure there is no safe place for such criminals to hide.

"If you have any information about drug dealing in your area or are concerned about somebody who may be involved in County Lines, contact us - DM @MerPolCC or contact @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111"
