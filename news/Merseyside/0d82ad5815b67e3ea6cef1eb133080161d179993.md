Officers are appealing for information after an opticians was burgled and a large amount of designer glasses stolen.

The incident is reported to have happened on Monday 8th June at around 2am when two offenders broke into Harris Opticians on Banks Road, West Kirby through the rear of the property, causing significant damage to the door.

Constable John Molyneux said: "This business burglary has resulted in a significant financial loss for the owners and those responsible should be held accountable.

"In the current climate, we should be supporting each other, not causing more economic hardship to local businesses.

"Anyone with information, knows the person responsible or has seen a number of glasses being sold should get in touch quoting 2000331525."
