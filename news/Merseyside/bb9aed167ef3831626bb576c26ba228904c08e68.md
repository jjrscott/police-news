Officers have recovered a large cannabis farm in a disused pub on Mill Road, Liverpool.

The farm was located on Friday evening (8th May) by officers on patrol in Anfield.

They forced their way into the pub and once inside found the farm which spanned over four floors, consisting of 10 growing rooms that contained 697 Cannabis Plants.

Ibrahim Demnushaj, 26 of no fixed address and a 17 year old man were arrested and later charged with cultivation of cannabis. They appeared at court yesterday (11th May) where they were both remanded to await a Crown Court trial.

Sgt Steve Passey from our #OpTarget team said: "This is a great find and has led to a large amount of cannabis being taken out of circulation.

"Being involved in drug crime often comes hand in hand with more serious offences and can lead to communities being fearful. Therefore it is crucial drugs are removed and those living and working in the area feel free to go about their daily lives without the worry of dangerous people posing a risk to their safety."

Anyone that knows someone involved in crime should get in touch @MerPolCC or contact @CrimestoppersUK anonymously.
