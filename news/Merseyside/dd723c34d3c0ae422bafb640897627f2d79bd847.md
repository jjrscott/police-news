We're appealing for the public's help to trace Andrew Jones, who is missing from home.

Andrew, aged 49, is missing from his home in Bridge Croft, Litherland, and was last seen at 7am today (Saturday, 27 March).

He is described as white, around 5ft 8in tall, of medium build, with blue eyes. He is clean shaven and has a fresh complexion.

When he was last seen, Andrew was described as wearing a navy blue hooded top, dark grey work pants and dark-coloured work boots.

We are concerned for Andrew's whereabouts and anyone who has seen him is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 or the charity missing people on 116 000.
