We have arrested a man and recovered cash and a large quantity of drugs following the search of an address in St Helens last night, Thursday, 8 October.

At around 8.15pm, officers investigating the supply of drugs attended the address in Marina Drive and carried out a search of the property, resulting in a number of packages of suspected cocaine being recovered from under the bathroom floorboards.

A quantity of cannabis and cash was also recovered.

Officers arrested a 36-year-old man from St Helens on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A and B drugs. He remains in custody for questioning.

Inspector Rob Budden said: "Despite efforts to conceal it under the floorboards, a large amount of suspected cocaine was recovered from an address in St Helens last night, meaning these dangerous drugs have now been prevented from reaching our streets.

"Those involved in the supply of drugs have no regard for our communities and the lives they affect, and we will continue to act on information given to us by the public to pursue these individuals and put them before the courts."

If you have information on the supply of drugs or criminality in your area, please contact @MerPolCC, 101 or @CrimestoppersUK, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
