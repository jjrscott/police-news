We have arrested a 31 year-old Wirral man on suspicion of s47 assault and affray following an incident in Birkenhead.

A video showing a man being violently assaulted by another man was circulated on social media last week and reported on by a national newspaper website.

The incident was not reported to Merseyside Police but is believed to have happened between 1.15pm and 1.30pm on Friday 6th November at the junction of Eastbourne Road and Menai Street.

Detectives were keen to establish the identity of both men to ensure their safety and numerous enquiries have been carried out.

A 31 year-old man from the Rock Ferry area was arrested earlier today in connection with the assault. He is currently in custody where he is being questioned by detectives.

A second man has also been traced and is safe and well.

Detective Inspector Nick Suffield said: "This was a nasty and violent incident which took place in broad daylight in attack in open view of residents in the area of Eastbourne Road and Menai Street of Birkenhead.

"Although it was not reported to Merseyside Police it is important to make it clear that violence of any scale will not go unaddressed and any incident of this type will be investigated thoroughly and action taken where necessary."
