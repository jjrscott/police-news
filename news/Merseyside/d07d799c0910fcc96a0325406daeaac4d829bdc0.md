We are currently investigating after Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) were stolen from a parked car.

It has been reported this morning that at some point between 10:30pm on 31st March - 5:45am 1st April someone has smashed the window of an NHS work van parked on Greenham Avenue, Kirkby and stolen face masks and gloves.

Chief Inspector Phil Mullally said: "This shows a complete lack of empathy towards our emergency service colleagues who are working tirelessly to protect the wider community. This equipment is vital in allowing NHS staff to complete their job and in the current climate where we are supposed to be supporting each other and working together, it is upsetting to see this sort of crime has taken place. Help us find the person/s responsible."

If you see someone selling these items in or around Kirkby or know anything about this incident, please get in touch quoting: 20000193044.
