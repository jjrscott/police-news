Yesterday marked International day for the Eradication of Violence Against Women, and we were in Liverpool city centre offering support and advice on domestic abuse.

Also known as White Ribbon Day, yesterday (Monday, 25 November) marked the start of 16 days of Activism against Gender Based Violence and officers were in Williamson Square throughout the day, joined by Liverpool City Council, Savera UK, Liverpool Domestic Abuse Service, Katumba and South Liverpool Domestic Abuse Services to raise awareness on domestic abuse and the help available to those who need it.

To show support of the campaign, force headquarters will be lit up in orange for the duration of the 16 days.

Detective Chief Inspector Bev Hyland from the Protecting Vulnerable People Unit, said: "The White Ribbon Campaign aims to raise awareness of abuse against women, particularly domestic abuse, and encourage greater reporting of this hidden crime.

"We know that many people are aware that offences are being committed but remain silent, and I want to encourage those people , as well as victims, to come forward so we can take action and help those who need it and those who may not be able to help themselves.

"There is a lot of support available and we have specially trained officers ready to listen to you, treat you with compassion and respect and investigate any allegations of abuse thoroughly. It is vital that we all work together - not just the police and our partners, but members of the public too, to break the silence and help those in need.

"I want to make it clear that domestic abuse is never acceptable and that no one should have to tolerate being treated this way regardless of their gender or sexual orientation. Making those first steps and reporting abuse can be daunting and there are many reasons why people find it hard to do, but there is support available, not just from the police, but other organisations too.

"If you are suffering and can find the courage to come forward, or know someone who may be a victim, please reach out and break the silence."

If you have any information on domestic abuse you can contact @MerPolCC, 101 or @CrimestoppersUK, anonymously on 0800 555 111. More information on the White Ribbon campaign can be found here: https://www.whiteribbon.org.uk/
