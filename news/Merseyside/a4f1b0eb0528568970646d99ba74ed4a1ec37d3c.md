We can confirm that emergency services are in the Woolton area following a serious road traffic collision this afternoon, Thursday 16 January.

At around 4.25pm, we were called to Woolton Road to reports of a car in collision with a lamppost. The driver, a man in his 70s, has been taken to hospital in a critical condition.

Road closures are in place at the junction of Woolton Road with Gateacre Park Drive and we would ask the public to avoid the area while we deal with the incident.

Anyone who witnessed the incident is asked to contact @MerPolCC or 101 with reference 609.
