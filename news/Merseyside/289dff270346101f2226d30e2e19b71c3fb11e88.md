Officers are appealing to members of the public who may recognise this man. We'd like to speak to him as we believe he could have information to help us investigating two racial incidents.

The first occurred on Wednesday 22nd April, at around 7pm when an unknown man entered a takeaway on North Hill Street, Toxteth. Inside, he was verbally racially abusive and also threatened staff.

The second incident occurred on Saturday 2nd May, at around 6pm. The same man is reported to have returned to the takeaway and made threats to staff, used abusive language and also spat at them.

Sergeant Furlong said: "This sort of vile behaviour should not be tolerated by anyone in our community. This man has been rude, made threats and also spat at staff carrying out their jobs. In the current climate where we are all on high alert, this is simply unacceptable. We want to speak to this man as we believe he could have crucial information in regards to these incidents. Get in touch if you know him."

Alternatively, if you remember either incident and can help us with our continued investigations, you are advised to DM us on @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact @CrimestoppersUK anonymously quoting: 20000254055.
