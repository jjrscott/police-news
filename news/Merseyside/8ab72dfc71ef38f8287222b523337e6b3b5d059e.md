We arrested two men on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon and drugs offences following a stop search in Huyton last night, Monday 4th May.

Op Target officers were on patrol at around 5.45pm when they stopped a taxi on Woolfall Heath Avenue and detained two men.

A search of the taxi recovered a machete-type weapon and a quantity of cannabis.

Both males, who were aged 27 and 28 and from the Huyton area, were arrested and taken into custody where following a search a quantity of white powder was recovered and they were both further arrested for possession with intent to supply Class A drugs.

Both remain in custody where they are being questioned by officers.

Knowsley Targeted Policing Inspector Jon Coote said: "Our officers are continuing to patrol and are always vigilant to suspicious activity and will use stop-search powers were appropriate.

"I am pleased that this weapon has been removed from our streets so that it cannot be used to cause fear in our communities."

Anyone who has information about who is carrying weapons or dealing drugs in their community is asked to DM @MerPolCC or contact @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111.
