We have charged a 37-year-old man with multiple offences, following an incident on Saturday 20 March where a man wearing a police uniform was seen to be acting suspiciously in the Southport area.

We received reports of the man's behaviour in Costcutters on Cemetery Road, Southport, and outside Tesco on Liverpool Road.

Officers attended the scene and established that the man was not a police officer and he was subsequently detained and arrested.

Stephen Monaghan, 37, of Stamford Road, Birkdale has been charged with impersonating a police officer, drink driving and possession of an offensive weapon.

Monaghan was remanded in custody and will appear at Wirral Adult Remand Court this morning, Monday 22 March.
