On Saturday, 28 November, officers from our Matrix Unit conducted a drugs warrant on Lancaster Close, Kirkdale.

They used forced entry to get inside the property and two women aged 33 and 36 were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A and B drugs at the scene as a large quantity of suspected heroin, cocaine and cannabis resin was seized, along with cash and drugs paraphernalia.

Detective Inspector Craig Turner said: "The recovery of these drugs have put a significant dent in their distribution chain and I am hopeful that the wider public see some positive changes in the community now that these drugs are not being sold or used in their neighbourhoods.

"Taking drugs off the streets means that other forms of serious violence also decreases and our communities can go about their daily lives more safely.

"With the run up to Christmas, it is especially important that we protect one another and you report crime to us as frequently as possible as this allows us to investigate and take appropriate action."

Both women were taken to custody but have since been released pending further investigations.
