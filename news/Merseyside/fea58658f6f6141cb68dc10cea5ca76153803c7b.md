Officers from Merseyside Police's Project Medusa, have this afternoon (Friday, 26 March), arrested two people in a pre-planned County Lines operation.

The pair, a 29-year-old man and a 36-year-old woman from Southport, have been arrested on suspicion of being concerned in an offer to supply Class A drugs.

They have been taken to a police station on Merseyside where they will be questioned.

Officers from Project Medusa have worked alongside officers from the Force's Roads Policing Matrix Vehicle Enforcement Team (MVET) to arrest the pair and stop their car safely, as it travelled from Preston to Southport. The car has been recovered and will be searched.

Detective Inspector Gary Stratton said: "Project Medusa works across force boundaries and with other teams within Merseyside Police to ensure we make arrests and take potential offenders off our streets.

"It works in partnership with the Force's MVET team: a proactive policing team dedicated to denying criminals the use of our road network.

"County Lines drug dealing blights communities and the lives of those taking drugs and those who are often coerced into dealing them on behalf of organised crime groups.

"Today's arrests are just one example of the work we carry out, day in, day out to target those involved in County Lines and bring them to justice."
