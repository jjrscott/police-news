Officers have arrested a 27 year old man from Liverpool on suspicion of attempted robbery and theft.

We were called just before 6pm last night (10th Feb) after a man reported he had been attacked whilst walking through Botanic Park. Here, the offender demanded money before punching the victim, knocking him to the floor.

Luckily the victim managed to get home with only minor injuries, where he called the police.

Following this, officers received another report of a man having his bike stolen. We deployed to the area where a man was spotted matching the description of the offender, given by the two victims.

The 27 year old man was consequently arrested on suspicion of attempted robbery and theft of a pedal bike. He was taken to custody for questioning where he remains at this time.

Insp Andy Lloyd said: "Serious violence, regardless of whether this results in injury or not, will not be tolerated. We are determined to find those who threaten or harm others and cause fear in our communities.

"If you know someone involved in crime, of any nature in the Liverpool area, please get in touch and make this a safer place for everyone." #OpTarget
