Recruitment lines to join Merseyside Police close next Friday so we're encouraging any driven individuals who are passionate about serving their community to join the Force if you haven't already applied!

But what is policing really about? Watch our video to find out.

T/ACC Natalie Perischine said "The Government recently announced funding for an uplift in the number of police officers nationally, and as a result Merseyside Police is looking towards a sustained recruitment of new officers.

"In addition to this, there will be another recruitment drive in November. Then, throughout the next three years there will be further opportunities for members of the public to join us.

"For those applying in the future, there will be changes in relation to how you can apply to become an officer. However, we will ensure these changes are communicated and the different routes to become a police officer are made clear.

"We want to encourage people from various communities, who have the passion, ability and drive to deliver an effective policing service, to join us and help us better understand the needs of the diverse communities we serve and protect.

"Being a police officer, although a tough job, is extremely rewarding and is definitely a job for all people from all backgrounds or walks of life. Therefore, it is extremely important that our officers are representative of the communities we serve. We embrace diversity and inclusivity and work as one team to provide the public with an effective policing service."
