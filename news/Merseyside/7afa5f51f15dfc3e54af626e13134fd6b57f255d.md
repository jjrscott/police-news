We are releasing CCTV images of a man Detectives believe may be able to assist with an investigation into a burglary which took place in Childwall last year.

Between 3.45pm and 11pm on Thursday 7 November 2019, an unknown offender entered a house in Childwall Bank Road and stole the occupiers handbag.

The victim's bank cards were used later that same evening in the Childwall area, as well as in L13 and L15.

CCTV images of the victim's cards being used in various convenience stores have been obtained.

Detective Inspector Steve Ball said: "We believe this man may have information to assist with our enquiries so if you recognise him, don't hesitate to get in touch.

"I am especially appealing to anyone who may have seen anything suspicious in the Childwall area on Thursday, 7 November last year.

"Burglary causes a massive impact on victims across Merseyside and we are determined to identify the person responsible for this and all burglaries and put them before the courts."

Anyone who recognises the man or has any information which could assist the investigation is asked to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111.
