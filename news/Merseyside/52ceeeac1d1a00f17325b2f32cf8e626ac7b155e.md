Detectives are appealing for information after a 71-year-old man was assaulted in Southport last month (30 January).

At around 5.35pm, it was reported that the victim had been slapped on the head by a man while walking down Gordon Street outside Bowland Court. The unknown offender then struck him to his sternum, causing him to fall sideways.

The victim sustained an injury which required emergency surgery in hospital. He is now recovering at home.

The offender is described as a white male aged between 30-40 years, around 5ft 11 in tall, wearing dark clothing with a hood pulled up. He is believed to have walked away in the direction of Lord Street.

Detective Inspector James Halpin said: "An investigation is underway and we are carrying out CCTV, forensic and witness enquires following this incident.

"This was an awful ordeal for the victim, who ended up in hospital with some painful fractures which needed surgery. We're are working to identify the offender and bring him to justice for this inexcusable act of violence.

"If you witnessed the incident or have any dashcam or CCTV footage from the area, please get in touch so we can take action."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 quoting ref. 21000064643 or Crimestoppers, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
