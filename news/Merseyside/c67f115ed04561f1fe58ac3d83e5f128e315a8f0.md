Officers from our Roads Policing Unit are appealing for witnesses to a serious fail to stop RTC in Tuebrook last month.

At around 11.50am on Friday 31 July, emergency services were called to Marlborough Road to reports of an electric bike in collision with a female pedestrian in her 80s. She was taken to hospital with serious injuries.

The male rider of the bike fell but failed to stop at the scene and rode off.

CCTV, witness and other enquiries have been ongoing.

Inspector Stuart McIver from the Roads Policing Unit said: "We're very keen to speak to anyone who saw this incident or who was passing or lives nearby and may have captured something of note on home CCTV or dashcam. Please check and come forward.

"The victim was left seriously hurt and remains in hospital, so while her and her family are left to pick up the pieces of this devastating moment, the rider involved is hiding. I'd appeal to the rider, or anyone who knows them, to do the right thing and come forward."

Anyone with information or footage is asked to come forward @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 with reference 20000452751.
