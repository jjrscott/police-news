Detectives in Sefton are appealing for information after a burglary at a post office in Crosby in the early hours of this morning, Sunday 27 September.

At around 2.20am, officers and Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service (MFRS) were called to College Road to reports of money being stolen from an ATM at the post office. It is believed that access was gained through a small explosion at the front of the premises, although we are still establishing the circumstances.

We remain at the scene carrying out forensic and other enquiries. A cash box was found nearby.

Detectives Inspector Catherine Walsh said: "Thankfully it appears that no injuries were caused in this incident. However, this is an extremely dangerous way to target any premises, which clearly puts members of the public at risk. The damage and inconvenience to the business is also significant. We have shown before in successful operations that we will use all available means to identify and bring to justice those identified.

"We are particularly keen to speak to anyone who saw any suspicious activity in and around College Road at around 2am, and if you live locally and have home CCTV or dashcam, please check and let us know. We will take positive action and remove these dangers from the streets."

Anyone with information is asked to contact us via social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police CC with reference 20000584914.

You can also pass information via the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
