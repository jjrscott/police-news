We are appealing for information following a serious injury collision in Crosby on Tuesday, 24 December 2019.

It was reported that at around 9.25pm, a dark coloured vehicle, possibly a Ford Fiesta, was in collision with a pedestrian on Myers Road East near the junction with Kelvinside.

Emergency services attended and the pedestrian, a 76-year-old woman, was taken to hospital with serious injuries to her leg and shoulder.

The driver stopped at the scene to offer assistance, but left shortly after and enquiries are ongoing to trace her.

She is described as around 5ft 7, mid 20's to early 30's, of slim build with dark straight hair and a local accent.

Roads Policing Sergeant, Jeremy Ferguson said: "An investigation is ongoing following this collision, which occurred on Christmas Eve and left an elderly woman with serious injuries.

"If you witnessed the incident, or have any dashcam or CCTV footage from the area, please get in touch.

"Likewise, we are particularly keen to trace the driver of the vehicle, and would ask her, or anyone who knows her, to please contact us. The victim is now slowly recovering at home and we are determined to establish the full circumstances surrounding this collision."
