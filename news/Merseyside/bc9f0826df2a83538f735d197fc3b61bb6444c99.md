We are appealing for information after a report of indecent exposure on a bus in Liverpool today (Friday 11 October 2019).

At about 11.20am it was reported a man who boarded the 10a Arriva bus to St Helens had exposed himself after getting on in Kensington.

The man was removed from the bus close to Whiston Hospital.

The offender is described as mixed race, in his 50s, around 5ft 7in tall, of heavy build, with short dark brown hair and stubble. He was described as having a cut to the nose, and wearing ear phones, a black and grey woolly hat, black coat and a red hooded jumper.

Community Inspector Peter Rexwinkel said: "I would like to reassure the local community that we take incidents of this nature extremely seriously. This would have been an upsetting incident for the passengers on the bus to witness, and we want to hear from anyone who can help us identify the offender so we can bring him to justice."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police CC. You can also call 101 quoting incident reference 19100589199 or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
