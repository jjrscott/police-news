Officers have arrested a man from Coventry and fined his passenger after the stop-check of a car in Huyton last night, Thursday 21 January.

At around 10pm, a VW Golf (pictured) was stopped by officers on Liverpool Road, Huyton after the registered keeper was shown to be from Coventry.

The driver was found to have a provisional driving licence, no insurance and failed a roadside cannabis test.

The 24-year-old man from Coventry was arrested on suspicion of drug driving; driving without a license; driving without insurance and taken to a police station for questioning. The driver has now been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

The car was seized and the passenger was issued with a COVID fine for making an unnecessary journey into Merseyside.

Inspector Jon Coote said: "At a critical time in this pandemic, during a national lockdown, it's astounding that anyone should even contemplate making such a long journey across the country, and never mind the obvious dangers caused to other road users, both from driving under the influence and without a license or insurance.

"Our officers are patrolling the roads of Merseyside at all times, and we hope this is a clear deterrent to anyone making non-essential journeys. We will act on anything suspicious, be that where your car is registered, your manner of driving, or faults on the vehicle.

"We have a collective duty to keep each other safe at this time of great strain on the NHS, in general life and on the roads alike. Be responsible, be sensible, and if you suspect such reckless behaviour from others, let us know and we'll do the rest."

You can report any matters concerning COVID-19 and the current legislation to us @MerPolCC or through Merseyside Police's website https://www.merseyside.police.uk/.
