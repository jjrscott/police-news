Officers in Liverpool will be setting up dispersal zone in Vauxhall following reports of anti-social behaviour associated with drug dealing in the area.

The Dispersal Zone has been authorised from 4pm today (Thursday, 26 September 2019) until 4pm on Saturday, 28 September.

The area covered (see map) is bounded by Great Homer Street, A5034 Boundary Street East, Boundary Street, Vauxhall Road, Leeds Street, Scotland Road, Dryden Street and back along Great Homer Street to its junction with Boundary Street East (A5034).

The order comes under Section 34/35 of the Anti-Social Behaviour & Policing Act 2014 which gives police officers and police community support traffic officers powers to direct people they suspect are causing or likely to cause crime, nuisance or anti-social behaviour to leave the area for up to 48 hours.

If a person has been directed to leave the area and returns during the period of the dispersal notice, an offence will have been committed.

Any breaches of this can lead to their arrest.

Inspector Graeme Rooney said: "This order is not about bothering people going about their legitimate daily business. But we recognise the impact drug dealing and anti-social behaviour has on individuals and communities, and we will be targeting people involved in this type of behaviour for the next 48 hours.

"The dispersal zone gives us the powers we need to deal effectively with people and I would urge anyone in the area with any information about drug dealing, anti-social or criminal activity in their area to contact 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
