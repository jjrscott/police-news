We have arrested two people following an incident in Toxteth last night, Friday, 29 November.

At around 7.10pm, officers were called to Windsor Street following reports a male had been stabbed. The male is reported to have left the scene prior to officers arrival and enquiries are ongoing to locate him and ensure he is safe and well.

A short time later, a second report was received that a woman had been assaulted at an address in Enid Street. She sustained non-life threatening facial injuries and was taken to hospital for assessment.

Following enquiries, a 39-year-old male from Liverpool was arrested on suspicion of section 18 assault and section 47 assault. A 29-year-old woman from Liverpool was also arrested on suspicion of section 47 assault. They have both been taken for questioning.

Enquires are ongoing to establish the full circumstances and anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 quoting ref. 19100700037 or @CrimestoppersUK, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
