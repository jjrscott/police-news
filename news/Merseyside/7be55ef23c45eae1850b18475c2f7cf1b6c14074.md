We have recovered a suspected firearm and arrested a man in Anfield today, Saturday, 28 March.

At around 11.05am, officers working in the area saw a man in possession of a suspected gun at an address on Breck Road.

A 22-year-old man from Anfield was arrested on suspicion of possession of a firearm and was taken to a local police station for questioning.

Officers remain in the area to carry out enquiries and anyone with information is asked to contact police.

Chief Inspector Matthew Moscrop said: "We know the fear and harm those involved in serious and organised crime can inflict on our communities, and I hope today's arrest and firearm recovery show the public that we are relentless in our pursuit of these criminals.

"We can't do this without the help of the public and so the information we receive from our communities plays a vital part in removing offenders and weapons from our streets. An investigation remains ongoing, so if you have any information at all, please contact us.

If you have information about this offence (quote ref: 20000187210) or any other offences in your area, please contact @MerPolCC or call 101. Information about this, or any other offences can also be reported anonymously to Crimestoppers @CrimestoppersUK or 0800 555 111.
