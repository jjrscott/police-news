We are issuing photos of a French Bulldog who was stolen in a burglary in Anfield in the early hours of this morning, Tuesday 19 November.

At some time between 1.30am and 5.20am, entry was gained to a house on Wenlock Road and a 2-year-old French bulldog called 'Bella' was stolen, along with a handbag and wallet.

Bella is a tan and blue dog, with a black collar and pink bone attached (see photos). Extensive enquiries are underway to trace her and return her safely.

Constable Simpson said: "I would implore anyone who has information to do the right thing now, and return Bella to her devastated family.

"Bella is a beloved family pet. If she was stolen for the purposes of breeding, we need those involved to realise that she is not able to breed. Come forward with what you know and let's reunite the family soon."

Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC or 101 with reference 126 of 19 November. Information can also be passed via Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
