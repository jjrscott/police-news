We have arrested a man, and seized a suspected stolen electric bike and drugs following an incident in West Derby last night, Wednesday 15 July.

At around 10.25pm, patrols on Muirhead Avenue East sighted a man on an electric motorbike, who attempted to make off. The man was detained and searched due to a smell of cannabis. A quantity of cannabis was recovered.

A 19-year-old man of no fixed abode was arrested on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle; and possession of controlled drugs. He has been taken to a police station for questioning. Enquiries continue to identify the owner of the bike.
