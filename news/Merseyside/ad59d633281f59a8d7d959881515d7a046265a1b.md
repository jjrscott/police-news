We have today welcomed the sentencing of a Wirral man for offences including theft of motor vehicle, fraud and handling stolen goods.

Daniel Joseph Greatrex, 44, of Parkfield Avenue, Birkenhead, was jailed for two years and nine months when he appeared at Liverpool Crown Court last week.

He was also given a four year driving ban and an indefinite Criminal Behaviour Order.

Greatrex carried out the offences in the West Kirby, Birkenhead and Spital areas of Merseyside as well as in the Cheshire area where he admitted theft from motor vehicle offences in Ellesmere Port.

As part of his CBO Greatrex cannot enter driveways, gardens, or private dwellings without consent, touch or enter a motor vehicle without consent, be in possession of vehicles, keys, wallets, purses or bank cards without permission and he is excluded from entering a designated area outlined by a map.

Detective Sergeant Kevin O'Rourke said: "I am pleased that Greatrex is behind bars for these offences and that he faces restrictions as part of a significant criminal behaviour order upon his release.

"Members of the public have a right to feel safe in their own homes and for their property to be safe and offences like this cause misery and upset.

"Merseyside Police will do everything in its powers to bring people who commit offences such as this and I would ask anyone who has details of where stolen goods are being stored, or who is responsible for burglaries in their area to contact us or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 so that we take action to stop them."
