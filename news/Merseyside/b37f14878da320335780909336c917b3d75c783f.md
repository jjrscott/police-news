Officers have seized a vehicle and arrested a man on suspicious of driving offences following a stop-check in Liverpool yesterday, Monday 23 November.

At around 11.25am, officers sighted a Blue Ford C-Max driving erratically on Walton Road. The vehicle was searched due to a strong smell of cannabis, and cannabis was found within the vehicle. The driver was detained and provided a roadside drug test.

A 22-year-old man from Toxteth was arrested on suspicion of driving a vehicle whilst unfit through drugs; driving whilst disqualified; and possession of cannabis. He has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Liverpool Targeted Team Sergeant Phil Burrell said: "This arrest shows the swift and effective action we will continue to take when we suspect anyone causing risks on the road.

"If you have any concerns or become aware of anyone you suspect is driving illegally, do the right thing and we will remove them and their vehicle."
