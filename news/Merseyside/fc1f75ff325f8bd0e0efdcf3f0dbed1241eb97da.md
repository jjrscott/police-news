Assistant Chief Constable Rob Carden, said: "We note the decision of the Ground Safety Advisory Group to agree that the outstanding fixtures for the 2019/20 Premier League season can be safely and securely played at Goodison and Anfield.

"Working together with both teams, Liverpool City Council, Spirit of Shankly, Blue Union, and other supporter groups we want to ensure that everyone enjoys the game from the safety of their own home.

"In relation to crime and disorder we have no objections to any of the Everton, or Liverpool, home fixtures being played at their respective grounds.

"The main issue of concern was always going to be public health. It is not the role of the police to make operational decisions on the basis of public health. We are guided by experts in public health and the Government. We accept the decision of the GSAG in this respect and will work closely with our partners to play our part in delivering safe events.

"We are still in unprecedented times due to the COVID-19 pandemic and there are strong concerns in Merseyside, and the wider North West, due to the fact that the R rate here is still higher than the rest of the country. For that reason we would urge supporters to do the right thing - stay at home, enjoy the opportunity to watch every second of the game free of charge on your own TV , in your own living room and keep yourself, your family, friends and neighbours safe."
