Detectives are appealing for information following an ATM theft in Orrell Park in the early hours of today, Tuesday 16 March.

At around 2.20am, officers attended following an alarm being activated outside Orrell Park Station. Damage was confirmed to a stand-alone ATM machine and cash was removed.

Enquiries are ongoing including forensics and CCTV.

A rail replacement bus service is in operation while these continue. Moss Lane is also closed in both directions between Orrell Lane and Matlock Avenue.

Detective Chief Inspector Sabi Kaur said: "Our enquiries are at an early stage but we're keen to hear from anyone who may have been passing or live locally and captured this incident on their CCTV, dashcam or other devices.

"If you saw or heard any vehicles making off at speed around 2.20am, come forward too and we will take positive action on all information received.

"We're determined to find those responsible and thank everyone for their patience as we carry out this investigation."
