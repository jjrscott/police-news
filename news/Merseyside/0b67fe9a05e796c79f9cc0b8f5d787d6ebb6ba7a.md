A man has been charged with three burglaries after officers saw a man climbing out of a window in Anfield on Saturday (26 September).

At about 8pm on Saturday officers conducting enquiries into another matter in an alleyway on Morecambe Street heard shouting coming from a property on the street.

An officer saw a man climb from a window, and after a short foot pursuit the man was detained on nearby Scorton Street.

It is not believed any items were taken.

Mehdi Naseri, 30, of no fixed address was arrested and later charged with burglary.

He was also charged with burglary in connection with two burglaries at neighbouring properties on Holland Street, Fairfield on 7 September during which electric hand drills were stolen.

He was remanded in custody to appear at Liverpool Magistrates Court today (Monday 28 September 2020).
