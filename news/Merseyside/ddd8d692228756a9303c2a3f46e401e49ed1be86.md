We're appealing on behalf of the Coroner's Office to locate the next of kin of Andrew Ventin, who sadly passed away on 11th May.

Mr Ventin, aged 69 of Molyneux Court, Liverpool passed away at his home.

There are no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death.

It is thought that he may have previously been involved in rugby coaching in the South Wales area.

If anyone remembers him, knows how we can contact his family or has any information to help us, please contact Coroners Officer Simon Knuckey on 0151 233 0134 or emailing simon.knuckey@liverpool.gov.uk.
