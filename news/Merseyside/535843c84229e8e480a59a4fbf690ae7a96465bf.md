We arrested a man on suspicion of drug supply following the execution of a warrant on Wednesday, 11 September.

A warrant was executed at a property in Kirkby at around 11.55pm and one male detained. After a search of the house, bags of white powder were found and seized, alongside cash and mobile phones.

A 40-year-old male from Kirkby, was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply a controlled drug of Class A (cocaine). He has been released under investigation and enquiries are continuing.

Detective Inspector Tony O'Brien said: "We will not tolerate drug dealing in our communities and every arrest and seizure should serve as a reminder that we will never stand by and allow criminals to profit illegally from exploiting vulnerable people.

"We have recovered drugs and cash and I hope this activity reassures the wider public that we are determined to make our communities safer places to live.

"We need communities to keep engaging with us, so that we can disrupt this criminal activity with their help and ask anyone with information on suspected drug dealing can contact @MerPolCC or 101 quoting reference 0395 of 11/9/19 but always call 999 if a crime is in progress. You can also pass information anonymously to the independent charity @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111."
