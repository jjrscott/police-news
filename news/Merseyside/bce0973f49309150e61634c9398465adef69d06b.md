We have arrested two men and seized cash and suspected cannabis following a stop check in Croxteth yesterday, Tuesday 26 January.

At 5.05pm, Matrix patrols stopped a Citroen Berlingo on Oak Lane due to the smell of cannabis. A search was carried out and a large bag of suspected cannabis found, in addition to around Â£2000 cash. Both male occupants were detained and the drugs, cash and vehicle seized.

A 29-year-old man from Huyton was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to Class B drugs and possession of criminal property.
A 31-year-old man from Roby was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class B drugs.

Both men are in custody awaiting questioning as enquiries continue.

Detective Inspector Amy Smith said: "This is a great example of why we proactively patrol our communities and stop vehicles we have grounds to suspect are involved in crime. These two men will now be questioned.

"If you suspect that drugs are being supplied where you are, pass information to us directly or anonymously and we'll take action."
