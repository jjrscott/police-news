Detectives are continuing to appeal for information following the discovery of the body of a woman at a house in Southport on Friday night, 29 January.

Officers attended at a house on Folkestone Road at 8.40pm and found the body of a woman in her 70s. She was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

A post mortem has taken place but results are currently being withheld pending further reports. The woman is yet to be formally identified. The victim's next of kin have been informed and specialist officers are supporting her family at this time.

Our investigation continues and a 47-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder. He remains under arrest and is currently in hospital.

Detective Chief Inspector Simon Hurst said: "Extensive enquiries are ongoing in relation to this tragic incident.

"We can now confirm that the victim and man arrested were known to each other, and that the woman died at this house. We will issue further updates when appropriate and in the meantime I would ask that their privacy is respected at this terrible time.

"I'd also reiterate our appeal, and urge anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious in the area of Folkestone Road at around 8.30pm on Friday night to come forward. Any home CCTV, dashcam, images, witness accounts or other information may be vitally important as our investigation progresses."
