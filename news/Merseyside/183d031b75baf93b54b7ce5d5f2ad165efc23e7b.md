We are appealing for witnesses following a fail to stop RTC in Kirkdale on Christmas Day.

At around 4pm on Friday 25 December 2020, it is reported a vehicle was in a collision with an 18-year-old male cyclist on Royal Street near the junction of Walton Road.

The cyclist suffered significant injuries and received surgery at hospital. He is now recovering at home.
The driver of the vehicle is believed to have left the scene without stopping or leaving any contact details.

CCTV and witness enquiries are ongoing.

Inspector Carl McNulty from the Roads Policing Unit said: "A cyclist was left badly hurt and shaken after this shocking incident. We are keen to trace the driver of the vehicle to assist our enquiries and would also ask anyone who witnessed the incident to please get in touch.

"Likewise, if you have any dash cam or CCTV footage from the surrounding area that could help us identify the vehicle involved, please let us know."

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has any information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 quoting ref. 20000783120 or Crimestoppers, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
