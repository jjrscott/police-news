We have issued a CCTV image of a man we want to trace following an assault outside a bar in Birkdale.

Shortly after midnight on Saturday 8th August 2020 a 26 year-old man was waiting for a taxi outside Birker's Bar on Liverpool Road.

An unknown male approached the victim and began shouting in his face. The victim was then struck to the face by the male, suffering a large laceration.

We have issued a CCTV image of a man we would like to speak to as we believe he has information which could assist our investigation.

Anyone who knows the man pictured or has any information which could assist the investigation is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 20000470775.
