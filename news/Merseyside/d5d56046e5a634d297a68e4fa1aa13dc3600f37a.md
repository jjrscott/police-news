We're appealing for information following reports of a firearms discharge in Huyton last night, Sunday, 29 November.

Shortly before 7.30pm, officers were called to Woodlands Road after it was reported shots had been fired at a house on the street. Patrols attended and damage consistent with a firearms discharge was found to a wall of the house.

No one is reported to have been injured during the incident.

An investigation is underway and a cordon is in place. Officers remain at the scene to carry out enquiries and provide reassurance to the local community.

Detective Inspector Tony O'Brien said: "We are in the very early stages of an investigation after shots were fired at a house in Huyton last night, and are working to establish the exact circumstances.

"Officers will remain in the area to carry out enquiries and speak to witnesses, and we are keen to hear from anyone with information. If you saw or heard any suspicious behaviour in the area, or have any CCTV or dashcam footage, please let us know. Any information could prove vital to the investigation and assist us in finding who is responsible for this reckless incident."

Anyone with information, CCTV or dashcam footage is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 quoting ref. 755 of 29/11/20 or Crimestoppers, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
