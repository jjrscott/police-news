We have issued a CCTV image of two men we would like to speak to following a robbery at a newsagents in Huyton.

At around 9.30am on Friday 6th September two men entered Rocket News on Bowring Park Road. One of the men jumped over the counter and assaulted a shop assistant. The second man guarded the door while the first man then demanded cash from the till.

The men then left the shop with cash, cigarettes and bottles of alcohol.

The shop assistant was not badly hurt during the incident.

We have issued CCTV images of two men who we believe could assist with our investigation.

Anyone who recognises the men or has any information which could assist the investigation is asked to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 19100503117.
