Officers have arrested and charged a Liverpool man with various offences following an arrest in Wirral yesterday, Tuesday 9 June.

At 7pm, a man was arrested after being located in the Leasowe area. He was taken into custody on suspicion of vehicle crime and theft offences and questioned.

30-year-old Peter Rutter of Kensington, Liverpool has now been charged with three counts of theft from motor vehicle and two counts of vehicle interference following offences in the Meols area on Saturday 30 May, in which successful and unsuccessful attempts were allegedly made to gain access to vehicles on driveways of homes. Items stolen include documents, cash and sunglasses.

Rutter was also charged with Section 39 assault and theft in connection with an incident at Co-Op in Wallasey Village, in which a man barged into a member of staff and allegedly stole bottles of vodka before making off. Enquiries continue to identify a second man believed to have been involved.

Rutter was remanded in custody to appear at Wirral Magistrates Court today, Wednesday 10 June.
