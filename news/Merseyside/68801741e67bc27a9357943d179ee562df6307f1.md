Yesterday (28th Jan) officers welcomed the sentencing of a 30 year old man from Northern Ireland after he was caught with 5kg of cocaine in his HGV in Seaforth.

Andrew Cousins, 30, of Meadowlands Avenue, Kilkeel was sentenced to 6 years behind bars.

His lorry was stopped on Princess Way, Seaforth on 13th November last year. During a search of the lorry, officers discovered 5kg of cocaine.

The driver, Andrew Cousins was arrested at the scene for possession with intent to supply Class A drugs. He was consequently charged and remanded in custody until yesterday where he was sentenced.

Detective Sergeant Jamie Dean said: "Bringing drugs into Merseyside with the intention of using, selling or distributing them elsewhere puts our communities at significant risk. We will continue to do everything we can to support the public and ensure that they do not have to suffer the dangerous consequences drug crime can entail.

"This is a great result and I hope Cousins spends the next six years reflecting on his actions. I also hope this shows others that may be involved in drug or any other serious crime that we will not stop looking for you and we will bring you to justice."

Anyone that knows the whereabouts of drugs, how they are being transported from place to place and who is involved in this, should get in touch as a matter of urgency to keep our communities safe. #OpTarget
