Detectives and Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service (MFRS) are appealing for information following a suspected arson of a car in Prenton, Wirral last night, Tuesday 7 April.

At around 11.20pm, we were called to reports of a BMW on fire outside of an address on Prenton Dell Road. The fire was extinguished, no injuries were caused, and CCTV and witness enquiries are ongoing to establish the circumstances.

Detective Chief Inspector Paul Nilsen said: "Thankfully nobody was injured in this incident but the recklessness of setting a car alight so close to homes is clear to see.

"If you live locally and saw or heard anything, or captured anyone acting suspiciously on CCTV or dashcam, please come forward and we will take action to remove whoever was responsible from the streets."

You can pass information via @MerPolCC or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, with reference 20000205476.
