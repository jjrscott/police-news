We can confirm that patrols remain at an address in Minstead Avenue, Kirkby this evening following the search of a property. (Friday, 20 September).

Officers executed a warrant at around 3.40pm and recovered what is believed to be two firearms, ammunition and suspected hand grenades. The EOD were also called as a precaution.

Detective Inspector Leanne Hobin said: "This warrant has had a positive result and now a number of dangerous weapons have been removed from our streets.

"I would like to reassure the community, particularly the local residents in the area that there is no need to be alarmed and the weapons have been safely removed from the address and pose no risk to the public.

"The criminal use and storage of weapons will simply not be tolerated by Merseyside Police and we will continue to act on information given to us by the public to pursue those involved in serious and organised crime and remove those intent on causing fear from our communities."

Anyone with information on the use of weapons or where they may be stored is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 or @CrimestoppersUK.
