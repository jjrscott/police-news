We are appealing for help in finding a 29 year-old man who is wanted on recall to prison.

John Stephen Walker, who is originally from Speke, was recalled to prison for breaching the conditions of his licence. Officers in Lancashire and Cheshire who are investigating burglary offences would also like to speak to him.

He is described as a white male, 5ft 7in tall, of slim build, with dark brown hair and brown eyes.

Anyone who has seen him or knows of his whereabouts is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111.
