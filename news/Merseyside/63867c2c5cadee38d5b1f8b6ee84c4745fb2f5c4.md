Officers on patrol in Sefton on Friday night (4th December) have arrested two men for drugs offences whilst seizing around £15,000 worth of suspected cocaine.

The arrest was made when officers spotted the men, aged 24 and 30 parked on Harrowby Road in Seaforth at around 10pm.

Whilst being spoken to, the 24 year old was thought to have hidden something on his person. They were both therefore searched and found with a bag of cocaine, cash and two mobile phones. He was taken to custody for a more thorough search where he was found with a further six wraps of cocaine.

A search of a property on Alexandra Road, Waterloo where a large amount of uncut Class A drugs were found, estimated as having a street value of £15,000 as well as a further £5,000 in cash.

Both men were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs and the 24 year old was additionally arrested on suspicion of possession of a controlled Class A drug and possession of criminal property.

They were questioned overnight and have now been released pending further investigation.
