An investigation is underway after a woman was injured after her car was shot at in Dovecot last night, Sunday, 24 November.

The 40-year-old victim had parked up in her VW Golf on Aldwark Road at about 7.30pm with her partner and four-year-old daughter. Her partner had just got out of the car when two men approached and fired a number of shots at the car, one of which grazed the underside of her arm.

The woman, who was obviously terrified by the attack, drove off to a relative's house. She was then taken to hospital where she was treated for the injury to her arm.

Crime scene investigators are carrying out forensic examinations at the scene and house-to-house and CCTV enquiries are being carried out in the area in a bid to identify the offenders.

Detective Superintendent Richie Salter, said: "This is an outrageous attack and we are so fortunate that this wasn't fatal. At this stage we believe that the two offenders were armed and they had no thought for the woman, or child in the car, and it is more through good fortune that we are not investigating a serious injury, or worse.

"The two men involved in this cowardly attack need to be caught, and I would appeal to the community to come forward with any information which could help us find them.

"It's beyond comprehension what the victim and her daughter have gone through and the emotional scars will stay with Mum for the rest of her life, our thoughts are with her and her family and specialist Family Liaison Officers will be providing support. If you have any information which could help us find the offenders please let us know.

"There was a lot of concern and compassion from members of the community who were out last night and I would urge them to think about what they may have seen, or heard, as it could be vital. It's at a time like this that we need our communities to pull together and show that this kind of behaviour is absolutely unacceptable.

"We believe the offenders were parked in a dark coloured car on Winstone Road prior to the shooting and may have been parked there for some time. Did you see the car, or the people inside? If you did please contact us urgently we are determined to find these people and put them behind bars. The actions of these individuals are abhorrent and cannot be tolerated.

"This investigation is in its very early stages and detectives are working to establish the motive behind the attack. CSI's are carrying out forensic examinations on Aldwark Road and Winstone Road and they both remain closed at this time, I would like to thank local residents for their patience and understanding as we carry out these investigations.

"One of the offenders is described as white, 5ft 10in to 6ft tall with a slim build, whilst the second offender is described as 5ft tall. Following the shooting they were seen to drive off down Winstone Road.

"I would appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of Aldwark Road and Winstone Road last night who saw anyone, or anything suspicious or captured anything on dash-cam footage on their way home CCTV, to contact us as they may be able to assist with the investigation.

"Firearms have no place on the streets of Merseyside and we are committed to finding the people responsible for using them and bringing them to justice."

Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPol, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting log 833 of 24 November.
