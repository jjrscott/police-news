A revolver and ammunition have been recovered after they were found by a member of the public in Croxteth Country Park yesterday (Tuesday 19 November 2019).

The weapon was found in a plastic bag near to a hedge at about 10.55am, and police attended to recover the gun and bullets for forensic examination to establish if there are any links to any offenders or incidents.

Detective Inspector Sean Kelly-Martland said: "Every time a weapon is taken out of circulation it is good news for the people of Merseyside.

"Firearms are used by criminals to cause serious harm in Merseyside, so when members of the public come to us with information about where they may be stored they are doing their communities a great service.

"Recoveries such as this should leave people who attempt to hide firearms in no doubt that we are using every tactic available to us to take guns off the streets and bring anyone involved to justice."

Anyone with information on where firearms are being stored is asked to contact Merseyside Police via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police CC, on 101 or the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information. In an emergency, always call 999.
