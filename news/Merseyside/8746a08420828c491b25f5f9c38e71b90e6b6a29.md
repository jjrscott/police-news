Dispersal zones are to be introduced into parts of Kensington, Tuebrook, West Derby and Croxteth Park this weekend following recent reports of antisocial behaviour and disorder.

The order will run from 4pm today, Friday 30th October until 4am on Sunday 1st November and officers will be in the area to provide a visible presence and deal with any incidents.

The Dispersal Zones cover the area bounded as per the maps.

The order comes under Section 34 of the Anti-Social Behaviour & Policing Act 2014, which gives police officers and police community support traffic officers powers to direct people they suspect are causing or likely to cause crime, nuisance or anti-social behaviour to members of the public to leave a designated area and not return for up to 48 hours.

Under the legislation, officers have the power to seize any item, including vehicles, used in the commission of anti-social behaviour.

Should a person who has previously been directed to leave the area return, an offence would be committed, which they may ultimately be arrested for.

Anyone who wishes to report anti-social or criminal behaviour can contact 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. Always call 999 in an
emergency. You can also follow @MerPolNthLpool on Twitter and @LiverpoolPolice on Facebook for updates and advice.
