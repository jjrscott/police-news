A man has appeared in court charged with racially aggravated S4a Public Order, following an incident in Toxteth last month.

Michael Lavin, 52 years of Greenheys Garden, Sefton was given a 10-week suspended sentence after appearing at Liverpool Magistrates Court yesterday (Tuesday, 30 June).

This follows an incident at a shop on Lodge Lane on (Tuesday, 14 June), when the offender entered and began racially verbally abusing a staff member. Police were contacted and the offender continued to verbally abuse a police officer. The man was arrested and taken into police custody.

Hate Crime Co-ordinator Rachel Roberts said: "This is a busy and popular shop and I know the local community would be shocked to hear that staff members had been treated this way.

"The man also abused one of our officers and again, this is something that we cannot tolerate and should not be tolerated by members of the public.

"We treat race hate crime extremely seriously and I hope this action shows that if you contact us, we will arrest these offenders and put them before the courts."
