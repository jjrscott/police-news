Officers have arrested two people after they were caught having stolen 7 jars of coffee from a local supermarket.

A 47 year old man was spotted on bridge street, St Helens today (26th March) with the carrier bag trying to sell a jar of coffee to a member of the public.

Officers approached the man and found the suspected stolen coffee inside his bag. He was arrested on suspicion of theft. CCTV from the nearby supermarket identified a 40 year old woman had also been present when the theft took place and so officers attended her address where she was also arrested.

Inspector Neil Birkett said: "Our officers are committed to supporting the community in St Helens. In the current climate where people are struggling to get the necessities they need, it is disappointing that some people choose to steal food products.

"We want everyone to know that our officers are out on the street to deter this type of crime and support the shop staff and business community who are providing a vital service".

The female was later charged and bailed. The male was issued a conditional caution in Custody.
