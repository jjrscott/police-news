Detectives in Sefton are appealing for witnesses following an incident in Crosby yesterday afternoon, Tuesday 15 September.

At around 4.30pm, officers were called to reports of a group of youths chasing two youths by Crosby Marina. One individual in either group was reportedly in possession of a knife.

The two youths being pursued gained entry to the porch of a nearby property on Seaview Terrace, before escaping through the rear. The group of youths outside caused damage to the window of the porch, before they also made off.

Descriptions of the groups are not known at present, although one of the youths outside is reported to have been riding a bright orange bicycle.

No injuries were reported, although the occupants of the property were left extremely distressed. CCTV, forensic and witness enquiries continue.

Detective Chief Inspector Gayle Rooney said: "This is a disturbing incident for the family involved to have experienced, and we're supporting them as our enquiries continue.

"We want to speak to anyone in or around Crosby Marina at 4.30pm and whether they saw or heard anything, captured those involved on CCTV, dashcam or footage from any device. It is vital that we gather all available evidence quickly to identify each and everyone involved.

"Incidents like this are rare, but knife crime can devastate the lives of individuals, families and communities and we will take positive action to remove weapons and those who use them from the streets."

Anyone in the area with information, CCTV or dashcam can contact us on Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' with reference 1272 of 14 September.

You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
