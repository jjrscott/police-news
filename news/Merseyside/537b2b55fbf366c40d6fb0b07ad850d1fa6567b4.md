We are appealing for witnesses following an attempted robbery in Liverpool on Wednesday, 4 March.

At around 5.30pm, it was reported that a man was waiting at traffic lights on Scotland Road approaching the Mersey tunnel entrance, when he was approached by a man who tried to pull him from his motorbike.

A struggle followed before the offender, who is believed to have appeared from the junction with Silvester Street, made off and the victim, a man in his 50's, managed to ride away.

The offender is described as a white male, around 5ft 6in tall, of slim build, in his early 20's, wearing a grey and red hoody and a scarf covering his face.

An investigation is ongoing and anyone who witnessed the incident, or has any information, CCTV or dashcam footage is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 quoting ref. 20000140096 or @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111.
