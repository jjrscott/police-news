We are appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Kirkby on Tuesday 16th February.

At around 1.25pm a man in his 50s had returned to his van after withdrawing money from a cashpoint at the junction of Rowlings Way and Broad Lane when he was approached by a male carrying a black sports bag with boxes of kitchen knives.

The male placed one of the boxes on the dashboard of the man's car.

The male then produced a knife and made threats to the man to hand over cash. The man handed over cash and the male walked away.

The man was not injured during the incident but was left shaken by his ordeal.

An investigation is underway and CCTV enquiries have been carried out in the local area.

The male is described as a white male, about 6ft 2in tall and of broad build. He was wearing a long coat with buttons up the front and a blue and white facemask. He as carrying a dark coloured sports holdall style bag.

Detective Inspector Jackie Guinness said: "This happened close to a busy area with a number of shops and I'm sure that there would have been plenty of people in the area who may have seen this man or even had him offer to sell them a set of knives.

"We would be keen to speak to any of those people or anyone who used the shops or cashpoint who has dash cam footage which may have captured something"

Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 210000102227.
