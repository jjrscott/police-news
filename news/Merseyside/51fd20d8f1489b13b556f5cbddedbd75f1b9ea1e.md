We are appealing for information after a burglary was reported at a community centre in Everton overnight.

A report was received at about 9.10am today (Tuesday 15 October 2019) that the yard area of the Liverpool Six Community Association, on Queens Road, had been broken into sometime after 6.30pm on Monday.

Offenders had forced entry at a gate and taken the contents of a palette outside including beauty gift sets.

No entry was gained to the building itself.

Community Inspector Graeme Rooney said: "The stolen items had been generously donated by organisations and members of the community so that they could help people less fortunate than them.

"They had been collected by people who care so deeply about looking after under privileged members of our communities that they have dedicated their time to collecting and distributing these vital supplies.

"It is absolutely despicable to think that the offenders have taken advantage of this goodwill and I am sure the Everton community will share our disgust.

"If you have any information on who is responsible for this, or have been offered any of the items described since Monday evening, please contact police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police CC. You can also call 101 quoting incident reference 19100597328 or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.
