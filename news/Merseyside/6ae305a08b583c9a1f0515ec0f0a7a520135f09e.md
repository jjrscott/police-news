We can confirm we are aware of a video circulating on social media in relation to the arrest of a man in Toxteth on Sunday morning (2nd August).

Officers were on patrol in Hartington Road at around 10.20am when they attempted to stop and speak to a man. The man failed to stop when asked and when an officer approached the man he struck the officer with a crutch several times.

The man had to be restrained by officers and he was arrested on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker (police officer) and possession of an offensive weapon.

The man was later released under investigation and taken to hospital for an assessment. The officer did not require hospital treatment.

Assistant Chief Constable Natalie Pereschine said: "Our officers are put into difficult situations every day as they seek to protect the public and keep the streets of Merseyside safe.

"I am aware that the video circulating on social media only captures a very small part of the incident and enquiries remain ongoing.

"But I would like to reiterate that we will not tolerate officers and staff being assaulted and will take positive action to bring any offenders to justice."

An investigation is currently underway into the incident.

Anyone with information which could assist is asked to DM @MerPolCC or @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111.
