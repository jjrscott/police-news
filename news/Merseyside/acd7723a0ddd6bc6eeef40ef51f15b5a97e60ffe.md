Merseyside Police are today, Friday 29th January, continuing to appealing for witnesses following a fatal collision on the M62 yesterday (Thursday).

At around 5.45am a multi vehicle road traffic collision occurred on the Eastbound/Manchester bound carriageway of the motorway.

This happened between junction 5 at Roby and Junction 6 at Tarbock Island. Sadly the female driver of one of the vehicles was pronounced dead at the scene.

The female has been named as 57 year-old Paula Heaney from the Anfield area, but who was originally from St Helens town centre.

The family would like to thank people for their thoughts and kind words and ask that their privacy is respected at this time. They are being supported by specially trained family liaison officers.

Constable Andy Roper, from the Serious Collision Investigation Unit said: "We are keen to speak to anyone using that route in the time leading up to the collision and especially to anyone who may have a dashcam fitted to their vehicle.

"Even if you do not believe it has captured the collision itself, we would be interested in footage capturing the area in the build up to events unfolding. We ask people employed and driving company or work vehicles - such as HGV, taxi and fleet drivers to consider whether their vehicle may have captured any footage.

"If you were using the M62 in either direction between 5.35am until 6am and have footage or information, please contact us on 0151 777 5747 or email rpiu@merseyside.police.uk and quote reference 21000058743 or alternatively call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
