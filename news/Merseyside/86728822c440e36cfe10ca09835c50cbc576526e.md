We have today, Friday 26th February, arrested a 53 year-old Wirral man on suspicion of conspiracy to supply Class A and B drugs.

The arrest comes part of the national Operation Venetic.

The man, who is from the Woodchurch area, is currently in custody where he will be questioned by detectives.

Detective Constable John Molyneux said: "Our work to target those who supply and distribute drugs remains ongoing.

"An investigation is ongoing and we will continue to work closely with partner forces up and down the country, as well as North West Regional Organised Crime Unit and the National Crime Agency, to protect our communities and prevent harmful drugs from reaching our streets."

Anyone who has information about drug dealing in their area can DM @CrimestoppersUK on 0800 555 111.
