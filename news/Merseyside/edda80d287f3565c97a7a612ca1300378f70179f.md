We are appealing for information after unconfirmed reports a woman was assaulted in Northwood on Saturday night (21 September 2019).

A report was received at 8.35pm that the woman was struck to the face by a man close to St Mary's Social Club on Kennelwood Avenue, possibly using a sharp object. It was reported she was then taken into the club by members of the public.

At this stage no victim has come forward and enquiries are ongoing to locate the alleged offender.

Potential witnesses have been spoken to and CCTV enquiries have also been carried out in the surrounding area.

Officers have made enquiries with local hospitals but have not identified anyone with injuries matching those described.

Detectives are keeping an open mind as to whether it is linked to a shooting reported to have happened nearby a short time later.

Anyone who witnessed the incident, or who has any information which could help detectives with their inquiries, is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 or @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111.
