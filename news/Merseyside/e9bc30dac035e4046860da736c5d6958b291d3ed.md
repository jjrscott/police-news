We have today, Monday 16th September, welcomed the sentencing of a 46 year-old Wirral man for multiple offences including burglary, drug supply and driving offences.

Ian Clifford Cooper, of Arkle Road, Bidston, pleaded guilty to burglary dwelling in relation to an incident in Woodhey Road, Higher Bebington in April this year and possession with intent to supply heroin and crack cocaine, in relation to drugs seized from an address Audlem Avenue, in Oxton last September.

He also admitted dangerous driving, disqualified driving and drug driving in relation to an incident in Slatey Road, Oxton, on 9th March this year.

He was sentenced to eight years and three months when he appeared at Liverpool Crown Court today (Monday).

Detective Inspector Steve Ball said: "I am pleased that Cooper is behind bars where he rightly belongs after committing a number of offences including drug supply which we know causes untold misery in our communities.

"Members of the public have the right to feel safe in their own homes.

"We know how offenders responsible for burglaries have no regard for the impact they have on victims but I want to assure people that if they keep coming forward with any information we will ensure those communities affected by burglary continue to be protected.

"I would particularly ask that people also take some extra precautions to protect their properties including locking all their windows and doors before going to bed, moving any vehicle keys away from sight of windows and the reach of letter boxes and locking garden tools in sheds so that they cannot be used to force entry into properties."

Anyone with information on suspected burglary, drug supply or other offences can speak to local officers, message @MerPolCC , call 101 or contact @CrimestoppersUK anonymously on 0800 555 111. #OpCastle #BeatTheBurglar
