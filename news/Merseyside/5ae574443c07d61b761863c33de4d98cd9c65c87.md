Two men were arrested after officers from the Matrix firearms unit stopped a car which was acting suspicious in Toxteth.

Officers stopped the car, a Skoda, in Huskisson Street, at around 11.30pm on Friday, 6th March.

The car was searched and a quantity of wraps, suspected to be Class A drugs, were recovered.

The car was also found to be displaying false plates and is believed to have been stolen from the Lymm area in January 2020.

A 41 year-old man from the Sefton Park area and a 32 year-old man from Kirkby were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs.

Both have been released under investigation pending further enquiries.
