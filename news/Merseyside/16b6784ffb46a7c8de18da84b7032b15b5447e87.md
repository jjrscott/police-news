Detectives have arrested a man and seized a firearm and cannabis following a warrant in Fazakerley last night, Tuesday 25 February.

A warrant was carried out at an address in Beryl Walk, resulting in the seizure of a revolver, cannabis and paraphernalia.

A 29-year-old man from Prescot was arrested on suspicion of possession of a firearm and possession with intent to supply, and has been taken to a police station for questioning.

Detective Chief Inspector Rachel Wilson said: "Each and every firearm we remove from the streets makes your community safer. All such weapons can cause fear and harm where you live, and our determination to reduce gun crime is continuous, and has seen numerous firearm seizures and a recent reduction in incidents.

"The links between firearms and drug supply are clear to see, and we will respond to all information which comes in about all serious and organised crime. If you know where weapons, drugs or other illegal items are being stored, carried and used, let us know and we will do the rest.

"You can talk to us directly or anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."

Anyone with information on the storage of drugs or weapons is asked to contact @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
