We are appealing for witnesses after a fail to stop serious injury road traffic collision that occurred in the Toxteth area this afternoon, Thursday 20th August.

At around 1.45pm a 12 year-old boy, who was on his bike, was in collision with a car on Smithdown Road at the junction of Holmes Street.

The boy suffered a serious leg injury and is currently receiving medical treatment at hospital. His injuries are not believed to be life threatening.

Roads Policing Sergeant Jonathan Cawley said: "This is a busy road with lots of road users. We know people witnessed the collision but so far we have been unable to locate them.

"We are also appealing to anyone who happened to be in the area at the time and has dash cam footage or anyone who saw a silver hatchback type car leave the scene to contact us."

Anyone with information can DM @MerPolCC or call 101 quoting reference 20000500724.
