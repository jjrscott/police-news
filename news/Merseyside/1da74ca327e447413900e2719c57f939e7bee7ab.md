We are appealing for information after burglars attempts to break into a cash machine in Wallasey in the early hours of today (Tuesday 12 November).

A report was received that an alarm was sounding at McColls, Trafalgar Road at around 12.30am where offenders cut open a shutter and smashed a window to gain access to the store.

Damage was then caused to an ATM inside before the offenders left the scene empty-handed after being disturbed by the arrival of police.

It is believed the offenders drove away in an Audi S1 car, and left a Volvo along with a number of tools at the scene.

The Volvo and tools have been recovered by police and are being forensically examined.

Officers are currently in the area this morning working with staff at McColls as well as carrying out house to house enquiries, CCTV analysis and forensic tests.

Anyone who may have seen the offenders or has any information that could help us with ongoing investigations, no matter how small, should contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact @CrimestoppersUK anonymously quoting: incident reference 19100660296.
