The knitted toys

Teddy bears and dolls knitted by a grandmother have been given to help support children who find themselves at **Medway** police station.

The toys were made by the lady during the second lockdown, and she has now donated them to Kent Police.

The fourteen knitted teddy bears and four dolls will be used in the Vulnerable Victim Suite and will be given to children to use while in the station to help them feel more comfortable.

Detective Inspector Suiling Chan, of Medway's Vulnerable Investigation Team said: 'This was a kind-hearted gesture by a resident which will enable us to go the extra mile for children who come to our attention.

'Unfortunately, we do sometimes have to help children as part of our investigations. This could be because of a road traffic collision, or because they have been affected by abuse.

'Protecting them is our absolute priority and we always give them the highest amount of care - on top of our efforts to stop them coming to any further harm.

'These teddies will complement our efforts and will be given to children to help them feel more comfortable.'
