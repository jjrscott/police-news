We are reminding residents to take simple crime prevention steps to keep their homes and themselves safe during the winter months.

Historically, we have seen an increase in burglaries over the autumn and winter months when it gets dark early and we fill our homes with gifts in readiness for Christmas.

As the nights draw in this presents opportunities for acquisitive crime such as burglary which as well as causing inconvenience and distress, can have a profound impact on feelings of safety and security.

Chief Inspector Lara Connor from Kent Police said: 'With new Covid-19 restrictions in place for the next four weeks, we understand people are staying at home, but this will not stop opportunist burglars.
'We want people to think about making it harder for thieves to steal.
'Simple steps such as storing keys away from doors and windows and taking them with you when you go to bed will mean you are less likely to be a victim of a car-key burglary, disposing of packaging rather than leaving them by your bins outside so you are not advertising expensive items you have bought and storing and locking away bikes, tools and garden items which could be stolen or used to break into your home.'

There are other steps you can take such as security marking items including bikes, mobiles and laptops, keep receipts, serial numbers safe and phone IMEI numbers safe and photograph and insure expensive or unique items so if you are a victim of burglary, your belongings will be too hot for thieves to sell on.
