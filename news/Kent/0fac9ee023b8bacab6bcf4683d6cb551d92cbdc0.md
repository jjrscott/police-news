Investigators are appealing for information following a fatal collision on the **M26 motorway**.

At around **1pm** on **Thursday 15 October 2020** , a red LDV Maxus flatbed van with three occupants was travelling along the coastbound carriageway of the M26 prior to **junction 2A near Wrotham,** when it was involved in a collision with a grey DAF articulated lorry.

Two of the occupants of the flatbed van, who were men from the Maidstone area aged in their 20s and 40s, died at the scene. A third man from the same vehicle was taken to a London hospital where his condition is described as critical.

## Appeal for witnesses
