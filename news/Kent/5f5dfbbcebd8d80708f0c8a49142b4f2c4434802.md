Investigators are appealing for information after receiving a report that a moving car was damaged on the **West Malling** bypass.

At around **12.15pm** on **Sunday 11 October 2020** , a motorist was driving on the **A228 Ashton Way** when his sunroof was struck by an object as he drove under a bridge.

Inspector Lizzie Jones of the Tonbridge and Malling Community Safety Unit said: 'The sunroof of this vehicle was smashed and it is only by chance that the occupants did not suffer serious injuries.

'We do not know what the object was that struck the vehicle and are appealing for information from witnesses.

'We would also like to hear from anybody who saw two children with cycles on the bridge at the time of the incident or anybody who knows who they might be.'
