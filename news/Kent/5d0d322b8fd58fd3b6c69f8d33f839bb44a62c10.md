Business owners are reminded to ensure valuable items are securely stored if being left overnight, following a number of burglaries on a **Sittingbourne** trading estate.

Kent Police received reports of three break-ins to commercial premises on the **Trinity Trading Estate** at around **2am** on **Wednesday 18 December 2019**. Computer equipment, cash and vehicle keys were reported stolen.

Sergeant Jason Hedges of the Swale Community Safety Unit said: 'Some businesses cease trading over the Christmas period and thieves can see this as an opportunity to target the premises.

'We would like to remind business owners to review their safety measures and to ensure large amounts of money or valuables are either securely stored or are not left on-site. Keep the building secure and consider installing CCTV, alarms and security lighting.

'Any business owners who have concerns about their security can contact our Community Safety Unit for advice on staying safe.'

Anyone with information regarding these incidents is asked to call Kent Police on **01795 419119** quoting crime reference **46/240261/19**.
