Detectives investigating an assault in **Ashford** have renewed their appeal for information.

On **Tuesday 2 April 2019** at around **6.45pm** Kent Police officers were called to a report of a disturbance in a field near **Stanhope Road**.

Two men, in their 20s, suffered serious arm and hand injuries and were taken to a local hospital for treatment.

Officers carried out a number of enquiries in the area, near to **Frittenden Close** , and in total six people were arrested in connection with the incident.

Between 2 April and 6 April 2019 three 19-year-old men, two 18-year-old men and a 17-year-old boy were arrested and have since been released pending further investigation.

Detective Sergeant Robert Goodban said: 'We have carried out a large number of enquiries into the circumstances surrounding this incident and we know there were lots of people at the scene who may have witnessed the assaults take place.

'We believe there could still be people who have crucial information and have not yet been in touch. A year on, we urge anyone with information to get in contact with us as soon as possible.

'Any information, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant, could be vital to our investigation.'
