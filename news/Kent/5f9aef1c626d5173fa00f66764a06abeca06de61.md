Dash cam footage and witnesses are sought by officers after a car overturned on the **A21** near **Sevenoaks**.

At around **4.30pm** on **Saturday 11 July 2020** , a silver Peugeot 206 and a Volvo collided on the coastbound carriageway close to **Morleys roundabout**. The Peugeot overturned and came to rest on its roof on a grass verge. There were no serious injuries, but it is reported the occupants of the vehicle, two men and two women, exited and left the scene on foot.

They were located by police a short time later walking on the A225 in the direction of Tonbridge. One of the group, a 35-year-old man from Sittingbourne, was arrested on suspicion of drink driving, driving without a licence or insurance, failing to stop after an accident and taking a vehicle without consent. He was later released, pending further investigation.

Officers are urging anyone who may have seen the collision, or who noticed the Peugeot in the moments leading up to it, to contact them. Drivers who were in the area are also asked to check if they have any dash cam footage, which may assist the investigation.

Witnesses can call Kent Police on **01622 604100** , quoting reference **46/118681/20**.
