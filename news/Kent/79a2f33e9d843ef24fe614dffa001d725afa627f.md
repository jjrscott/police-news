Catapults seized

Catapults and ball bearings were seized by Rural Task Force officers who responded to local farmers' concerns about poaching in **Faversham** on **Friday evening, 30 October 2020.**

The officers were called to the area at **6.57pm** after a suspected poacher was captured on CCTV on farmland in **Stalisfield**.

Officers attended the area and carried out a search which led to them stopping a Ford Mondeo at around 8pm on Church Road, Throwley.

The officers seized catapults, ball bearings and fishing equipment from the vehicle and a man was arrested in connection with rogue trader offences in a neighbouring county.

## Farm Watch

The incident was reported directly to the team via the Farm Watch social media messaging group which involves people in the rural communities being able to network and report suspicious activity to the Rural Task Force.

Sergeant Darren Walshaw said: 'The team were in the area as part of ongoing work to tackle hare coursing and poaching which can cause significant harm to rural communities.

'In addition to the suffering caused to animals those participating in such activity cause a huge amount of damage to property, are often linked to other offences and become aggressive when challenged.

'We will continue to work with people within the rural community to target such behaviour and encourage anyone who witnesses hare coursing or has information about those involved in poaching to contact us.'
