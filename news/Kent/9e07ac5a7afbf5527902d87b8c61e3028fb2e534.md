Two suspected drug dealers are to appear in court following the seizure of Class A drugs and a stun gun in **Ashford**.

During the **morning of Friday 19 March 2021** , officers from Kent Police's Divisional Support Unit in Folkestone executed a warrant under the Misuse of Drugs Act at a property in **Sotherton, Ashford**.

Quantities of heroin and crack cocaine were recovered from the property including hidden within the floor and the loft.

The two men from Ashford, **Gary Booth** , 46, of Wellesley Road, and **Peter Baars** , 52 of Sotherton, were each charged with two counts of possessing Class A drugs with intent to supply and possession of a stun gun disguised as a torch.

They appeared at Folkestone Magistrates' Court on Saturday 20 March where they were remanded in custody. They will next appear at Canterbury Crown Court on 19 April 2021.
