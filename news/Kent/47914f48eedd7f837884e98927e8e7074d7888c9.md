More than 100 cannabis plants have been seized after Kent Police carried out a drugs warrant in **Canterbury**.

Officers carried out the warrant at a property in **Halstead Close** on the morning of **Monday 18 January 2021**.

Around 101 cannabis plants were seized, as well as other items, and an investigation into the site is ongoing.

## Action

Sergeant Shelah Thompson, of Canterbury's Community Policing Team, said: 'Kent Police is determined to make the county a no-go area for drug dealing networks and I am pleased this warrant has seen a large amount of cannabis taken out of circulation.

'Criminal groups would have profited from the sale of these drugs, potentially causing further crime and anti-social behaviour in the area.

'I urge anyone who suspects drugs are being cultivated, produced or dealt in their area to report it to us by calling 101, visiting www.kent.police.uk/report, or calling 999 if a crime is in progress.'
