A suspected intruder is to appear at court following his arrest in **Chatham**.

The incident took place at around **2.15am** on **Saturday 20 March 2021** , when it is alleged a woman woke to find a man she did not know in her bedroom.

## Arrest

The victim immediately raised the alarm and the man was detained by one of her relatives. Officers attended the scene and he was arrested and taken into custody.

**David Tyler** , of Wyles Road, Chatham, was charged later the same day with trespassing on premises with the intention of committing a sexual offence and sexually touching a woman without consent.

The 71-year-old appeared before Medway Magistrates' Court on Monday 22 March, where he was remanded to a hearing at Maidstone Crown Court on 19 April.
