Images of a man have been released by officers investigating allegations of vehicle interference in **Herne Bay**.

The owner of a vehicle, parked overnight in **Linden Avenue between 28 June 2020 and the following morning** , reported finding a door and the glove compartment open and items left in the car had been moved.

It was reported that offenders were seen to try the door handles of other cars in the same street that night.

PC Tom Booth said: 'We hope that people will recognise the clothing and trainers worn by the man pictured, as perhaps belonging to someone they know.

'Anyone with information which could assist the investigation should call Kent Police on **01843 222289** quoting 46/111440/20.'

You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111 or using the anonymous online form.

CCTV: Officers want to speak to this man.
