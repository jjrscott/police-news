Motorists are reminded to look out for suspicious activity following a recent number of car crimes in the **Hadlow** , **Kings Hill** and **Sevenoaks** areas.

Nine catalytic converter thefts were reported on **Wednesday 26 February 2020** across the Hadlow and Kings Hill areas and three on **Saturday 29 February 2020** in Riverhead, Sevenoaks.

All the alleged offences happened in daylight with the car being jacked up and the catalytic converter sawn off. Officers believe the crimes are likely to have been carried out by the same suspects.

Sevenoaks Chief Inspector, Jon Kirby says: 'We are very keen to make motorists aware of the recent increase in this type of crime so that they take the right steps to protect themselves.

'Our specialist teams are using all the resources they have to target the offenders, including scouring CCTV and working with car parks to ensure better vehicle security.

'Anyone who witnesses any suspicious activity should report it immediately via 101 or 999 if in progress and requires an immediate response. You can also call the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or complete the online form'.

## Crime prevention advice:

 * contact your car manufacturer as some sell clamps and security cages that make catalytic converters more difficult to steal
 * park your vehicle in a garage whenever possible
 * if you do not have a garage then park in a busy, well-lit area
 * consider installing good quality CCTV cameras
 * security-mark and register the metal shell of the converter so we can return it to you if it is stolen and recovered.
