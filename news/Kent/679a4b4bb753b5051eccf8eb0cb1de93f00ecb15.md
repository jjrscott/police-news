Electric scooter owners in **Maidstone** are reminded to comply with the law and be considerate of other road users.

The warning is issued after police community support officers seized an e-scooter from a child after he was seen riding it in a dangerous manner in **Plains Avenue** , on **Wednesday 2 December 2020**.

The boy had been advised by the same officers regarding a similar incident a few days earlier. His parent was asked to attend the police station to retrieve it and they received guidance regarding their son's conduct.

Inspector Stephen Kent of Maidstone's Community Safety Unit said: 'In the town centre and surrounding housing estates we have been receiving reports of the antisocial and dangerous use of e-scooters.
'Owners should be aware that these currently fall under the same laws and regulations that apply to all motor vehicles.
'This means for use on a public road the user requires insurance, vehicle tax, a driving licence and registration.'

## Illegal use

The use of e-scooters on pavements, in cycle lanes and in pedestrian-only areas is illegal and, in general, they should only be used on private land with the landowner's permission.

Inspector Kent continued: 'Our officers will be stopping and giving words of advice to e-scooter users and will seize the equipment where offences have been committed.
'Where appropriate, persistent offenders or dangerous riders can be issued with a fixed penalty notice or receive a traffic offence report.'

Further advice is available on the government website here.
