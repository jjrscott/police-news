CCTV images have been issued by officers investigating a series of arsons in **Tunbridge Wells** which caused damage to parked cars.

Between **1.45am** and **3.45am** on **Tuesday 16 June 2020** two vehicles sustained damage after fires were started in **Sherwood Road** and **Kingswood Road**.

A short time later rubbish bins and street signs were set alight in **Pembury Road** , as well as in **Nelson Road, Hawkenbury**.

An appeal for information was initially issued by Kent Police on 26 June.

Officers have now released CCTV images of a man who was outside a convenience store in Sherwood Road, at the same time as one of the fires.

Police Sergeant James Page said: 'We believe this man may have important information, which can assist our enquiries. He was pictured in an area very close to where one of the fires took place and we would really like to speak to him. He was wearing a rucksack at the time and smoking a cigarette.'
