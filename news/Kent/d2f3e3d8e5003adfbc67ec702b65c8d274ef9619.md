Officers investigating suspected arsons to two vehicles in **Maidstone** are appealing for information.

At around **11pm** on **Wednesday 15 April 2020** , patrols were called to a car on fire in **Elmstone Lane, Barming.** Approximately ninety minutes later a panel van was reported to be alight in **Fant Lane.**

Nobody was injured in the blazes which were put out by Kent Fire and Rescue Service.

## Suspicious

Investigators are treating the cause of the fires as suspicious and are completing house-to-house enquiries in the area, while the scenes are being forensically examined.

Inspector Mark Hedges of Maidstone's Community Safety Unit said: 'We suspect the fires were started deliberately and are very keen to hear from anyone who may have seen anything unusual or suspicious.

'I would also appeal to nearby residents, who have not yet spoken to my officers, to check any CCTV they may have outside their homes.'
