Kent Police is liaising with and supporting the **Metropolitan Police Service** in relation to its investigation into the disappearance of **Sarah Everard** which has seen a large number of its officers in the **east Kent area**.

Over the next few days, the Met Police will continue to carry out activities across the area whilst their enquiries progress.

Assistant Chief Constable Tom Richards from the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate said: 'We know that people will be deeply concerned given the events of the last few days and the circumstances surrounding it, but as you would expect, the Metropolitan Police Service is carrying out an extensive and thorough investigation, and the public will see an increased visibility of officers throughout the area.

'Our officers will be supporting that presence around the county to listen to any concerns and will do everything we can to support and reassure people. The safety of our communities remains our priority and there is nothing that suggests there is a wider threat to the public.'
