Residents in the **West Malling** area are warned to ensure sheds and outbuildings are secure following a number of reported thefts.

Between **11 and 12 September 2020** , six sheds were targeted at properties on **London Road**. Items stolen included power tools, golf clubs and bicycles.

## Further break-ins

Two further sheds were broken into at addresses in the **High Street** between **12 and 13 September**. Nothing was stolen from inside but a hedge cutter was taken from one of the gardens.

A cycle was also reported stolen from a locked shed in **Offham Road** between **11 and 13 September** and another was targeted at a house in **Holly Hill Road** the following day.

Sergeant Sarah Alvey of the Tonbridge and Malling Community Policing Team said: 'We suspect opportunist thieves may be visiting the area during the hours of darkness looking for valuable tools stored in sheds and outbuildings.

'While we are investigating these offences, I would advise residents to make sure you lock all doors and windows and consider fitting a shed alarm or security light.

'My officers continue to patrol these areas at vulnerable times and I would urge anybody who sees someone on foot or in a vehicle acting suspiciously to contact us on 101.'
