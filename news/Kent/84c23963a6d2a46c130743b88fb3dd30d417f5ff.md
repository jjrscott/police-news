Van owners are being warned to make sure their vehicles are secure following two arrests near **Dover**.

Kent Police was called to **St Margaret's at Cliffe** shortly after **11.30pm** on **Tuesday 23 February 2021** following a report that a van had been broken into.

A car was later stopped by officers in nearby Upper Road and a 24-year-old man from Eltham, south-east London and a 25-year-old man from Gravesend were arrested on suspicion of theft from a vehicle.

The suspects have been released under investigation and enquiries into the incident are ongoing.

District Commander Chief Inspector Daniel Carter said:

'I would like to warn other van owners in the area to make sure their vehicles are secure.

'Where possible, do not leave items of value in your vans when parked and, where necessary, consider using a lockable internal cabinet and mark any items using paint pens and lacquer spray.

'If a secure garage is not available, we advise you to park your van in a well-lit area, ideally covered by CCTV.'
