Following the disruption to borders last week, roadside waste was left behind affecting many of the key routes to **Dover**.

Nicky Potts, Highways England head of operational integration, said: 'Since **Boxing day** and over the last few days, we have collected over 1,400 bags of waste along the **M20** between **junctions 8 and 9** as well as a large lorry load from between **junctions 10a and 13**.
'We have more litter clearance work planned over the next week which will include supporting our Dover District Council partners in cleaning up the A20 and A2.
'We thank residents in the affected areas along the motorway for their patience while this work is carried out.'

Partner agencies, including Kent Police, Highways England, Kent County Council and the Department for Transport under the Kent Resilience Forum are working together to ensure roads are clear and freight is moved to the ports as quickly as possible.

Assistant Chief Constable Claire Nix, who is chairing the Kent Resilience Forum's planned response to potential disruption in the county as a result of the end of the EU Transition period, said: 'Whilst we have relatively low numbers of freight crossing the channel at present, the Kent Resilience Forum is working together to ensure the smooth running of freight through the county, and that any waste as a result of the disruption we saw last week is cleared as quickly as possible.'

Following the requirement for a negative Covid-19 test before heading to France, hauliers must ensure that they obtain a negative test result before heading to Kent, together with the correct documentation, including Kent Access Permits before arriving in the county in order they can cross the Channel.

Drivers who do not have the Kent Access Permit may be fined up to Â£300.
