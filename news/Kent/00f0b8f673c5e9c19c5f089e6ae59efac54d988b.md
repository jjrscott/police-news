A CCTV image has been issued by officers investigating a burglary at a garage in **Offham**.

Between **7pm and 8pm on 13 November 2020** , a garage on **Teston Road** was targeted and a large quantity of power tools were reported stolen.

## CCTV issued

Officers have been investigating the incident and are now able to issue a CCTV image of two people they believe could help with their enquiries.

Investigating officer, PC Lee Goble said: 'While the CCTV image is blurred, we are hoping that somebody who knows the men or recalls seeing two men at around the time of the incident wearing similar clothing, calls the appeal line.'
