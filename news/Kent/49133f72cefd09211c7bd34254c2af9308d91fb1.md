Between **Thursday 7** and **Friday 8 January 2021** , three sheds were targeted at properties in **London Road** and **Barleycorn**. Items stolen included power tools, garden appliances and a cycle.

## Further thefts

A further shed was broken into at an address in **King Street, West Malling** between **Sunday 3** and **Thursday 7 January.**

Sergeant Sarah Alvey of the Tonbridge and Malling Community Safety Unit said: 'We suspect an opportunist thief is walking around the area on foot during the hours of darkness, looking for items of value in garden sheds and outbuildings.
'I would advise residents to make sure you lock doors and windows and consider fitting a shed alarm or security light.
'My officers are patrolling these areas at key times and I would urge anyone who sees somebody acting suspiciously to contact us on 101, or 999 if you believe a crime is taking place.'
