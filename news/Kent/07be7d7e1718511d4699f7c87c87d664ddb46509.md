Farmers in west Kent are urged to be vigilant following a spate of satellite navigation thefts from tractors.

Five vehicles were targeted on farms in the Sevenoaks district, between the evening of **Monday 7 September 2020** and the early hours of **Tuesday 8 September.**

The systems cost several thousand pounds to buy for each tractor and were allegedly stolen from locations off **Plaxdale Green Road,** in **Stansted, Sevenoaks and Wrotham Water Road, Wrotham.**

## **Information sought**

The thefts are being investigated by Kent Police's Rural Task Force and officers are appealing for anyone with information to contact them.

PC Dan Perry said: 'These pieces of equipment are essential for farmers; losing them to thieves as well as losing the information they hold, can have a very detrimental impact on their businesses.

'We are asking anyone who may have seen anything suspicious to call us. Motorists who drive in these areas are also asked to check any dash cams which may hold important footage.'

If you can help call Kent Police on **01622 604100** , quoting reference 08-0238.

You can also contact Kent Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111, or by using the online form.

## Further advice

To help deter thieves, farmers are reminded that where possible they should remove satellite navigation systems from tractors and other farm machinery, when left overnight.

Don't leave them in a locked cab, as these can be broken into. Also consider using property marking kits as an added security measure.
