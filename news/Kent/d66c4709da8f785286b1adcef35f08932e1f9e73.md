Liam Elward, pictured on CCTV on the day of the offence, has been jailed.

An extended sentence has been imposed on a man who stabbed his victim following an argument at a **Ramsgate** property.

**Liam Elward** , 33, admitted wounding with intent after he attacked a man with two knives at a house in the town's **High Street** on **Monday 29 June 2020**.

At Canterbury Crown Court on Thursday 11 February 2021, he was given an eight-year jail sentence and ordered to serve an extra three years on licence when that sentence ends.

## Assault

Elward had an argument with the victim at the property on the morning of the day of the attack.

He then went away and got two knives, one a serrated bread knife and the other a four-inch kitchen knife, before returning and attacking the victim.

The man suffered cuts to his body and Elward then chased another man from the property with the knives in his hands.

Elward was located by police later that day and arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

## Charge

He was charged with and admitted that charge and a further charge of affray at Canterbury Crown Court on Wednesday 28 October 2020.

PC Emma Wheeler, Kent Police's investigating officer, said: 'Elward was completely reckless to the injuries he caused on the day of this attack and it is only by good fortune that we were not dealing with a far more serious case.

'The length of the sentence imposed, and the extended licence period, will prevent Elward being able to cause any further harm to those around him.'
