Reuben Daley, pictured, has been jailed for 13 years

A thirteen-year jail term has been imposed on a man who repeatedly hit his victim with a hammer during an assault in Folkestone.

**Reuben Daley** hit the man up to 30 times during the incident outside a pub in **Harbour Street** on **Thursday 6 February 2020**.

The 43-year-old pleaded guilty to wounding with intent and possession of an offensive weapon at Canterbury Crown Court.

Daley, of Coolinge Road, Folkestone, was brought back before the court on Thursday 3 December 2020 and sentenced to thirteen years.

## Extended sentence

He will also serve an extended four-year period on licence following his release.

Daley was seen in the pub watching his victim on the day of the assault. He waited until the man left the premises before attacking him.

He hit the man to the head and body with the hammer before following him back into the pub and continuing the assault.

## Arrest

A member of the public managed to take the hammer from Daley before he made off. He was arrested three days later.

The victim lost consciousness following the assault and suffered cuts to his face and head.

Detective Constable Luke Thomson, Kent Police's investigating officer, said: 'This was a shocking assault, the consequences of which could have been far more serious.

'Daley is an unpredictable and violent man and I am pleased this investigation and the resulting sentence has removed him from the streets of Folkestone for a considerable amount of time.'
