Dashcam footage and witnesses are being sought by officers investigating a report of dangerous driving near **Halstead**.

The incident happened at around **11.40am** on **Friday 5 February 2021** , after a blue Ford Kuga with one occupant failed to stop for a patrol in **Stonehouse Lane**.

## Pursuit

The Kuga is alleged to have travelled at speed into **Church Road** and **Shoreham Lane** , pursued by the patrol. It then continued into **Otford Lane** before being abandoned on the **A224 London Road** near Halstead.

It is reported that during the pursuit the Kuga stopped and reversed towards the officer's car three times, colliding with it twice and disabling the police vehicle on the third occasion.

The driver left the Kuga on foot and is understood to have made his way onto the hard shoulder of the M25, where he was collected by another vehicle.

Investigating officer, PC Alex Peacock said: 'We are appealing for witnesses who saw the Ford Kuga at any stage of the pursuit to contact us. This includes a woman with a pink top and cap who was jogging on Church Road near its junction with Shoreham Road, and who jumped out of the way as the vehicle passed her.
'In addition, motorists with dashcam who were in the area and residents with CCTV are asked to check for footage that may assist the investigation.'
