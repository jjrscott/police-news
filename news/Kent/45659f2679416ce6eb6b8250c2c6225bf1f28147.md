Seven charges have been authorised against a Sheppey man after Kent Police was called to a disturbance in **Minster-on-Sea**.

At around **1.45pm** on **Friday 12 February 2021** , Kent Police received a report that a dispute was taking place in the **Nettle Way** area. During the incident, four men are said to have been assaulted by a single man. The same suspect is also reported to have damaged a car and a garden gate.

Following a search of the area, officers arrested **Leonard Lee** in connection with the incident.

The 28-year-old, of Nettle Way, was later charged with two counts of racially aggravated assault, assault, common assault, racially aggravated criminal damage, criminal damage and possessing an offensive weapon, a hammer, in a public place.

He was remanded in custody to appear at Medway Magistrates' Court on Monday 15 February 2021. At the hearing, he pleaded guilty to each charge and was released on bail. He will next appear for sentence at Maidstone Crown Court on a date to be determined.
