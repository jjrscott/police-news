A CCTV image has been issued following a report that a woman was assaulted and spat at in **Tunbridge Wells.**

At around **noon** on **11 October 2020** , the victim was in **Victoria Road** when she asked a man she did not know to move away, as she felt he was walking too close to her.

It is alleged the man responded by insulting the victim, aged in her 30s, before he threw the contents of a beer can at her and then spat on her clothing and hair.
