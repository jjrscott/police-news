Searching officers found a mobile phone hidden behind a car radio after they arrested a cocaine dealer in **Tonbridge**.

On **Wednesday 23 December 2020** , officers from the Tonbridge Community Policing Team were on patrol when they stopped a VW Golf in **Darenth Avenue**.

Suspecting the driver, 34-year-old **Shahin Miah** , was involved in the supply of drugs, the officers searched him and found two deals of cocaine in one of his pockets. They also seized £35 and a mobile phone, and he was arrested and taken into custody.

At the police station, the VW was searched and the officers found eight cocaine deals inside a sock in the glove compartment and two further deals in a phone case.

## Hidden cash

In addition, they seized £485 in cash hidden inside the vehicle, and a mobile phone that was receiving texts relating to drug purchases, from behind the car radio.

Miah, of no fixed address, was later charged with possession of cocaine with intent to supply and possessing criminal property, namely the seized cash.

## Guilty

He pleaded guilty at Maidstone Crown Court and on Wednesday 27 January 2021 was jailed for three years.

Investigating officer, PC Jake O'Reilly said: 'Miah has been travelling into Kent to supply Class A drugs to some of the most vulnerable people in our community.
'These dealers cause misery and promote crime and we will continue to target them whenever they appear in our towns.
'My message to these criminals is simple, come here to deal drugs and our patrols will track you down and bring you to justice.'
