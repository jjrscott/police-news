Burglary investigators in the Medway Crime Investigation Department have charged two men after receiving reports that two homes in **Chatham** had been targeted.

Both offences are said to have taken place in **Rochester Street** on the night of **Thursday 3 December 2020**.

Kent Police was first called at around **11pm** , when it was reported two men were seen attempting to gain access to a home. These same two men are then reported to have forced entry to the basement of a different, nearby property.

Officers immediately attended the area and had detained two men before midnight.

**Lee Fideghelli** , fourty-two, of King Edward Road, Gillingham, and **Mark Abraham** , twenty-nine, of The Mount, Chatham, were both later charged with burglary and attempted burglary.

They appeared at Medway Magistrates' Court on Saturday 5 December.

At the hearing, Abraham pleaded guilty to both offences and was sentenced to sixty days in prison, suspended for a year.

Fideghelli did not enter a plea and has been remanded in custody to appear at Maidstone Crown Court on Monday 11 January 2021.
