A CCTV image has been released by officers investigating a theft in **Maidstone** town centre.

Between midday and **2.10pm** on **Saturday 12 December 2020** , it is alleged a man in his 60s had a wallet stolen from his backpack while he was distracted in a **Week Street** shop.

## Image issued

Officers have been completing enquiries and are now able to release an image of two women who they believe may be able to assist with their enquiries.

Police Sergeant Craig Chalmers-Stevens said: 'While their faces are not very visible, we are hoping somebody recognises the women from their distinctive clothing and contacts us.
'I would remind shoppers to be careful when out and about to avoid becoming victim to opportunist thieves. Never leave bags unattended on top of prams, shopping trolleys, wheelchairs or mobility scooters.
'If you are carrying a backpack, ensure it is fastened or zipped up and valuables are not easily accessible.'

## Can you help?
