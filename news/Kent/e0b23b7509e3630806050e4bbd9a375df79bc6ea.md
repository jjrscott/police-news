Motorists in **Herne Bay** are being urged not to leave any valuables in their cars following thefts in the town.

On **Tuesday 30 June 2020,** Kent Police received four reports that cars in **Mortimer Street, Pier Street, Linden Avenue and Kings Road** had belongings stolen from them the **night before** , including a wallet, tools and cash.

A second vehicle parked in **Linden Avenue** was also reportedly searched but nothing was taken.

In some of the cases, the vehicles may have been left insecure by the owners.

Anyone with information or who witnessed suspicious activity in the areas mentioned should call Kent Police on **01843 222289** quoting 46/111440/20.

DC Adele Tyrer from the Chief Constable's Crime Squad said: 'We ask that people make sure their vehicles are locked before leaving them unattended, even for a short time, and remove anything which might be attractive to thieves, including sunglasses or loose change.

'We believe there may be other victims who have had items stolen from their cars but who have not yet reported it to Kent Police.

'It is crucial people inform us, either by calling 101 or reporting via our website, so the thefts can be investigated.

'The information provided could assist in identifying and arresting those responsible for this criminal behaviour.'
