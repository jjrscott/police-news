Kent Police is appealing for information after two women reported being threatened during a burglary in **Ashford**.

The incident happened on **Thursday 27 February 2020** in **Repton Manor Road** at approximately **8pm**.

One of the victims, in her 30s, opened the door to two men who are reported to have forced their way into the property before threatening her and demanding money.

## Men fled towards Templar Way

Another woman, also in her 30s, was threatened before they both managed to get out of the house and shout for help. The suspects, seen wearing balaclavas, then fled from the property on foot in the direction of Templar Way.

There were no reported injuries and nothing was reported stolen.

PC Matthew Johnston said: 'We continue to investigate a number of lines of enquiry but believe there may be people who witnessed the incident who we have not yet spoken to.

'We are also interested in any drivers who may have dashcam footage from the area of Repton Manor Road and Templar Way between 7pm and 8.30pm.'
