Three suspected drug dealers have been arrested in **Folkestone**.

The arrests were made after a car failed to stop when requested to do so by police following concerns of suspected drug dealing in **Forresters Way** during the **morning of Tuesday 5 January 2021**.

The vehicle was found in the **Longford Terrace** area and officers seized quantities of cash, wraps of suspected Class A drugs, mobile phones and drugs paraphernalia.

Officers subsequently arrested a 24-year-old man from New Romney, a 53-year-old man from Hythe and a 36-year-old woman from Hythe on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs.

The two people from Hythe were also further arrested on suspicion of driving offences.

All three were released on bail until 28 January while enquiries continue.
