Kent Police has seized weapons and set up a knife detector during operations to tackle knife crime in Thanet.

Officers recovered 11 bladed articles during a sweep of parks and green spaces in **Margate** and **Ramsgate** on **Wednesday 29 January 2020**.

In a separate initiative, officers worked with a public house in **Ramsgate** and set up a knife detector outside the venue on the evening of **Thursday 30 January 2020**.

## Positive response

Sergeant Stephen Moat, of Thanet's Community Safety Unit, said: 'The knife detector acts as a deterrent to anyone considering taking a weapon with them into the town centre during the evening. This is reflected in the fact that no weapons were found on anyone entering the premises.

'The response from both the public and the premises was overwhelmingly positive, with those out in the town happy with the actions we are taking to ensure their safety.

'We will continue to run operations of this kind to ensure the message gets out that carrying a knife is completely unacceptable. We will always seek to prosecute anyone found with a blade.'
