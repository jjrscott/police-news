Officers investigating four incidents committed in **Gravesend** during a 10-minute period have charged a man.

At **7.47pm** on **Thursday 24 December 2020** Kent Police received a report that a man, who was carrying a knife, had forced entry to a home in **Wrotham Road** and assaulted an occupant. Nine minutes later, a similar offence took place in **Essex Road**.

In between the two burglaries, the same offender is alleged to have assaulted a different man in Wrotham Road before damaging a nearby garden gate and summer house.

Kent Police officers had safely detained a suspect by 8.05pm and no victims reported sustaining serious injuries.

**Jacek Gralak** , 24, of Kent Road, Gravesend, was later charged with two counts of aggravated burglary, affray, actual bodily harm, criminal damage and assaulting an emergency worker.

He appeared before Medway Magistrates' Court on 26 December and was remanded in custody to appear before Maidstone Crown Court on 25 January 2021.
