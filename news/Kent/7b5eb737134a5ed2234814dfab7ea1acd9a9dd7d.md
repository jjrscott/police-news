Two people have been arrested on suspicion of running a brothel in **Gillingham**.

Both individuals were arrested on the evening of **Friday 4 December 2020** after officers in the Medway Community Policing Team attended an address in **Milton Road** as part of an ongoing investigation.

A 25-year-old man and a 28-year-old woman, both from Gillingham, were subsequently arrested on suspicion of exploiting prostitution for gain, and managing a brothel, before being taken into custody.

Officers are working to establish the full circumstances, while also ensuring anyone who may be at risk of exploitation receives the necessary support.
