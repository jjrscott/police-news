A CCTV image has been issued by officers investigating threats made to employees at an **Aylesford** supermarket.

At around **2.20pm** on **25 April 2020** , staff at Sainsburys on **Mills Road** stopped a man who sought to enter the premises through the exit.

## Threats

It is alleged the man then made threats to members of staff while holding a traffic cone.

Enquiries in the area have led officers to identify a CCTV image of a man who may have important information.
