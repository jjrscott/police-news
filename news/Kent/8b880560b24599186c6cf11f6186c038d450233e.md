Roads have now been reopened following the removal of an unexploded wartime bomb at Crockenhill Primary School, Swanley.

The bomb was found just after 1pm on 3 February 2020 during an excavation of part of the playground.

All school children were safely evacuated and two roads surrounding the school were closed.

Green Court Road and Stones Cross Road, which links into Broadway, were closed but have since reopened.

A Ministry of Defence bomb disposal unit have now removed the device from the site and have confirmed the area is now safe.
