Two arrests have been made after officers stopped a vehicle in **Chatham** and discovered class A drugs.

Kent Police officers signalled for a car to stop in **Walderslade Road** on **Monday 7 December 2020** at around **8pm**. The two occupants, a 26-year-old woman and a 23-year-old man, believed to be from London, were searched along with the vehicle.

Class A drugs, suspected to be heroin and crack cocaine, were discovered along with cannabis, mobile phones and cash.

The pair were arrested for being concerned in the supply of drugs and enquiries remain ongoing with the County Lines and Gang Team.

Inspector Martin Williams said:

'We take a zero tolerance approach to drug-related crime and will continue to disrupt those involved in supplying drugs in Kent. These substances can have such a detrimental impact on people's lives and there will be no let-up in our determination to keep criminals and their drugs off our streets.'
