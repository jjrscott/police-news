CCTV images have been issued by officers investigating a reported theft at a **Maidstone** shop.

At around **7:45pm** on **Tuesday 9 February 2021** , a man entered the store in **Willington Street** where it is alleged he stole a quantity of cash from the till.

A member of staff intervened, however, he left the premises turning right towards Valentine Road.

## CCTV images

Officers are now able to issue CCTV images of a person who they would like to identify.

Investigating officer, PC Wetherell, said: 'While the man has his coat hood up and a face mask obscuring his features, we are hoping somebody living in the local area recognises him from his clothing and contacts the appeal line.
'We would also like to hear from motorists with dashcam or residents with CCTV who may have footage that could assist the investigation.'
