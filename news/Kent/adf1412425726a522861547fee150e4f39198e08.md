Residents in the **West Malling** area are reminded to keep sheds and outbuildings secure following a spate of reported burglaries.

On **Sunday 17 January 2021** , a shed in **Town Hill** was targeted and an outboard motor was stolen.

## Power tools

Two further sheds were broken into at addresses in **The Green** and **Comp Lane, Offham** between **Wednesday 20 and Thursday 21 January**. Items stolen included power tools, garden equipment and golf clubs.

Sergeant Sarah Alvey of the Tonbridge and Malling Community Safety Unit said: 'There have been a number of overnight thefts from gardens this month and officers continue to remain alert for anybody they suspect is intent on committing crime.
'A number of residents have contacted us where they have seen somebody acting suspiciously and, in most cases, we have been able to attend promptly and track down those brought to our attention.
'I would urge members of the public to continue to report this type of incident to us on 101, or 999 if you believe a crime is taking place.
'I am also reminding residents to make sure you lock doors and windows and consider fitting a shed alarm or security light.'
