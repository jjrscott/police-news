Criminals travelling to commit seasonal theft and fraud are being targeted by officers in uniform and plain clothes, in town centres across west Kent.

Throughout December, offenders from outside the county seeking to target local communities and businesses, are likely to encounter road checks and officers patrolling vulnerable areas on foot.

## Cars seized

On **Tuesday 8 December 2020** , checks on motorists driving into **Tonbridge** led to an arrest of a man on suspicion of driving under the influence of drugs and the seizure of four uninsured cars.

In a separate incident, a man in his 30s from Orpington, was arrested in **Tunbridge Wells** on suspicion of multiple retail thefts.

Inspector Lizzie Jones of the Tonbridge and Malling Community Safety Unit said: 'My officers are always alert for suspicious activity in our town centres and throughout this month we will be seeking to deter those intent on committing purse and handbag thefts, shoplifting and fraud.
'A number of criminals from outside the county target towns across west Kent and those that are not deterred by our high visibility road checks should expect to be stopped and searched by teams in plain clothes in Tonbridge, Sevenoaks and Tunbridge Wells.'
