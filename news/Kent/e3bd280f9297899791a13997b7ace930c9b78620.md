Witnesses are sought by officers investigating a report of rape in **Canterbury**.

A teenage girl reported the offence took place **between 5pm and 6pm** on **Tuesday 15 September** in **St Stephen 's Park** and then continued in **St Stephen 's churchyard in Hales Drive**.

A 17-year-old boy from the Canterbury area has since been arrested in connection with the incident and has been released on bail until 3 December.

Investigating officer DC Maria Goodwin said: 'Following a number of enquiries into the assault, it has come to light that there may have been people in the area who may have seen something and can assist with our investigation.

'In particular we are asking people to come forward if they remember being approached by a teenage boy in the churchyard, who was asking for cigarettes.

'We would also like to speak to a man believed to have sat near the victim and the suspect on some logs in St Stephen's Park and who may have information.'
