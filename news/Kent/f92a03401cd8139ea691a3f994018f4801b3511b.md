Residents in Maidstone are warned to be on their guard following a distraction burglary at a pensioner's house.

During the afternoon on Friday 4 September 2020 a man walked up to a property in the Kingswood area and spoke to the occupant, a woman in her 90s.

It is alleged the man offered to cut a hedge and stepped inside the woman's home before leaving with her handbag.

Detective Inspector Richard O'Toole said:

'We would like to take this opportunity to remind residents to be alert to unexpected callers offering to complete repairs or gardening jobs.

'Don't leave your doors and windows open or even unlocked unless you are nearby.

'If you are approached for work, you do not have to accept immediately, ask for their quote in writing and take some time to ask other traders for their quotes too.

'If in doubt about a doorstep caller, ask them to leave and come back at a more convenient time when a family member or friend can be with you.'
