Information is sought after a woman reported being raped in **Gillingham**.

The victim has said she was approached by a man in **Grange Road** , near the junction with **Court Lodge Road** , at around **12.30am** on **Thursday 24 December 2020**. He then raped her in a nearby alleyway.

A 29-year-old man from Gillingham was arrested on suspicion of the offence later that morning and has been released on bail, pending further enquiries.

PC Devon Larnder-King, Kent Police's investigating officer for the case, said: 'The victim of this case is receiving the best possible support and we have progressed several lines of enquiry since this was reported to us.

'We believe there was at least one other person in the area shortly before the offence took place. It is likely they would have been unaware an offence was about to occur, but they may still have important information that can help us. I therefore encourage them to contact us as soon as possible.

'We are additionally keen to hear from anyone else who believes they have information, or privately held CCTV or dash cam footage from the surrounding area, that can assist us.'

Anyone who saw anything suspicious is asked to call Kent Police on **01634 792209** quoting **46/225701/20**.
