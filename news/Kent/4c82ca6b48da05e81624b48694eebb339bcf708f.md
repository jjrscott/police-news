Dashcam footage is sought by officers following a report a lorry was struck by a rock thrown from a bridge above the **M26** motorway.

The vehicle's windscreen was shattered as a result of the incident, which happened at around **2.40pm** on **Wednesday 24 March 2021** , near the junction for Wrotham.

It is alleged objects were thrown as the driver was passing a bridge on the A227, Borough Green Road, which runs directly above the M26.

Patrols attended but were unable to identify any suspects.

## Malicious

Sergeant Sarah Alvey of the Tonbridge and Malling Community Safety Unit said: 'Throwing anything at a moving vehicle is reckless and malicious, and to throw something from a bridge at a moving vehicle could easily kill someone. Fortunately reports of this nature are still rare, but it is important motorists are aware and remain vigilant. 'The driver reported seeing four children on the bridge when the incident happened, and we are working in partnership with local schools to inform and educate pupils of the dangers and penalties. I would also urge parents to ensure their children know the dangers and consequences of throwing objects onto the highway.'

Anyone with dashcam footage or information which may assist the investigation is asked to call Kent Police on **01622 604100** , quoting reference 46/48442/21.
