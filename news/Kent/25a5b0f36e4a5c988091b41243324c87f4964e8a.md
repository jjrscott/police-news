Shoppers in west Kent are being reminded to keep their purses safe following three reported thefts.

At around **2.20pm** on **Sunday 2 August 2020** , a pensioner had a purse stolen from her handbag while in a supermarket at **Quarry Wood, Aylesford**.

A bank card from the purse was later used to withdraw a quantity of cash from an ATM outside the store.

## Shoppers targeted

Two thefts in Tonbridge were also reported on **Tuesday 4 August**.

At around **9.30am** , a woman in her 70s was shopping at a supermarket on **Quarry Hill Road** when her purse was stolen from a bag.

Later that day, another purse was stolen from a shopping trolley in a car park on **Swanmead Way** while the owner was distracted.

Kent Police's District Commander for Tonbridge and Malling, Chief Inspector Rachael Cumberland said: 'I would remind shoppers to be careful when out and about to avoid becoming victim to opportunist thieves.

'Ensure nobody is able to see your PIN when you use a cashpoint. Never leave handbags unattended on top of prams, shopping trolleys, wheelchairs or mobility scooters.

'If you have one, a purse chain can be an effective measure against thieves.'

## Can you help?

Anyone with information about the thefts should contact **01622 604100** quoting reference numbers 2-1072 and 4-0628.

You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously by calling **0800 555111** or using the anonymous online form.
