A drug dealer who used a vulnerable person's **Chatham** home as a base to supply drugs has been jailed.

**Jason Alvaro** of Ordnance Road, Enfield, was sentenced to two years in jail at Maidstone Crown Court on 23 February 2021.

The 19-year-old had admitted one charge of possessing heroin with intent to supply and one charge of possessing crack cocaine with intent to supply.

He was arrested on **28 September 2020** after officers from the County Line and Gangs Team, who were on a routine patrol of the **Maidstone Road** area, learned that a nearby address was being used as a base to supply drugs.

Alvaro, who had travelled to the Medway towns to supply drugs, was then found inside the property, along with 50 wraps of heroin and crack cocaine which were seized.

Cash and a mobile phone were also recovered and Alvaro was arrested.

Investigating officer PC Michael Williams said: 'Alvaro specifically targeted, and exploited, a person who he knew to be vulnerable so that their flat could be used as a base for drug dealing.

'We were on a routine patrol when we became aware of the offending and I'm pleased that our quick actions have removed a drug dealer from the streets.'
