Builders are reminded to be vigilant against thieves following reports of burglaries at construction sites in **Sevenoaks** and **Borough Green**.

Kent Police is also urging residents to help deter criminals by reporting any suspicious behaviour where work is taking place.

The most recent break-ins are alleged to have taken place **between 14** and **15 October 2020** , in **Western Road, Borough Green** , where intruders are reported to have entered two empty properties.

On **Wednesday 14 October, between 7.20pm** and **8.20pm** , a construction site in **Mount Harry Road, Sevenoaks** was also entered after locks were broken to a fence.

## Costly damage

Detective Inspector Richard O'Toole of west Kent CID said: 'No items were reported stolen during these incidents, but businesses will be left counting the cost of damage caused to windows and doors which have been broken and smashed.

'Any would-be thieves are likely to need vehicles to transport stolen items, so if you saw a suspicious car, van or truck in either of these areas we would really like to hear from you. We are also asking people to keep their eyes peeled and if they see any ongoing suspicious activity to call **999**.'

Anyone with information which may assist the investigations is asked to phone Kent Police on **01622 604100** , or Kent Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111, quoting crime references 46/184680/20 and 46/184663/20.

## Security advice

Officers are reminding those working in the construction industry of some simple steps to help keep sites safe and secure.

_Where permitted, good lighting will help illuminate the site and deter intruders._

_CCTV and intruder alarm systems should be considered to protect compounds and offices._

_Display warning notices stating security precautions are in force without providing specific details._

_Ensure everyone on site is aware of site security procedures._

_Encourage everyone on site to mark all their tools and keep a list of all Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) as well as serial numbers and engine numbers._

_Any tools left on site overnight should be stored in security tool sheds, protected by CCTV or intruder alarm systems._

_Beware of the risk of theft from completed or partially completed buildings, of materials such as copper piping._
