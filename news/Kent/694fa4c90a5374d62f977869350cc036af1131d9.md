Shoppers in **Ashford** are being urged to be vigilant after a woman's gold bracelet was reportedly stolen by a bogus charity collector.

The incident happened in the **High Street** , near the junction with Wellesley Road, **shortly after midday on Friday 17 January 2020**.

It was reported that the victim and her husband, who are both in their 70s, were approached by two women described as being in their early 20s who told them they were collecting money for charity.

After making a donation the couple were both hugged twice by the suspects. The victim later realised that her bracelet had gone missing.

## Distraction

Inspector Jason Atkinson of the Ashford Community Safety Unit said:

'Some thieves go to great lengths to steal valuable items from people, including the use of distraction and sleight of hand techniques to target victims when they least expect it.

'The vast majority of charity collectors and street vendors who operate in the town centre are legitimate and have permission to be there, and should be able to show you their licence if you have doubts about their credibility.

'If you are approached by anyone who may be acting suspiciously or attempting to invade your personal space, walk away and notify Kent Police online or by calling 101.'

Witnesses or anyone with information is urged to call the appeal line on 01843 222289 quoting reference 46/11287/20.
