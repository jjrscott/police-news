A clubhouse in Sheerness may lose its licence after Kent Police found it was open and serving alcohol which is against the current Covid-19 restrictions.

**The Saddlebrook clubhouse** , which is part of Saddlebrook Park in **Warden Bay Road, Leysdown** , will now be subject to a full premises licence review hearing.

Licensing officers visited the business on **26 February 2021** where they found a group of people inside drinking alcohol which had been purchased from the venue, which is not permitted under current Coronavirus legislation.

CCTV enquiries also showed that continuous breaches of this nature have taken place over a number of weeks.

An expedited premises licence review was held virtually on 17 March where the licence was suspended, pending a full hearing.
