Two men have been charged with cocaine supply offences after two cars were stopped in **Dartford**.

**Andrew Dean** and **Julian Warrick** , both 30, were detained in the **Pinewood Close** area after Kent Police officers observed two parked vehicles which they suspected to be involved in drug dealing.

Cash, five mobile phones and cocaine with an estimated street value of up to Â£14,000 is said to have been seized following a search of both cars.

Mr Dean, of Iris Drive, Sittingbourne, and Mr Warrick, of Regent Square, Belvedere, have since been charged with conspiring to supply the class A substance.

Mr Warrick was additionally charged with acquiring criminal property - the cash.

Both men appeared at Medway Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 24 March 2021 and, at the hearing, they were each remanded in custody to next appear at Maidstone Crown Court on Wednesday 21 April.
