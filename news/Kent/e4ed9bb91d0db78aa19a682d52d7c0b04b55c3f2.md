A CCTV image has been issued by officers investigating the reported theft of a dog in **Hollingbourne**.

The incident happened in **Upper Street** at around **8.50am** on **Monday 18 January 2021**. It is alleged a man in a white flatbed truck stopped his vehicle and stole a white and tan cocker spaniel that was sitting outside an address.

The truck then left the scene up **Hollingbourne Hill** towards **Bredgar** and **Sittingbourne**.

Police Sergeant Craig Chalmers-Stevens said: 'Our investigators have been pursuing a number of lines of enquiry and are now able to issue a CCTV image that shows a side view of a white truck we would like to trace.
'It has been a week since Daisy was taken and we are urging anybody with information that may help us find her to call our appeal line.
'We would also like to hear from anyone, who has not yet spoken to the police, with CCTV or dashcam footage that shows the truck travelling between Hollingbourne, Bredgar and the Sittingbourne area between 8.30am and 9am on 18 January.'
