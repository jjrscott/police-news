A witness appeal has been issued after Kent Police received a report that money had been stolen from a person who was using a **Tonbridge** cash machine.

The incident happened at around **12.15pm on Friday 19 February 2021** , in **The Pavilion** near the **High Street**.

## Distraction

It is alleged two men approached a pensioner who was using an ATM, and then distracted him by stating the machine was faulty.

The victim then found cash had been stolen while he was talking to the suspects.

On the same day, a 24-year-old man from Stratford, Greater London and a 23-year-old man from Maidstone, were arrested in connection with the incident. They were later bailed to return to the police station on 18 and 19 March, pending further enquiries.

Investigating officer, PC Lucy Gentry of the Chief Constable's Crime Squad said: 'We are appealing for witnesses or anybody with information that may help the investigation to call the appeal line.
'We would also like to hear from anybody who was approached by two men at Tonbridge cashpoints in similar circumstances.'
