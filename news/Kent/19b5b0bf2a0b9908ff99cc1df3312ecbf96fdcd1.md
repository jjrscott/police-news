Ashley Clayton has been jailed

A county line drug dealer has been jailed for more than two years for suppling drugs to **Medway**.

**Ashley Clayton** , 23, of Galleons Drive, Barking, was jailed at Maidstone Crown Court on 9 February 2021 after he admitted one count each of possession with intent to supply crack cocaine and heroin. He was sentenced to two years and eight months.

Officers investigating a county line drug network, known as the Pablo line, executed a warrant at his address on **7 October 2020**.

Following his arrest officers carried out a search of the property along with a second address in Loxford Road, Barking.

They found a mobile phone which contained numerous text messages alluding to drug deals.

There was also evidence which showed that the mobile had been used to help control the supply of crack cocaine and heroin from **London** into Medway.
Clayton was charged with the offences on 8 October.
Investigating officer PC Ben Shove said: 'Clayton was a key connection in this drug network, helping to control it and ensuring the drugs were distributed accordingly.
'I'm glad he has been removed from the streets and I hope his sentence acts as a deterrent to others. Drugs not only affect the lives of the drug user but impacts on families and communities.
'We work hard as a team, and as a force, to disrupt and tackle the supply of drugs coming into Kent and Medway and will continue to do so.'
