Kent Police's Rural Task Force have handed out fines to a group of men for breaching Government Covid-19 regulations.

Officers attended **Melon Lane in Romney Marsh** on **Saturday 26 December 2020** due to concerns about possible hare coursing in the area.

A group of people were seen by officers in a nearby field and attempted to leave the area when police arrived. They were not social distancing or using face coverings.

The group were stopped and twelve men were issued with fixed penalty notices of two hundred pounds each for breaching Government rules to stop the spread of Covid-19.

Kent Police's Assistant Chief Constable Claire Nix said: 'We continue to ask that people follow the guidance, help control the spread of the virus and save lives and are reminding people that they need to take personal responsibility to protect others from harm.

'We will continue to police in the way we have since March - using the 'four E' approach. Engage, Explain, Encourage and Enforce as a last resort.

'In most situations, we resolve breaches without having to issue a fine. Where people refuse to listen and comply or blatantly exploit the regulations with large gatherings - and are putting everyone at risk - we will take robust enforcement action.'
