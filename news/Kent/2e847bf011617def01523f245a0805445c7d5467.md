Kent Police officers investigating an assault in **Ashford** are continuing to appeal for information.

Officers were called to the **South Willesborough area** of the town at **2.15pm** on **Wednesday 9 September 2020** where two teenage boys had been injured. It is believed they had been assaulted shortly before, during a disturbance involving two groups in **parkland near Herbert Road**.

One was taken to a local hospital where he was treated for a hand injury.

The suspects are described as a group of up to eight men of Asian appearance wearing hooded tops. One possibly had a scooter with him.

Officers will be carrying out additional patrols in the area and wish to thank those witnesses who have already spoken to police.
