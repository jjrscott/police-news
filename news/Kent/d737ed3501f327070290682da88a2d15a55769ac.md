Members of the Volunteer Police Cadets have been helping cyclists protect their bikes at a security marking event in **Ashford**.

A total of around 115 bikes were marked during the event at a skate park in **Stanhope** on **Tuesday 20 August 2019**.

Security marking enables bikes to be registered on a national database, making it even harder for thieves to operate.

The event was run by local Police Community Support Officers and supported by the Volunteer Police Cadets Scheme and Kent County Council wardens.

Inspector Jason Atkinson at Kent Police said: 'Our officers worked with the cadets, who are aged between 13 and 17 and who regularly assist in community based projects like this.

'They showed great enthusiasm and were on hand to help mark bikes as well as offer general security advice and guidance on how to keep property safe.

'Having your bike marked not only deters thieves but increased the chances of having stolen or lost property returned to you.'
