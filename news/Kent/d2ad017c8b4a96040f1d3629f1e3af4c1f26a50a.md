Two arrests have been made and drugs seized after proactive work by officers investigating drug dealing in **Folkestone**.

Officers from the town's Local Policing Team were on patrol in **Cheriton Recreation Area** at around **12.15am** on **Saturday 27 February 2021** when they noticed two men acting suspiciously.

The men were stopped and, following a search, officers seized suspected cocaine, cannabis, phones and cash.

A 20-year-old man and a 19-year-old man, both from the Folkestone area, were arrested on suspicion of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply.

The 19-year-old man has since been bailed until Saturday 27 March and the 20-year-old was released after receiving a caution for possession of cannabis.
