Car owners in **Tunbridge Wells** are being warned following recent thefts of catalytic converters.

Since the beginning of **December 2020** five vehicles have been targeted during the hours of darkness in the **Pembury, Hawkenbury** and **Sherwood estate** areas.

District Commander, Chief Inspector Neil Ready, said: 'Our officers regularly patrol these areas and are alert for suspicious vehicles or criminals on foot, however, we are reminding residents to ensure cars are kept as safe as possible whilst we investigate.
'We would advise to owners to contact the car's manufacturer, as some sell clamps and security cages that make catalytic converters more difficult to steal.
'You can also security-mark and register the metal shell of the converter so we can return it to you if it is stolen and recovered.
'As part of our enquiries we also work closely with scrap metal dealers to make it easier to trace sellers of stolen metal and also identify any dealers who operate illegally.'

Further advice on keeping homes, vehicles and valuables as secure as possible throughout the winter is available on the Kent Police website.
