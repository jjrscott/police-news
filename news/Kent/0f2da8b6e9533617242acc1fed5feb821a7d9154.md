CCTV images have now become available of a man who may have important information about a purse theft in **Tunbridge Wells.**

The theft took place in a supermarket on **Linden Park Road** at around **11.30am** on **12 December 2019**.

## Frauds

The victim, a woman in her 80s, was distracted and it is alleged a bank card from the stolen purse was later used to obtain cash and other goods from several town centre shops.

Inspector David Higham of the Tunbridge Wells Community Safety Unit said:

'Officers who have been investigating the theft and frauds are now able to release CCTV images of a man who may be able to assist their enquiries.

'The image is blurred but we are hoping somebody will recognise the person in the photograph.

'While these offences are not common in this town, and our local officers are always alert for suspicious activity, I would remind shoppers to be careful when out and about to avoid becoming victim to opportunist thieves.'

## Advice

Never leave handbags unattended on top of prams, shopping trolleys, wheelchairs or mobility scooters. Always keep them zipped up and where you can see them.

Do not carry large amounts of cash and, if you have one, a purse chain can be an effective measure against thieves.
