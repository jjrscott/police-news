Kent Police was called at around **6pm** on **Wednesday 12 February 2020** to reports a handbag had been grabbed from a woman inside a vehicle in **Wrotham Road**.

The victim got into her car which was parked in the corner of a car park where Zion Place joins Wrotham Road. As she placed her bags on the front passenger seat, a man opened the passenger door, reached in and snatched her handbag from her hands.

The suspect is described as being white, approximately 5ft, 9ins tall, of slim build and wearing dark jeans and a black or navy blue jumper with the hood up.
