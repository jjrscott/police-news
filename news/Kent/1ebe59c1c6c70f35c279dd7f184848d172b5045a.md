CCTV images have been issued by officers investigating allegations staff in a **Tunbridge Wells** shop were subjected to threats and homophobic abuse.

The incident happened at around **10.20am** on **14 March 2021** , after a man and a woman entered a Poundland store in **Grosvenor Road** and attempted to buy a set of knives.

## Abuse and spitting

It is reported that after being asked for identification they became abusive, shouting and swearing at the store's employees.

The man is alleged to have thrown the set of knives at one member of staff and also spat (in his direction) on a screen in front of the checkouts.

Homophobic comments are said to have been made as well as threats to assault the victim.
