Information is being sought by detectives investigating a suspected arson in **Swanley.**

Damage was caused to a house in **Apple Orchard** during a fire which started in the early hours of **Wednesday 11 March 2020**.

The occupants were awoken at around **1.25am** to the sound of a smoke alarm. They discovered the front door was on fire and flames were spreading into the hallway.

The victims managed to exit the property with no serious injuries and the fire was put out by Kent Fire and Rescue Service.

## Possible CCTV clues

A forensic examination of the scene has since determined the cause of the fire to be deliberate.

Officers have carried out house-to-house enquiries and are continuing to appeal for any information which may assist the investigation.

Detective Constable Kate Humpheryes of west Kent CID said: 'We believe the fire was started deliberately, at a time when the occupants were sleeping. It has destroyed the front door and the entire property was also heavily smoke damaged, but clearly this could have potentially been much worse.

'We are very keen to hear from anyone who may have seen anything at all unusual or suspicious and would appeal to nearby residents, who perhaps we have not yet spoken to, to also check any CCTV systems they may have outside their homes.'

## Can you help?

Anyone with information which may assist the investigation, is asked to call the west Kent appeals line on **01622 604100** , quoting reference 46/45780/20.
