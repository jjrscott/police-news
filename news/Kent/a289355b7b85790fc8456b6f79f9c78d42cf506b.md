A suspected robber has been charged with two offences in Medway.

Kent Police was called on **15 July 2020** after a man reported being approached by a person in **Railway Street, Chatham** , at around **1am**.

The suspect was alleged to have threatened the man with a knife and demanded money before the victim was able to walk away and get help from a nearby member of the public. The suspect then left the area without taking anything.

At around **1.50am** another man was approached by a person in **Strood High Street** who was reported to have threatened him with a knife. The suspect is alleged to have taken the victim's phone as well as earphones before he ran away.

Local patrol officers responded to the two reports and at 2.20am a man matching the description of the suspect was arrested in Chatham High Street.

**Harry Law** , 18, of Grebe Way, Maidstone, has been charged with one count of robbery, one count of attempted robbery and one count of possession of a bladed object in a public place.

Mr Law appeared before Medway Magistrates' Court by video link on 16 July 2020 and was recalled to prison for a previous offence. He will appear at Maidstone Crown Court on 13 August.
