CCTV images have been issued of a man officers would like to speak to in connection with shoplifting offences in **Tonbridge.**

Two recent thefts have been reported at the Co-op store in **York Parade** , where high value items including bulk quantities of meat have been stolen.

## Thefts and abuse

On **Tuesday 21 January 2020** a man is said to have filled a basket with a number of items and then left the store without making any attempt to pay.

The same person is reported to have returned two days later, on **Thursday 23 January** , before filling a bag he was carrying with several meat products.

As he left the store the suspect verbally abused a member of staff who had followed and challenged him.
