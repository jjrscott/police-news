Motorists in the Swanley area are being warned following recent thefts of catalytic converters.

Since the beginning of **November 2020** at least six thefts have been reported in **Swanley** and **New Ash Green**.

## Investigation

Detectives are treating the offences as linked and an investigation has currently assisted in the arrest of two suspects.

Chief Inspector Mark Stubberfield of the Sevenoaks Community Safety Unit, said: 'While our officers regularly patrol these area and are alert for suspicious activity, we are taking the opportunity to warn residents to ensure cars are kept as safe as possible whilst we investigate.
'We would advise to owners to contact the car's manufacturer, as some sell clamps and security cages that make catalytic converters more difficult to steal.
'You can also security-mark and register the metal shell of the converter so we can return it to you if it is stolen and recovered.
'As part of our enquiries we also work closely with scrap metal dealers to make it easier to trace sellers of stolen metal and also identify any dealers who operate illegally.'

Further advice includes parking your vehicle in a garage whenever possible or, if you do not have a garage, then park in a busy, well-lit area. If feasible, consider installing good quality CCTV cameras.
