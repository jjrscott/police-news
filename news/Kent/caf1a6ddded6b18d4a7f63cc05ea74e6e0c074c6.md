Car owners in west Kent villages are reminded to remove valuables and check vehicles are secure to deter opportunist thieves.

The advice comes after reports of attempted thefts from cars in the **Swanley** area.

## Cars targeted

On the morning of **Tuesday 16 February 2021** , Kent Police received a report that a car parked in **London Road, West Kingsdown** had been entered and searched. Nothing was stolen from inside.

Two days later, a further car was targeted while parked overnight in **Paddock Close, South Darenth** and locking wheel nuts were stolen.

On **Wednesday 24 February** , officers were contacted after bank cards were said to have been taken from a vehicle parked in **Beech Avenue, Swanley**.

District Commander, Chief Inspector Mark Stubberfield said: 'We suspect opportunist thieves are targeting vehicles in rural villages, during the hours of darkness.
'I would urge owners to remove anything of value overnight and ensure all doors are locked and windows are fully closed.
'If possible park in a garage or a well-lit secure car park and, if you have a satnav, take the time to remove suction marks from your windscreen or dashboard.
'These simple precautions are the best way to ensure the safety of your personal property.'
