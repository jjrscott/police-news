Drug charges have been authorised after Kent Police brought a car travelling on the **M20** to a controlled stop.

At around **7.15pm** on **Friday 26 March 2021** , officers became suspicious of a vehicle which was travelling towards **Ashford**.

Suspecting it may be involved in supplying class A drugs, it was stopped on the slip road for junction 10, leading to the arrest of **Ronaldo Scott** and a 52-year-old woman from Ashford.

Mr Scott, 18, of Bennett Road, Stockwell, London, has since been charged with being concerned in the supply of heroin and crack cocaine, and possessing a knife in a public place.

He appeared at Folkestone Magistrates' Court on Monday 29 March and will remain in custody ahead of another hearing at the same court on Tuesday 6 April.

No charges have been authorised against the woman and she has been released on bail, pending further enquiries, until Friday 23 April.
