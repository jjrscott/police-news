Motorists are being urged to ensure their cars and vans are secure following thefts from vehicles in **Ashford**.

Kent Police was called to the **Kennington** area of the town late on the evening of **Wednesday 14 October 2020** following a series of incidents.

The owners of at least three vehicles reported that items had been stolen after two people were seen trying car door handles.

A 34-year-old man and a 22-year-old woman, both from the Ashford area, were arrested and have since been bailed until Sunday 11 November.

## Advice

PC Jack Ambrose said: 'We would advise car owners in all areas, including Ashford, to make sure their vehicle doors and windows are properly closed and locked at all times.

'It is also a good idea to ensure that no items of value are left in cars when they are unattended, and nothing is on show.

'Parking your car in a well-lit area, or an area covered by CCTV, will also deter thieves.

'Ensuring your home is also locked and that no windows are open will meanwhile reduce the chances of anyone stealing car keys from within your property.'
