Julian Muca, pictured, has been jailed

A driver caught with £180,000 worth of cannabis in his van when he was stopped by Kent Police has been jailed.

Officers uncovered twelve vacuum-packed bags of the Class B drug when they stopped **Julian Muca** , 25, near **Ashford**.

Muca, of no fixed address, has since admitted possession of cannabis with intent to supply and was jailed for fifteen months at Canterbury Crown Court on Tuesday 1 December 2020.

## Stopped

Officers from Tactical Operations spotted the Ford Transit between Junctions Eight and Nine of the **M20** on the afternoon of **Wednesday 14 October**.

The vehicle had been linked to drug dealing in the area and was stopped and searched in **Chart Road** after it exited the motorway.

Each of the twelve bags found inside contained a kilogram of cannabis, giving each bag a street value of around £15,000.

Muca declined to give any information about where the drugs had come from or where they were being transported to.

## Disrupt

PC Harry Russell, Kent Police's investigating officer, said: 'Good work from our officers on the day of Muca's arrest has seen a large amount of an illegal drug removed from circulation.

'The money that would have been made from the sale of these drugs to users in Kent would have benefited a criminal enterprise and led to more crime in the future.

'Kent Police is determined to shut down and disrupt the activities of drugs networks and, as this case shows, jail sentences await those who get involved.'
