Tyler McDermott

A drug dealer found with more than Â£500 worth of illegal substances has been jailed.

**Tyler McDermott** , 21, was arrested after attending Margate Police Station in relation to an unrelated incident on **Thursday 24 October 2019**.

A search of his vehicle uncovered ketamine, cocaine and MDMA, some of which was hidden in a plastic egg in his van.

Analysis of his phone found messages dating back at least three months arranging drug deals with users.

McDermott, of **Telham Avenue** , **Ramsgate** , admitted two counts of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply and one count of possessing class B drugs with intent to supply when he appeared before Canterbury Crown Court on Monday 7 December 2020.

He was jailed for two-and-a-half years at the same court on Monday 1 February 2021.

Detective Sergeant Simon Hiscock of Kent Police said:

'People who choose to deal drugs to vulnerable people in our community need to know that their activities will lead them to prison.

'The sentence handed down in this case shows that the courts take such offending seriously and I hope it sends out a warning to anyone tempted to get involved in drug dealing.'

Some of the drugs were found hidden inside a plastic egg
