Kent Police's Serious Collision Investigation Unit is appealing for witnesses after a fatal incident near **Ashford**.

Officers were called on the evening of **Tuesday 15 December 2020** to a report a man in his 50s had suffered injuries in an earlier collision.

It is believed the man was a passenger in an articulated lorry and had got out to assist while the vehicle manoeuvred near a railway bridge in **Cheeseman's Green Lane, Sevington** between **7pm** and **8.30pm** that evening.

Officers believe the lorry collided with the man before the driver and the man continued their journey. The extent of the man's injuries then became apparent and emergency services were called. The man later died from his injuries.

## Can you help?

The vehicle involved is described as a white articulated lorry with blue lettering on the side.

A 28-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of causing death by careless driving and has been released under investigation.

Anyone who saw the lorry in the area on the evening, or who has CCTV or dashcam footage which may assist the investigation, is urged to call the Serious Collision Investigation Unit on **01622 798538** or email sciu.td@kent.police.uk quoting reference HW/DH/111/20.
