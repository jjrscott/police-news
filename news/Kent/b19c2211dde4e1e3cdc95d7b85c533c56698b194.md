Residents in **Headcorn** are reminded to keep their bank cards safe following a report of a robbery outside a supermarket.

The incident happened at around **10.45am** on **Wednesday 17 February 2021** next to a Sainsburys Local store in the **High Street**.

It is alleged a man approached a woman in her 70s while she was using a cash machine, reached over her shoulder and stole her bank card.

## Cash stolen

The victim later found a quantity of cash had been taken from her bank account.

The man is described as being white, five feet and six inches tall and dressed in black clothing. He was also wearing a black face mask.

Inspector Stephen Kent of the Maidstone Community Safety Unit said: 'While this type of offence is not a common occurrence in the villages in this area, I would remind shoppers to be careful when out and about to avoid becoming victim to opportunist thieves.
'Don't carry large amounts of cash and, when you use a bank or credit card, ensure nobody can see you enter the PIN.
'If you discover cards have been stolen, contact your bank or building society immediately so that they can be blocked.'
