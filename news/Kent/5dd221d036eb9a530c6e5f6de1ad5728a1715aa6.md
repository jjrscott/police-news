Two people were given warnings for drugs and 28 were searched as part of a multi-agency operation at **Dartford** train station.

Officers from Dartford's Community Policing Team worked with the British Transport Police and the Metropolitan Police on **Friday 5 February 2021**. Police Dog Max assisted and a metal detector arch was also used.

The operation was part of a joint approach to help deter serious violent crime through high visibility patrolling and during the evening officers stopped and searched 28 people. The people searched were chosen after PD Max indicated towards them.

Of those stopped two people were found in possession of cannabis and were given penalty notices.

Community Safety Unit Inspector Sarah Rivett said:

'Activity like this helps us gather intelligence and demonstrates our commitment to protecting the public from criminal activity.

'Due to the current national lockdown we were not able to stop and search the amount of people we usually would during an operation like this, but it is still important to show the local community that we are continuing to tackle criminality as we always have and that we are there to protect the wider public.'
