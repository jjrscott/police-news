Seven years' imprisonment has been imposed upon a man who struck a person in the head with a screwdriver.

**Nicholas Barrs** committed the assault against a motorist while they sat inside a parked car in **Gillingham** in May 2020.

The 38-year-old, of Balmoral Road, Gillingham, admitted attempting to cause grievous bodily harm and possessing an offensive weapon in a public place. He was sentenced at Maidstone Crown Court on Wednesday 31 March 2021.

At around **6.50pm** on 21 **May 2020** the victim, a man in his 20s, parked in **Balmoral Road** to meet with a friend.

As they were sitting inside the vehicle, CCTV captured Barrs walking past the driver's door before going to the back of the vehicle. He then reached behind his back to retrieve an item from the waistband of his trousers.

With the screwdriver in hand, he opened the driver's door, struck at the victim five times and connected twice.

The assault left the victim, who was known to Barrs, with a cut below his right eye socket and another to his forehead.

Kent Police officers arrested Barrs at his home later that evening and received authority to charge while he was in custody. He has been held on remand since.

Detective Constable Michael Rake, Kent Police's investigating officer for the case, said: 'Barrs subjected the victim of this case to a senseless and savage attack.

'Such actions show Barrs to be exceptionally violent and I am pleased that a custodial sentence has been imposed.

'Barrs' imprisonment is doubtlessly a good result for the community and I hope it provides the victim with a degree of closure.'
