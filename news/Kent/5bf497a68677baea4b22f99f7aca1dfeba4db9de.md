CCTV images

CCTV images of three men who may have information on a burglary in **Ashford** have been released by Kent Police.

Investigating officers believe each of the pictured men will have important information that can help them investigate the incident, which took place at an address in **Beaver Lane** between **2pm** and **2.30pm** on **Friday** **11 September 2020**.

## Suspects claim to be from waterboard

A gold ring and a pickaxe is reported to have been taken from the address after two people, claiming to be from the waterboard, knocked on the victim's conservatory window and told her repair work was taking place nearby.

During the conversation, it is believed the items were stolen from inside her home.

### Witnesses and dash cam

Investigators have carried out house-to-house enquiries and reviewed available CCTV. As a result of these enquiries, they believe all three people left the scene in a white Ford Focus.

In addition to identifying the men in the images, officers are also keen to obtain any dash cam footage that was recorded by motorists in the Beaver Lane area between 1.45pm and 2.15pm on Friday 11 September 2020.

Anyone who recognises the men in the images is asked to call Kent Police on 01843 222289 quoting 46/163464/20.
