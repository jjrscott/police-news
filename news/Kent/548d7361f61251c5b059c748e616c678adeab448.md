Cyclists are reminded to take care when leaving their bike unattended in **Maidstone**.

The warning comes after two reported thefts in the town centre on **Monday 3 August 2020**.

## Bikes targeted

At **9am** , a mountain bike was left locked in the **High Street** and, when the owner returned a short time later, it had been stolen along with the lock.

A second cycle theft was reported after it was targeted in **Week Street** between **12.30pm** and **1.20pm** while the owner went into a shop.

Inspector Mark Hedges of Maidstone's Community Safety Unit said: 'Cycles can be easy targets for thieves but you can take some simple steps to protect your property.

`Get a good lock and attach your bike and any removable parts such as the wheels to something secure, even if you are only leaving it for a few minutes.

'Don't forget to take any light fittings or expensive accessories with you.

'Cyclists should avoid leaving their bike in an isolated place and use locations where a potential thief can be seen by witnesses or on CCTV.'

Further crime prevention advice is available on our website.
