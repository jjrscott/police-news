Two suspected burglars have been charged in connection with the theft of thousands of pounds of electrical goods from shops in **Tunbridge Wells** and **Ashford**.

Laptops, speakers and smart watches were among hundreds of items reported stolen from two John Lewis stores, during a series of break-ins between **15 September 2020** and **28 January 2021.**

During this period, detectives from the Chief Constable's Crime Squad have been investigating four burglaries and an attempted burglary. The offences are alleged to have been carried out at branches in **Kingstanding Way, Tunbridge Wells** and in **Fougeres Way, Ashford**. Goods with a total value of around Â£100,000 were reportedly stolen.
