Residents are reminded to be vigilant against door-step fraudsters, after a spate of recent incidents in **Sevenoaks**.

It is reported that people posing as council workers have targeted elderly people in three different streets in the town.

On **15 January 2020** , a woman in her 80s in **Granville Road** received a phone call from a man claiming to be from Sevenoaks Council. He explained that repairs were needed on the drains outside her home.

## Stolen

Later that day a man arrived and asked for bank card details so he could pay a deposit for the works. No work was carried out and a quantity of money was later reported stolen.

Over the next two days, a further two incidents were reported in a road off **St John 's Hill** and **Witches Lane.**

Inspector Mark Stubberfield, of the Sevenoaks Community Safety Unit, said: 'It is highly likely these crimes are being committed by the same offenders who target the vulnerable.

'Whilst our dedicated fraud teams work hard to detect this sort of crime we must be sure residents are aware of how they operate. A council worker would never ask for bank card details or money over the phone or at the door.

'If you are approached by someone you believe is a scammer, do not give out any details. If they are on the phone, end the call immediately and wait at least five minutes before using your telephone in order to clear your line from the scammer, then call the police.

'If you are suspicious of someone who has knocked at your door do not open it and call 999.'

If you have information which may help with enquiries into these particular crimes please call **01622 604100** quoting 46/10217/20.

For advice on how to prevent becoming a victim of these type of offences contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 or visit www.actionfraud.police.uk/report_fraud.

To report suspicious activity call **101** or **999** if there is a crime in progress. You can also call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111 or use the online form.
