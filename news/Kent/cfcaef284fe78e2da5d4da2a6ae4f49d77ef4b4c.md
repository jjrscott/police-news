CCTV images have been released after a woman was threatened with weapons at her **Maidstone** home.

At around **2.45pm** on **Sunday 7 June 2020** , a woman was inside her house in **Lancashire Road, Shepway** when three men appeared at her open front door.

## Weapons

It is alleged at least one of the men was holding a weapon and, as they tried to enter, the victim attempted to close the door.

A relative who was also at the victim's house came to her assistance and the three men ran off.

Investigating officer, Police Constable Alex Peacock said: 'We are issuing CCTV images of three men who may be able to assist us with our enquiries.

'While the image is blurred we are hoping somebody who recognises them will contact us.'
