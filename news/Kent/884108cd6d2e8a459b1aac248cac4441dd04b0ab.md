It is reported a man used abusive language during an altercation at a McDonald's drive-through in **Hart Street**.

The incident happened at around **11.30pm** on **Friday 12 March 2021**.

## Argument and abuse

The man and woman were in different vehicles and became involved in a traffic dispute as they were queueing to be served.

The suspect, who was a passenger in a red Vauxhall Corsa, is alleged to have got out of the vehicle to confront the victim in her black Audi, before using racist language towards her and her children.

A man known to the victim then challenged him, before staff intervened and both parties went their separate ways.
