A drug dealer is starting a prison sentence after he was arrested with cocaine by officers from the **Tunbridge Wells** Community Policing Team.

On **26 April 2020** , officers on patrol saw a Vauxhall Corsa parked on **London Road** and they stopped to talk to the driver, **Daniel Aldred**.

While speaking to him, they saw a plastic bag in the footwell of the vehicle that they suspected contained Class A drugs.

## Cocaine seized

It was seized and found to contain 27.83 grams of cocaine. A mobile phone was also located that contained text messages relating to the supply of drugs.

Aldred, of Barden Road, Bidborough, was arrested and, when a room he had been using at a nearby hotel was searched, the officers found a wrap of cocaine and Â£1,685 in cash.

He was later charged with possessing cocaine with intent to supply and possession of criminal property, namely the cash seized.

## Guilty

Aldred, aged 28, pleaded guilty at Maidstone Crown Court and on Thursday 17 December he was sentenced to two years and five months in prison.

Kent Police's District Commander for Tunbridge Wells, Chief Inspector Neil Ready said: 'This man was making a significant amount of money supplying cocaine to Tunbridge Wells drug users.
'The drugs trade brings misery to our communities and I am pleased he is now starting a prison sentence.
'Our proactive officers will continue to target these offenders and we will seek to confiscate any cash or other property acquired through their criminal activities.'
