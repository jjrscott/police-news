A suspected drug dealer has been charged after a proactive arrest by officers from the **Tunbridge Wells** Community Policing Team.

At around **4.30pm** on **Monday 25 January 2021** , a police patrol in **London Road** saw a Ford Fiesta they suspected was being used in the supply of controlled drugs, and followed it to **The Goodwins**.

## Arrest

The driver was seen to briefly leave the vehicle and enter an address, and on his return he was arrested.

When the suspect was searched at Tonbridge Police Station the officers found thirteen cocaine deals. They also seized his mobile phone and a later search of a house in The Goodwins found ten further bags of cocaine.

## Charged

**Alesander Martinez** of Marconi Road, Chelmsford, Essex was later charged with possessing cocaine with intent to supply and driving without insurance.

Mr Martinez, aged 31, appeared before Medway Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 26 January, where he was bailed to a hearing at Maidstone Crown Court on a date to be confirmed.
