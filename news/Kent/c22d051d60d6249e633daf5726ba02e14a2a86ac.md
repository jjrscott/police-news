## Security reminder to residents

Officers are advising residents to ensure doors and windows are kept secured to help reduce the risk of becoming a victim of burglary.

District Commander for Ashford, Folkestone and Hythe, Chief Inspector Nick Sparkes said: 'During the summer, burglars tend to target any windows which are left open in the warmer weather, so secure windows and doors of any rooms you are not present in.

'Also check the space outside your windows, and remove any bins and garden furniture nearby which could be used to reach them.

'Burglars can be opportunistic and so we want to remind residents not to give them any chances to steal your belongings.'
