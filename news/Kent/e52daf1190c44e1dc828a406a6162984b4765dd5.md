Officers investigating a robbery in **Herne Bay** have released images of a man who may be able to assist their enquiries.

Kent Police was called at approximately **8pm** on **Tuesday 4 August 2020** to a report that cigarettes had been stolen from a supermarket in **Sea Street** and an employee had been threatened with a knife. No injuries were reported.

Officers have since been carrying out enquiries and are now releasing images of a man who they hope people will recognise by his clothing.

Residents with private CCTV or vehicle dashcam in the area are also asked to check their recordings to see if anything has been captured which would assist officers' enquiries.
