Mehdi Aitsilarbi, pictured, has been jailed.

A teenager from London who sold class A drugs in **Canterbury** for a county line network has been sentenced.

**Mehdi Aitsilarbi** , 19, was seen dealing substances later found to be cocaine and heroin in the city in **January 2020**.

Following an operation by the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, Aitsilarbi admitted supplying class A drugs at Canterbury Crown Court and was sentenced to four years in a young offenders' institution on Tuesday 19 January 2021.

## Operation

Aitsilarbi was observed selling wraps of suspected drugs in the **Kirby's Lane** area of Canterbury on **14** , **16** and **17 January 2020**.

The wraps were later found to contain heroin and cocaine and text messages ascertained that Aitsilarbi was working for the 'Rocky' county line.

County lines are the names given to drug dealing where organised criminal groups use phone lines to move and supply drugs, usually from cities into smaller towns and rural areas.

## Arrest

Kent Police officers attended Aitsilarbi's home off Bow Common Lane in **Bow, east London** on **Tuesday 25 August** and he was arrested.

Detective Constable Chris Weatherstone said: 'Kent Police is committed to shutting down groups who try to bring drugs into the county to sell to vulnerable people in our communities.

'The drugs these criminal groups supply invariably lead to further offending and anti-social behaviour and I am pleased another member of one such network has been taken off the streets.'
