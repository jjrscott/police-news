Officers investigating the assault of a motorist in **Sandwich** are appealing for further witnesses.

On **Friday 9 October 2020** a white Range Rover and a blue Fiat Panda were being driven along the **A256** , **Sandwich Bypass** , at around **5.15pm** when both vehicles came to a stop at the point where the road narrows from two lanes to one.

After the cars had come to a standstill the driver of the Fiat Panda reported being assaulted. He was kicked in the hip and punched twice in the face before the white Range Rover was driven away from the area.

Since this incident, officers have reviewed available video footage and spoken to both drivers along with a witness. However it is believed there may be other motorists who drove past the incident on that day with information vital to their enquiries.
