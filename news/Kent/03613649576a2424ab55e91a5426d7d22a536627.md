CCTV images have been issued by officers investigating a report of an attempted burglary at a **Maidstone** business.

At around **1.35am** on **22 November 2020,** a shop on **Mote Road** was targeted by a group of men. They are alleged to have gained entry to the rear yard of the premises intending to break-in.

## Climbed wall

After they were disturbed by a neighbour it is reported the men left the scene by climbing over a wall into **Kingsley Road** , before making their way towards **Brunswick Street East**.

Officers have been investigating the incident and are now able to issue CCTV images of some people they believe could help with their enquiries.

Investigating officer, PC Matt Thomas of Maidstone CID said: 'While their facial features are obscured by coat hoods and face masks, we are hoping that somebody who knows the men or recalls seeing them at around the time of the incident wearing similar clothing, calls the appeal line.'
