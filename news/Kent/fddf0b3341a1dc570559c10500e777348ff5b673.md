CCTV images have been issued as part of an investigation into violent disturbances in and around the **New Ash Green** area.

Officers are continuing to appeal for information following a series of linked incidents last month, which left a man suffering multiple injuries.

Kent Police was initially called at **3.50pm,** on **Wednesday 30 December 2020** , to reports of fighting involving a large number of people, at a car park and rugby playing field off **Punch Croft**.

Those involved were said to have been carrying weapons including baseball bats.

## Assault and arrests

The occupants of two cars, also alleged to have been at this location, are then believed to have been involved in a separate incident a short distance away in **Hartley.**

An 18-year-old man was assaulted at the junction of **Church Road** and **Gorsewood Road**.

He was taken by ambulance crews to a London hospital suffering serious leg injuries.

A media appeal was issued shortly after the disturbances and since then three men, aged 19, and a 14-year-old boy, have been arrested in connection with assault and public order offences.

## Can you help?

Detectives are now renewing the appeal with images of a further four people, who they believe may have important information.

Anyone who recognises them is urged to contact Kent Police on **01622 604100** , quoting reference 46/228823/20.

You can also contact Kent Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or by using the online form.
