Andy Opoku has been jailed.

A cyclist who attempted to steal a man's bag in Gillingham has been jailed.

**Andy Opoku** , of Railway Street, Gillingham, admitted attempted robbery and was sentenced at Maidstone Crown Court on 15 February 2021 to two years and four months' imprisonment.

The 35-year-old was arrested on **3 August 2020** following a report that a man on a bike had attempted to steal a bag from a man in **East Street** at **3.49pm**.

The victim had been walking down the street when Opoku approached him on a bike and demanded he hand over his belongings and threatened to use violence. The victim managed to run away from Opoku and alerted Kent Police.

As part of the investigation CCTV was reviewed and a man matching the description of the suspect was identified.

Officers also attended the area later that day and saw Opoku riding a bike in West Street. He was arrested in connection with the incident and charged the following day.
Investigating officer Detective Constable Rebecca Veares said: 'Opoku initially denied being involved in his incident and claimed he was being set up, however our enquiries clearly linked him to the offence and he later admitted the charge which was put to him.
'He caused fear and stress to the victim and it's quite right that he has been sentenced accordingly.'
