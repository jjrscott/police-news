Detectives are appealing for information following suspected arsons to two vehicles parked in the **Maidstone** area.

Police were called to a location in **Tonbridge Road, Barming** at **11.15pm** on **Tuesday 19 May 2020,** where a car was destroyed and another damaged.

Kent Fire and Rescue Service extinguished both fires, which happened close to a junction for Glebe Lane.

## Report anything suspicious

Maidstone Chief Inspector, Ray Quiller, said: 'Thankfully no one has been injured; however, any fire started deliberately can easily endanger lives and therefore it is very important we identify anyone who may have been involved.

'This may be someone you know, who has been staying out late or who perhaps has come home smelling of petrol or smoke and is behaving differently.

'We are continuing to follow a number of enquiries, including reviewing any potential CCTV opportunities and conducting house-to-house enquiries. I would urge residents to remain vigilant and report anything suspicious straight away.'

If you can help call the west Kent appeals line on **01622 604100** , quoting reference 46/84839/20.

Two men, aged 22 and 32, both from Maidstone, were arrested on suspicion of arson at 3.45pm on Wednesday 20 May.
