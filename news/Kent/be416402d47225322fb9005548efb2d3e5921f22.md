Elderly residents are being warned to make sure doorstep callers are genuine following a burglary in **Whitstable**.

It was reported that, at around **6.40pm** on **Friday 11 December 2020** , a woman walked into a property in **Manor Road, Tankerton** claiming to be a carer.

She left after she was challenged to show ID by the resident. It is believed the same woman had called previously, on **Wednesday** **7 October** , when medication was taken from the property.

## Challenge

The woman was described as aged in her twenties, around five feet, four inches tall, of slim build and with brown hair. She wore dark blue clothing.

Canterbury Community Safety Inspector Guy Thompson said: 'The resident was right to challenge the unknown woman when he found her in his home and we ask all residents to make sure the people who visit them are genuine.

'Officers are making enquiries into the incident and anyone who has information regarding the burglary should call Kent Police on 01843 222289 quoting 46/219242/20.'
