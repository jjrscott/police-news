Three suspected thieves have been arrested after officers found copper and lead in a vehicle in **Ramsgate**.

Kent Police was called at around **4.20am** on **Tuesday 9 February 2021** to **Broad Street** in **Ramsgate** , following a report of men behaving suspiciously on the roof of a building.

Officers attended the scene and as part of their enquiries, found a van in **Chatham Place** , which had become unable to move due to the icy conditions.

A quantity of copper piping and lead was recovered and three men were arrested on suspicion of theft.

A 43-year-old man from Broadstairs, a 21-year-old man of no fixed address and a 33-year-old man from London have been released on bail until 4 March while enquiries are ongoing.
