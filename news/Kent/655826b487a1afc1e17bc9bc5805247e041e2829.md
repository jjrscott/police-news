Witnesses are sought to a fatal collision near **Sandwich.**

A blue motorcycle and a white Ford Transit van, travelling on the **A256 Sandwich Road** , were involved in a collision at **11.40am** on **Wednesday 22 July 2020.**

The collision took place on the Thanet-bound carriageway.

The rider of the motorcycle, a man in his 40s, was confirmed deceased at the scene and two other men received treatment at a local hospital.

Officers from the Serious Collision Investigation Unit (SCIU) are appealing for witnesses and would like to speak to a van driver who was reported to have left a layby and joined the Sandwich-bound carriageway at a similar time to the collision. It is believed the driver will have important information which could assist with enquiries.

## Can you help?

Witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage, of either the collision or the vehicles just before the incident, should call the SCIU appeal line on **01622 798538** or email sciu.td@kent.pnn.police.uk quoting HW/LB/63/20.
