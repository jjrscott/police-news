William Parker

An offender who stabbed a man before assaulting an officer in **Chatham** has been jailed for more than three years.

On **Thursday 14 May 2020** officers were called to a property in **Gordon Road** following an allegation that **William Parker** had stabbed a man he knew in the neck and shoulder.

On attendance, Parker, 43, was found to be extremely aggressive and his victim had left the scene.

Parker was seen by officers picking up a drill and refused to let police into his home.

Officers were forced to break the downstairs window and, once inside, a constable was punched in the head as he tried to detain him. Parker was tasered by officers due to his level of aggression.

Following his arrest Parker was also accused of stabbing his victim in the hand two days before. He was charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent and assault by beating of an emergency worker.

He pleaded guilty to the offences and was sentenced to three years and four months in prison at Maidstone Crown Court on 30 September.

Investigating officer, PC Helen Wilkes, said: 'Parker has demonstrated that he's a very violent man and thankfully is now in prison.

'Kent Police will not tolerate those who carry knives or use them to cause harm to others.

'Unpredictable and challenging situations like this one can arise but no officer should ever accept being abused or assaulted. Kent Police will continue to pursue anyone who commits violent offences.'
