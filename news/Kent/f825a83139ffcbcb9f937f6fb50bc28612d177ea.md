On the morning of **Thursday 21 January 2021** , officers from Thanet's Community Policing Team attended a property in **Northdown Road**.

In the basement of the property, police found around 20 cannabis plants as well as a quantity of cannabis and growing equipment.

## Investigation launched

The drugs and equipment have been seized and an investigation into the site is ongoing.

Sergeant Sean Scarsbrook, of Thanet Community Policing Team, said:

'The sale of this cannabis would have benefited criminals and I am pleased our officers have uncovered the site and seized these illegal drugs.
