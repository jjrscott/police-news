Two charges have been authorised after Kent Police received a report that a man had been seen attempting to steal from parked cars in **Gravesend**.

At around **12.20am** on **Monday 19 October 2020** , a suspicious man is said to have entered, and rummaged through, two cars which had been parked in **Milton Hall Road**.

No items were stolen but, following a review of the circumstances, officers identified Liam Lunt as a suspect.

The 21-year-old, of Windmill Street, Gravesend, was arrested on suspicion of the offence on Wednesday 13 January and later charged with two counts of vehicle interference.

He was remanded in custody to attend Medway Magistrates' Court on Thursday 14 January. At the hearing, he was released on bail and will attend the same court on Friday 29 January.
