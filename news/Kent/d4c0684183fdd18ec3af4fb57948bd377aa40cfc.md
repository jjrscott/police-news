CCTV images have been issued by officers investigating the theft and attempted theft of high value computer ink cartridges from a supermarket in **Swanley**.

At around **4.15pm** on **Monday 11 May 2020** , two men were stopped by security staff as they tried to leave Asda, in **London Road** , with stock valued at more than £1,000.

It is reported that no attempts were made to pay and although the items were recovered, the suspects managed to leave the scene.

## Further offence

Officers are linking the incident to a previous alleged theft at the same shop on **12 January 2020**.

On this occasion a staff member was assaulted after challenging a man and a woman as they were exiting with a trolley.

The suspects left with ink cartridges valued at more than £800.

It is believed the person pictured may have important information which can assist police with their enquiries.
