A **Folkestone** resident has been issued with a £400 fine after hosting groups of people at his flat twice in less than two weeks.

Kent Police officers first attended the property near **Military Road** at **11.25pm** on **Friday 20 November 2020** and dispersed around 20 people from the property.

The resident of the flat was issued with a Fixed Penalty Notice for £200 for his first breach of Government rules relating to coronavirus.

Officers returned to the address at **12.20am** on **Tuesday 1 December** following a report of another noisy gathering.

## Second breach

Around 10 people were inside the property and the group were dispersed. For the second breach, the resident was this time issued with a £400 fine.

Assistant Chief Constable Claire Nix said: 'Kent Police continues to respond to the virus in the same way we have since March, using enforcement only as a last resort.

'Blatant and repeated breaches of the rules in this way will result in our officers issuing fixed penalty notices to those responsible.

'The virus is still a huge threat to our communities and I would encourage everyone to adhere to the national restrictions to keep themselves and others safe.'
