Officers are reminding residents not to leave valuables in their cars overnight following a number of incidents in **Dartford** where items have been stolen.

Between **New Year 's Eve** and **Monday 4 January 2021** , Kent Police has received seven reports of vehicles being broken into, with items taken on most occasions.

The vehicles were parked in **Princes Road** , **Ashen Drive** , **St Ronan 's View**, **Knole Road** , **Beacon Drive** , **Page Close** in **Bean** and **Balmoral Road**.

The incident in Balmoral Road took place at around **3am** on 4 January and a witness has reported seeing a young white man looking into cars.

At the time, he was wearing a black puffer jacket, grey jogging bottoms, neon pink gloves, a woollen hat and cream shoes.

Inspector Sarah Rivett from Dartford's Community Safety Unit said: 'These incidents have been carried out at random and by an opportunistic thief.

'I would encourage people to ensure their vehicles are locked and to make sure no valuables are left inside their cars overnight. We will continue to patrol these areas to deter any further incidents. Anyone with information or who is concerned their vehicles have been targeted should report offences to Kent Police.'
