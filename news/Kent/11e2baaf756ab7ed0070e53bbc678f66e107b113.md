Detectives investigating two reports of fraud in the **Canterbury** area are warning residents to be wary of any unexpected deliveries.

On **Friday 11 December 2020** a parcel arrived at a property in **Burgess Road, Aylesham** at around **11am**. The victim wasn't expecting one and when he opened the box he found a mobile phone inside.

He called the mobile provider who said a phone had been ordered in his name with his date of birth and address. Suspiciously, the bank details used to pay for the phone were different to his own.

A few moments later the victim had a knock at his door and a man, claiming to be from a delivery company, said the item was delivered by mistake and he needed it back.

The victim was suspicious of this and refused to hand the parcel over. The suspect is said to have run away from the area and the victim reported the matter to Kent Police.

## Warning

It follows a similar incident which took place in **Milner Crescent, Aylesham** at around **4pm** on **Thursday 3 December 2020**. Despite the victim querying why the parcel had to be returned, it was reportedly snatched from her hands on the doorstep. Enquiries made have established the item inside the parcel was a mobile phone.

DC Sophie West from Kent Police's Chief Constable's Crime Squad said: 'We are treating these incidents as linked for the time being and urging local residents to be wary of any unexpected deliveries and certainly anyone claiming to be a courier asking for items back.

'Criminals will use many different tactics to defraud innocent people and can be very persuasive, so it is important that whilst investigating such incidents we also remind everyone of the steps they can take to stay safe from fraudsters.

'If in any doubt, don't answer the door and report the incident to Kent Police or Action Fraud straight away.'

## Appeal

Anyone with information concerning the two incidents in Aylesham is asked to call **01843 222289** quoting reference 46/219013/20 for Burgess Road and 46/214881/20 for Milner Crescent.
