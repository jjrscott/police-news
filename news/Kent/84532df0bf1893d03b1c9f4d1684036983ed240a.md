Members of the public are being asked to check if they recognise any of the items pictured after three men were arrested in connection with theft offences in **Maidstone.**

The men were detained on **21 September 2020,** as part of an investigation into a series of thefts from motor vehicles in the **Shepway** area.

Enquires led to the discovery of the suspicious items at a property in **Penfold Close** and officers are now keen to identity their rightful owners.

## Items recovered

Possessions recovered include a pressure washer, power tools, a toolbox, and a microphone and stand inside a case bearing the words 'Ashton'.

More than Â£1,000 in cash was also seized under the Proceeds of Crime Act.

As well as returning them to potential victims, police are hopeful that identification will also assist with enquiries into any offences committed.

Anyone who recognises any of these the items or has any information should call the west Kent appeals line on **01622 604100** , quoting reference 46/169023/20.

If you wish to remain anonymous, call Kent Crimestoppers on 0800 555111 or complete the online form.

The suspects currently remain on bail, pending further enquiries.
