A CCTV image has been released of a person police would like to speak to following allegations security staff at a supermarket in **Larkfield** were racially abused.

On **8 February 2020** a group of three people entered Tesco in Lunsford Park and were challenged by staff, amid suspicions one of them was attempting to steal.

As the group was leaving the shop the suspect is reported to have caused criminal damage to a light and then shouted racial abuse at two members of staff.

Officers are now issuing an image of a man who they believe can assist their enquiries.
