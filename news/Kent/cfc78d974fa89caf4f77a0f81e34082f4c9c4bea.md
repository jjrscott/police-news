Motorcyclists in the **Maidstone** area are being reminded to ride responsibly and lawfully, or risk having their bikes seized.

Maidstone officers together with Kent Police's Rural Task Force are targeting nuisance motorbikes that cause a danger to pedestrians and horse riders in rural areas.

## Seized

On **2 May 2020** , officers seized two uninsured off-road bikes and a quad bike on **Boxley Road, Boxley**.

Two days later they also issued section 59 warnings to two motorcyclists on **Hill Road, Wouldham** and, on **Monday 18 May** , a rider was stopped in a field near **Lidsing** and received a formal warning.

District Commander for Maidstone, Chief Inspector Ray Quiller said: 'Our officers are responding to concerns raised about off-road motorbikes that present a potential danger to others and affect the quality of life for the local community.

'A section 59 warning gives us the power to seize and in some cases destroy a vehicle, if it has been driven uninsured or where the rider is causing a nuisance.

'My patrols will continue to carry out this type of operation in rural areas around Maidstone and I would encourage residents to report any incidents to us on 101. This allows us to build a picture of the problem and deploy our patrols effectively.'
