A burglar has been jailed for six years for breaking into a house near **Canterbury** and stealing a drone.

**Jason Pitt** , 47, was caught on CCTV approaching the property during the afternoon of **Wednesday 20 January 2021**.

Following an investigation by Kent Police's Chief Constable's Crime Squad, he was identified from the footage and arrested six days later.

Pitt, of no fixed address, admitted burglary at Canterbury Crown Court on Monday 1 March and was jailed for six years the following day.

## Offence

The victims left their home in **Sturry** on the morning of the offence and returned in the afternoon to find a rear window had been smashed.

Items in a room at the house had been disturbed and a drone had been stolen.

CCTV showed Pitt walking around the garden of the property before leaving with a bag in his hands.

He was on licence from prison at the time of the offence and officers from Kent Police identified him from the CCTV images.

## Advice

Detective Constable Kirsty Gee, Kent Police's investigating officer, said: 'I am very pleased that the speed and efficiency of our investigation saw this burglar identified and arrested within a week of the offence.

'The case shows the value in having domestic CCTV and security systems which can deter burglars and help bring them to justice following offences such as this.

'The evidence against Pitt left him no option but to plead guilty and the sentence will mean he is unable to target Kent residents for a considerable amount of time.'
