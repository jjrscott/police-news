CCTV images have been released by officers investigating a theft at a **Maidstone** shop.

A handbag was reported stolen when a pensioner was distracted at Marks and Spencer in **Eclipse Park** , at around **1.10pm** on **Wednesday 6 January 2021**.

## Cash stolen

It is alleged one of the bank cards was then used at a cashpoint in **Swanley** following the theft.

Officers are now able to issue CCTV images of two people who they believe could help with their enquiries.

Investigating officer, PC Lauren McNeil said: 'While the man and the woman in the photographs are wearing face masks, we are hoping that somebody recognises one or both of them and gets in contact with our appeal line.'
