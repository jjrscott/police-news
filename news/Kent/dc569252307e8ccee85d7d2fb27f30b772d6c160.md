Tonbridge CCTV

A CCTV image has been issued of a man and a woman officers would like to speak to in connection with theft and fraud in **Tonbridge**.

Kent Police received a report on **14 May 2019** that a purse had been stolen from a shopper in supermarket in **Sovereign Way**.

A bankcard that was in the purse was later used in an attempted fraudulent transaction at another store in **Tonbridge High Street**.

Similar offences believed to be linked have been reported in areas outside the county in Dorset and Northumberland.

An investigation is ongoing and a CCTV image has now been released of a man and woman who officers believe may have important information.
