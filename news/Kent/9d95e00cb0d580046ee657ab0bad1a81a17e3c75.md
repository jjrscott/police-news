The seized knuckle duster

A knuckle duster and drugs were seized by Kent Police during a joint operation in Medway.

Officers from Medway's Community Policing Team worked with the British Transport Police at **Chatham and Gillingham Stations** on **27 September 2020**. Police Dog Max, from Kent Police, also provided assistance.

As a result a quantity of what is believed to be cocaine, and a knuckle duster, were seized.

A 30-year-old man from Chatham was arrested on suspicion of possessing an offensive weapon, and for a drug-dealing offence, and has been released pending further enquiries.

Inspector Matthew Burbeck, of Medway's Community Safety Unit said: 'We routinely carry out these proactive operations as they help us to gather intelligence and demonstrate our commitment to protecting the public from criminal activity.

'We will continue to work with our partners to tackle and disrupt the supply of drugs and weapons within Medway.'
