Steven Tonks

A child sex offender has been jailed after he admitted attempting to groom a child online.

**Steven Tonks** of Windmill Road, Gillingham, appeared at Maidstone Crown Court on 26 March 2021 where he was sentenced to one year in jail.

The 50-year-old was charged with one count of attempting to engage in sexual communication with a child between **6** and **21 November 2018**.

He was arrested on 21 November following information which revealed Tonks had engaged in an online conversation with a person who he believed was a 12-year-old girl.

During the conversations Tonks made sexual remarks and also sent explicit images of himself.

He was arrested in Goudhurst Road, Gillingham, and later charged with the offence.

Investigating officer Detective Constable Chris Horan said: 'Tonks engaged in sexually explicit conversations with a person he believed to be a young child and I do believe he would have continued to do so, and would have very likely progressed his offending if he had not been arrested.

'I would encourage anyone with similar concerns to contact Kent Police as we will always take reports seriously and investigate accordingly.'
