Kent Police has secured the closure of a **Folkestone** property linked to county line drug dealing and anti-social behaviour.

Officers from the town's Community Safety Unit worked with Folkestone and Hythe District Council and the landlord following repeated calls to the address in **Holmesdale Terrace**.

The closure order, made under the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act, prevents anyone except the landlord or those working for the landlord from entering the premises.

Anyone entering the property in breach of the order can be arrested and could face a prison sentence.

## Arrest

The action was taken after Kent Police visited the property on **Thursday 5 November 2020** and arrested a man on suspicion of drugs offences.

Cash and phones were seized and the 20-year-old man, from west London, was released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Since then, officers have been called to further disturbances at the address on **Tuesday 24 November** and **Sunday 29 November**.

## Impact

PC Stephen Alexander, from Folkestone Community Safety Unit, said: 'Kent Police is committed to disrupting county lines activity with every tool available to us and house closures of this sort are one such tool.

'We also do not underestimate the impact on local residents of the anti-social behaviour which all too often goes hand in hand with drug dealing.

'I would like to thank all of those involved in obtaining this order and hope the town is a safer and more secure place as a result.'
