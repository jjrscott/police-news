Seven people have been handed £200 fines after they were found breaching Coronavirus regulations in **Rochester**.

Kent Police was called at **12.25am** on **9 February 2021** to a report of a group of motorists who were seen gathering in a car park near **Corporation Street** , Rochester, where they were reported to be playing music.

Officers attended and reminded the group of the current national lockdown guidelines and issued each person in attendance with a £200 fine. The group were then advised to leave the area and return to their homes.

Inspector Mat Burbeck of Medway's Community Safety Unit said: 'The regulations are there to protect not only individuals but also the wider community in helping to stop the spread of the virus and this includes prohibiting the mixing of multiple households and large gatherings.

'This was a clear breach of the regulations which resulted in seven people receiving fines and we will continue to enforce the regulations where required.'
