Shoppers in **Maidstone** are reminded to keep their wallets and purses safe following a theft at a supermarket.

A wallet and bank cards were reported stolen when a man in his 60s was distracted at Tesco in **Grove Green** , between **11.50am** and **midday** on **Tuesday 20 October 2020**.

It is alleged one of the bank cards was used at a cashpoint outside the store immediately after the theft, and then at further shops in the town centre.

Inspector Stephen Kent of the Maidstone Community Safety Unit said: 'While this type of offence is not a common occurrence in this town, I would remind shoppers to be careful when out and about to avoid becoming victim to opportunist thieves.
'Always keep wallets or purses in a secure pocket or in bags that are zipped up and where you can see them.
'Don't carry large amounts of cash and, when you use a bank or credit card, ensure nobody can see you enter the PIN.
'If you discover cards have been stolen, contact your bank or building society immediately so that they can be blocked.'
