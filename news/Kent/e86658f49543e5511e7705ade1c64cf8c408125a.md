A child sex offender from Tonbridge has been jailed.

**Jordan McGrath-Coulstock** committed 12 sex offences against children between **2014** and **2016**.

The offences took place in **Rochester** and included three counts of rape, an attempted rape and two sexual assaults.

After being arrested, it was necessary to release him on bail so detectives could build the best possible case for the victims, and ensure they were being safeguarded.

While on bail he led officers on a dangerous pursuit which started in **Strood High Stree** t and ended in **Forge Lane** , **Higham** , in **October 2020**. During the incident, he drove on the wrong side of the road, skipped a red light and reached speeds of 80mph in a 40mph zone.

McGrath-Coulstock admitted dangerous driving and driving while disqualified but denied all of the offences committed against children.

The 20-year-old, of Northwood Road, was found guilty following a trial at Maidstone Crown Court and sentenced to five years' imprisonment on Monday 1 March 2021.

Detective Constable Natalie Collin, who investigated the sexual offences, said: 'McGrath-Coulstock targeted three vulnerable young girls and preyed on them before committing various offences against them.

'He went so far to deny these offences and put the victims through the difficulty of a trial. I want to commend their bravery.

'We will always take reports of sexual offences seriously and will always thoroughly investigate allegations, no matter how old the offences are reported to be.'
