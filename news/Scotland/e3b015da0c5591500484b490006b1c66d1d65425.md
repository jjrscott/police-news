A 48-year-old man has been sentenced to 2 years and 9 months at Perth Sheriff Court for sexual offences against a young child between January 2014 and September 2019 in Perth.

Adalbert Bredau has also been sentenced for public indecencies. He was sentenced on Wednesday, 25 March, 2020.

Detective Constable Graeme Layland, the Investigating Officer, said: "First and foremost our thoughts remain with the victim and their family as they continue to attempt to cope with the abuse they suffered through Bredau's sexual exploitation of children.

"I would like to thank the wider communities in Perth and Kinross who have assisted police as we carried out our investigation. I hope that the community can take some comfort in knowing that this individual is now in prison and upon his future release will be subject to additional stringent and robust management within the community.

"I would also like to acknowledge the hard work undertaken by our partners at Perth and Kinross Social Work Department who work tirelessly to protect children every day."
