Police in Lanarkshire are appealing for information following a wilful fire-raising in Bothwell.

Officers were called around 11.35pm on Monday, 16 November, 2020 after a car was deliberately set on fire on Bellshill Road.

The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service attended and extinguished the fire safely and there were no injuries.

Enquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances surrounding the fire which is currently being treated as suspicious.

Detective Sergeant Craig Melrose, of Lanarkshire CID, said: “Thankfully nobody has been injured as a result of this deliberate fire.

“We are appealing to anyone who has any information and may have seen a silver car acting suspiciously around the area at the time of the incident.

“I would also ask if anyone in the area has possible dashcam or CCTV footage that could assist with our investigation to get in touch with officers.

“This was a reckless act and I would appeal to anyone who may have any details surrounding the incident to get in contact with police.

“Police can be contacted by calling 101, quoting incident number 3820 of 16 November, 2020 or by making a call anonymously to the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
