Police Scotland can confirm that a 66-year-old man has died following a crash on the A82 in Lochaber.

The incident happened around 5.25pm on Monday, 26 October near Glengloy north of Spean Bridge.

The man was the driver and sole occupant of a southbound green Citroen Berlingo which was involved in a collision with a northbound Volvo lorry.

The man was pronounced dead at the scene. The driver of the lorry was uninjured.

The road was closed for around nine hours to allow for an investigation at the scene.

Sergeant Ewan Calder of the Road Policing Unit in Fort William, said: "Our thoughts are with the man's family and friends at this time.

"We are working to establish the full circumstances which led to this collision to make contact.

"In particular we would be keen to speak to anyone who may have seen either of the vehicles prior to the collision, who may have seen the crash itself or who may have dashcam footage.

"Anyone who can help our enquiries is asked to call 101, quoting 2566 of 26 October."
