Police Scotland can confirm that two men, aged 26 and 27, have been charged following the thefts of whisky from shops and distilleries in Moray and Perthshire.

The thefts took place on Tuesday 28 January and Wednesday 29 January, in the Aberlour, Dufftown, Tomintoul and Aberfeldy areas. The total value of whisky stolen has been estimated at over £9,000.

Enquiries into the matter are ongoing and the two men are expected to appear at Elgin Sherriff Court today (Tuesday 30 January).

PC Lisa Warren, from the Forres and Speyside Community Policing Team, said: “I would like to reassure our communities that officers will respond to any reports of theft and will conduct thorough enquiries to not only recover the stolen property, but to bring those responsible to justice.”
