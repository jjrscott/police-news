He has been sentenced to five years and eight months imprisonment.

Detective Constable Mark Cummings, of Wishaw CID, said: “We welcome today’s sentencing of Jamie Cunningham after what was a despicable act and a frightening experience for the victim who has been left with life changing injuries.

“This was a challenging enquiry and the sentence reflects the gravity of his crimes. He will now have to face the consequences of his actions.

“I would like to thank the local community for their assistance with our investigation and those who came forward with vital information that has brought Cunningham to justice.
