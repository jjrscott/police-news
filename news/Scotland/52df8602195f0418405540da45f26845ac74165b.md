Officers are appealing for witnesses after a woman was sexually assaulted on Forrest Street in Airdrie.

The incident happened near a pedestrian crossing close to Katherine Park shortly after 5.20pm on Thursday, 28 January.

The woman was walking in the company of another woman when they were approached by a male jogger.

As he was passing them, the man touched her inappropriately over her clothing before running off along Forrest Street in the general direction of Airdrie.

The man is described as being around 5ft 6in tall, very slim build and aged around 16 to 20-years-old. He was wearing dark coloured running clothes.

Detective Sergeant Iain Sneddon of Coatbridge Police Station said: â€œWe are working to identify the person responsible and would urge anyone who may be able to help to come forward.

"We would be keen to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time, or who may have dashcam footage if you were driving, to come forward.

"Anyone with information can call 101, quoting reference 2740 of 28 Jan, or call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
