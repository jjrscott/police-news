Police in West Lothian are appealing for witnesses following the theft of a van in Harthill and an attempted housebreaking in Armadale.

The theft happened around 5.40am in the West Main Street area of Harthill on Saturday, 11 January, when the 56-year-old driver of a delivery van was found lying in the road.

He was taken to Wishaw general hospital with serious injuries where he remains in a stable condition.

The van, a blue Iveko, was then used in an attempted house breaking at a store around 6.10am in the Ochilview Square area of Armadale. It was later found abandoned in the Forrester Road area of the town.

Officers are keen to speak to anyone who may have seen the theft of the van and the attempted housebreaking as well as it being driven between the two locations and afterwards.

Detective Sergeant Derrick Lunan, of Wishaw CID, said: “The van driver was seriously injured during the theft and we would like to speak to anyone who saw what happened as well as any suspicious activity beforehand.

“We are also keen to speak to anyone who saw this van being driven around at that time in the morning and after the incident at the store before it was then abandoned.

“If you have information that will help our enquiries please call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident 0660 for the theft and 0697 for the attempted housebreaking, both of Saturday, 11 January. Or call the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.”
