Police Scotland can confirm that cocaine worth approximately £44,000 has been recovered from a vehicle in Maybole.

The vehicle was searched by officers as part of a pre-planned operation at premises on the South Ayrshire town's High Street during the morning of Tuesday, 22 December.

A 37-year-old man has been arrested and charged in connection with the recovery. He will appear in court on a later date.

Local area commander, Chief Inspector Brian Anderson said: “We take a proactive approach to target those who are involved in the manufacture, sale and supply of controlled drugs in South Ayrshire and do all we can to disrupt their activities.
"Our ongoing success in targeting drug dealing activity depends on the support and assistance of our communities, who do not tolerate the damage which is done by the trade in illegal drugs.

“I would encourage anyone who has information in relation to drug dealing to report this to ourselves or to the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
