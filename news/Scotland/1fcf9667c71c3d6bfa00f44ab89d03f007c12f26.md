Police Scotland has acknowledged the conviction of Declan Blythe for the murder of Cameron McMillan.

Cameron was 23-years-old when he was killed in the Quarry Street area of Motherwell on Sunday, 19 May, 2019.

Declan Blythe (23) has been found guilty at the High Court in Glasgow today, Wednesday, 18 November, 2020.

Detective Inspector Cammy Miller said: “Declan Blythe now has to deal with the consequences of his actions.

“Although this verdict can’t change what happened in the street on that morning, I hope that the outcome gives some sense of justice to Cameron’s family. Our thoughts remain with them and with the rest of his loved ones, as they continue to come to terms with their tragic loss.

“I want to take this opportunity to thank members of the public for coming forward and assisting with our investigation, which led to this prosecution.

“This should send a clear message that violent crime will not be tolerated in Lanarkshire and we will work alongside our partners at the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal service to ensure that perpetrators are brought to justice and removed from our communities.”
