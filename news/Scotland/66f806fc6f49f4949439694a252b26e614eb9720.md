Police in the Highlands can confirm that a quantity of drugs has been recovered from the Alness area, thanks to the work of Police Dog Sika.

The recovery was made in a rural area near Fyrish on Tuesday 4 February. While enquiries remain ongoing, the drugs are believed to be cocaine and cannabis with an estimated street value of over £300,000.

Local Inspector Jim Rice, from Tain Police Station, said: “Drugs misuse and dealing brings nothing but misery to our communities and I want the public to know that we will use every tool and tactic at our disposal to remove these illegal substances from our streets.

“I’d like to commend the good work of PD Sika and his handler for their assistance in this case.”
