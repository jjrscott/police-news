Police are appealing for witnesses following a wilful fire-raising in Paisley on Thursday, 28 January, 2021.

Between 7pm and 7.30 pm, a fire was deliberately set at the door of a flat in a close in Ferguslie Walk, Paisley. The fire, which was extinguished by the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, caused damage around the door of the flat both internal and external. There was no one in the flat at the time and no one injured.

Detective Constable Dougie McGlynn, Paisley CID, said:

"Thankfully this fire didn't take hold and spread further in to the flat or to the other homes in the close.

"At the moment officers are carrying out house to house enquiries and checking CCTV in an effort to identify whoever did this.

"The street is off a busy road and near local shops. If you were in the area around that time and maybe saw someone hanging about the close or if you have dash-cam footage from the street, then please give us a call."

Information can be passed to Paisley CID via 101. Please quote reference number 2759 of 28 January 2021 when calling. Alternatively, information can be passed anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
