Officers in Glasgow are appealing for information following a serious assault in the city centre on the evening of Tuesday, 7 April.

Police Scotland received a report around 9.40pm of a man lying on the ground with serious injuries in Renfrew Street.

The 32-year-old had sustained a serious facial injury and was taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary for treatment.

Enquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances of what happened and detectives are appealing to members of the public who live in the location and may have seen or heard something suspicious.

Detective Vikki Reid, of Stewart Street CID, said: “There are a number of flats that overlook the area where the man was found and we are asking anyone who may have seen something from their home to get in touch.

“In particular we are looking for two men who were seen in the area and might be able to help with our enquiries. The men are described as both around 6ft tall and both were wearing dark clothing.

"If you have any information which could assist our investigation, please contact Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident number 4053 of Tuesday, 7 April. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestopppers on 0800 555 111."
