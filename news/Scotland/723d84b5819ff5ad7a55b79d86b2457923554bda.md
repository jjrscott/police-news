Following today's sentencing of Christopher Bruce (42) to 12 years imprisonment at Edinburgh High Court for Directing Serious Organised Crime and his part in the supply of over 60 kilograms of controlled drugs including diamorphine (heroin), amphetamine and cannabis in Dundee, with a street value of over £400,000, the senior investigating officer Detective Inspector Stewart Forsyth said:

“This was a large scale operation which involved the dismantling of a well-established organised crime group who were intent on distributing drugs on our streets and causing significant harm to our communties. Christopher BRUCE sought profit from this trade but will now be serving a lengthy prison sentence.

Also convicted today at Edinburgh High Court, along with Bruce, Colin Stewart (35) was convicted for his involvement in Serious Organised Crime and his part in the supply of cannabis and received a 6 year custodial sentence.

Following earlier convictions for their individual roles in these drugs recoveries, the crime group have collectively been sentenced to over 40 years imprisonment.

DI Forsyth added: “These sentences serve a strong message to people who deal controlled drugs within our communities that we continue to be determined in arresting and convicting people involved in this illicit trade.

“A significant amount of work was carried out during this investigation by the investigation team, our partners as well as assistance from the wider public and I would like to publicly thank them for that.

“Police Scotland remain committed to keeping people safe and reducing risk of drug related harm in our communities. If anyone has any concerns regarding criminality in their area, please contact Police Scotland on 101.”
