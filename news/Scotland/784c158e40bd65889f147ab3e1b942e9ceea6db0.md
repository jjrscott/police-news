A 26-year-old man will be reported to the Procurator Fiscal in connection with a series of thefts in the Alloa area.

Officers from the Forth Valley Priority Crime Team recently executed a search warrant at a property in Alloa where stolen items were recovered. A man was subsequently reported in connection with 12 thefts from vehicles across the town, including on Hutton Park and Forebraes. The thefts occurred between 28 October and 1 November 2020. The man was also reported in connection with a theft on Mary Place, Clackmannan in December 2018."

Detective Inspector Norrie Petrie said: "Police Scotland is committed to tackling acquisitive crime and ensuring that those responsible face the consequences of their actions, regardless of the passage of time. We will use all available options to us to detect crimes when they occur.

"Anyone who sees or hears any unusual or suspicious behaviour is asked to contact police on 101, ideally at the time it occurs."
