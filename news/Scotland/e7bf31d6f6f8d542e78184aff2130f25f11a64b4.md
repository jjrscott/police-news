Chief Superintendent Mark Sutherland, Greater Glasgow Division, said: "We are aware of a proposed demonstration outside Celtic Park on Sunday, 6 December, 2020 and would urge people to find alternative ways to protest, such as online, to help prevent the spread of coronavirus.

"The Scottish Government regulations are quite clear that these types of protest are prohibited in areas under level four restrictions.

"Officers will continue to police these types of event using the 4Es approach of engaging with those taking part and explaining the restrictions in place to save lives.

â€œOur response will be measured and appropriate but we will use enforcement where required."
