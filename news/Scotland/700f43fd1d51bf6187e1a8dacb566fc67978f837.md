Officers in Haddington are appealing for information after a man and woman were robbed while walking the River Tyne Walk last night.

The incident took place shortly after 9.50pm on Thursday, 1 October, when the pair were approached by a man asking to use a mobile phone.

This man produced a weapon and robbed the pair of a number of items, before leaving in the direction of Nungate Bridge when the female victim ran to contact police.

The suspect is described as being white, around 30-years-old, between 5ft 6 and 5ft 9, medium to stocky build, with a local accent. He was wearing black trousers and a black jacket or hoodie with the hood up, as well as a black face covering.

Enquiries have indicated that the suspect may have been seen in the Waterside area at around 10.25pm, walking in the direction of Giffordgate and Ford Road.

Detective Constable Steven Stewart, from Dalkeith CID, said: “We’re appealing for anyone who was in the area and may have seen the man in question to please get in touch.

“If you have information which could assist our investigation, please call police on 101, quoting incident 3681 of 1 October. Alternatively, you can all Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, if you wish to remain anonymous.”
