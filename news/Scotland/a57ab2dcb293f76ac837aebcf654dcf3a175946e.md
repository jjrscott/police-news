Police in Tayside are appealing for witnesses after a man was assaulted in Dundee and had his bike and wallet stolen.

The incident happened around 9.30pm on Friday, 14 August, on Reres Road, Broughty Ferry. A 42-year-old man was cycling when he stopped to speak to a group of five men. Two men assaulted the victim, stole his bike and his wallet. The wallet was later found discarded with a three figure sum of cash missing. It's believed this was a targeted attack.

One suspect is described as having ginger hair wearing a denim top and bottoms and tanned boots. The second suspect is described as having bleached blonde hair wearing a white Timberland t-shirt, jeans and white trainers.

Constable Callum Hampson, based at Downfield, said: "We're appealing to anyone who might have witnessed this incident to contact us.

"The large group and the victim on his bike would've been quite distinctive. The victim didn't require any hospital treatment but the incident was frightening for him and we're appealing to anyone with information to let us know."

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting incident number 1285 of 17 August or anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
