Officers in Glasgow are appealing for information after a man was found injured in the street in the Milton area of the city.

The 55-year-old man was found around 3.30pm on Monday, 6 July in Castlebay Street, having sustained serious head injuries.

He was taken by the Scottish Ambulance Service to Glasgow Royal Infirmary where he is currently in a serious condition.

Enquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances of what happened before he was found and how he came about his injuries.

Detective Inspector Graham McCreadie, of Maryhill CID, said: “We are keen to speak to anyone who may have seen what happened, in particular before the man was found in the street.

“We believe a passing cyclist may have stopped to help and we would urge that person to come forward to help with our investigation.

“Anyone who saw anything, who may have CCTV footage or dash-cam footage that could help with our enquiries is asked to call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident number 2114 of Monday, 6 July, 2020.

“Or they can make a call anonymously to the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
