Police in Midlothian are appealing for witnesses after an attempted robbery in Mayfield.

The incident happened in Mayfield Park around 8.50pm on Thursday, 16 July, 2020, when a 39-year-old woman was approached from behind by a man who pushed her to the ground and demanded her mobile phone.

The man ran into the tunnel nearby towards the school.

The suspect is described as being in his late 30s, around 5ft 9in tall, of skinny build with brown hair and a fringe. He also had a silver thin hoop through his right nostril. He spoke with a local accent and may have been wearing a plain black face mask at the time. He was also wearing a navy blue hoodie, navy blue jogging bottoms, black Nike boot type trainers and black fingerless gloves.

Detective Constable Declan Hogg, of Dalkeith CID, said: "We're appealing to anyone who witnessed this incident or saw a man fitting this description in the area shortly before or after the incident happened to contact us.

"This was a frightening ordeal for the victim who was left understandably shaken."

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting incident number 3811 of 16 July or anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
