Police Scotland is appealing for witnesses following the sudden death of a pedal cyclist near Lumphanan.

Officers were called at 11.25am this morning (Friday, 15 January, 2021) after a 60-year-old man was found unwell on the B9119 Echt to Tarland road. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

​His next of kin have been made aware but formal identification is still to take place.

Sergeant Peter Henderson of the Road Policing Unit in North East Division said : “Our thoughts are with the man’s family at this difficult time. We are keen to speak to anyone who may have been travelling on the B9119 this morning around 11am and saw the man. He was using a white pedal cycle. The road is still currently closed while we continue our investigation. Anyone with any information is asked to call 101, quoting 1033 of Friday, 15 January, 2021.”
