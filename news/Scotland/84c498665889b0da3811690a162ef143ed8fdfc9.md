Police in West Lothian are appealing for witnesses after a teenager was seriously assaulted in the George Street area of Bathgate.

The incident is believed to have happened between 1.15am and 1.30am this morning (Saturday 8 February). The 16-year-old boy was taken to St John’s Hospital for treatment.

Officers are currently conducting enquiries in the area and reviewing CCTV to establish the full circumstances and identify four men in dark clothing who are believed to have been involved in the incident.

DC Alan Gibson, from Livingston CID, said: “Whilst we don’t have descriptions of the suspects, the assault took place near a bar on the opposite side of the road, so it is likely that patrons have either seen the incident itself or these men running from the area.

“I’d ask members of the public with information to contact Police Scotland and assist us with our enquiries.”

Anyone with information can call Police on 101, quoting incident 0312 of 8 February. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 if you wish to remain anonymous.
