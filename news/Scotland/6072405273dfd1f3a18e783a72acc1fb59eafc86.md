Officers in Clydebank are appealing for information after a male indecently exposed himself on Friday, 15 January, 2021.

The incident took place around 6.05pm on Friday evening on Barns Street. A 19-year-old woman was at the bus stop opposite Andrew Drive when a male exposed himself.

The male suspect is described as tanned, in his 30s, about 5ft 10in tall and of medium build with shoulder length black hair. He was wearing a black leather jacket with distinctive white lines on the chest and sleeves, black jeans and brown lace-up shoes.

Constable Sophie Canty, of Clydebank CID, said: “I'm appealing to anyone who may have been in the area at the time of the incident, or saw a man fitting the description either before or shortly after it took place, to contact us.

“Anyone who may have information or saw anything suspicious can contact police on 101, quoting incident 2634 of 15 January.”
