A 27-year-old man was sentenced to eight years in prison yesterday for killing a man in Lanarkshire.

Liam Donnelly was sentenced at the High Court in Glasgow for killing Philip McMillan in Holytown last year. Donnelly pled guilty to culpable homicide in December 2019.

Alan Dunion, 24, and Ryan Downie, 24, both pled guilty to being in possession of a bladed article. Dunion was sentenced to 12 months in prison and Downie was admonished.

The incident happened around 5.50am on Sunnyside Crescent on Friday, 22 February, 2019. Philip McMillan, 26, died at the scene after he was stabbed in the chest.

Detective Inspector Kenny Dalrymple, of Lanarkshire CID, said: "The death of Philip McMillan was a completely senseless killing over a small debt and highlights the dangers of carrying a knife. If you carry a knife, you will be more likely to use it and the consequences of this can be devastating.

"Our officers acted quickly to gather evidence and subsequently the three men were charged the following day. Violence won't be tolerated in our communities."
