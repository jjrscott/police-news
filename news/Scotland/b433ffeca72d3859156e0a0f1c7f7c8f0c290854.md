Police in Lanarkshire are appealing for witnesses after a vehicle was deliberately set on fire in Rutherglen.

The incident happened around 12.10am on Thursday, 8 October on Jedburgh Avenue in the town and involved a white Mercedes A class car parked on a driveway.

The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service attended and extinguished the fire. Nobody was injured but the car was extensively damaged.

Detective Constable Gareth Laird, of Lanarkshire CID, said: "We are treating this as a fire raising and our enquiries so far suggest this was a targeted attack.

"We are particularly keen to identify a person seen at the time running from Jedburgh Avenue in the direction of Wardlaw Avenue.

"They are described as being around 5ft 7in tall, of medium build and wearing dark clothing.

"We would urge anyone with information, or who may have private CCTV or dashcam footage, to come forward.

"Anyone with information can call 101, quoting incident 0036 of 8 October, or call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
