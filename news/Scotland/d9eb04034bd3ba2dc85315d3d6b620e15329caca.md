Dean Jones (39) was sentenced at Edinburgh High Court today (Friday, 10 January) for his part in the robbery at Gleneagles Hotel in June 2017.

Jones has been sentenced to 11 years and four months in prison.

Detective Chief Inspector Andrew Patrick said :

‘Jones, along with others committed a serious crime targeting Gleneagles Hotel, causing great distress to those who were working and staying there.

'Today's sentencing concludes a long and complex enquiry.

'Two other men have already been sentenced for the crime whilst Jones fled the United Kingdom and was later apprehended trying to enter Brazil in 2018 however, with assistance from the Foreign & Commonwealth Office and the National Crime Agency, officers from Police Scotland travelled to Brazil to extradite him back to Scotland in October 2019.

‘This sentencing serves as a warning to others that such crimes will not be tolerated. These crimes will be fully investigated to ensure those who are responsible are brought to justice’.
