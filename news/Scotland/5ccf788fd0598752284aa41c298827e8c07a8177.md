Police Scotland can confirm that a five figure sum of Class A drugs has been recovered following a police operation in Perth.

The recovery took place at an address on Young Street, Perth around 9.30am on Friday, 25 September 2020 where a quantity of cocaine with an estimated street value of £40,000 was recovered, along with a four figure sum of cash.

A 34-year-old man has been arrested and charged in connection with drug offences and is due to appear at Perth Sheriff Court at a later date.

A full report has been submitted to the Procurator Fiscal.

Sergeant Greg Dent, of Perth Community Investigation Unit, said: “This recovery shows that the supply of drugs will not be tolerated within our communities.

“We will continue to work to try and track down those involved in this type of behaviour.

"Officers rely on information from the public and I would ask that if anyone has any concerns surrounding drugs in your area that you get in contact with police.

“Police can be contacted on 101 or you can report this anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
