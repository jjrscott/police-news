Road Policing officers are appealing for information following a serious road crash on the Isle of Lewis.

The incident happened around 3.25pm on Monday, 14 December, 2020, on the B895 Newmarket to Tolsta road at Broadbay View, Back. It involved a 9-year-old girl and a blue Toyota Yaris.

Emergency services attended and the girl was initially taken to Western Isles Hospital before being transferred to the Royal Hospital for Children in Glasgow. Her condition is described as serious but stable.

The road was closed until 11.50pm whilst officers carried out an investigation.

Sergeant David Miller, of Highlands and Islands Road Policing Unit, said: "Our enquiries into the circumstances of the crash are ongoing and I am appealing for anyone who was in the area at the time and has not yet spoken to us to come forward.

“I’m particularly keen to speak to anyone who may have dashcam footage which could help with our enquiries.”

Those with information can contact the Road Policing Unit in Dingwall on 101, quoting reference number 1877 of 14 December.
