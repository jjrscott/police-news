Police Scotland is appealing for witnesses after a road crash on the A828 near Duror on Monday, 17 February.

The incident involved a single vehicle - a red Audi A4 car - and happened near Duror cemetery at around 5.30pm.

The vehicle collided with a roadside barrier and then a wall at the cemetery.

The 40-year-old male driver and sole occupant of the car was taken to Belford Hospital in Fort William.

He has since been transferred to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary where he is in a serious condition.

The road was closed for around four hours to allow for an investigation at the scene.

Sergeant David Miller, of the Road Policing Unit in Dingwall, said: "We are carrying out enquiries to establish the full circumstances which led to this collision.

"The car was being driven north before the crash and I would urge anyone who either witnessed the incident or who saw the vehicle on the road beforehand to come forward.

"Anyone who may have dashcam footage is asked to review this and then pass on anything which could be of note.

"Anyone with information can contact police on 101, quoting incident 2961 of 17 February."
