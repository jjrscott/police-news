**Published 22 May 2020**

Police in Inverness are appealing for information following two fire-raising incidents at separate properties on Diriebught Court in the city.

The first was reported shortly before 1pm on Wednesday, 20 May and the second around 3.50pm on Thursday, 21 May at a neighbouring property.

Nobody was injured on either occasion, though some damage was caused to each property.

Both fires are being treated as wilful and enquiries to establish the circumstances of each incident.

Detective Inspector Reuben Lindsay of Inverness CID said: "We are keeping an open mind at this stage about whether these fires are linked, though there are similarities between each case.

"On both occasions the damage caused was contained but it should go without saying that deliberately setting fires is incredibly reckless. The consequences could easily have been far more severe.

"Anyone who may have information or who may have seen any suspicious activity around Diriebught Court or the surrounding area is urged to come forward and contact Police Scotland on 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."

Please quote reference 1629 if specifically referring to the incident on 20 May or 2387 for the incident on 21 May.
