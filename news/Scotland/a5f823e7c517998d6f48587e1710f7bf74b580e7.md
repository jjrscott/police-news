A man has today (Tuesday, 13 October) been sentenced at Falkirk Sheriff Court for being in the possession of indecent images of children.

Alan Chalmers was sentenced to three years and nine months in prison following his conviction on Tuesday, 22 September, 2020. He has also been placed on the Sex Offenders Register indefinitely.

The 40-year-old plead guilty to possessing multiple devices and USB’s which contained thousands of indecent images of children created between January 2019 and May 2019.

Detective Chief Inspector Richard Banks of the National Child Abuse Investigation Unit said: “We welcome the sentencing today of Alan Chalmers. He will now spend over three years in prison for his truly despicable actions.

“He acted with no regard to the young victims in the images and videos he was viewing and was under the mistaken belief that the internet would provide him with anonymity and would prevent him being caught. Our investigation and today’s result proves he was wrong.

“Any form of child sexual abuse is a serious criminal offence and is a priority for Police Scotland. We encourage anyone with concerns about a child at risk of abuse, or a potential victim, to contact police immediately.”
