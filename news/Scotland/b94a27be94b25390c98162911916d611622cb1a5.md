Police in Aberdeen can confirm that a 29-year-old man has been arrested and charged following the recovery of Class A drugs from the Sheddocksley area.

A drug search warrant was executed at a property in the Lewis Road area around 12.00pm on Thursday 9 January. A quantity of heroin and ‘crack’ cocaine was recovered, with a combined estimated street value of over £12,200.

The man, from the Nottingham area, is expected to appear at Aberdeen Sheriff Court today (Friday 10 January).

Detective Sergeant William Murdoch, from Aberdeen CID, said: “Drug misuse brings nothing but misery to our communities.”

“I want to reassure people across the North East that we are using every tool and tactic at our disposal to remove these illegal substances from our streets and to deal with those responsible.

“If you have any information or concerns about drug misuse or wider criminality in your area, do not hesitate to contact us on 101 or report anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
