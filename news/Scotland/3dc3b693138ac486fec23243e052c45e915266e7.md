Police in Lanarkshire are appealing for information following a wilful fire raising in Coatbridge.

The incident happened between 12.15am-12.40am on Wednesday, 29 July, 2020, when two cars, a white Mercedes and a white Chrysler, were deliberately set on fire at an address in Lees Court.

The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service attended and extinguished the fire safely and there were no injuries.

Detective Constable Jamie Routledge, of Lanarkshire CID, said: “Although nobody has been injured as a result of this, there has been significant damage to the owners two vehicles.

“This was a reckless act and this type of behaviour will not be tolerated in our communities.

“I would ask that if anyone noticed anyone acting suspicious in the area or witnessed the incident to speak to officers.

“I would also ask if anyone was driving on Dundyvan Road at that time of the fire and may have dashcam footage to get in contact with police.

“Police can be contacted on 101 quoting incident number 0135 of 29 July, 2020."
