A 34-year-old man has been arrested and charged after two handguns were recovered from a house in Greenock.

The property on Wren Road was searched on Thursday, 14 May, 2020 following an investigation by Police Scotland and the National Crime Agency, as part of the Organised Crime Partnership. Enquiries were carried out after the UK Border Force intercepted a firearm as part of their checks of incoming mail. Two handguns were recovered at the address along with a small quantity of cannabis.

Detective Inspector Tom Gillan, of the Organised Crime Partnership, said: "Our investigation has resulted in firearms being removed from the local area and while it is not linked to the recent shooting in Greenock, I hope this police activity and partnership approach gives the local community some reassurance. Our work around these proactive investigations will continue across Scotland."

The 34-year-old will appear at Greenock Sheriff court at a later date.
