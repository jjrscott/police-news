Police Scotland can confirm that a 41-year-old man has been arrested and charged following the recovery of a cannabis cultivation in Hawick.

Officers attended at an address in Sandbed where they recovered around 330 plants with a potential street value of £416,000.

The man was due to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Wednesday, 1 July, 2020.

Chief Inspector Stuart Reid, Area Commander for the Scottish Borders said: “This is the second cultivation we have recovered in Hawick in recent weeks which shows our commitment to disrupting the supply and production of drugs within the area.

“Recoveries such as this send a clear message that we will not tolerate drugs within our local communities.

“It is important that we continue to work with members of the public who can provide us with essential information that can assist with our investigations.

“I would urge if anyone has any information or is concerned about drugs within their area, please get in contact with officers.

“Police can be contacted on 101 or alternatively Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800555111.”
