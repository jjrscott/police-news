Police in Falkirk are appealing for information after a man indecently exposed himself in the Langlees area of the town.

The incident happened around 5.30pm on Saturday, 17 October, 2020, when a 40-year old woman was walking on a footpath near David's Loan near the Celtic gym.

A man appeared from some bushes, took hold of her arm and exposed himself. He then ran off along David’s Loan, possibly in the direction of the sewage works.

The man is described as white, slim build, aged in his late 30s or early 40s with short black hair. He was wearing a black jacket, a black tracksuit and white trainers.

Inspector Bill Donohoe said: “Fortunately the woman was not injured but she has been left extremely upset by what happened.

“I am appealing to anyone who may have been in the area at the time and seen anything to get in touch, particularly if they saw this man before or after the incident.

“If you can help please call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident number 2983 of Saturday, 17 October, 2020, or make a call anonymously to the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
