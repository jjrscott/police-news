Police are warning people to be on their guards after a Stirling woman was the victim of a scam.

The 60-year-old woman was contacted by phone on Saturday, 7 November, and told there was suspicious activity on her bank account.

The caller advised a police officer would attend to collect the woman’s bank card, and a man arrived a short time later to do so.

The card was returned several hours later.

After several further contact attempts were made, the victim visited her bank where concerns were raised and police were contacted.

Crime Prevention Officer Bryan Mackie said: “Luckily banking protocols prevented any money from being taken from the woman’s account, however it is important people are aware of this scam and avoid falling victim.

“The man who collected the woman’s bank card is believed to have shown some form of identification, however a police officer would never arrive to take your bank card.

“We would urge anyone who is contacted by their bank, and is concerned regarding the legitimacy of the call, to hang up and call back the bank’s main number to confirm who they are speaking with.

“Anyone with information or concerns about fraudulent activity can contact Police Scotland through 101.”
