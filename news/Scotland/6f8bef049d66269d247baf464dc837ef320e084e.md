“We are appealing to anyone who may have seen anything suspicious in the street, both before or after the fire, to get in touch. I am also asking anyone with private CCTV or dash-cam that may help with our enquiries to get in touch.

“If you can help please contact Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident 3227 of Wednesday, 13 January, 2021, or make a call anonymously to the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
