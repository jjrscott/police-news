This weekend Police Scotland's Road Policing Division will focus on motorcycle safety as part of their motorcycle safety campaign due to bikers being some of the most vulnerable road users on Scotland’s roads.

The freedom of the open road makes motorcycling an exhilarating way to travel and enjoy magnificent scenery, however collisions involving motorcyclists are disproportionate to the number of riders using our roads. While motorcyclists make up just 1% of the traffic on our roads they account for around 13% of all people killed, often during cornering or overtaking manoeuvres.

Head of Road Policing, Chief Superintendent Louise Blakelock said: "Road safety is everyone's responsibility and I would ask motorcyclists to ensure they have suitable safety equipment and urge all riders to not only travel within the posted speed limits but also at the appropriate speed for the road conditions and their capabilities.

“This campaign allows officers to engage not only with motorcyclists but other road users, giving us the opportunity to provide advice and education and to share our experience on how we can all make our roads safer.

“Road Policing Officers will continue to patrol roads across Scotland and any offences will be dealt with appropriately.”
