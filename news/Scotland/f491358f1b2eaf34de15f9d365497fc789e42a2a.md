Police in Glasgow are appealing for information after two men entered a takeaway on Kilfinan Street, in the city and demanded money.

The incident happened around 8.20pm on Saturday, 16 January, 2021. Four staff members were working inside when the men threatened them with knives.

The men took a packet of cigarettes and a lighter and then made off in the direction of a lane leading to the Balmore Industrial estate.

The first man is described as white, aged in his late 20s, with blue eyes, and of medium build. He was wearing a navy blue jacket with the hood up, navy or royal blue joggers.

The second man is also white and aged in his late 20s. He was wearing dark clothing.

Detective Constable Suzanne Walker said: “Fortunately no one was injured and the men made off without the cash they had demanded. But staff were left very upset by what happened.

“I would urge anyone who may have seen any suspicious behaviour in the area at the time of this incident to get in touch, or anyone who may have been driving nearby and have dash-cam footage that could help with our enquiries.

“If you can help please Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident 3378 of 16 January 2021. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously by calling the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
