Police in Edinburgh are appealing for information following vandalism to a number of premises in the city centre.

Two incidents took place in The National Museum of Scotland, on Friday 24 January and Saturday 25 January respectively, where glue had been applied to different areas of the venue’s toilets. A further similar incident has since been reported at the Festival Theatre on Nicolson Street.

Inspector Trish Robertson, of the West End Community Policing Team, said: “Thankfully nobody has been seriously injured as a result of these incidents, however these thoughtless acts were extremely irresponsible and could have potentially harmed young children.

“Officers are conducting a thorough investigation and I would urge anyone with any information, of who may have seen something suspicious, to contact Police via 101, quoting incident 2808 of 27 January.”
