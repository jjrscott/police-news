Police Scotland welcomes the conviction and sentencing of Matthew Jardine after he assaulted two police officers on Saturday, 11 April, 2020.

Inspector Claire Walker, of Dumfries Loreburn Street Station, said: "This was at a time when our officers were working amidst the height of the coronavirus pandemic.

"The officers had been called to assist Mr Jardine and in the course of carrying out their duties, he decided to assault them by spitting on them.

"Our officers find themselves dealing with situations on a daily basis to protect the people and communities we serve, and are trained to a high level to deal with violent and confrontational situations. But being assaulted is not simply part of the job and it cannot be tolerated.

"The Chief Constable made it clear that assaults against officers and staff is utterly unacceptable in his public pledge made to tackle this last month, and we will always work tirelessly to bring perpetrators before the courts."
