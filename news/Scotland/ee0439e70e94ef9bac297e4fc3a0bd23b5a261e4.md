Police Scotland is appealing for information after high-value camera equipment was stolen in Glasgow in the early hours of this morning (Sunday, 31 January).

Officers were called to a business unit in Oakbank Industrial Estate around 1am, after reports of the shutter being forced and a glass door being smashed during a break-in.

Various models of camera were taken, including Sony, Fuji, Sigma and Canon - thought to be worth around £50,000.
