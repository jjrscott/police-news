We can confirm that a 79-year-old man has been arrested for the murder of Doctor Brenda Page. Dr Page, who was 32 years old, was found murdered in her flat at 13 Allan Street, Aberdeen, on 14 July 1978.

Detective Inspector Gary Winter, of Police Scotland’s Major Investigation Team, said: “I would like to appeal to anyone who believes they may have information relevant to the enquiry and has not previously come forward or been seen by the Police.

"I would also urge any previous witnesses from 1978, or from the subsequent review from 2014 onwards who have changed contact address or telephone numbers to get in touch and update us. The enquiry team can be contacted by calling 101 and quoting reference number 479 of 17 March or by e-mailing SCDHOLMESAberdeen@scotland.pnn.police.uk"

Please be aware that proceedings are now live under the Contempt of Court Act.
