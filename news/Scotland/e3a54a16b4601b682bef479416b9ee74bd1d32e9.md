Road Policing officers in Dingwall are appealing for witnesses following a road crash at around 3.00pm on Saturday, 18 January, 2020 on the B9161 at the entrance to Munros Nurseries.

The incident involved a silver VW Golf which left the road. Officers are keen to trace the occupants of two vehicles, the first heading towards Munlochy ahead of the VW Golf and the second, possibly a dark coloured Nissan X-Trail or similar vehicle, which emerged from the Munros Nurseries junction.

Anyone who may have been in the area and witnessed the incident, or anyone who may have dashcam footage of the B9161 from the A9 junction to Munlochy between 2.55pm and 3.15pm that date is urged to contact Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident 2335 of 18 January, 2020.
