Police in Ayrshire are appealing for information following the sudden death of a man found within a car on the A77 at Ayr.

The incident was reported to police around 6pm on Saturday, 25 July. The 46-year-old was found within a blue Ford Fiesta car -registration LA56 HZN - which was parked in a layby on the northbound carriageway of the road near Dalmilling Golf Course, between the Holmston and Whitletts roundabouts.

Enquiries so far have established that the vehicle was seen parked around 7am on Saturday, 25 July but was not there at 7pm on Friday, 24 July.

Detective Inspector Nathan Calderwood of Ayrshire CID said: "We are working to establish the full circumstances which led to this incident and would appeal to anyone who noticed the vehicle at any time prior to 7am on Saturday to let us know.

"I would ask anyone who was on the road overnight between Friday and Saturday and may have dashcam footage to review this and pass on anything which may be of use.

"Anyone who may have seen the vehicle or who has any other information can contact police on 101, quoting incident 3105 of 25 July."
