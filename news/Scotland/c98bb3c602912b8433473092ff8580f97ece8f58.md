Police in Lanarkshire are appealing for information following an assault in Hamilton.

Around 12.45pm on Wednesday, 25 November, 2020 at an address in Kelvin Gardens, a man was struck by a white Ford Fiesta, registration SD11 THV, which was driven at him deliberately.

Two men then got out of the car and attempted to assault the 35-year-old, before driving off in the direction of Udston Road.

The vehicle was later traced burnt out on North South Road, Cleland around 2.50pm on the same day. There were no serious injuries as a result of the incident.

The suspects are described as men, dressed in black and wearing full balaclavas.

Detective Inspector Susie Cairns, of Lanarkshire CID, said: “We are appealing to members of the public who may have information that could assist with our investigation.

“This incident took place in the middle of the day and I would ask if you were in the area or noticed anyone acting suspicious that you get in contact with Police.

“I would also ask if you saw the vehicle described being driven erratically on the day of the incident that you get in touch with officers.

“Anyone with any information is asked to contact Police Scotland on 101 quoting incident number 1413 of Wednesday, 25 November, 2020.”
