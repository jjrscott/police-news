Officers from Glasgow Road Policing are continuing their enquiries and re-appealing for any information after a fatal road crash on Parkhouse Road, Glasgow on Saturday, 29 August, 2020.

The crash involving a lorry and a motorbike took place around 10am on Saturday, 29 August, on Parkhouse Road at its junction with Nitshill Road. Emergency services attended, however the 62 year-old male motorcyclist was pronounced dead at the scene.

A full report will be sent to the Procurator Fiscal.

Sergeant John Bradford from Glasgow Road Policing said:

“Our investigation into the cause of this crash is continuing. A number of people stopped to help at the scene, however this is a busy road and I am sure there are other witnesses to the crash who have not yet spoken to police.

“I would urge any further witnesses, or anyone with information to come forward. I would also ask anyone travelling on these roads around the time of the crash last Saturday, who has dash-cam footage to contact us.”

Anyone with information should contact officers through 101 quoting reference number 1268 of 29 August.
