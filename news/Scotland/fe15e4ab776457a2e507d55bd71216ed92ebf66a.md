A man responsible for a number of serious domestic abuse offences committed over a 22 year period has been convicted at Glasgow High Court today, Wednesday, 16 December, 2020. He is due to be sentenced on Friday, 29 January, 2021.

Paul Hill (54), of Ayr, was found guilty following a trial of 15 charges, including rapes, violence and animal cruelty.

His offending took place against 9 women between 1987 and 2009 throughout the Tayside, Grampian and Fife areas.

Hill was the subject of an investigation by officers from Police Scotland's Domestic Abuse Task Force.

Detective Sergeant Gordon Patullo, of Tayside Division’s Domestic Abuse Task Force, said: “Police Scotland is committed to bringing domestic offenders to justice and supporting victims of domestic abuse.

“This conviction recognises the seriousness of Hill's crimes and the courage of his former partners in giving evidence. It sends out a clear message that domestic abuse will not be tolerated and offenders will be prosecuted to the fullest extent.

“Victims of domestic abuse should have confidence that the police will make to investigate their reports robustly and sensitively when they feel ready to come forward and will work to bring offenders to justice.”
