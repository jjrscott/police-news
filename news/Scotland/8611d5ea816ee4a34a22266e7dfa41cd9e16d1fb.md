Police are appealing for information after housebreaking in St Cyrus, Aberdeenshire, on Wednesday, 19 February, 2020.

Between 7pm and 9.15pm yesterday evening, a house was broken into and a quantity of personal items, including jewellery, worth a five-figure sum, was stolen.

Detective Sergeant John Lumsden, from Aberdeen CID, said:

“St Cyrus is a small village therefore it’s possible that locals may have noticed any suspicious people or vehicles in town last night.

“If you have any information that may help our enquiry then please get in touch. We’d be keen to hear from anyone who may have dash-cam footage of vehicles in the area or maybe personal CCTV, including doorbell cameras, to check them and give us a call.

Anyone with information is urged to contact Queen Street Police Office, Aberdeen, on 101, quoting reference number 3631 of 19 February. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, if you wish to remain anonymous.
