Two men have been charged after five firearms and ammunition were recovered in North Ayrshire.

Officers made the discovery after stopping a Ford Mondeo in Irvine Road, Largs, as part of an intelligence led operation on Tuesday, 1 September.

A 43-year-old man was arrested and a 37-year-old man was subsequently arrested from an address in Stevenston in connection with the incident.

Both men have been charged and will appear at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court on Thursday, 3 September.

Detective Inspector Martin McGhee, of Police Scotland’s Specialist Crime Division, said: “Information from the public about alleged criminality can be vital and helps us protect communities.

"I would ask anyone who has information about the criminal use of firearms to contact us on 101. If you would prefer to remain anonymous, you can pass on information via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
