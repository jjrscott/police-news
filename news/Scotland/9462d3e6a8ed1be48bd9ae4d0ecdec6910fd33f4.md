Officers in the Highlands are appealing for information after a housebreaking in Ullapool on Saturday, 15 February, where a car was stolen.

Between 1.00am and 9.20am yesterday morning, a house in Morefield Place, Ullapool was broken into and a grey Skoda Octavia VRS Estate was stolen. The car was later recovered locally and is back with its rightful owners but appears to have been driven a substantial distance.

A Police Scotland spokesperson said:

“While we are pleased the vehicle has been returned to its owners, we are looking to trace those responsible.

“Anyone with information about this incident, or anyone who was driving in the Ullapool area between the times in question with dash-cam footage is asked to contact police via 101 quoting incident number 1344 of 15 February. Alternatively Crimestoppers can be contacted on 0800 555 111, where anonymity can be maintained.”
