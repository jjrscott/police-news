**Chief Constable Iain Livingstone has issued a statement following the Appeal Court's decision in respect of the conviction of Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al-Megrahi.**

Chief Constable Iain Livingstone said: "The bombing of Pan Am 103 and the terrible loss of 270 lives has had a profound impact in Lockerbie, Scotland, and internationally.

â€œOn behalf of the Police Service of Scotland, I pay tribute to the families of the victims who have demonstrated courage and dignity for over 30 years and my thoughts remain with them today.

"Since 1988 policing in Scotland has been committed to carrying out the largest terrorist and murder investigation ever undertaken in this country.

"Police Scotland will continue to work closely on this investigation with the Crown Office, our American law enforcement colleagues and other international partners."
