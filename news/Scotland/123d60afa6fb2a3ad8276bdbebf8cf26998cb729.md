Detective Superintendent Donna Duffy, head of Public Protection in Greater Glasgow Division, said: "Child sexual exploitation is a constant threat, not just in Glasgow but in communities across Scotland. In Glasgow, we have developed strong child protection partnerships with a range of agencies, to help us identify children who may be at risk and to allow us put in place support to prevent vulnerable children being exploited.

"We can confirm that at this time we have received no information or intelligence that suggests children in Govanhill are being exploited. Nor are there any ongoing investigations. Our local policing teams are engaging with various partners in the Govanhill area on a daily basis. We continue to engage with partners to ensure children and young people across Glasgow are protected.

"Reports that children may be at risk are treated very seriously. If you or anyone you know has information concerning the safety of any child in Glasgow then please contact the Police or the social work department and the matter will be thoroughly investigated. All such investigations are dealt with sensitively and involve a full multi agency response, and safety planning for any victims identified."
