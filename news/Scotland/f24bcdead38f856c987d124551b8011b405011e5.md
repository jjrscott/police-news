Detectives at Clydebank are appealing for witnesses after a vehicle was deliberately set on fire in Dumbarton on Wednesday 30 December 2020.

Around 9:15pm on Wednesday evening, we received a report of a Range Rover car on fire outside a house in Castlegate Avenue, Dumbarton. The fire was extinguished and no one was injured.

Following a joint investigation between Police Scotland and Scottish Fire and Rescue, the fire is being treated as wilful.

Detective Sergeant Peter Jarvis of Clydebank Police Station said: “Thankfully nobody was injured during this incident however it was nonetheless a deliberate and very dangerous act.

“It is important that we trace anyone who is responsible and I would urge anyone who was in the area at the time and saw anything suspicious to come forward.

“Anyone with information can contact police at Clydebank on 101 quoting reference number 3435 of 30 December. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 anonymity can be maintained."
