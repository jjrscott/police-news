Police in Inverness are appealing for information after a serious one vehicle collision that occurred on the southbound A9 after the Raigmore Interchange yesterday afternoon (Monday 13 July, 2020).

The collision happened at around 4:05pm and involved a white Honda Integra. The driver, a man in his 20s, was taken to Raigmore Hospital with serious injuries where he remains in a serious but stable condition.

Enquiries to establish the full circumstances remain ongoing and Road Policing officers are appealing to anyone with dash-cam footage or who was in the area between Longman Industrial Estate and the Inshes flyover to contact them.

Sergeant Davie Miller from the Highland and Islands Road Policing Unit said: “We believe that the Honda Integra may have been travelling at speed along with a grey Audi A3 or S3 motor car. We are appealing to anyone who may have seen these vehicles prior to or at the time of the collision to speak to us. Additionally, I'm appealing to the driver of the Audi to come forward as they may have information that can assist with our investigation.

“Anyone with information is asked to contact Police Scotland on 101 quoting incident 2206 of 13 July.”
