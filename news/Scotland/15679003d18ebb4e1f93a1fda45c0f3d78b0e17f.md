Police Scotland can now confirm the identity of the man who died in a road crash on the A92 near Cowdenbeath in Fife.

Mr King was the driver of a red Vauxhall Meriva involved in a crash around 9.55pm on Saturday, 12 September about half a mile east of the junction for Cowdenbeath.

Two boys, aged 12 and one-year-old, were taken to the Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy for treatment to minor injuries.

In a statement, Mr King's family said: "The family are devastated by the sudden death of John.

"We would like to thank everyone for their thoughts and condolences. We would ask for privacy at this sad time."

The road was closed until around 1pm on Sunday, 13 September to allow for an investigation at the scene.
