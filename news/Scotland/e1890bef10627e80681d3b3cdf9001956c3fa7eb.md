**Published 24 April**

Police in Ayrshire are appealing for witnesses after a flat was deliberately set on fire in Largs.

The incident happened on Morris Street between 2am and 2.10am on Friday, 24 April, 2020 when a man walked up to the flat with a Jerry can and set fire to the front door area. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service attended. Nobody was injured.

The suspect is described as in his forties with a flushed red appearance and appeared to be walking with a slight limp/discomfort. He was wearing a green parka style jacket with dark jeans, dark trainers, a blue beanie hat and dark scarf partially covering his face. He was carrying a bright green Jerry can and a yellow hose.

Officers believe it was a targeted attack.

Detective Constable Scott Hendry, of Saltcoats CID, said: "We're appealing to anyone who saw the man or has doorbell or home CCTV footage showing suspicious behaviour to contact us.

"The man would have been very distinctive given what he was carrying. Thankfully nobody was injured but the act was reckless and the outcome could've been a lot worse."

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting incident number 0315 of 24 April or anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
