Police Scotland officers have recovered a large scale cannabis cultivation in Glasgow this morning, Monday, 2 November, 2020

Officers, in an intelligence led police operation searched industrial premises in Strathmore Road in the city, under warrant, and recovered a quantity of cannabis plants with an estimated street value estimated to be in the region of two million pounds.

Two men, aged 26 and 27 years were arrested and charged in connection with the recovery and are expected to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court on Tuesday, 3 November, 2020. A report is being prepared for the Procurator Fiscal.

Detective Chief Inspector John Morrison from Police Scotland’s Serious and Organised Crime Unit said: “We are committed to targeting the illegal supply of drugs in our communities and any information we receive will be taken seriously and acted upon. This was a cultivation in what can only be described as on an industrial scale and it is hoped that this seizure will have a serious impact on those who make it their business to deal in this despicable trade.

"We rely on members of the public to provide us with information which we can act on. We would encourage anyone with information about suspicious activity to contact Police Scotland on 101 or if you wish to remain anonymous, to call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
