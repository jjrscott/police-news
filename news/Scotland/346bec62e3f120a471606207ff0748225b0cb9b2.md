Police are appealing for information after a house was broken into in Bathgate, West Lothian, on Saturday, 30 May, 2020.

Around 2.55 am, a ground floor flat on Cochrane Street, Bathgate, was broken into and some personal items stolen. The suspect is described as male, white, in his late 20s, 5ft 3 to 5ft 5 in height, of skinny build, pointed chin, wearing jeans, a baseball cap and dark coloured trainers.

The people in the flat, a 50-year-old man, a woman aged 56, and a 27- year-old woman were not injured but have been left shaken by the incident.

Detective Constable Rachel Royan, Livingston CID, said:

"It would appear that the thief had managed to get into the house but was then disturbed by one of the occupants before running out in to the street heading towards Balbardie Avenue.

"We believe at this time that it was an opportunist crime and so it's possible the man may have been in the area for some time before this break-in. So if you saw someone acting suspiciously in the area, or someone who looked out of place around that time, then call the CID at Livingston Police Office via 101. Please quote reference number 0774 of 30 May, 2020, when calling. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
