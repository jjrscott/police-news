Sergeant Paul Hunter from Cupar Police Station said: “We are eager to trace the driver of a silver or grey Mercedes car, which is possibly a newer shape and the registration may contain the letters VDR or similar, to help with our investigation into the crash.

“We are also appealing for any dash-cam footage of the incident or of the Mercedes car both before and after the crash or any other information that will help with our enquiries.

“Anyone with information can call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident 2171 of Thursday, 27, February 2020.
