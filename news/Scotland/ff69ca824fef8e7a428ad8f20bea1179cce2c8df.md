Police in West Lothian are still appealing for information about a fatal hit and run as officers carried out a stop and speak with drivers one week on from the incident.

Road policing officers spoke to road users on the B792 on Sunday, 27 September - exactly one week on since George Robertson, 53, died. They carried out the checks between 9pm and 11pm to try and gain more information about the incident.

The 53-year-old was walking along the road when he was struck by an unidentified vehicle. The driver of the vehicle failed to stop.

The incident is believed to have happened between 10.15pm and 11pm on Sunday, 20 September, on the B792 just south of Torphichen.

He was taken by ambulance to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary where he was pronounced dead a short time later.

Inspector Peter Houston, from the Road Policing Unit, said: “George Robertson, also known as Mojo, was a much loved family man and his family, friends and the local community have been left devastated by this tragic incident. His loved ones are still looking for answers as to what happened.

"I am making an appeal directly to the driver of the vehicle involved to please do the right thing and make yourself known to the police. I would also urge anyone with knowledge of who was driving to pass this information on and help us provide answers for George’s family.

“The inquiry team are still looking to speak to anyone who was on the B792 between 10.15pm and 11pm on Sunday 20th who may have noticed a pedestrian wearing dark clothing. We would also urge anyone who may have seen a dark vehicle, which may have had fresh accident damage, in the area around the time of the collision to contact us."

Anyone with information or dash-cam footage that can help the investigation is asked to contact Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident number 4127 of Sunday 20 September.
