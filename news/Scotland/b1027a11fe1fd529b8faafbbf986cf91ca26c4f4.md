Police are appealing for information following a wilful fire-raising at a café in Hazlehead Park, Aberdeen, on Friday, 11 December, 2020.

Around 9.20 pm, police and emergency services were called to a fire at the café which is near to the entrance to the park off Groats Road, Aberdeen. The building has been extensively damaged.

Officers are carrying out enquiries in the area and checking CCTV, however, are keen to speak to anyone who was in the park last night. Detective Constable Alan Gordon, Aberdeen CID, said:

"The park is a popular place and well used by dog walkers and people out for a stroll or run. I would like to hear from anyone who was in the park between 7pm and 9.20pm last night who may have seen people hanging about the café or acting suspiciously nearby.

"If you have any information that may assist our investigation, please call Aberdeen CID via 101 quoting reference number 3460 of 11 December, 2020. Alternatively, Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.
