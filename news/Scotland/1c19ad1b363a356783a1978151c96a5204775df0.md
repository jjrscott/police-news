Police in Glasgow are appealing for information following an attempted robbery this morning in Glasgow City Centre.

The incident happened in the St Enoch Square area around 8am today (Wednesday, 2 December), when a 62-year-old woman was using an ATM, at which point another woman demanded she hand over money.

The suspect is described as being white and slim build. She was wearing a blue coloured North Face jacket with a black hood, light blue jeans and red trainers with white soles.

Constable Bryan Evans, from Greater Glasgow CID, said: "Although the victim was not injured, this was a terrifying experience for her.

"I'm appealing to anyone who may have been in the St Enoch square area around the time of the incident and may have noticed anyone matching the suspect's description to please contact police."

Anyone with information can call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident 0470 of 2 December. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, if you wish to remain anonymous.
