Officers in Motherwell are appealing for information after a wilful fireraising in the area.

The fire was extinguished by the Scottish Fire and Rescue service. Substantial damage was caused to the front door of the property. Nobody was hurt during the incident.

A man was seen running away from the scene, he is descried as wearing a light coloured top and dark coloured trousers.

Detective Inspector Kenneth Dalrymple of Wishaw CID said: “This was a reckless and dangerous act of wilful fireraising which thankfully did not result in anyone getting injured.

“We believe that this was a targeted attack and we are keen to trace those responsible as soon as possible.

“A man was seen to run away from the incident and we are appealing to anyone who may have seen him in the area around the time of the fire.”
