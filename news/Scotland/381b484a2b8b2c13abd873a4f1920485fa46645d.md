A teenager has today, Wednesday, 8 July, been sentenced to seven years in prison for the serious sexual assault of a woman in Methil last year. He has also been placed on the sex offenders register for life.

The attack happened on an area of waste land close to Laird Avenue on 29 January 2019 when a 20-year-old woman was raped at knifepoint.

An investigation was launched by detectives from Fife’s Public Protection Unit which resulted in a then 14-year-old boy being arrested and charged in connection with the incident.

On Tuesday, 11 February, 2020 at the High Court in Glasgow, the now 15-year-old pled guilty to the incident and has today been sentenced.

Detective Inspector Kelly McEwan, senior investigating officer on this case said: “This was a complex investigation and involved a number of officers, specialists and partners, along with the support of the local community in Methil.

“This has been a truly horrendous and traumatising incident and will no doubt have lasting effects on the victim but I would like to thank her for assisting with our enquiries and the courage and dignity she has shown throughout."

"We are committed to keeping Fife a safe place and will always treat reports of sexual offences with the upmost professionalism. Victims will be supported and offences will be thoroughly investigated in an effort to bring perpetrators to justice"
