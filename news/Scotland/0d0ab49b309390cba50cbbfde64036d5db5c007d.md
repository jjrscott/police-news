A man who stabbed another man to death in his own home has pled guilty to murder today at the High Court in Glasgow.

On Monday 14 October, 2019, 45-year-old Steven Clark or Robinson was found dead in his flat in Carrbridge Drive in Maryhill, Glasgow.

Nineteen-year-old Christopher Lawson was quickly arrested and later charged in connection with this death. He was held in police custody until his appearance at court. During a trial at Glasgow High Court he pled guilty to murder.

Detective Chief Inspector Stevie Wallace, the Senior Investigating Officer in the case said: “This was a horrendous attack on a vulnerable man in his own home. Hopefully this result today will give Steven’s family and friends closure on what has been a horrific period in their lives. I'd like to thank the investigative team for all of their hard work on this case and their efforts to get justice for Steven.”
