Police Scotland is appealing for information following a robbery at a supermarket in Barrhead.

The incident happened around 7.35pm on Tuesday, 15 December at the Lidl store on Kelburn Street.

An unidentified man pretended to go through the checkout to pay for item before waiting for the cashier to open the till.

He has then pushed the male cashier out of the way before grabbing a low three figure sum of cash from the till and running off towards Barnes street.

The man is described as being white, in his 30s and around 5ft 9in tall.

He was wearing a grey hooded Nike top with black shoulders, black jogging bottoms, brown rigger style work boots, and a blue disposable mask.

Enquiries are ongoing and officers are appealing from anyone with information to come forward.

Constable Robert Fox from the Greater Glasgow Robbery Unit said: "Nobody was injured but the staff involved were understandably shaken.

"We would urge anyone who may have information about this incident to come forward as soon possible.

"We would be particularly keen to hear from anyone who may have seen a man acting suspiciously around the area or in the supermarket on Tuesday evening.

"You can call 101, quoting incident 2884 of 15 December, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
