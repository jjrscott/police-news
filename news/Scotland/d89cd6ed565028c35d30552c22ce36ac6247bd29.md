Police Scotland are carrying out enquiries after a robbery in the Clydebank area.

Three men forced entry to a house in Montrose Street in the town at 5pm on Wednesday 19 August. They threatened a man and woman within the house, with one of the men in possession of what appeared to be a firearm.

The men subsequently made off with a three figure sum of money along with other items of value from within the address.

Detective Sergeant David Lavery said: “The men threatened the couple with violence but thankfully no-one was injured as a result of this incident. There were children also within the home. From our enquiries so far we understand that the threat was directed at the couple with no wider risk to the public.

“We are looking to trace the three men involved who were wearing surgical face coverings at the time.

“Officers are reviewing CCTV opportunities and carrying out house to house enquiries.

“There were a number of people and vehicles in the street near to this address when this incident took place and we would like to hear from anyone who has any information or knows who is responsible for this crime to come forward quoting incident 2578 of Wednesday 19 August.”
