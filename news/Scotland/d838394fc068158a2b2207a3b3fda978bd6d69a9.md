Police Scotland acknowledges the sentencing of Norman Czemerys, who was given a 20 months prison sentence and added to the Sex Offenders Register when he appeared at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court on Wednesday, 12 August, 2020.

The 71-year-old was previously convicted of offences relating to indecent images and videos of children, and possession of extreme pornography.

Detective Chief Inspector Richard Banks, National Child Abuse Investigation Unit, Police Scotland said: "Czemerys' online behaviour was reprehensible with no regard to the young victims depicted in the images he was viewing.

"He believed the internet would provide anonymity and allow him to undertake his offending undetected. This was not the case, and as a result of our enquiries he will now face the consequences of his actions.

"The restrictions imposed by the coronavirus pandemic has prompted a growth in internet use, creating an increased risk of offending online and exposing children to abuse, whether in a private or virtual space.

"Any form of child sexual abuse is a serious criminal offence and is a priority for Police Scotland. We encourage anyone with concerns about a child at risk of abuse, or a potential victim, to contact police immediately.‚Äù
