Road Policing officers in Lanarkshire are appealing for witnesses and dashcam footage following a fatal road crash, which took place yesterday on Main Street in Plains, North Lanarkshire.

The crash took place at around 4.30pm on Thursday, 24 September, at the junction with Northburn Street. It involved a blue and white Suzuki motorcycle and a black Volkswagen Fox car.

The male motorcyclist was pronounced dead at the scene, while the driver of the Volkswagen was not injured.

Sergeant Gemma Blackadder, from Police Scotland Road Policing, said: “We are asking for anyone who was in the area around 4.30pm and either saw the crash take place or saw the motorcyclist beforehand to please come forward.

“If anyone has potential dashcam footage or CCTV prior to the incident also, that would greatly assist our enquiries.”

Anyone with information is asked to contact Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident 2348 of 24 September.
