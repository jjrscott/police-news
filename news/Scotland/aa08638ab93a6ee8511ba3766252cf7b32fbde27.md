Police Scotland can confirm that a 56-year-old man has died following a crash near Inverness yesterday (Friday, 13 November, 2020).

The incident took place around 5.20pm near to Castle Stuart, on the B9039, and involved a Renault Clio, a Honda Civic and a Mercedes Vito van.

The man was the driver and sole occupant of the Renault Clio and was pronounced dead at the scene.

The driver of the Honda Civic was taken to Raigmore Hospital with non-life threatening injuries, while the driver of the Mercedes was uninjured.

Sergeant Ewan Calder, of the Road Policing Unit in Fort William, said: “Our thoughts are with the deceased’s family and friends at this time.

“The road was closed for around seven hours yesterday, to allow for an investigation at the scene, and we are continuing work today to establish the full circumstances of the collision.

“In particular, we would be keen to speak with anyone who may have witnessed the collision itself, or who may have seen any of the vehicles involved prior to the incident. We would also be keen to receive any potential dashcam footage from the area.”

Anyone with information, or who could help the investigation, is urged to call Police on 101, quoting incident 2776 of 13 November.
