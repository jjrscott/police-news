Road policing officers in Fife are continuing their investigation into the fatal road crash on the A92 near Lochgelly.

The incident occurred 9.55pm on Saturday, 12 September around half a mile east of the junction for Cowdenbeath.

The 63-year-old male driver of a red Vauxhall Meriva involved in the collision died at the scene following the incident.

Inspector Andy Mather of Fife Road Policing said: "Following extensive enquires into this incident, we have now established that another vehicle collided with the Vauxhall prior to it leaving the road.

"We are appealing for anyone who may have been travelling in the Cowdenbeath and Lochgelly area or on the A92 dual carriageway around 9pm to 10pm that evening, particularly if you saw a black coloured 4x4 type vehicle.

"Anyone who may have dashcam footage from the time is asked to review this and pass on anything which may be of note.

"Any information can be passed to police by calling 101, quoting incident 3941 of 12 September or by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
