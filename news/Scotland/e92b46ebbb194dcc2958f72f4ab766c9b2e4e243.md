Police in Lanarkshire are appealing for witnesses after a seven-year-old boy was seriously injured in a collision with a vehicle in Airdrie.

The boy was on foot on Gartleahill in Airdrie, near the junction with Target Road, when he was struck by a car around 5.25pm on Tuesday, 14 October.

He has been taken to the Royal Hospital for Children in Glasgow for treatment to serious injuries.

The occupants of the car - a grey Ford Kuga - were uninjured.

The road was closed for around six hours to allow an investigation at the scene.

Sergeant Gemma Blackadder, of the Road Policing Unit in Motherwell, said: "Our enquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances which led to this incident.

"I would urge anyone who may have witnessed the incident to come forward if you haven't already spoken to an officer.

"In particular we would be keen to hear from anyone who may have dashcam or private CCTV footage which could help our enquiries.

"If you have any information then please call 101, quoting incident 2412 of 13 October."
