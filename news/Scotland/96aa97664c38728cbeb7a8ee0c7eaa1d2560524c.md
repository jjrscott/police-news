Officers are appealing for information after a 37 year-old man was robbed within his house in New Stevenston on Friday, 12 June, 2020.

Around 10.30pm on Friday evening, the 37 year-old man was within his home on Carfin Street when three men entered the house, assaulted him and stole a three-figure sum of cash.

Police and ambulance attended and the injured man was taken to Wishaw General Hospital to be checked over.

The three men responsible are described as being in their early 20s, between 5ft 8ins – 5ft 11ins in height. They were all wearing light coloured clothing and had their hoods up. One may have been using a bike.

Detective Constable Gary Lipscombe of Wishaw Police Office said: “This is a busy road and I am hoping that people in the area may have seen these three men acting suspiciously in the area around the time of the robbery last night. I would appeal to any witnesses, or anyone with information to contact us as soon as possible.”

Anyone with information should contact Wishaw Police Office through 101 quoting reference number 4328 of 12 June. Alternatively Crimestoppers can be contacted on 0800 555 111, where anonymity can be maintained.
