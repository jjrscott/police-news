A man has been charged in connection with drug offences after a quantity of cannabis was found in a car on the A74(M).

On Tuesday, 23 June, 2020, officers from Lockerbie’s Road Policing Unit stopped a vehicle on the northbound carriageway near to Moffat.

A search of the vehicle found one kilogram of cannabis with an estimated street value of £10,000 and a four-figure sum of cash.

Chief Inspector Darren Faulds, of Police Scotland’s Road Policing Unit, said: “As a result of a proactive stop of a vehicle on the motorway network, a quantity of drugs has been removed from circulation.

“A 33-year-old man has been charged in connection with the incident and a report will be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal.

“Removing illegal substances from our communities remains a priority for officers and I would encourage anyone with information about drug crime in their area to report this to police so that we can investigate thoroughly.”
