Detectives at Clydebank are continuing enquiries and appealing for information after a 20 year-old man was robbed in Alexandria on Saturday, 5 December, 2020.

Around 8.45pm on Saturday evening, the young man was robbed of a portable speaker within Christie Park, Main Street, Alexandria.

The man was uninjured but badly shaken as a result of the robbery.

The two men responsible are described as white and in their late teens to early 20s. One of them was of slim build with brown hair. He was wearing a light-coloured hooded top with dark–coloured trousers and trainers. The other had a heavy build with short shaved hair. He was wearing a light-blue padded jacket.

Constable Craig McGarry said: “I believe that people may have seen these two men immediately before or after the robbery, either within Christie Park or in the surrounding area and I am urging anyone with information that will assist this investigation to come forward.

Anyone with information should contact Clydebank Police Station through 101 quoting reference 3644 of 5 December. Alternatively Crimestoppers can be contacted on 0800 555 111, where anonymity can be maintained.
