Police in Lanarkshire are appealing for witnesses after an attempted robbery in Cumbernauld this morning (Wednesday, 22 July, 2020).

Around 7.55am, a 43-year-old woman was approached by a man at the underpass tunnel near to the M80, leading from Castlecary Road to Wardpark Industrial Estate. The man assaulted the victim before trying to steal her bag. He ran off in the direction of the M80.

The male suspect is described as Indian/Pakistani, in his early 30s, around 5 ft 10 ins and of slim build. He had short black wavy hair and a thin patchy black beard. He was well-kept in appearance and was wearing a high viz vest, black jacket, black skinning jeans and black boots.

Detective Sergeant Mark Nelson, of Coatbridge CID, said: "The victim was badly shaken following the incident and received minor injuries. Our officers are supporting her.

"This was an isolated incident and I would like to reassure the local community we are doing everything we can to identify the culprit. I am appealing to anyone who was in the area before or after the time of the incident and saw a man matching this description to get in touch with police. If you were driving in the area and have access to a dash-cam, I would ask you to please go back and check for any footage that may assist our investigation."

Information can be provided to police on 101, quoting reference number 0684 of 22 July, or reported anonymously to independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
