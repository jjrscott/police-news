Police in Glasgow are appealing for witnesses after an attempted robbery at a premises on Queen Margaret Drive.

The incident happened around 4.30pm on Tuesday, 24 November, 2020, at a gift shop on Queen Margaret Drive when the suspect threatened staff with a glass bottle before making off empty handed in the direction of Byres Road.

The suspect is described as a white male with a Glaswegian accent, 5ft 8ins tall, of slim build, with sallow skin and large brown eyes. He was wearing a distinctive red and black snow style jacket with a silver or white band on the elbow area, dark grey jogging bottoms, dark grey trainers and a blue surgical face mask.

Constable Bryan Evans, of Govan Police Station, said: “This has been a terrifying experience for the shop staff and thankfully nobody was hurt in the incident.

“The area was extremely busy around the time of the incident and I’m appealing for anyone who may have seen a man matching the description before or after the incident to contact police.

“I would also ask anyone who was in the area with dash cam footage that may help our investigation to get in touch.”

Anyone with information should contact police via 101, quoting incident number 2300 of 24 November.
