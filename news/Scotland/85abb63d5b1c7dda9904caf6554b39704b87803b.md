Detectives in Moray are appealing for information following a break-in that took place in Elgin yesterday (Thursday 13 February).

The incident happened in the Hamilton Drive area and is believed to have been between 8.30am and 1.30pm.

As a result of the break-in, a quantity of personal items including jewellery was stolen, valued at a four-figure sum.

Detective Sergeant Scott McKay, from Aberdeen CID, said: “This incident took place during the daytime, on a residential street, therefore it is highly likely that someone has seen the person or people responsible in the area at the time. I would therefore like to appeal for any witnesses to come forward, whether you have seen the crime or simply people acting suspicious nearby.

“I am also appealing for anyone in the area with CCTV to come forward and contact Police. This includes doorbell cameras and vehicle dashcams.

“As we continue to carry out a number of enquiries in relation to this crime, residents may notice an increased police presence in the area, as we carry out additional patrols.”

Anyone with information is urged to contact Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident 1919 of 13 February. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, if you wish to remain anonymous.
