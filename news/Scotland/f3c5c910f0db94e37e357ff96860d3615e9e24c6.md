Police are appealing for witnesses following a single vehicle road crash on the A9 near Dunblane in which a man has been seriously injured.

Around 7.30 am this morning, Saturday, 12 December, 2020, police and emergency services were called after a blue Peugeot car left the carriageway and crashed in to a tree off the A9 southbound, near to the QV junction (Queen Victoria School junction), Dunblane.

The 19-year-old male driver of the car was taken by ambulance to Ninewells Hospital in Dundee where medical staff describe his condition as serious.

Sergeant Jill Kirkpatrick, Road Policing East, said:

"We are keen to hear from anyone who was driving along the A9 near the QV junction this morning who either saw the crash or who may have any information that will assist our investigation. We are particularly keen to view any dashcam footage that drivers may have from the road around this time.

"Please contact Road Policing East via 101, quoting reference number 0876/12 December, 2020 when calling.

The A9 southbound remains closed while officers carry out enquiries. Local diversions are in place.
