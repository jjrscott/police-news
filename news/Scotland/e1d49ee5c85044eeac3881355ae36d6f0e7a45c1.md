Detectives in Glasgow are appealing for information after a 45-year-old man was seriously assaulted in the Lyoncross Road area earlier this week.

The incident happened around 3.55pm on Tuesday, 12 January, near the junction of Lyoncross Road with Linthaugh Road. The victim was approached and assaulted by a man unknown to him, causing serious facial injuries.

The suspect is described as wearing a dark jacket, with the hood up, and had his face covered by either a scarf or a facemask. After the incident, he was seen to run away down Linthaugh Road.

Detective Constable Andy Reid, from Govan CID, said: "This was an unprovoked attack, which has left the victim with significant injuries.

"I am appealing to members of the local community to get in touch if they have any information on the identity of the suspect or were in the area at the time and saw the assault take place.

"I would also appeal to anyone who was in the Linthaugh Road area on Tuesday afternoon and may have seen a man in a black jacket, with his good up, acting suspiciously."

Anyone with information is urged to contact police on 101, quoting incident 2005 of 12 January. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, if you wish to remain anonymous.
