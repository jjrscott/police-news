Police Scotland has charged five men following the recovery of drugs with a combined street value of £700,000 in the Highlands.

Since February 2020, officers have carried out a number of seizures in rural areas in Alness as part of an intelligence-led operation. Drugs including cocaine and cannabis have been recovered during the investigation which is still ongoing.

Five men (aged between 19 and 30) have been charged and are due to appear at Inverness Sheriff Court on Friday, 7 August, in connection with this.

Detective Inspector William Nimmo said: "This enforcement action was carried out following an intelligence-led operation and sends out a clear message that such behavior will not be tolerated in our communities.

"But we can't tackle this alone. The public continue to play a vital role in assisting investigations into drug crime and I would encourage anyone who has any concerns about drug-related activity, or has any information about those involved in drugs, to contact police on 101 or make an anonymous report to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
