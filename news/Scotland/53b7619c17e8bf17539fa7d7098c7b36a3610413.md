A man has today, Wednesday 2 December, 2020, been convicted in connection with the death of Ryan Barrie, who died at an address in Dundee in March 2020.

Stephen Robbins, 33, pled guilty to the culpable homicide of the 39-year-old at the High Court in Edinburgh.

Both men were involved in an altercation in the street in Benvie Gardens, Dundee, in the early hours of Sunday, 1 March, 2020, when Mr Barrie sustained a serious head injury.

A short time later emergency services were contacted and Mr Barrie was sadly pronounced dead within his home address. Robbins was later arrested and charged in connection with the death of Mr Barrie.

Detective Inspector Stewart Andrew, of the Major Investigation Team (North) based in Dundee, said: “During the altercation in the street Mr Barrie sustained serious head injuries from which he sadly died a short time later.

“Our thoughts and sympathies remain with the family and friends of Mr Barrie and I hope that today’s outcome will offer them some comfort.

“Police Scotland continues to tackle violence at all levels and officers work hard to ensure that those who commit violent offences are brought before the courts.”
