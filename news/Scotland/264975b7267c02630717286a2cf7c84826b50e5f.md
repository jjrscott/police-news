Police in Lanarkshire are appealing for information following an attempted murder in Blantyre.

The incident happened around 7.40am on Friday, 29 May, 2020, at an address in Anderson Gardens when a car deliberately struck a 47-year-old man.

Emergency services attended and the man was taken by ambulance to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital where he is being treated for life threatening injuries.

The car involved is described as a small silver Peugeot.

Detective Sergeant Laura Sands, of Lanarkshire CID, said: “This was a reckless act that has resulted in a man sustaining life threatening injuries.

“Although this happened early in the morning, I would ask that if anyone noticed a car matching this description or any suspicious activity in the area to contact police.

“We believe the car may have driven in the direction of Glasgow Road and would ask anyone with any information to please come forward.

“I would also appeal to those who have possible dashcam footage that could assist with our investigation to get in touch with officers.”

Police can be contacted on 101 quoting incident number 0786 of Friday, 29 May, 2020.”
