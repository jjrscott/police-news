Police Scotland has charged two men following the recovery of cocaine with a street value of £180,000 in Aberdeen.

As part of an intelligence led operation, officers carried out searches at properties in the West End of the city on Thursday, 19 November, 2020. Cocaine was seized from the properties with an estimated street value of around £180,000.

Two men, aged 25 and 27, were arrested and charged in connection with drug supply offences and appeared at Aberdeen Sheriff Court today (Friday, 20 November).

Detective Inspector Rob Sim said: "Controlled drugs have no place in our society and we will continue to target those individuals who profit from their supply.

"We rely on members of the public to provide us with information which we can act on. We would encourage anyone with information about suspicious activity to contact Police Scotland on 101 or if you wish to remain anonymous, to call Crimestoppers on 0880 555 111."
