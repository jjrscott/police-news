Police in North Lanarkshire are appealing for information after a man indecently exposed himself in Airdrie.

The incident happened around 3pm on Saturday, 6 June, 2020. Two woman in their thirties were walking over a bridge on Cairhill Road when they saw a man on the disused railway line path underneath exposing himself.

The male suspect is described as around 40 years old and of slim build. He was wearing blue denim jeans, a grey knitted top, a black beanie hat and was carrying a blue carrier bag.

Detective Sergeant Ronnie Douglas, of Coatbridge CID, said: "The incident happened on a pathway where members of the public regularly go to walk and exercise and so I'm eager to trace the man responsible as soon as possible.

"I'm appealing to anyone who may have been in the area at the time of the incident, or saw a man matching this description either before or shortly after it took place, to contact us.

"Anyone with information can contact police on 101, quoting reference number 2115 of 6 June."
