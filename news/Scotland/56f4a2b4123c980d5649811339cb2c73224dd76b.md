Detectives in Glasgow are appealing for the help of the public following a serious assault on a 68- year-old man in the city centre on Saturday night. At around 10.30pm on Saturday, 3 October, 2020, the elderly man was waiting at a bus stop in Jamaica Street in Glasgow, following a night out in the city. At that point he was approached and in an unprovoked attack, assaulted by a younger man. As a result of the attack, the victim was taken to hospital where he was treated for what is described as a life changing injury.

Detective Constable Allyson Ferguson at Stewart Street Police Office said: “This appears to have been a totally unprovoked attack on a man waiting on his bus home after a night out. I would ask anyone who may have witnessed this attack, or who has any information which could help in the investigation to call us on the 101 number, quoting the reference number 1999 of 4 October.”
