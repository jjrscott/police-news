Around 12.45pm on Tuesday, 18 August, officers stopped a 33-year-old woman near the A970 close to Tingwall and recovered a quantity of drugs, believed to be Heroin and Cocaine with an estimated street value of eight thousand pounds (£8,000).

Further searches were then carried out by officers at two addresses in Tingwall and Mossbank in connection with this enquiry.

A 33-year-old woman and a 38-year-old man have both been arrested and charged in connection with this recovery. A full report will be sent to the Procurator Fiscal.

Local Area Commander, Chief Inspector Lindsay Tulloch said: “We are committed to ridding our local communities of drugs and we will continue to work to target those involved in this type of criminality.

“We rely on information from the public to help us gather intelligence and we will act on it appropriately. I would urge anyone with information about drugs in their community to contact their local police office through 101. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where anonymity can be maintained.”
