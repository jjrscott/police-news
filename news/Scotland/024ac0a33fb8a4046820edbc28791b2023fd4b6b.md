Following our appeal into damage caused to Stornoway Primary School, we can confirm that two 14-year-old girls and a 12-year-old boy have been charged in connection and will be subject of a report to the Children's Reporter.

Sergeant Ross Masson, of Stornoway Police Station, said: "I'd like to thank the members of the public who came forward with information after our appeal. This type of behaviour will not be tolerated in our communities. Anyone who has concerns about anti-social behaviour in their area is encouraged to contact police by calling 101 as promptly as possible."
