On 5 November, 2020, the Larkfield area of Inverclyde experienced disgraceful scenes whereby police officers were attacked by people throwing bottles and other items at them. The officers required to protect themselves and had to deploy with public order equipment.

An investigation has been ongoing since that evening to identify those responsible. This week officers traced a further two 15-year-old males and one 16-year-old male and they were charged with mobbing and rioting offences. This brings the current number of people charged to four, and enquiries are continuing to identify others involved.

The Area Commander for Inverclyde, Chief Inspector Paul Cameron said: “the scenes we saw in Larkfield on bonfire night were completely unacceptable. Police officers work hard to protect our communities all year round. They do not come to work to have bottles and other items thrown at them. I am pleased that we have identified some of those responsible and work will continue to identify others involved.”
