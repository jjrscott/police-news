Officers in Dundee believe they have identified a man found collapsed on Kinghorne Road, Dundee, who sadly died on the way to hospital.

Formal identification has yet to take place, however, the family of a 67-year-old local man has been informed and the death is not being treated as suspicious, but remains unexplained pending a post mortem.

The man was found lying on Kinghorne Road around 2.15pm on Thursday, 30 April. The Scottish Ambulance Service and local officers attended and the man was pronounced dead en route to hospital.

Officers would like to thank members of the public who helped the man when he was found collapsed and all those who responded to the appeal to identify him.

Police Scotland is continuing to ask anyone who may have information about him or his movements on the day he was found to come forward. If you can help please call 101, quoting incident number 1816 of 30 April, 2020.
