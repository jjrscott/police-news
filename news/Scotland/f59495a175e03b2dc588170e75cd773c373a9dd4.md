Detectives in Aberdeen, along with Road Policing officers, have carried out an intelligence-led operation in the city, which saw 18 individuals charged in connection with a number of offences, including drugs supply and various road traffic offences.

The dedicated patrols took place on Wednesday, 17 June, and targeted individuals linked to both acquisitive and serious and organised crime.

Those charged were men aged between 18 and 53-years-old.

Detective Sergeant John Lumsden, from Aberdeen CID, said: “These patrols were designed to root out offenders involved in serious crime and significantly disrupt their illegal activities.

“This is the latest in a series of operations as part of a Road Crime Initiative across the North East and I want to reassure the public that these efforts will not stop, with more planned in the coming weeks and months.”
