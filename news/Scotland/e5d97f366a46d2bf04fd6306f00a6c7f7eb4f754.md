Police in Glasgow have issued a CCTV image of a man they wish to trace as part of an ongoing investigation into a fraud in the city centre in July 2019.

On 18 July, 2019 a man purchased goods within Glasgow City Centre using a stolen credit card.

Police believe the person in the image may be able to assist their enquiries. He is described as a white male, aged 18 to 21, slim build, short fair hair and wearing a green Parka coat with fur trim and a white shirt.

Detective Constable Mark Soutter of Glasgow CID said:

“This has been a high value fraud, whereby goods have been obtained by deception. As part of our ongoing inquiries we’re eager to identify and trace the man pictured and would ask anyone who can help us to get in touch as soon as possible.”

Anyone with information should contact Police Scotland on 101 and quote incident number 4319 of 21 July 2019. Alternatively an anonymous report can be made to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
