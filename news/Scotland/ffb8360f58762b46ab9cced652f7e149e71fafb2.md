Police in South Lanarkshire are appealing for information after a car was set on fire in Larkhall.

Around 11pm on Wednesday, 8 July, officers received reports of a parked red Vauxhalll Insignia on fire on Annbank Street. The fire was extinguished by the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and nobody was injured as a result.

The fire caused substantial damage to the vehicle, which belongs to an elderly couple, and forensic examinations have found this to have been a wilful fireraising.

Detective Constable Andrew Sinclair of Cambuslang CID said: “We are appealing to members of the public who may have any information relating to this deliberate fire.

“This was a reckless act and I would like to stress how dangerous wilful fire-raising is and discourage anyone from setting a fire deliberately and know that officers will investigate any reports robustly.”

Anyone with information is asked to contact Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident 4147 of 8 July, 2020, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
