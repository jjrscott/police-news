Police are appealing for information following a housebreaking at council buildings in Torry, Aberdeen.

Between 10.30 pm on Friday, 24 July and 6.30 am on Saturday, 25 July, 2020, the City Wardens Office on Balnagask Circle was broken into and a quantity of electrical items, including a lap top, radios and other computer equipment, were stolen. It is estimated the theft is worth a four figure sum.

Detective Constable Kev Lynch of the CID Proactive, said:

"This office is based in a mainly residential area so we would like to hear from anyone who may have seen people hanging about the area or indeed, anyone running off with equipment or heavy bags during the night.

"We are especially keen on any dash-cam footage from cars driving on Balnagask Circle or the surrounding streets between 10.30 pm last night and 6.30 this morning.

"Officers are currently checking CCTV in the areas as well as making local enquiries, however, if you have any information that will assist our investigation, then please contact the CID Proactive Unit via 101 quoting reference number 1034 of 25 July 2020."
