Two men have been arrested and charged in connection with a shooting in Cumbernauld that happened earlier this year.

The incident took place in Brunswick Gardens around 6.55pm on Thursday, 23 January, 2020. A 27-year-old man suffered injuries to his back and a 52-year-old woman, who had been walking her dog, was caught up in the incident. Her dog, a white Maltichon called Henry, died as a result of a firearm being discharged.

The two men, both aged 23, have been reported to the Procurator Fiscal and will appear at court at a later date.

Enquiries remain ongoing.
