Police in South Lanarkshire are appealing for information following a wilful fireraising in Larkhall on Monday, 3 August.

Around 8.25pm, the Deli Cabin in Strutherhill Industrial Estate was deliberately set on fire. The Scottish Fire & Rescue Service attended and the fire was extinguished. Nobody was hurt in the incident.

Two men were seen near the premises at the time of the fire and later got into a white transit van which drove off onto the B7078 towards Canderside toll. The first man is described as slim and wearing dark clothing with tracksuit bottoms. The second man is also described as slim and wearing lighter clothing.

The vehicle was recovered a short time later burnt out on Candermill and Marlage Road.

Detective Sergeant Brian Bennie, of Airdrie CID, said: "I am appealing to anyone who was driving in the area at the time and saw any unusual activity or men in a white transit van acting suspiciously to contact police. If you have a dash-cam, I would ask you to please check back and see if you have any footage that could help with our enquiries."

Those with information can contact police on 101, quoting reference number 3467 of 3 August, or can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
