Officers are appealing for information after a man exposed himself in Helensburgh on Thursday, 17 December, 2020.

Between 8.20pm and 8.30pm, a 36-year-old woman was in Townhead Road when a man exposed himself to her and made a comment. After the man was challenged, he ran off.

The woman was left badly shaken by the incident.

Officers are appealing for anyone with any information on this man. He is white, with a local accent, around 5 ft. 10 inches in height, a slim build and dark brown hair. He is described as having patchy facial hair. He was wearing a navy blue jacket with a white hooded top underneath.

Officers are in the process of reviewing relevant CCTV footage for any additional information.

Detective Constable David Jamieson said: â€œI am appealing to anyone who was in the area around the time of the incident to contact us. Perhaps you saw the man when he was running off after the incident. I would also ask motorists with dash cams who were in the area to check their dash cams as they may have captured images which could assist our investigation."
