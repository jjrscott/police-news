Emergency services attended and a 52-year-old woman was pronounced dead at the scene.

The road was closed for around five hours to allow a full collision investigation to take place.

“We are currently conducting enquiries to establish the full circumstances surrounding the collision and I would ask those who may have information to get in contact with police.

“High Street would have been a busy area at the time and I would ask anyone who was in the area that may have witnessed the crash to contact officers.

“I would also appeal to anyone who has any dashcam or CCTV footage that can assist with our investigation to come forward.

“Police can be contacted on 101 quoting incident number 2147 of Friday, 13 November, 2020.”
