Communities in Renfrewshire and Inverclyde are being urged to continue with their commitment to following the stay at home guidance.

Chief Superintendent Alan Murray, divisional commander, praised residents across the division who have supported the policing response to coronavirus.

Chief Supt Murray said: “I am grateful to everyone who is playing their part at this time.

“Police Scotland officers are out in our communities 24/7 engaging with people and encouraging compliance. As a last resort, and only where people continue to defy the very clear advice being given, we are using enforcement powers.

“As the Chief Constable said today, we need everyone to continue to play their part to protect the NHS and save lives.

“The restrictions are still in place and although we recognise it is a difficult time for everybody, we must stick with it.

“I also want the people of Renfrewshire and Inverclyde to know that day-to-day policing continues. If you need to report a crime or have concerns that someone is at risk of harm, please get in touch.”
