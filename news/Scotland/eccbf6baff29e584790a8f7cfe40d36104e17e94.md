Police in Fife are appealing for information following a crash on the A92 eastbound between Cowdenbeath and Lochgelly.

The incident happened around 2.50pm on Wednesday, 26 February, when four lorries were involved in a crash having been required to take evasive action near the interchange with the A909.

A 55 year-old man sustained leg injuries and was taken to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy by the Scottish Ambulance Service.

Sergeant Nicola Young of the Fife Road Policing Unit, said: “We are eager to trace the driver of a white Mercedes Sprinter van which was travelling in an eastbound direction at the time of the crash to help with our investigation into the full circumstances of what happened.

“We are also appealing for any dash-cam footage of the incident or the white Mercedes van. Anyone with information that can help please call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident 1990 of Wednesday, 26 February.”
