Police Scotland can confirm a 54-year-old woman has died following a road crash on the A82 on Tuesday, 15 September, 2020.

The incident happened around 3.50am on the A82, one mile south of Crianlarich in the Stirlingshire area and involved a silver MG ZS car and a lorry.

Emergency services attended, however the woman was pronounced dead at the scene. The road was closed until 2.15pm whilst an investigation was carried out.

Road Policing Sergeant David Marr said: "We are supporting the woman's family at this incredibly difficult time.

"Enquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances of the collision. I would urge anyone who may have witnessed the crash but has not yet spoken to police to come forward. I am particularly keen to speak to anyone who may have dash cam footage on the A82 between Helensburgh and Crianlarich prior to the crash which could help with our investigation."
