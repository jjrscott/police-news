Police in North Ayrshire are appealing for information following a robbery involving a woman in Irvine.

The incident happened on Eglington Street at its junction with Seagate, around 12pm on Monday, 17 February, 2020.

A 43-year-old woman was grabbed from behind before her bag containing a small sum of money was taken from her. The suspect then ran off in the direction of Castle Street towards the River Irvine.

The woman was uninjured as a result.

The suspect is described as a white man, wearing a black jacket, baseball cap, jeans and white trainers.

Detective Sergeant Stephen McCulloch, of Saltcoats CID, said: “The woman involved in this robbery was uninjured but has been left evidently shaken.

“This happened on a busy road where there would have been a number of witnesses and we would ask anyone with any information to get in touch.

“We are also keen to speak to the driver of a white transit van who got out his vehicle and ran after the suspect.

“I would also appeal to anyone who may have dashcam footage to get in touch with Police.”

Police Scotland can be contacted on 101 quoting incident number 1503 of Monday 17 February, 2020.
