Officers in Glasgow are appealing for information and witnesses following a serious assault in the Pollock area of the city.

A 40-year-old man sustained a serious arm injury during a disturbance at a property in Househillmuir Road, around 10.30pm on Friday, 3 July. He was taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and released after treatment.

A man, described as around 19 to 20-years-old and wearing a grey tracksuit, left the address and officers are keen to trace him and believe he may also have been injured.

Detective Natalie Timothy, of Govan CID, said: “We are eager to trace the young man who left the property. If anyone saw anything or know anything about those involved, then please get in touch.

“Also, anyone who has CCTV footage or was driving in the area and has dash-cam footage that could help with our enquiries is asked to contact us on 101, quoting incident 4050 of Friday, 3 July, 2020 or call the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.”
