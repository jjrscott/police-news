Police Scotland acknowledges today’s sentencing of Duncan Grant, who has been jailed for 12 months. The 30-year-old’s sentencing at Glasgow Sheriff Court follows his guilty plea in July, in relation to the possession and distribution of over 1,600 indecent images of children.

Detective Sergeant Bruce Ward, from Police Scotland’s National Child Abuse Investigation Unit, said: “Today's sentencing means that Duncan Grant will have the next year to reflect on his truly despicable actions.

"He acted with no regard to the young victims in the images and videos he was viewing, under the mistaken belief that the internet would provide him with anonymity. Our investigation and today's result proves he was wrong and this same fate awaits other potential offenders.

"Any form of child sexual abuse is a serious criminal offence and is a priority for Police Scotland. We encourage anyone with concerns about a child at risk of abuse, or a potential victim, to contact police immediately.”
