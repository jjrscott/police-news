Police Scotland can confirm drugs worth around £10,000 have been recovered from a vehicle which was stopped on the A9 south of Inverness.

Officers stopped the southbound car near Moy around 11.40pm on Wednesday, 28 October and recovered cocaine, along with a sum of cash worth more than £5,000, following a search.

A 30-year-old man was arrested in connection with the recovery. He will be subject of a report to the Procurator Fiscal.

Detective Sergeant Joe Newson at Aviemore Police Station said: “We will continue to stamp out any drug related activity as there is no place for drugs and the misery they bring in our communities.

“Anyone who has any concerns surrounding drugs is asked to contact police on 101 or alternatively Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where anonymity can be maintained.”
