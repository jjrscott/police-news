Police Scotland are appealing for witnesses following a fatal crash near Tealing.

The crash happened around 8.10am on Thursday, 12 March, 2020 on the A90 between Dundee and Forfar at the Petterden junction and involved two vehicles: a van and a bus.

The driver of the van, a 32-year-old man, was pronounced dead at the scene.

Several people from the bus were taken to Ninewells Hospital for treatment.

The A90 northbound carriageway currently has one lane open and the A982 between Petterden and Glamis remains closed and is expected to be for some time.

Inspector Greg Burns from Police Scotland’s Road Policing Unit said: “This was a serious collision and our thoughts at this time are with the friends and family of the man who has lost his life, along with all of those involved.

“Our enquiries into the cause of the crash are ongoing and I would ask anyone who saw what happened, and has not yet spoken to officers, to come forward. I would ask motorists using the A90 this morning and who may have been recording via dash-cam devices to check their systems and provide any relevant footage to us as soon as possible.”

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting incident number 0550 of Thursday, 22 March.
