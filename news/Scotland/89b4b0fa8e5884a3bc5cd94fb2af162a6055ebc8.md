We welcome the conviction and sentencing of Hugh Steele, who was yesterday sentenced to nine and a half years in prison for causing the death of Carol Georges by driving dangerously and while unfit through drugs.

The two car crash happened on the A749 near the Cathkin bypass on 3 November 2019 shortly after 8pm. Sadly Carol Georges died at the scene and another man was taken to hospital with serious injuries.

Chief Inspector Darren Faulds from the Road Policing Division said: “By getting behind the wheel of a car while under the influence of drugs and driving dangerously, Hugh Steel has shown absolutely no regard for the safety of other road users. His actions have cruelly taken away an innocent member of the public from their family and friends.

“The consequences of driving dangerously and under the influence of alcohol or drugs cannot be understated and there is no excuse for it. We all have a part to play to keep each other safe while using the roads. No family should have to lose a loved one because of the selfish and dangerous actions of another driver and cases like this highlight why you should never drink or drug drive.

“If you have concerns someone may be drink or drug driving, please call us so we can take action.”
