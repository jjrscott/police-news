Road Policing officers in Glasgow are appealing for witnesses and dashcam footage following a fatal road crash, which took place last night on Glasgow Road in the Barrhead area.

The single-car crash happened around 9.50pm and involved a red Honda Civic.

The 31-year-old male driver was pronounced dead at the scene, while the passengers, aged 25, 26 and 31 all sustained serious but not life threatening injuries.

Sergeant Michael McCusker, from the Greater Glasgow Road Policing Unit, said: “Our thoughts are with the deceased’s loved ones at this time, along with others who were involved in this incident.

“As we continue our investigation, we’re asking for anyone who was in the Glasgow Road area around the time of the crash to please get in touch, whether you saw it take place or may have seen the car a little earlier.

“We are also interested in seeing potential dashcam footage prior to the incident, which could greatly assist our enquiries.”

Anyone with information is asked to contact Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident 3853 of 7 March.
