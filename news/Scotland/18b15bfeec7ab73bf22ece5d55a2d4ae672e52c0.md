Police Scotland can confirm that a man has been charged in connection with the death of a teenager in Helensburgh.

Officers received a report of a concern for person around 6.25am on Saturday, 25 July. As a result police attended an address in the Johnson Court area of Helensburgh and the body of Kirk Allan, aged 19, was found within.

The 30-year-old man is due to appear at Dumbarton Sheriff Court on Monday, 27 July, 2020.

Detective Inspector Steve Martin said: “Our thoughts remain with Kirk’s family and friends at this very difficult time. Officers will continue to work in and around the community to provide reassurance.

"Enquiries are continuing to find out the full circumstances of what happened, in particular Kirk's movements in the days preceding his death, however, we are not looking for anyone else in connection with the death.

“Anyone with information that may help with our enquiries, who has not already spoken to officers, is asked to contact Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident 1006 of Saturday, 25 July, or make a call anonymously to the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
