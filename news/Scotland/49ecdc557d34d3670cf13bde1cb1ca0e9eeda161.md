Detectives continue to appeal for information after a firearm was discharged at a property in Paisley.

The incident happened in Glencoats Drive around 1.30am on Wednesday, 30 December, 2020.

Detective Inspector Ian Ross, of Paisley CID, said: "Enquiries so far confirm that a firearm was discharged at a property. Thankfully nobody was injured as a result of this reckless act. We also believe a dark-coloured vehicle was in the area shortly before the firearm was discharged and left immediately after.

"We continue to appeal for information and I am particularly keen to speak to two people who were walking a dog on the street at the time - believed to be two males, one possibly a child. It's possible they may have heard or witnessed the incident. I would ask them, or anyone who may have information in connection, to contact police on 101 quoting reference number 0190 of 30 December.

"Local residents will continue to see a highly visible police presence in the area whilst our enquiries continue. If you have any concerns or information in connection, please do speak to our officers who will be carrying out patrols."
