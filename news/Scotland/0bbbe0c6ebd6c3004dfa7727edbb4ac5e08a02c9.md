A teenager responsible for serious sexual and physical violence towards children has been convicted following a trial at Glasgow High Court today (Friday, 18 December, 2020).

The 17-year-old committed the offences in the East Ayrshire area between 3 July and 6 August 2019, which included two counts of rape, two counts of serious sexual assault and assault to danger of life.

An investigation was launched by detectives from Kilmarnock's Public Protection Unit which resulted in the then 16-year-old boy being arrested and charged in connection with the incidents.

Detective Inspector Martin Prendergast, Public Protection Unit, said: "This teenager is a dangerous and predatory individual who has shown no remorse towards the victims, all of whom were children. He played on their vulnerabilities and his actions will no doubt have lasting effects on them. These were horrific crimes for someone of such a young age to commit and we welcome his conviction today.

"Police Scotland is committed to the protection of children and to bringing all perpetrators of sexual abuse to justice. We would urge anyone who wishes to report any child protection concerns or sexual crime to contact us on 101 so we can conduct a thorough investigation. We will always treat reports of sexual offences with the utmost professionalism and sensitivity."
