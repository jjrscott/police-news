Police in the Highlands are appealing for information following a fatal road crash in Aviemore.

The incident happened around 11.45pm on Friday, 7 February, 2020, when a Black Ford S-Max collided with a tree on the B970 near Inverdruie, Aviemore.

Emergency services attended and both men, the 39-year-old driver and 36-year-old passenger, were pronounced dead at the scene.

The road was closed for around eight hours whilst enquiries were carried out.

Sergeant Alasdair Mackay, of Highland and Islands Road Policing, said: “Our thoughts are with the families of the men involved and enquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances surrounding the crash.

“The road has a number of residential houses and businesses nearby and I would ask anyone who may have seen anything to get in contact with police.

“Although late at night, this is a busy road and I am appealing to anyone who has any information to come forward.

“I would also urge those with dashcam footage that may help with our investigation to get in contact with police by calling 101 and quoting incident number 4537 of Friday, 7 February, 2020."
