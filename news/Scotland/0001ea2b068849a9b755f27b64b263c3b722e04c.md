Police Scotland is carrying out inquiries after three houses were broken into in St Andrews, Fife.

The break-ins happened in Berry Place, Learmonth Place and Crawford Gardens between 5.30pm & 9pm on Tuesday 3 March.

Large quantities of money and jewellery were stolen.

Detective Inspector Chris Mill said:

"From our initial inquiries we believe all three break-ins are connected, but I would like to reassure the people who stay in St Andrews and North East Fife that these sort of crimes are relatively rare. When they do happen we will ensure every effort is made to identify those response and bring them to justice.

"We will be carrying out door to door enquiries and carrying out road stops checks to assist our investigation.

"Anyone with any information, or who knows who is responsible should contact Police Scotland on 101 quoting reference number 3588 of 3 March".
