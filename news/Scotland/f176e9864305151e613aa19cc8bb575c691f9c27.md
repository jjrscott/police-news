Dylan’s family have released the following statement: “Dylan was a loving son, brother and grandson, and was loved by all that had the pleasure of knowing him. He is sorely missed by all. He had an adventurous and outgoing soul and had the biggest heart.

“Our family would like to thank all of the emergency services for their efforts at the scene and we would ask that our family’s privacy is respected at this difficult time.”

Sergeant Chris Smith, of the North Road Policing Unit, said: “We are continuing to support the families of the two men, whilst we continue our investigations into the cause of the crash.
