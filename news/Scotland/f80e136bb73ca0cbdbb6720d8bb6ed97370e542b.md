Officers in Aberdeen are appealing for information after a man was found in Tillydrone on Friday morning with unexplained injuries.

Around 11am on Friday, 2 October, officers were called to Pennan Road after a 34-year-old man was found on the street with head injuries. He was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for treatment.

Detective Constable Kayleigh Mclean, from North East CID, said: “We are carrying out enquiries to establish the exact circumstances and how this man was injured.

“As part of this investigation, we are keen to trace a yellow Seat Ibiza, which we believe was in the area just before the man was discovered and may be able to assist our enquiries.

“Anyone with any information on the incident itself, or the car in question, is encouraged to contact police on 101, quoting incident 1030 of 2 October. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, if you wish to remain anonymous.”
