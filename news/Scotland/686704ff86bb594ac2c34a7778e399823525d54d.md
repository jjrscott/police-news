As part of planned operations in the South of Edinburgh on Wednesday, 22 January, 2020, two men have been arrested and charged in connection with a number of alleged housebreakings.

Police have been investigating a number of housebreakings to business and domestic premises, particularly in the Gilmerton and Ferniehill areas, which have included keys for motor vehicles being taken and then used to steal cars from outside the houses.

The two men aged 22 and 23 years are due to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Thursday, 23 January, 2020.

Detective Inspector Jon Pleasance at Edinburgh Division CID said:

“Housebreaking is a horrible crime and remains a priority for Police in Edinburgh. I would like to thank the public for their support in these investigations and we will continue to work closely with communities to ensure that we are disrupting those individuals committing these crimes and bringing them to justice.

“I’d also like to reinforce to residents the importance of maintaining household security and always ensuring window and doors are locked. I’d also urge householders who have CCTV or doorbells with video recording facilities to contact local police should they capture any suspicious activity.”
