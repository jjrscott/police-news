Police in Edinburgh have released CCTV images of a man that officers believe may be able to assist them with enquiries into robbery at a shop in the city.

The incident happened at premises on Ashley Terrace around 7pm on Tuesday, 23 June, 2020 and a three figure sum of cash was stolen.

Officers believe that the man shown in the image may have information that will assist with their investigation and would appeal to any members of the public who recognise him to come forward.

The man is described as black, aged in his late 20s to early 30s, of a medium build and around 5ft 10ins tall. He is shown in the image wearing a dark grey suit jacket, a black hooded top, black trousers and black leather shoes.

Detective Constable Zaira Marker of Corstorphine CID said: â€œNobody was injured but this was a frightening experience for staff and customers alike. Our enquiries are ongoing and I would urge anyone who may be able to identify the man in the images to come forward.

"If you can assist with this or have any other information at all please call 101, quoting incident 3084 of 23 June, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
