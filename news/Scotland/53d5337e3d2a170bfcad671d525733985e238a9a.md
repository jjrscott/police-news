Police are appealing for information after a man was assaulted and his van stolen from him in Shotts on Monday, 27 July, 2020.

Around 10.45 pm on Monday night, a 28-year-old man had just parked his white Ford Transit van outside a Chinese takeaway on Station Road, Shotts, when he was pushed to the ground by a man who then jumped in to the van and drove off towards the roundabout at Calderside Garage.

The van driver was not injured but obviously shaken by the incident.

The suspect is described as White, in his 20s, wearing dark clothing and either a hat or a hood.

Detective Constable Sharon McBride, Wishaw CID, said:

"We believe that this was an opportunist crime as the man had just stepped out of his van when he was pushed to the ground and the van stolen.

"Station Road is a busy area and I am sure that someone would have seen the van driven at speed - initially with the driver's door wide open, towards Benhar Road, possibly heading towards Salsburgh.

"If you have any information about the incident or the van, which has no identifiable markings, then please contact police at Wishaw via 101 quoting reference number 3742 of 27 July, 2020, or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 where details can be given in confidence."
