A 27-year-old man has been arrested and charged in connection with a bogus workmen incident in Newmachar, Aberdeenshire.

He is due to appear at Aberdeen Sheriff Court on Monday, 3 August, 2020.

The incident happened about 2.30pm on Thursday, 30 July, at a property on Brownhill Drive when a 72-year-old woman was targeted and had a quantity of money stolen from her bank account.

Detective Constable Katy-Jo Reid, of Aberdeen CID, said: “This type of activity often affects vulnerable and older people and we will continue to target the professional con artists who are responsible.

“People can take some simple but effective steps to protect themselves if someone turns up on their doorstep offering to undertake work, including asking for identification, not making on the spot decisions and never handing over money on the doorstep.

“Anyone with concerns regarding this type of activity should contact Police Scotland on 101.”
