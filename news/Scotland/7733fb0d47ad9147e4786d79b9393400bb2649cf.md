Police Scotland is appealing for information after a 15-year-old boy was sexually assaulted at a bus terminus in Clydebank.

The boy was at the terminus at Chalmers Street at 11.20pm on Monday 1 June, when he was approached by a man, who engaged him in conversation and then sexually assaulted him.

Detective Sergeant Bernadette Wall said:

"The boy was shocked but physically unhurt by the incident. He moved away from the man and watched him get on board a number 60 bus and leave the area.

"We are keen to trace the man, described as black, 5ft 10 inches in height, aged in his late 20's, foreign accent but spoke English. He was wearing a black baseball cap, a grey spotted t-shirt with white on the shoulder, dark coloured bottoms, earring within left ear and carrying a black backpack with a water bottle within the side compartment which was wrapped within a plastic bag.

"We have been carrying out enquiries to establish the identity of the man and we would appeal to anyone who may know who the man is to get in touch with Police Scotland on 101, quoting 4885 of 1 June."
