As the Easter holiday weekend gets under way, we would like to thank the people of Fife for staying at home.

Chief Superintendent Derek McEwan, divisional commander, said: "The vast majority of people across the division have been complying with the instructions and I would like to thank everyone for playing their part.

"The Chief Constable stressed the importance of this when he spoke with the First Minister today and asked the public to continue with the changes, even during the holiday and as the weather gets better.

"We have dedicated patrols in place across the Kingdom and this will include our many beauty spots, such as our beaches and open spaces.

“Police Scotland officers are engaging with people, establishing their individual circumstances and explaining the risks to public health of failing to comply with guidance.“We will always encourage compliance but, as a last resort, we will use the enforcement powers which are in place.

“So please, over the Easter weekend stay at home and stay safe, maybe connect online instead of holding a house party.

"This is a challenging time for us all and I want to thank the public for their overwhelming support and co-operation. Our collective efforts will protect the NHS and save lives during the coronavirus pandemic."

Under the emergency powers relating to coronavirus, a total of 29 Fixed Penalty Notices were handed out in Fife between March 27 and April 9.
