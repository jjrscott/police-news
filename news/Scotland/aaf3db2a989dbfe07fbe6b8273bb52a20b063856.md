Police Scotland has been informed about an injured swan at Birnie and Gaddon Lochs with fishing line, hooks and weights attached to it.

PC Ben Pacholek, Fife's Wildlife Crime Liaison Officer, said: “Whilst it is unclear where the swan has become tangled in the fishing line, I’d remind anyone attending Birnie and Gaddon Lochs that fishing is not permitted on either of the reserves. Anyone fishing at the reserves is committing a criminal offence and could find themselves the subject of a report to the Procurator Fiscal."

The SSPCA have been contacted and are attending to provide assistance to the swan.

Members of the public who witness any incidents they consider to be a wildlife crime are asked to report this to Police Scotland. More information on wildlife crime can be found here - https://www.scotland.police.uk/contact-us/report-wildlife-crime
