Officers are appealing for information after a derelict building was deliberately set on fire in Nigg around 9pm on Sunday, 20 December, 2020, in Old Stonehaven Road.

Sergeant Barry Wallace, of the Nigg Community Policing Team, said: “I am appealing to anyone who may have been in the area at the time of this fire and seen anything suspicious to get in touch, including anyone who was driving and may have dash-cam footage that might help with our enquiries.”

“In particular I am keen to find out more about a group of girls, described as being in their mid-teens, who were seen running off from Old Stonehaven Road in the direction of Wellington Terrace. They may have information that could help us.

“If you can help please call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident 3537 of Sunday, 20 December, 2020 or make a call anonymously to the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
