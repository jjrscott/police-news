Police in Dalry are appealing for information after an adult otter was found dead on the Water of Ken last week.

The death was reported to police, after it was found by a fisherman just off Ayr Road, at around 8.15pm on Friday, 2 October.

The animal had been caught in a Fyke net, which appears to have been illegally set to catch crayfish in the river.

PC John Cowan, Wildlife Crime Liaison Officer, said: “The setting of any unlicensed crayfish trap in Scotland is strictly illegal and irresponsible. As we’ve seen in this sad case, it also puts other local wildlife at risk.

“These nets are not designed in a manner to stop other animals from entering, becoming trapped and drowning. This is not the first time that a local otter has died in such a way.

“We are appealing for anyone with information on the net to come forward and contact police on 101, quoting incident 3426 of 2 October.”
