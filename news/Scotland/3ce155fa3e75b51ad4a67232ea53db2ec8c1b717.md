Police in Dumfries and Galloway have charged a man who was caught driving at excessive speed near Lockerbie.

The incident happened around 4pm on Friday, 5 June, 2020, when officers from the Dumfries and Galloway Road Policing Unit, who were carrying out speed checks, became aware of a white Mercedes E220 AMG travelling at high speed on the A74(M) at junction 17.
Officers detected the vehicle which was travelling northbound towards Glasgow on the A74(M) at speeds of up to 138mph.

The 38-year-old driver was stopped and charged in connection with road traffic offences.

Sergeant Jonathan Edgar, of Dumfries and Galloway Road Policing, said: “The dangers of speeding are well known and are a contributing factor in many serious and fatal road crashes. This reckless behaviour displayed in this instance showed utter disregard for the safety of other road users.

"Most people using the roads do so with due regard for the speed limits and driving conditions, but I would appeal to the minority to slow down and in doing so, reduce the chances of collisions and the danger to others.”
