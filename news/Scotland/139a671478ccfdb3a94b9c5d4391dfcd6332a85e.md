Police in Lanarkshire are appealing for information following a spate of wilful fire raisings in East Kilbride.

Officers were called to an address in MacKenzie Gardens around 12.40am on Saturday, 17 October, 2020 where a black Range Rover car was set on fire.

Around 12.30am on Thursday, 15 October, 2020, two cars which were parked in driveways at the same address were also found to be on fire.

On both occasions, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service attended and extinguished the fires safely. There were no injuries.

Officers believe the incidents are linked and are treating the fires as deliberate.

Detective Sergeant, Craig Melrose, of Cambuslang CID, said: “Thankfully nobody has been injured as a result of these reckless acts.

“This is the second incident at this address in a few days and we believe that these fires are linked.

“If you have any CCTV or dashcam footage that could assist us with our investigation, I would ask that you come forward and speak to police.

“I would also ask if anyone noticed anyone acting suspicious in the area that they get in contact with officers.

“Police can be contacted by calling 101 and quoting incident number 0026 of 15 October, 2020. Alternatively, information can be passed anonymously through Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
