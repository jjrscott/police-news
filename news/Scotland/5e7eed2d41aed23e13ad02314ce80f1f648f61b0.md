A man has been arrested and charged in connection with the racially motivated vandalism of posters at Slessor Gardens in Dundee.

The 34-year-old will be reported to the Procurator Fiscal.

Inspector Martin Jenkins, of Maryfield Police Station in Dundee, said: "Whilst incidents of this type are rare, we will not tolerate any racially motivated crime in the Tayside area.

"My message to everyone, whether they have been a victim of this sort of behaviour or witnessed it, is to please report it to us.

"We will take all reports seriously and will thoroughly investigate all instances of this nature to ensure offenders are brought to justice."

John Alexander, Dundee City Council leader, said: "I am impressed by the reaction of the people of Dundee who immediately donated to a fundraising campaign to replace the posters at Slessor Gardens.

"The artist also described the support she received as overwhelming.

"I am grateful to Police Scotland for their work on this matter."

Anyone who wishes to report a crime is asked to speak to Police Scotland via 101, or 999 in an emergency.

Alternatively, the charity Crimestoppers can also be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.
