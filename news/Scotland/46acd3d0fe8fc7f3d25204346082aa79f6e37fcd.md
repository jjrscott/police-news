Officers are seeking the help of the public following a high value break-in overnight. Around 3.44am this morning, Friday, 16 October, 2020 the premises of Kwik Fit in Quarry Road in Irvine were broken into. A large quantity of specialist tools and equipment was stolen in the raid which have a high value. A silver coloured Vauxhall Astra car, Registration Number LO61HWE was also stolen in the raid.

Detective Sergeant Stephen McCulloch at Saltcoats CID said: "We are keen to hear from anyone who may have been around the area of Kwik Fit in the early hours of this morning. Clearly a vehicle must have been used to transport the tools and equipment so we are keen to hear about any vehicle movements in this area either late on Thursday evening or early on Friday morning. In particular we would like to trace a white coloured Peugeot Boxer van which was seen in the area around this time. I would also ask that anyone who may have been driving in the area in a vehicle fitted with a dash-cam device take time to examine their device to see if it holds anything that might be of assistance to us. Callers can contact police on the 101 number and should quote the reference 0516 of 16 October. Anyone wishing to pass on any information while remaining anonymous can do so through Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
