Police are appealing for witnesses after a man died following a road crash in Knightswood, Glasgow, on Thursday, 24 September, 2020.

Around 10.10 pm, a 53-year-old man was struck by a white Audi car while crossing Great Western Road, near to Cowdenhill Road, Knightswood, Glasgow. He was taken by ambulance to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Govan where he died a short time later.

The 20-year-old male driver of the Audi car was not injured.

Sergeant Paul McPherson, Dumbarton Road Policing Department, said:

"Whilst we were able to speak to a number of people last night following the crash, we'd still like to hear from anyone, particularly drivers with dash-cam footage who were in the area at the time.

"We're also keen to speak to the driver of a black Toyota Avensis private hire taxi who had stopped to assist but left just before police arrived. He might have information that will help our inquiry.

"Any information can be passed to officers via 101. Please quote reference number 3779 of 24 September 2020 when calling."
