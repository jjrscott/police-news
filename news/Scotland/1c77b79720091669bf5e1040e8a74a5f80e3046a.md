Police Scotland continues to appeal about the whereabouts of James and Barry Gillespie.

Police Scotland has renewed its appeal for information about the current whereabouts of two men wanted for being involved in serious organised crime in Scotland.

James Gillespie, aged 47 years, and his brother Barry, aged 43 years, are known to have connections in Brazil, Spain, Tenerife and Portugal.

They are also wanted in connection with the abduction and attempted murder of Robert Allan in 2015.

Both men are wanted by Police Scotland and European Arrest Warrants are in place for them. There is also a Crimestoppers reward of Â£5000 available, for each of the men, for information that leads to their arrest.

They are regarded as being very dangerous and the public are warned that if they do see them they should not be approached.

Anyone with information should contact Police Scotland on 101 or information can also be given anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

The Crimestoppers appeals - with photographs of both men - are available below:
