Police in the North East are appealing for information after a series of break-ins to houses across Aberdeenshire.

The incidents happened between Monday 6 January and Thursday 9 January, at properties on St James Place and Saphock Place, Inverurie; Pantoch Drive, Banchory; and Kirkburn, Laurencekirk.

A total of four properties were broken into, with a number of items stolen including jewellery and cash. The total value of items stolen has been valued at a mid four-figure sum.

Detective Inspector Grant Pert, from Aberdeen CID, said: “I am keen to speak with anyone with any information about these crimes, all of which we believe took place during daytime hours.

“We are keeping an open mind about whether these incidents are linked. Any information provided to Police could make a difference and help us bring these enquiries to a successful end.”

Anyone with information should call 101, or alternatively Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, if you wish to remain anonymous.
