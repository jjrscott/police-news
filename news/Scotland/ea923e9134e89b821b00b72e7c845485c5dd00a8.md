Police in Lanarkshire are appealing for information following an incident of wilful fire raising in Shotts.

Officers were called around 7pm on Sunday, 8 November, 2020 following the report of a car on fire in the car park of Shotts Prison on Newmill and Canthill Road.

The Scottish Fire and Rescue service attended and extinguished the fire safely and there were no injuries.

Enquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances surrounding the fire which is currently being treated as suspicious.

Detective Inspector Kenny Dalrymple, of Lanarkshire CID, said: “Thankfully nobody has been injured as a result of this thoughtless act.

“We are treating the fire as deliberate and I would ask if you were in the area at the time and noticed anyone acting suspicious that you get in contact with officers.

“If you were driving in the area and have any dashcam footage that could assist with our investigation I would urge you to come forward.

“Police can be contacted by calling 101 quoting incident number 2912 of Sunday, 8 November, 2020.”
