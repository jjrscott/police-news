Road Policing Officers in Glasgow are appealing for witnesses after a 16-year-old girl was killed in a collision on Great Western Road last night. (Saturday 5 December)

Officers were called to the incident, near to the junction of Garscadden Road South, around 7.45pm after reports a pedestrian had been hit by a grey Ford Focus.

The teenager was taken to The Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, where she passed away.
