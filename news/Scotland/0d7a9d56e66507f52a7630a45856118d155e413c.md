Officers in Renfrewshire are appealing for information after a wilful fire raising in Paisley.

Around 11.55pm on Sunday, 13 December, police received reports of two cars on fire in a driveway on Hawkhead Road. The fire was extinguished by the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and nobody was injured as a result.

Substantial damage was caused to one of the vehicles, a grey Audi and the second vehicle, a black Jaguar, sustained minimal fire damage under the front nearside wheel as a result of the fire which is being treated as suspicious.

Detective Constable Liam Rodgers of Paisley CID said: “We are appealing for information from members of the public relating to this deliberate fire.

“Thankfully no one was injured as a result of this reckless act, but I would like to stress how dangerous wilful fire raising is and discourage anyone from setting a fire deliberately and know that officers will always investigate any reports robustly and thoroughly.

“If you saw anything suspicious in the area or have any information about the above incident and have not already spoken to police I would urge you to do so as soon as possible.”

Anyone with information is asked to contact Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident 3525 of 13 December, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.”
