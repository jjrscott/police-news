Police in Clydebank are appealing for information and witnesses following a serious assault on Great Western Road.

Detective Sergeant Peter Jarvis said: “We are appealing to anyone who witnessed this violent attack or the erratic driving which preceded it to please come forward.

“We are also keen to receive any potential dashcam footage from motorists who were in the area around the time in question and may have witnessed the crash.”
