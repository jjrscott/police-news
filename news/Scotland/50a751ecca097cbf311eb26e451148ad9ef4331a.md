**Published 27 April**

As part of Tayside Division’s ongoing anti-drugs initiative, Operation Slate, three men aged 67, 18 and 17, along with two women aged 47 and 19, were arrested at an address in Abbotsford Place, Dundee, on Sunday, 26 April, 2020. A quantity of crack cocaine valued at over £13,000 was recovered. Enquiries are continuing and those arrested are expected to appear at Dundee Sheriff Court on Tuesday, 28 April, 2020.

Dundee Local Area Commander, Chief Inspector David McIntosh said: “Covid-19 is currently taking up much of everyone’s attention, however daily policing activity goes on and we continue to work with partner agencies and local communities to tackle crime and provide support to the vulnerable. Criminals may try to take advantage of the current lockdown and physical restrictions to further their own aims, but I can assure everyone that we remain focused on keeping our communities safe, deterring and detecting crime.”

“Anyone having concerns or information regarding drug dealing or crime of any sort in their area should please call 101 and let us know. Information can also be passed anonymously through the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
