Police in the Highlands are appealing for information following a road traffic crash near Lybster.

The incident happened around 12.56pm on Saturday, 5 December, 2020 on the A99 at Burrigill, between Wick and Latheron, Caithness and involved a silver Ford Mondeo estate.

The driver, a 61 year old man, was taken to Caithness General Hospital, Wick where he later died.

The road was closed for around five and half hours to allow a full collision investigation to take place.

Police Sergeant, Angus MacLeod of Highlands and Islands Road Policing Unit, said: “Our thoughts are very much with the deceased’s family and friends at this time.

“We are appealing for any other road users who may have been in the area at the time and either saw the incident take place, or saw the silver Ford Mondeo prior to the crash, to please come forward.

“I would also ask if anyone has any dashcam footage that could assist with our investigation that they come forward and speak to officers.

“Police can be contacted by calling 101 and quoting incident number 1516 of Saturday 5 December, 2020.”
