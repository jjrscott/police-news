Around 4.45am on Wednesday, 1 January, two 16-year-old boys were approached by a man on McLaurin Crescent and robbed of their mobile phones.

The teenagers were unharmed during the incident.

The suspect left the scene on foot. He is described as white, aged in his thirties, medium build and was wearing dark-coloured clothing.

Officers carrying out inquiries into the incident are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

Detective Constable Alasdair Whitelaw from Paisley CID said: “The robbery took place in a residential area and, despite the time of night, may have been witnessed by members of the public who would have been celebrating Hogmanay.

“Our inquiries continue to establish which direction the suspect left the area in and I would appeal to anyone who may have seen a man acting suspiciously in the area, or those with any information which may be able to assist with our investigation, to come forward.”

Anyone with information should call Police Scotland on 101 and quote incident number 1591 of 1 January. Alternatively, an anonymous report can be given to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
