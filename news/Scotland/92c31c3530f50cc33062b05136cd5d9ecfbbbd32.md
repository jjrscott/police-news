Two men have been charged in connection with drug offences after a large quantity of cannabis was found in a car on the A74(M).

On Wednesday, 17 June, 2020, officers from Lockerbie’s Road Policing Unit stopped a vehicle on the northbound carriageway near to Eaglesfield.

A search of the vehicle found six kilograms of cannabis with an estimated street value of £60,000 and a four-figure sum of cash.

Detective Inspector Dean Little, of Dumfries CID, said:

“As a result of a proactive stop of a vehicle on the motorway network, a large quantity of drugs has been removed from circulation.

“Two men, aged 37 and 27, have been charged in connection with the incident and are due to appear at Dumfries Sheriff Court today (Thursday, 18 June).

“Removing illegal substances from our communities remains a priority for officers and I would encourage anyone with information about drug crime in their area to report this to us so that we can investigate thoroughly.”
