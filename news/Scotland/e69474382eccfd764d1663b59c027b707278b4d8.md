A man who died following a fatal collision in the Highlands can be named as Philip Reynolds Latham of Dunbeath, Caithness.

The 61-year-old was driving a silver Ford Mondeo estate near Lybster when the car collided with a wall while travelling south on the A99 just passed the entrance to Remiggy Farm. The incident happened around 12.55pm on Saturday, 5 December.

He was taken to Caithness General Hospital, Wick, where he later died.

The road was closed for around five and half hours to allow a full collision investigation to take place.

Sergeant Angus MacLeod, of Highlands and Islands Road Policing Unit, said: “We are still appealing for any other road users who may have been in the area at the time and either saw the incident take place, or saw the silver Ford Mondeo prior to the crash, to please come forward.

“I would also ask if anyone has any dashcam footage that could assist with our investigation that they speak to officers."

Anyone with information should contact Police Scotland on 101 quoting incident number 1516 of Saturday, 5 December, 2020.
