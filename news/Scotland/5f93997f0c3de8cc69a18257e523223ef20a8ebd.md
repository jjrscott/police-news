Detectives at Clydebank are appealing for information following an attempted robbery at a shop in Duntocher on Tuesday, 21 July, 2020.

Around 10.30am on Tuesday morning, a man entered Stevie’s Supasave store on Beeches Road, and threatened the shop staff with a knife and demanded money. When staff refused, the suspect ran off empty handed.

The man working in the shop was uninjured but badly shaken as a result of the incident.

The man responsible is described as white, and in his late teens to early twenties. He was wearing black clothing and was wearing a black face covering pulled up over his mouth and nose.

Detective Constable Imran Abuzar of Clydebank Police Station said: “We are currently carrying out enquiries in the area and gathering CCTV footage to establish more information on this incident and trace the man responsible.

“I am urging anyone who witnessed anything suspicious, or who has information that will assist our investigation to contact detectives at Clydebank through 101 quoting reference number 1072 of 21 July. Alternatively Crimestoppers can be contacted on 0800 555 111, where anonymity can be maintained.”
