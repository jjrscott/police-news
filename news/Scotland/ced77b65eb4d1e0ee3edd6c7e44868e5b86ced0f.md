Police in Aberdeen are appealing for information after a man indecently exposed himself in the Northfield area.

The incident happened around 7.50am on Sunday, 12 July, 2020. A 60-year-old woman was walking her dog along Provost Rust Drive towards Byron Crescent when she saw a man walking past her exposing himself.

The male suspect is described as being between 25-35 years of age with a local accent, about 5ft 7ins tall, of medium build with brown hair, brushed forward and has distinctive fair skin and freckles across his arms and face. He was wearing a dark and white coloured vertical stripped top, dark blue jeans and white high-top trainers. He was last seen walking along Bonnyview Drive.

Sergeant Mark Cobban, of Aberdeen Bucksburn Police Station, said:

"I'm appealing to anyone who may have been in the area at the time of the incident, or saw a man fitting the description either before or shortly after it took place, to contact us.

"Anyone with information can contact police on 101, quoting reference number 1328 of 12 July."
