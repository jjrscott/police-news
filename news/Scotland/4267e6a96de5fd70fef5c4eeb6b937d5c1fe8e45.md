Two men, both aged 30, have today (Friday, 17 January, 2020), been convicted of the murder of George Calvert from Paisley.

Stephen O’Donnell and Robert Muir were found guilty of the murder of the 40-year-old, following a trial at the High Court in Glasgow.

Officers and emergency services were called to Glen Street, Paisley, around 2.45pm on Tuesday, 19 March, 2019, where George was found with serious injuries to his head. He was taken by ambulance to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital where he was later pronounced dead.

Detective Inspector Robert Bowie, of Paisley Criminal Investigations Department, said:

“This was a brutal attack and one that has left George’s family absolutely devastated. I hope this conviction has given his family some sense of justice although due to O’Donnell and Muir's actions, they will have to live with the loss of a much loved family member.

“I would also like to thank those who assisted with vital information in relation to our investigation."
