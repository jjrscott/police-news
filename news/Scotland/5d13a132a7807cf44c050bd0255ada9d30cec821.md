Police Scotland has acknowledged the conviction of Joseph Ray who has admitted killing his two-month-old daughter.

Ava Ray died at the Royal Hospital for Sick Kids in Edinburgh on Friday, 2 November, 2012, having been admitted after taking unwell the previous day.

This prompted an enquiry led by Police Scotland's Major Investigations Team, resulting in Joseph Ray being charged in connection with her death.

The 32-year-old pleaded guilty to culpable homicide at the High Court in Glasgow today (Monday, 5 October).

Detective Inspector David Pinkney said: “Ray took the life of his daughter. Just months old, Ava should have been safest in the care of her father - instead he inflicted injuries that she would never recover from.

"I would like to thank Ava’s extended family for their support throughout the investigation and I sincerely hope that the punishment handed to Ray offers them some form of closure so that they can begin to move on with their lives."

Ray will return to court next month to be sentenced.
