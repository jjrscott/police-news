Christopher Webb (28) was sentenced yesterday, Monday, 7 September, 2020, at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court to three years and nine months in connection with possessing and distributing indecent images and videos of children.

Detective Chief Inspector Richard Banks, National Child Abuse Investigation Unit, said:

“The sentence imposed reflects the seriousness of Webb’s behaviour. He believed that his offending would go undetected by using various online platforms to carry out the sexual exploitation of children at various levels. This was not the case, and as a result of our enquiries he now faces the consequences of his actions.

“Webb is clearly a danger to children and the internet has supplied him the opportunity to indulge in his fantasies at the expense of the child victims. He has also encouraged others to participate in this type of behaviour and exploit vulnerable children in the process.

“Any form of child sexual abuse is a serious criminal offence and is a priority for Police Scotland and I urge anyone with concerns about a child at risk of abuse, or a potential victim, to contact Police immediately.”
