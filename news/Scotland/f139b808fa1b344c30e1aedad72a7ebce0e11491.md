Police Scotland have welcomed the custodial sentencing of Gary Jamieson (34) and John Mack (33) at the High Court in Glasgow today, for drugs and serious and organised crime offences.

Jamieson was sentenced to 4 years 6 months and Mack 4 years. Both men were issued with a Serious Crime Prevention Order which will allow them to be monitored on their release from prison.

Mack and Jamieson were arrested in September and December 2019 respectively following the recovery of 836,000 Etizolam tablets across locations in Glasgow that had an estimated street value of £420,000.

Detective Inspector Craig McPhail, of Glasgow Serious & Organised Crime Pro-Active, said: “We welcome today's sentencing of both Gary Jamieson and John Mack for their involvement in the supply of controlled drugs within the Glasgow area.

“This sends a clear message for anyone who is involved in organised crime that the supply of illegal substances will not be tolerated in our communities.

“Both men will now have to deal with the consequences of their actions.

“The public continue to play a vital role in assisting our investigations and anyone with any concerns about drugs, or who has information about those involved in drugs, should contact Police Scotland on 101 or make an anonymous report to the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
