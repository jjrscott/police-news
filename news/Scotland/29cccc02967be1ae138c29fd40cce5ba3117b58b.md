**Published 17th June 2020**

Two men have been arrested and charged in connection with bogus workmen incidents in various locations in Fife.

The men, aged 37 and 58, were due to appear at Falkirk Sheriff Court on Wednesday, 17 June.

The incidents happened over several weeks from Sunday 26 April to Saturday 16 May, 2020, in Kinghorn, Kelty, and Lochgelly.

Detective Constable Neil Gribbons, of Dunfermline CID, said: “This type of activity often affects vulnerable and older people and we will continue to target the professional con artists who are responsible.

“People can take some simple but effective steps to protect themselves if someone turns up on their doorstep offering to undertake work, including asking for identification, not making on the spot decisions and never handing over money on the doorstep.

“Anyone with concerns regarding this type of activity should contact Police Scotland on 101.”

The current Police Scotland Shut Out Scammers campaign in partnership with Trading Standards Scotland highlights how the public can spot a rogue trader or bogus caller on their doorstep. More information can be found online at www.scotland.police.uk/shutoutscammers
