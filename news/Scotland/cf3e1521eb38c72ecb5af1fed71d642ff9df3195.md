Police are appealing for information after a car was deliberately set alight in Monkton, South Ayrshire, on Friday, 22 May, 2020.

Around 2.30 am, the owner of a white Audi car woke to find his car on fire outside a house in Kilmarnock Road, Monkton. Emergency services attended and the fire was extinguished, however, the car was extensively damaged.

There was no damage to the house.

Detective Constable Stuart McCulloch, South Ayrshire CID, Ayr, said:

"Whilst we believe that this car was specifically targeted, the fact is that if it had not been noticed, the fire could have spread to the house and the other homes and property nearby and someone may have been injured.

"Officers are checking local and private CCTV in the area and carrying out door to door enquiries, however, would appeal to anyone who may have seen either a car or people acting suspiciously in the area this morning to get in touch.

"Any information can be passed to officers at Ayr Police Office via 101. Please quote reference number 0430 of 22 May 2020 when calling. Alternatively, information can be passed anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
