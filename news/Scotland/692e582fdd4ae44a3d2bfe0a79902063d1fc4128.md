A 41-year-old man who carried out two robberies in Forth Valley has been sentenced to over six years in prison.

Graham Wise committed the offences in Alloa and Stirling in January 2020. He pled guilty at the High Court in Edinburgh yesterday (16 June) and was sentenced to six years and four months.

The first incident happened at a Post Office on Mill Road, Alloa, around 5.15pm on Thursday, 23 January. He demanded money from two members of staff and when they refused, he sprayed the 44-year-old female staff member with a substance before attempting to spray the other staff member, a 25-year-old man.

The second incident happened at Riverside Mini-Market on Abbey Road, Stirling, around 7.40pm on Saturday, 25 January. He threatened staff before stealing a three figure sum of cash.

Wise was arrested on Saturday, 25 January and charged with both robberies.
Detective Inspector David MacGregor, of Stirling CID, said:

"This was a fast moving inquiry which involved outstanding work from officers across response policing, community officers and my own CID team. I hope the court result gives some comfort to those impacted by these crimes, particularly the staff at both premises.

"I would like to thank the public for their help during our investigation."
