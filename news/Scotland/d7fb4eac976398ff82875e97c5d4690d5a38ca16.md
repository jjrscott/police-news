As the Easter holiday weekend gets under way, Chief Superintendent John Paterson has asked people in Argyll and West Dunbartonshire to continue staying at home to save lives and protect the NHS.

The divisional commander said: “We are so grateful to the overwhelming majority of people who are complying with the instruction from government to stay at home.

“At Easter, I understand that this is particularly difficult as it is normally a time of year when people travel to or around our division to spend time in some of our beautiful locations.“But we are asking people to continue making those significant changes to their lives for the benefit of all of us. Connect with friends online instead of in person and, at this time, only travel if it's essential.

"The Chief Constable stressed the importance of this when he spoke with the First Minister today and asked the public to continue with the changes, even during the holiday and as the weather gets better.

“Police Scotland will have dedicated patrols in the division throughout the weekend and our officers will engage with people, establish their individual circumstances and explain the risks to public health of failing to comply with guidance. As a last resort, we will use the enforcement powers available to us.

"Thanks to all of our communities who are playing their part in this collective effort to tackle the spread of coronavirus."

Under the emergency powers relating to coronavirus, a total of 42 Fixed Penalty Notices were handed out in Argyll and West Dunbartonshire between March 27 and April 9.
