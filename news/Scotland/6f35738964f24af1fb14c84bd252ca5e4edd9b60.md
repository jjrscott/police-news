Around 5.45pm on Saturday afternoon, the 16 year-old was with a group of around 20 youths aged between 14-16 years of age on Troon beach. An altercation took place and the 16 year-old received a serious facial injury.

We have been carrying out enquiries to trace those involved and studying CCTV footage to identify the group.

“I would urge anyone who witnessed this incident, or who has any information that will assist the investigation into this serious assault to contact Ayr Police Office through 101 quoting reference number 3288 of 15th August.
