Police are appealing for witnesses after a fire in Glasgow City Centre on Wednesday, 2 December, 2020.

Around 9.35 pm on Wednesday night, police and emergency services were called to a fire in a lane off Gordon Street at Buchanan Street in which items including wooden seating and patio heaters caught fire.

Scottish Fire and Rescue attended and extinguished the fire. The damage to the property is estimated to be a five-figure sum.

Detective Constable Mark Soutter, Greater Glasgow CID, said:

"From our enquiries so far, a man is seen going in to the lane then a short time later is seen leaving the area just as the fire takes hold.

"The lane is used for storage by a local business and along with the patio heaters and wooden seating were gas canisters. Thankfully the fire did not affect them but this incident could have been so much worse.

"We have yet to establish whether the fire was deliberate or not, but whatever the case, we need to identify the man seen going in to the lane as his information could prove vital to our investigation.

"He is described as white, wearing dark clothing, dark footwear and a high visibility vest with a logo.

"We believe a short time before the incident he had been speaking to a group of people on Union Street at Gordon Street, possibly a charity, who were handing out orange bags to people in the area.

"We are keen to speak to them, or indeed anyone who has information that may assist our enquiry.

"Information can be passed to officers at Greater Glasgow Police Station via 101. Please quote reference number 3590 of 2 December, 2020, when calling."
