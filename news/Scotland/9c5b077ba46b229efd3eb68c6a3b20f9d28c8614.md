Detectives are asking for the help of the public in an investigation into a serious assault which took place on Sunday, 10 January, 2021. About 8.30pm on Sunday evening, a 39 year old man was assaulted in Ark Lane and on Duke Street in Glasgow. The assault started in Ark Lane and moved down onto Duke Street, where the victim was assaulted in a silver coloured Toyota Avensis car. As a result of the attack the victim was taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary where he is currently being treated for a serious injury to his leg.

Detective Sergeant Stephen Greenshields from the Glasgow Division's CID said: "We want to trace four young men aged between 16-18 years all of whom were wearing puffa style jackets with the hoods up who were involved in this attack. I would ask anyone who may have been in the area of Ark Lane/Duke Street area around this time to get in touch with us if they saw anything which might help in this investigation. I would also appeal to any drivers who may have been on Duke Street in a vehicle fitted with a dash-cam to check their device to see if it contains any footage which might assist us. Callers should use the 101 number and quote the reference number 2990 of 10 January."
