Police in Inverness are appealing for information following a series of break-ins at care homes in the city.

Three incidents were reported at homes on Culduthel Road, Kinmylies Way and Scorguie Avenue overnight between the evening of Tuesday, 2 June, and the morning of Wednesday, 3 June.

Nothing was stolen from the premises on Scorguie Avenue but a sum of cash worth around Â£700 in total was stolen from the other two businesses.

Detective Sergeant Graeme Johnstone of Inverness CID said: "Targeting care homes in this way is a particularly cruel act and extensive enquiries are ongoing to identify whoever is responsible.

"We believe all three incidents are linked and enquiries have established that a grey Audi S5 car was seen in each area overnight.

"We would urge anyone who may have seen this vehicle, who has dashcam footage or any other information which may help enquiries, to come forward as soon as possible."

Call 101 with information, quoting incident 0040 of Wednesday, 3 June, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
