Officers in Lanarkshire are appealing for information and witnesses following a robbery that took place in Blantyre yesterday (Saturday 8 February).

The incident happened at around 8.35pm at a shop in the Stonefield Road area.

A man reportedly threatened members of staff, before stealing a three-figure sum of cash, cigarettes and a bottle of alcohol. He ran from the scene, in the direction of Calder Street, leaving staff uninjured but shaken.

The suspect is described as being 6ft tall, medium build, wearing a grey top with the hood up and a scarf covering his face, along with light grey tracksuit bottoms and dark shoes, possibly covered with black plastic bags.

Detective Sergeant Craig Melrose, from Cambuslang CID, said: “We are carrying out enquiries in the area and are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

“Whether you saw the incident take place, may have seen a man matching this description nearby, or if you drove through the area and may have dashcam footage, any piece of information could prove vital.

“You can contact Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident 3626 of 8 February. Alternatively, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 if you wish to remain anonymous.”
