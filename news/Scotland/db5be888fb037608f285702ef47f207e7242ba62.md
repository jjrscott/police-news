A 22-year-old man has been arrested and charged in connection with a wilful fire raising series in Aberdeen.

A number of communal waste bins were set on fire in the Torry area between Sunday, 28 June and Wednesday, 19 August, 2020.

The man is due to appear at court at a later date. A report will be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal.

Sergeant Chris Wilson, of Aberdeen Torry Police Station, said: "Fortunately no one was injured as a result of any of the fires. However, any fire poses danger and working with Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, we have been driving this message. We have a strong community and always welcome any information that helps keep our area safe."
