Police Scotland has today welcomed the conviction of William Kennedy, 48, following his plea to causing the death of Patricia McIlwraith by dangerous driving and causing the severe injury and danger to life of a man.

William Kennedy was charged following a crash on the A77 near Ballantrae on Saturday 7 July, 2018.

Road Policing Inspector Greg Dinnie said: “William Kennedy chose to drive in a dangerous manner which tragically took the life of an innocent member of the public and seriously injured another which could have so easily been avoided.

“I would like to thank members of the public who witnessed the crash and helped our investigation following what was a very traumatic incident. William Kennedy will have to live with the consequences of his actions and our thoughts remain with Patricia’s family and friends.”
