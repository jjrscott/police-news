Police Scotland is issuing the following statement on behalf of 41-year-old Hope Bastine, a survivor of sexual abuse who was instrumental in the conviction of Derek Lincoln. He was sentenced at the High Court in Glasgow today.

"Words cannot describe how I feel today after the conclusion of my 16-year fight for justice.

"My childhood and adolescence were cruelly stolen from me by a man who repeatedly abused me within a religious cult which legitimised his actions. By incarcerating my abuser for 11 and a half years, Lord Matthews has set me free. Finally, I can give myself permission to pursue happiness and peace.

"Now, my greatest wish is that other victims of abuse living in silence and shame will see that justice can be done and seek freedom too.

"I could not have walked this challenging road alone. I wish to thank every friend and family member who has stood by me and the incredible Scottish police team who spent the last five years engaged in a tireless battle to bring this case to court.

"In particular, I wish to convey my heartfelt gratitude to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) staff member who conducted the harrowing forensic interviews with the sort of compassion and sensitivity which showed me that a man can be good and true and kind.

"Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak today."

\- Hope Bastine
