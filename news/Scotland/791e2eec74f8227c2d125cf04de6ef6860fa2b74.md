Three people have been charged following the search of a property on Forest Park Road, Dundee, on Thursday, 12 March, 2020.

Officers seized crack cocaine with a street value £6,000 from the address.

Two men, aged 18 and 45, and a 25-year-old woman have been charged in connection with drug supply offences and are due to appear at Dundee Sheriff Court today (Friday, 13 March).

Detective Sergeant Simon Murray, of Dundee CID, said: "This seizure again demonstrates our commitment to tackling the illegal supply of drugs and the individuals involved in the supply chain. We will continue to pro-actively target people suspected of being involved in drug dealing within our communities.

“We rely on the public to build our intelligence on drug-related issues and I would encourage anyone to report any suspicious activity or concerns of drug-related activity in their area to the police."
