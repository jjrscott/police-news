Police in Clydebank are appealing for witnesses after a flat was deliberately set on fire.

The incident happened on Dickens Avenue between 7.30pm and 8.30pm on Tuesday, 25 February, 2020.

Nobody was injured and detectives are treating the wilful fire raising as a targeted attack.

Detective Constable Lee Cassidy, of Clydebank CID, said: "We're appealing to anyone who has any information about this incident to contact us.

"Local enquiries have been carried out and we're asking if anyone has any private CCTV in the area that perhaps captures people or vehicles acting suspiciously to contact us.

"The outcome of this fire could've been different given it was a block of four flats so weâ€™re asking if the community can help us find those responsible."

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting incident number 3480 of 25 February or anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
