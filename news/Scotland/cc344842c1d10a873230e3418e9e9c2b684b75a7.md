Police in Irvine are appealing for information after a woman was robbed leaving the car park of the Rivergate shopping centre in the town.

The incident happened around 1.30pm on Thursday, 12 March.

The 62-year-old woman was walking through the multi-storey carpark on her way to the mall when she was approached by a man level 5 who threatened her and demanded money.

She took out her purse and gave him a note. He took the money and ran off towards the ramp leading to McKinlay Crescent.

The man is described as white, aged in his 30s, around 5ft 10in, of slim build and was wearing dark clothing, including a hooded top and white trainers.
Detective Constable Will Thomson, of Saltcoats CID, said: “Fortunately the woman was not injured. But being targeted like this in the middle of the day when she was going shopping has left her feeling very distressed.

“We are appealing for anyone who may have seen what happened, or seen the man both before and after the incident.

“If you can help with our enquiries please call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident 1716 of Thursday, 12 March, or make a call anonymously to the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
