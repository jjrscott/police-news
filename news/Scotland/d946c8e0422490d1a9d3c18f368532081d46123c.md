Police Scotland is appealing for witnesses after a man approached a woman in Forres.

The 21 year old woman was walking in Grantown Road, near to Grant Place around 10pm on Tuesday 12 May when she was approached by the man, who tried to engage with her and make contact with her. The motivation behind this incident is unclear and whilst she was not hurt, she was shaken by this man's actions before he left the area.

He is described as being in his 30’s, 5ft 7 inches tall, of slim build, wearing a black jacket and dark coloured jeans.

Inspector Kerry Rigg said :

‘I would like to reassure the community that our officers are doing everything they can to find the person involved. We do not yet know what this man's intentions were, but I would appeal to anyone who was in the area to get in touch and I'd especially also appeal to motorists who may have being driving in the area and may have captured the incident on dashcam footage to also get in touch’.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact Police Scotland on 101 quoting 3812 of Tuesday 12 May.
