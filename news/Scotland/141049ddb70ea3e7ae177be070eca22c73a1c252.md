On Thursday, 17 and Friday, 18 September, officers from the Divisional Serious and Organised Crime Team and Alcohol and Violence Reduction Unit carried out a pre-planned intelligence-led operation in Inverclyde targeting drugs misuse, which has resulted in five arrests.

Officers searched a number of addresses in Greenock and recovered a quantity of drugs, believed to be heroin with an estimated value in the mid three figures.

Four men and one woman have been arrested and charged in connection with these recoveries. In addition, a further woman has been reported for bypassing her electricity meter.

A full report will be sent to the Procurator Fiscal.

Detective Inspector Robert Bowie, the officer in charge of this operation, said: “Targeting drugs misuse in our local communities remains a priority and we are committed to seizing harmful substances before they reach the hands of the most vulnerable people.

“We will always act on information that we receive from the public on this issue and I would like to thank them for their co-operation. I would urge anyone with concerns or information relating to drugs misuse to contact their local police station by phoning 101. Alternatively Crimestoppers can be contacted on 0800 555 111, where anonymity can be maintained.”
