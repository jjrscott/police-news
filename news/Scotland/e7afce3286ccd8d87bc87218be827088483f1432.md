A man has been arrested and charged following the recovery of cannabis with an estimated street value of £150,000.

The 32-year-old man is due to appear at Inverness Sheriff Court on Friday, 15 January, 2021, after his vehicle was stopped on the A9 near Tomatin by officers on Thursday, 14 January, 2020.

Detective Inspector Reuben Lindsay said: “Drugs brings nothing but misery to our communities and officers are committed to tackling all activity associated with substance misuse, including those who manufacture, deal and get involved in this kind of crime.

“Our work often relies on the support of the public and I would continue to ask anyone with information or concerns about drug misuse to please contact Police Scotland on 101 or make a call anonymously to the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
