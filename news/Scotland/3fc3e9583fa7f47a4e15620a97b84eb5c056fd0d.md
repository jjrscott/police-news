Police Scotland can confirm that a four-figure sum of Class A and Class C drugs has been seized following a brief police pursuit in Tayside.

A blue Renault Clio was spotted travelling at excessive speeds on the A90 and was stopped by officers in the Inchmichael area at around 9.35pm on Thursday, 23 July. A quantity of heroin with an estimated value of £5,500 was subsequently recovered, along with a quantity of valium valued at approximately £2,500.

Two men, aged 22 and 25 have been arrested and charged in connection with the recovery and are expected to appear at Perth Sheriff Court on Monday, 27 July.

Inspector Greg Burns, of the Tayside Road Policing Unit, said: “Drug misuse brings nothing but misery to our communities.

"I want to reassure the people of Tayside that Police Scotland will use every tool and tactic at our disposal to remove these illegal substances from the region, including conducting targeted patrols across our roads.

“If you have any information or concerns about drug misuse, do not hesitate to contact Police Scotland on 101 or report this anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
