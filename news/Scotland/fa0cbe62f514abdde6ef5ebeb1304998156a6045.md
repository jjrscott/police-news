Police in North Ayrshire are appealing for witnesses after a teenager was assaulted and robbed in Kilwinning.

The incident happened around 12.45am on Sunday, 15 March, 2020, on Dalry Road.

A 17-year-old man was walking past a parked bus and was followed by a group of men before dropping his wallet, which was picked up by one of the men. The teenager attempted to retrieve his wallet but was tripped and assaulted as he fell to the ground.

The victim subsequently tried to get his wallet back a second time but was assaulted again by a man who had gotten off the bus.

Detective Constable Ross Keenan, of North Ayrshire CID, said:

“This was a random and unprovoked attack on a teenager that has left him shaken.

“I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed this assault or who may have seen the parked bus.

“Those with any information can contact Police on 101 quoting incident 0259 of 15 March. Alternatively, an anonymous report can be made to the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
