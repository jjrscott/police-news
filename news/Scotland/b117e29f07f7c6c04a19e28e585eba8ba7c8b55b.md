Police are appealing for information following a break-in to a store in Gretna Green, Dumfries & Galloway, on Monday 2 March 2020.

Around 9.20 pm last night, the Wee Big Shop at The Blacksmith’s Complex, Bensmoor Road, Gretna Green, was broken into and a quantity of cigarettes stolen.

Detective Sergeant Graeme Robertson, Dumfries & Galloway CID, said today:

“From our enquiries so far, we know that three people, all dressed in dark clothing with their faces covered with hoods or a scarf, broke into the shop around 9.20 pm and once inside stole a quantity of cigarettes.

A short time later, the thieves entered a light coloured saloon vehicle which was parked at the rear of the premises before making off.

Although the area would have been relatively quiet last night, there are hotels and houses nearby, so it’s possible someone would have seen what happened, or maybe saw the thieves or the car in the area.

“If anybody has any information, or were in the area at the time in their vehicle and has dash-cam footage, then please contact Dumfries & Galloway CID at Dumfries Police Station via 101. Quote reference number 3835 of 2 March 2020 when calling. Alternatively, Crimestoppers can be contacted in confidence on 0800 555 111.
