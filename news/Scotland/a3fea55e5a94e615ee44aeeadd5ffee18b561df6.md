Police Scotland can confirm that two men have been arrested and charged in connection with drug offences following a recovery of cocaine worth £223,000.

Officers from Tayside Road Policing stopped a Ford Fusion car on the M90 Southbound near Perth around 1pm on Wednesday, 28 October, 2020.

A subsequent search of the vehicle was carried out with assistance from Police Scotland’s Dog Unit where two kilograms worth of cocaine was discovered.

Two men aged 62 and 33 have been arrested and charged in connection with the incident and are due to appear at Perth Sheriff Court on Thursday, 29 October, 2020.

Inspector Greg Burns, of Tayside Road Policing Unit, said: “This was a significant recovery that shows the partnership working of the Road Policing, Dog, Community Impact and CID units within Police Scotland.

“We will continue to deter any drug related activity from our communities and act on any information surrounding the supply of drugs across the country.

“There is no place for drugs on our streets and I would ask that if anyone has any concerns surrounding this that they come forward and speak to police.

“Police can be contacted by calling 101 or alternatively Crimestoppers can be contacted on 0800 555 111, where anonymity can be maintained.”
