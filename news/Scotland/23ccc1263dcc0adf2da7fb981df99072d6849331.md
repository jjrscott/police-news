Police Scotland has arrested and charged a man in Glasgow following the recovery of cannabis with a potential street value of Â£800,000.

The recovery took place in the Govan Road area, at around 2pm on Wednesday, 2 September, 2020.

A 21-year-old man has been arrested and charged in connection with drugs offences. He was expected to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court on Thursday, 3 September.

Detective Inspector Cheryl Kelly, of Greater Glasgow CID, said: "Based on intelligence, specialist officers carried out a pro-active operation which resulted in a significant seizure of cannabis.

"We are committed to disrupting the illicit supply of drugs in our communities and we will use every tool and tactic at our disposal to remove these illegal substances from our streets.

"Criminal behaviour like this spreads harm and misery in our communities and it will not be tolerated. We can't tackle this alone though. We rely on the support of the public to build intelligence on drug-related issues so that we can act on their concerns.

"I would urge anyone who is aware of any information about the supply of drugs to report the matter to police on 101, or anonymously through independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
