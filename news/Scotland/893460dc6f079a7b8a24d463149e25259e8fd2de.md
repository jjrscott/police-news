Police Scotland can confirm that a 12-year-old boy has been charged and reported in relation to racist chants directed at a ‎Rangers player at the Celtic v Rangers SPFL match on Sunday, 29 December, 2019.

Superintendent Mark Sutherland, of Greater Glasgow Division: “Abuse of any form is completely unacceptable and Police Scotland will continue to rigorously investigate any reports of abuse we receive and bring those responsible before the relevant authorities.

"We'd remind the public that, as the person charged is below the age of 18, he cannot be named or identified for legal reasons as per the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995."
