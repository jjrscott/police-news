Police are appealing for information after a Ford Transit van was deliberately set alight outside an address in Earn Crescent, Pather, Wishaw, in the early hours of Saturday, 17 October, 2020.

Around 3.45 am, three men, only described as wearing dark clothing, were seen at the van which caught fire and was significantly damaged. They then ran off down a lane on Earn Crescent which leads to Linnhe Crescent.

Detective Constable Graeme Stoddart, Wishaw CID, said:

"Whilst we believe this to be targeted, there was someone in the house and the fire, which totally destroyed the van, did spread to the house causing damage to the front. Thankfully the householder and neighbours spotted the fire and called the fire service, however, to do this at a time when people would be in bed is shocking and a total disregard for safety.

"We are appealing to anyone who may have seen the men at the van or any unusual cars waiting in Linnhe Crescent to get in touch.

"Information, including dash-cam footage from any passing cars, can be passed to officers at Wishaw Police Station via 101. Please quote reference number 0521 of 17 October, 2020, when calling. Alternatively, details can be passed anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
