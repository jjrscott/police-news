Police are appealing for information after three cars were damaged in a fire in Cumbernauld on Sunday, 16 February, 2020.

Around 11.20 pm on Sunday night, police and emergency services were called after grey Hyundai Tuscan was deliberately set alight in a car park to the rear of a house in Inchwood Road, Cumbernauld. As a result of the fire, a further two cars, a white Kia Ceed and a gold Peugeot 407, were also damaged.

The Hyundai and the Kia cars sustained significant damage whilst the Peugeot was slightly damaged.

Detective Sergeant Ronnie Douglas, Lanarkshire CID, said today:

“Officers have still to determine the reason the Tuscan was deliberately set on fire, however, the fact is that if a neighbour had not seen the flames, then the fire could not only have affected the three cars as it did, but could have due to the wind that night, spread to nearby homes.

"We are keen to hear from anyone who may have seen people hanging about the cars or the back of the houses between 11.20 and 11.30 last night.

“Information can be passed to officers at Lanarkshire CID, Coatbridge Police Station, via 101. Please quote reference number 4177 of 16 February 2020 when calling. Alternatively, Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.
