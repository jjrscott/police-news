Police Scotland officers, as part an intelligence-led operation, executed a search warrant at a house in Dundee on Sunday, 16 August, 2020, where they recovered a quantity of drugs.

Officers attended the property in Spey Drive at 10pm and, during a search, discovered drugs with an estimated street value of almost £38,000.
