Around 9am on Thursday, 17 December, officers acting under warrant searched a house on the island of Eday, Orkney.

Local officers were assisted by the charity Orkney Drugs Dog during this operation. A quantity of Cannabis plants, with an estimated street value of £30,000, were recovered. Officers also seized a four-figure sum of cash and equipment relating to the supply of drugs.

A 57-year-old man has been arrested and charged in connection with this recovery. He is due at Kirkwall Sheriff Court at a later date.

A full report will be sent to the Procurator Fiscal.

Chief Inspector Matt Webb, of Kirkwall Police Station, said: “This significant recovery demonstrates our ongoing commitment to disrupting the supply of drugs in our local communities.

“We will continue to target those individuals who cause misery to others through the sale of controlled drugs and we will work relentlessly using all resources at our disposal to ensure they are brought to justice.

“We rely on information from the public and we will take action on information that is passed to us. Anyone with any concerns about drug dealing should contact their local police station through 101. Alternatively Crimestoppers can be contacted on 0800 555 111, where anonymity can be maintained."
