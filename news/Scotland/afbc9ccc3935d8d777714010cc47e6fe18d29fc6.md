Police in Glasgow are appealing for information after a man was assaulted in the city centre.

The incident happened on the footpath on Bath Street under the bridge at the junction with Buchanan Street around 4pm on Sunday, 19 July.

A 50-year-old old man suffered serious but non-life threatening injuries during the incident and has received treatment at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.

Enquiries are ongoing and officers are keen to identify a man seen in the area, described as being white, tall and thin who was wearing dark trousers or tracksuit bottoms, a light coloured top, dark trainers and a baseball cap.

Detective Sergeant Euan Keil of Glasgow City Centre CID said:

"We understand that two women came to the man's aid when they found him injured.
"However, they left without leaving names or contact details for police and we would be keen to speak to them or anybody else who may have information about this incident.
"Anyone who may be able to help is asked to call 101, quoting incident 2562 of 19 July, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
