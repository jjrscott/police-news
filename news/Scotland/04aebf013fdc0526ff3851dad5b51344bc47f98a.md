Road policing officers are appealing for information following a crash on the A939 north of Grantown-on-Spey in which one man has died.

The crash, involving a black Peugeot 2008 and a DAF articulated lorry, happened around 11am on Wednesday, 7 October, on a section of the A939 know as the Dava road, four and a half miles north of Grantown-on-Spey.

An 86-year-old man, the driver of the car, was pronounced dead at the scene and an 81-year-old woman was taken by the Scottish Ambulance Service to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness where her condition is described as serious.

Sergeant David Miller, of the North Road Policing Unit, said: “Our thoughts are with the family of the man who sadly died in this crash and our enquiries are ongoing to find out what happened.

“I would ask anyone who may have been driving along that stretch of road before the accident happened to get in touch and to check if they have any dash-cam footage that could help with our investigation.

“If you can help please call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident 0987 of Wednesday, 7 October, 2020.”
