Police in the Borders have recovered heroin with a street value of approximately £80,000 in Galashiels.

The drugs were recovered after officers stopped a van on Wood Street in the town during the afternoon of Thursday, 23 January.

A 34-year-old man has been arrested and charged in connection with the recovery. He is expected to appear at Jedburgh Sheriff Court today (Friday, 24 January).

Sergeant David Rourke of the Scottish Borders Community Action Team said: "We are committed to disrupting the trade in illegal drugs and tackling those who deal in them.

"We will not tolerate it and neither will our communities. We are grateful for the support we have from members of the public who provide the intelligence which helps us take drugs off our streets before they can cause further harm.

“This is a significant recovery and the operation involved officers from the Scottish Borders Community Action Team, Roads Policing, Operational Support Division and Local Borders Officers.

"I would urge anyone with information which could help prevent criminal activity to pass it on to us at any time by calling 101 or call anonymously Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
