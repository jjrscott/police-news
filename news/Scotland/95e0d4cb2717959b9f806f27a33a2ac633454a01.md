Police Scotland is appealing for witnesses after a man was assaulted in Wishaw on Sunday 27 September.

Around 10pm, a 20-year-old man was standing outside Ross's Bar in Stewarton Street when he was assaulted by another man with a bottle.

Officers are keen to trace a man described as being in his early 30s, with short dark hair and was wearing light coloured clothing.

Detective Constable Lindsey McIntyre from Lanarkshire CID said:

“This appears to have been a random assault and the man has been left with a serious injury to his head and face.

“This type of behaviour is completely unacceptable and it is vital that we trace the man responsible.

“I would appeal to anyone who was in the area around 10pm on Sunday and may have witnessed the attack, or anything at all suspicious, to please get in touch.

“Anyone with information is asked to contact Wishaw CID through 101, quoting incident number 0636 of Friday 28 September. Alternatively, Crimestoppers can be called on 0800 555 111, where details can be provided anonymously."
