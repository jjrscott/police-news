Officers in Edinburgh are appealing for witnesses to a road traffic crash which happened at around 1.10pm today, in Bankhead Terrace in Edinburgh. At that time the male rider of a quad bike came off his machine and as a result was injured.

Sergeant Jill Kirkpatrick of the Roads Policing Unit said: "We would like to hear from anyone who may have witnessed this crash earlier today. In particular we would like to speak to the occupants of a red coloured Toyota Prius car which was seen driving west along Bankhead Terrace at the time of the crash. I would also ask anyone who may have been driving in the area in a vehicle which had a dash-cam fitted to check their device for anything which might help us establish the circumstances surrounding this crash. Callers can use the 101 number to call in and should quote the reference number 1609 of 18 August 2020."
