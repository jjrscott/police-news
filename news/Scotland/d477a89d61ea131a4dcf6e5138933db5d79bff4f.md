It is now four years since Police Scotland set its current Equality Outcomes. As part of the organisation's duty under the Equality Act 2010, those outcomes must now be refreshed for the period 2021 to 2025, to ensure the organisation can deliver the best possible service for its staff as well as the diverse communities of Scotland.

The Equality Outcomes for 2021-25, along with strategic priorities in the Police Scotland/SPA Joint Policing Plan for 2021-2022, will provide the focus of the service's work in this key area over the next four years.

An electronic survey has been created, which is open to everyone - members of the public, officers, staff, and partners - to submit their thoughts and help shape the next set of Equality Outcomes for 2021-2025. Police Scotland Equality Outcomes please complete our, which is live for six weeks, closing on Thursday, 14 January, 2021. All answers are completely anonymous.

An Easy Read version of the survey is live, and it will also soon be available in British Sign Language: the closing date for these formats will be six weeks from the date of going live.

You can read more about our current Equality Outcomes and also the work Police Scotland has been doing to progress them.
