Officers in Glasgow are appealing for information following a robbery in Maryhill.

The incident happened around 10.30am on Monday, 17 February, 2020, at the Ladbrokes shop on Maryhill Road.

A man entered the shop, threatened the shop keeper with a weapon and demanded money, before running away with a small sum of cash.

The suspect is described as white, around 40 years old, 6 ft tall and medium build. He was wearing a black North Face jacket with a high-vis vest over the top, dark trousers and a black Mercedes branded cap. He was carrying a black plastic bag.

Constable Mhairi Gunn, of Helen Street Police Office, said: "Thankfully the member of staff was uninjured, but she has understandably been left very shaken.

“Enquiries into the incident are ongoing and I would ask anyone who recognises the description of the suspect to come forward immediately.

“I would also urge anyone who saw any suspicious activity in the area at the time, or has information which may be relevant to this investigation, to contact police as soon as possible.”

Those with information can contact Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident number 1014 of 17 February, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
