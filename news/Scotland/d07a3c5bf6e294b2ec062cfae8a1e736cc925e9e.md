Officers from the Nigg Local Policing Team are appealing for witnesses after concerning behaviour from a man in the area.

Around 2.30pm on Monday 11 January, a group of boys were approached and spoken to by a man near the community centre in Cove.

On Wednesday 13 January, around 3.30pm, a woman was walking with her daughter near to the same area, when they were approached and spoken to by a man fitting the same description.

On both occasions, the man was described as being black, around 6ft, with facial hair. He was wearing a black jacket/bodywarmer and spoke with an unknown accent.

Sergeant Barry Wallace of Police Scotland said: “We understand incidents of this type are concerning to the local community and we would like to reassure them that officers are working to trace the individual involved. We are also keen to ensure he himself, is safe and well.

“Anyone in the local community who has seen the man, or has had a similar encounter is asked to contact 101 quoting incident number 2530 of 11 January 2021.”
