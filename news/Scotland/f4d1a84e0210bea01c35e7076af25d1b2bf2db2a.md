Detectives in West Dunbartonshire investigating the disappearance of Mary Duncan have now concluded searching a number of sites in the area.

Searches at two sites at the Vale of Leven hospital began on Monday, 17 August, and a further search at a site in a residential area of Helensburgh began on Monday, 7 September.

A number of national teams assisted with the ground searches, which were concluded on Friday, 4 December, without a positive result.

Mary was 17-years-old when she disappeared from her home in Alexandria, West Dunbartonshire, in 1976.

Extensive enquiries have been carried out in an attempt to establish any information regarding Mary’s whereabouts, however no trace of her has been found.

Detective Superintendent Calum Young from West Dunbartonshire CID said:

“I can confirm that planned ground searches have now concluded, no further trace or information about Mary’s whereabouts has been found and the Duncan family have been fully updated.

“I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of the staff and management at the Vale of Leven Hospital for their support during search activity within the hospital, and also thank the public and media for helping to ensure that any disruption was kept to a minimum.

“Our enquiries into Mary’s disappearance remain ongoing, I would ask anyone who may have any information to contact Police Scotland on 101."
