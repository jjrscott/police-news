Police Scotland is appealing for information following a fatal crash at Harthill Services on the M8 in Lanarkshire.

The incident happened around 2.20am on Sunday, 29 March, when a black Renault Laguna was involved in a collision with a stationary lorry in the HGV park at the service station in Shotts.

In particular officers are keen to speak to anyone who has dash-cam footage of the car as it travelled westbound towards Glasgow before taking the slip road to the westbound Harthill services.

Sadly a 36-year-old man died at the scene of the crash.

Sergeant John Tait, of the Road Policing Unit at Motherwell, said: “We are keen to speak to anyone who may have seen the car as it was travelling westbound towards Harthill services and who may also have dash-cam footage.

“The car entered the slip road, mounted a grass verge and crashed into the lorry which was stationary at the time, parked in the HGV lorry park. Enquires are continuing to establish the full circumstances of what happened.

“Anyone with information should call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident 0218 of Sunday, 29 March.”
