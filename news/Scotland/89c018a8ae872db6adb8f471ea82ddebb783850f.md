Police in Glenrothes are appealing for information following a fire at Leslie Golf Club, Glenrothes on Sunday, 26 July 2020.

Around 2.30 am on Sunday, 26 July, emergency services attended a report of fire at the greenkeepers store at Leslie Golf Club.

Scottish Fire and Rescue Service extinguished the fire which had caused extensive damage to the building and specialist equipment stored within.
Police in Glenrothes are treating the fire as wilful and believe that three people who were seen running from the scene may be responsible.

Inspector Kirk Donnelly from Glenrothes Police said:
“This was a despicable and deliberate act by selfish individuals and thankfully on this occasion no one was injured.
“A number of wheelie bin fires have also been reported in the Leslie area and it is believed that these incidents may be connected to the fire at the Golf Club.
“I urge anyone with any information on who may be responsible for these crimes to contact Police Scotland via telephone number 101 quoting incident number 0669 of 26 July 2020.”

Alternatively calls can be made to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 where anonymity can be maintained.
