Police in North Ayrshire have charged the driver of an articulated lorry in connection with drink driving offences after they were found to be allegedly three times over the legal drink drive limit.

At around 6.40am on Friday 15 January, Road Policing Officers stopped a 44 tonne articulated HGV on Long Drive, Irvine, after information was received that the driver was under the influence of alcohol.

The driver, a 52-year-old woman, provided a positive road side breath test and was arrested at the scene. She was taken to Saltcoats Police Station and was found to be allegedly three times over the legal drink drive limit.

The woman has been released and the circumstances of the incident have been reported to the Procurator Fiscal. She is expected to appear in court at a later date.

Sergeant Ian Thornton Ayrshire Police Division’s Road Policing Unit said: “The dangers of drink driving are well known, however, when someone behind the wheel of an articulated lorry is under the influence alcohol, the potential for this to have serious injury or fatal consequences intensifies.

“Stopping drink driving does rely on information provided to us from the public, and I would like to thank everyone who reports concerning driver behaviour to us.

“Our recent festive drink and drug drive campaign resulted in over 500 motorists being reported for drink drug drive offences, 28 of these the morning after drinking. Our message remains clear; we will continue to take action against those who put themselves and others at risk by driving under the influence of alcohol.”
