Police are appealing for information following a wilful fireraising in Glasgow.

Around 4.45am on Friday, 6 November, officers received reports of two vehicles on fire on Linthaugh Road, which is believed to have been a targeted attack.

The fire was extinguished by the Scottish Fire and Rescue service. Nobody was injured in the incident.

Substantial damage was caused to both vehicles, a blue BMW 1 series and a white VW Tiguan as well as damage to a nearby property.

Detective Constable Paul McKenna said:

“We believe this was a targeted attack which caused substantial damage to two vehicles, and we are thankful that no one was injured and the fire was brought under control as quickly as possible.

There were two vehicles driving in the area around the time of the fire and we are keen to trace the occupants who may have seen anything suspicious.

“We are also appealing for anyone who may have been in the area or who may have private CCTV or dashcam to check their footage and come forward with anything or relevance.”

Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101 quoting incident number 0500 of 6 November or alternatively call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
