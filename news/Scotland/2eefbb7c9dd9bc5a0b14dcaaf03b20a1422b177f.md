Ten drivers have been arrested in connection with drink or drug driving in the Highlands, following the first weekend of Police Scotland’s two week summer drink and drug driving operation.

The operation will run between Saturday 27 June and Sunday 12 July, with officers from the Road Policing Division carrying out intelligence-led high visibility patrols to deter and detect people who put others at risk by drink or drug driving.

Four men, aged between 20 and 44, failed the roadside drug test and have been arrested in relation to alleged drug driving. Two of these men were arrested in Inverness, one in Aviemore and one in Alness.

Six drink drivers were also stopped over the course of the weekend. A 26-year-old woman was stopped in Alness and a 46-year-old woman provided a positive breath test and was taken to hospital for treatment to minor injuries after being involved in a one vehicle collision on the A832 near Muir of Ord. Four men, aged between 23 and 47, were also arrested with two being arrested in Inverness, one in Golspie and one in Stornoway. Five have been charged and will be reported to the Procurator Fiscal in due course. The sixth driver was arrested pending further enquiries.

Inspector Donnie Mackinnon from the Road Policing Division based in Dingwall said: “It is extremely disappointing to see these figures for the first weekend of the campaign and highlights that there are still people who appear willing to take risks and place themselves, and others, in danger.

“It is a message we will continue to enforce: driving whilst under the influence of drink or drugs is entirely unacceptable, the consequences of which can be catastrophic so please make the sensible decision to think twice and don’t do it.

“If you have information or concerns about anyone who may be drink or drug driving, please call us on 101. Information from the public can help take dangerous drivers off the road and also helps us to identify areas where we may need to increase proactive patrols.”
