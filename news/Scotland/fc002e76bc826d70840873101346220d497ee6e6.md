Police are appealing for information after a man was seriously injured during an attack in which he was struck with a weapon and a dog was set on him.

Around 2.30 am on Thursday, 16 July, 2020, a 42-year-old man was walking through the back courts of flats between Victoria Street and James Street, Ayr, when he was attacked by an unknown assailant and also bitten by a dog.

He was taken by ambulance to Ayr Hospital where he remains for treatment to leg and head injuries. Medical staff describe his condition as stable.

Detective Constable Robbie McIntosh, Ayr CID, said:

"Our enquiries are at an early stage at the moment as the injured man is still in hospital, however, we believe that he was the target of the attack. However, whether he was or not, this was a vicious attack in which the assailant tried to inflict some serious injuries.

"Officers are currently checking CCTV in the area but would appeal to anyone who may have either seen the attack, or have any information that will assist officers with their enquiries."

Information can be passed to Ayr CID via 101. Please quote reference number 0360 of 16 July 2020 when calling. Alternatively, details can be given anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
