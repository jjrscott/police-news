Road Policing officers in Dingwall are appealing for information and dashcam footage following a fatal crash which took place earlier today (Friday, 6 November).

The incident took place around 2.10pm on the A832 between Gairloch and Poolwe and involved a white Volkswagen Golf. The car’s driver, a 75-year-old man, was pronounced dead at the scene.

The road remains closed as the investigation continues, with diversions in place.

Sergeant Alasdair MacKay said: “Our thoughts are very much with the deceased’s family and friends at this time.

“We are appealing for any other motorists who may have been in the area at the time and either saw the incident take place, or saw the white VW Golf prior to the crash, to please come forward.

“We are also keen to receive any potential dashcam footage which could help our enquiries at this stage.”

Anyone with information is urged to contact police on 101, quoting incident 1976 of 6 November.
