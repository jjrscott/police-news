Police in Paisley are appealing for information following a serious assault in the Brick Lane area.

Around 9.50pm on Wednesday, 15 July, 2020, a 21-year-old woman was seriously assaulted by a man within a property on Brick Lane.

The victim was taken to Royal Alexandra Hospital with serious facial injuries.

The suspect is described as Eastern European with short dark hair and was last seen wearing dark clothing.

Detective Sergeant Chris Hughes, of Paisley CID, said: “This was a despicable and nasty attack on a young woman who could be scarred for life as a result.

“Anyone who may have seen a man fitting the description in the area either before or after the incident or saw a silver Audi A6 or a black Ford Focus in and around the area should contact police.

“I would also ask anyone who was driving in the area at the time with dashcam footage to get in touch as it could assist with our investigation.”

Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting incident 3632 of 15 July or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
