**Published 10 July 2020**

Police Scotland has charged seven people following the recovery of Class A drugs with a combined street value of £50,000 in Edinburgh.

Officers carried out search warrants at four addresses on Moredunvale Bank yesterday (Thursday, 9 July, 2020) as part of an intelligence-led operation. Heroin and cocaine were seized from the properties.

Five men, aged 23 to 56, and two women, aged 33 and 37, are due to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Monday, 13 July, in connection with this.

Detective Inspector Bob Campbell, of Gayfield Pro-active CID, said: "This enforcement action was carried out following an intelligence-led operation and tackling serious and organised crime remains a priority to us.

"We will proactively pursue anyone who is exploiting vulnerable people and importing drugs into our communities for their own illicit gain, but we can't tackle this alone.

"The public continue to play a vital role in assisting investigations into drug crime and I would encourage anyone who believes an individual or property within their community may be being exploited for criminal purposes to contact Police Scotland.

"If you have any concerns about drugs, or have information about those involved in drugs, you can contact police on 101 or make an anonymous report to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
