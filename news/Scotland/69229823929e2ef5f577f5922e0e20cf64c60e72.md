Detectives are seeking help in tracing a man responsible for a serious assault in Glasgow at the weekend. About 3.30am on Sunday, 18 October, 2020, a 38-year-old man making his way home along Holmbyre Road in Glasgow was approached by a man and seriously assaulted. The victim received a stab would to his side which required hospital treatment.

Detective Constable Glenn Clark at Cathcart Police Office said: "This appears to have been an unprovoked attack on a man in the early hours of Sunday morning. The man we want to trace can only be described as being a white male and was wearing a dark coloured top. This was a serious assault which could have had catastrophic consequences had the victim not received early medical treatment. I would urge anyone who may have been in the Holmbyre Road area, near to its junction with Blaeloch Drive around this time to contact us if they saw anything which might help in this investigation. I would also urge anyone who may have been in a vehicle fitted with a dash-cam to view their device to see if it holds any information which might assist. Callers can contact police on the 101 number and should quote the reference 0700 of 18 October."
