A man has been arrested and charged by Police Scotland in connection with culpable and reckless conduct after two unlawful gatherings were held in Edinburgh.

The first was held during the afternoon of Saturday, 5 September, and the second on Thursday, 10 September, outside the Scottish Parliament and in the surrounding areas.

A 60-year-old man has now been charged in connection with both gatherings, which were held in opposition to the Covid-19 restrictions, and a report will be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal.

Superintendent David Robertson of Edinburgh Division said: “Officers attended both of these gatherings to help ensure the safety of the public and to remind those attending to adhere to the current guidelines.

"We engaged with a number of people and encouraged them to comply with the law. As we have routinely said, enforcement will be a last resort but we will use the powers at our disposal where required to do so.

“We are asking people to take personal responsibility and remember that the purpose of these measures is to aid the collective effort to stay safe, protect others and save lives by preventing the virus from spreading."
