Police Scotland has welcomed the sentencing of four men responsible for a violent robbery in Edinburgh’s St Andrew Square last year.

At the High Court in Glasgow today (Wednesday, 15 July), Steven Batten and Dale Thomson were both sentenced to six years imprisonment, while fellow accused Jordan Craig was sentenced to six years and nine months.

A fourth man, Aidan Kelly, who was charged with planning the robbery, received a sentence of five years and ten months in prison.

The incident itself took place on Sunday, 25 August, 2019, when the men stole around £77,000 in cash.

Detective Inspector Kevin Tait, Edinburgh CID, said: “This robbery may have been well-planned, but it was a despicable act and a terrifying experience for the victims, leaving one of them with a serious facial injury.

“I’d like to thank the public for their assistance, which together with the concerted efforts of the enquiry team, allowed us to not only identify the men responsible for the crime, but also the person who was able to provide them with the knowledge to carry it out.

“We welcome today’s sentences, which suitably reflect the gravity of the offence. Thankfully, we rarely see this level of organised violent crime within the capital and I hope that today’s outcome shows that such acts will not be tolerated.”
