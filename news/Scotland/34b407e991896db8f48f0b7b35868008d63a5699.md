Police in Lossiemouth are appealing for information following a deliberate fire at Moray Golf Club.

The incident happened within the grounds of the club in Muirton Crescent around 10.30pm on Wednesday, 22 January, and is being treated as wilful.

The fire, which caused minor damage to the Greenkeepers shed, was extinguished by the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service.

No-one was injured and the roads remained open.

Constable Martin Dyer of Lossiemouth Police Station said: “Deliberately starting fires is a reckless act and it is fortunate that this fire was contained to the shed.

“I would urge anyone with information, or anyone who may have seen anything suspicious, to let us know.

“If you have any information please contact police on 101, quoting incident 3784 of 22 January, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.”
