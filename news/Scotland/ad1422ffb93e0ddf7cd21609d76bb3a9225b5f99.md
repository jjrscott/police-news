Officers responded to an alarm activation at a building in Robert Street, Port Glasgow, around 9.20pm on Wednesday, 2 December.

On arrival, nine people were spoken to and found to have travelled from Lanarkshire as part of an urban exploring group who intended to search a derelict building.

Chief Inspector Paul Cameron of Inverclyde said: "Derelict buildings are not maintained and are usually unsafe. Going into these risks not only your own safety, but that of the emergency service workers who may be required to go in after you."

As a result, five Fixed Penalties Notices were issued to adults for breach of the non-essential travel regulations.

CI Cameron continued: "The Chief Constable has made it clear that we are asking people to take personal responsibility to do the right thing and remember that the purpose of these measures is to aid the collective effort to protect the NHS and save lives by preventing the virus from spreading.

"Our officers will continue to engage with the public, explain the legislation and guidance, and encourage compliance. We will use enforcement as a last resort where there is a clear breach of the legislation."
