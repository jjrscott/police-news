At the High Court in Glasgow on Friday, 14 February, 2020, a man who murdered a 41-year-old woman in Ayr was sentenced to 18 years in prison.

55-year-old John Prentice from Troon, pled guilty to the murder of Ann McLean, following an incident which took place on Wednesday, 28 November, 2018.

Police were called to an address on Main Road, Ayr, around 5.25am after reports of a serious assault.

On arrival, Ann McLean was found with serious injuries to her neck and wrists and was pronounced dead at the scene.

Detective Chief Inspector Alan Sommerville, of the Major Investigations Team, said: “The sentencing of John Prentice will hopefully give the family of Ann McLean closure on what has been a difficult time.

“This was an unprovoked attack from a dangerous individual and has resulted in a woman losing her life.

“John Prentice will now have to face the consequences of his actions and this sentencing shows how committed Police Scotland are in bringing criminals of this nature to justice.

“I would like to take this opportunity to thank members of the public who came forward with information and assisted with our investigation.”
