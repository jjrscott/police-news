Police in Falkirk are appealing for information following an assault on a vulnerable 73-year-old man in Camelon.

The incident happened around 3.45pm on Saturday, 1 February, 2020, on the canal path outside a public house.

A cyclist approached the 73-year-old after falling off his bike and assaulted him before leaving in the direction of Glasgow Road, towards Camelon.

The suspect is described as white, male, of a stocky build, with brown short hair, a deep local accent and wearing all black clothing.

Inspector Ewan Wilson, of Falkirk Community Policing, said: “This assault has luckily left the elderly man with only minor injuries.

“The path is often used by dog walkers and other members of the public and I would ask if anyone was in the area at the time to come forward.

“Anyone who has any information can contact Police Scotland on 101 quoting incident number 2642 of Saturday 1 February, 2020."
