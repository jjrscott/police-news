Officers in Aviemore are appealing for the assistance of motorists after a number of high value mountain bikes were reported stolen from the Laggan area.

Eight Polygon Siskiu T8 mountain bikes, estimated to be worth around £12,800, were reported stolen from Laggan Wolftrax Visitor Centre between 11pm on Friday, 15 January and 3am on Saturday, 16 January.

Around the same time, 12 mountain bikes of various makes and models, estimated to be worth around £39,500, were reported stolen from The Wee Bike Hub along with £3,100 of clothing.

Officers are now appealing for anyone who was driving in the area around that time to check dashcam footage.

Detective Sergeant Andy Bilton said: “We are appealing for any drivers who were on the A86 or roads in the local area, between 11pm on Friday, 15 January and 3am on Saturday, 16 January, who may have dash cam footage to get in touch.

“Someone would need to have access to a large vehicle in order to steal 20 mountain bikes and we would ask anyone who recalls seeing anything like this to get in touch.

“We would also ask anyone who may have seen or heard anything in and around the premises to contact us.”

Anyone with any information is asked to contact police on 101 quoting incident 0935 of 16 January.
