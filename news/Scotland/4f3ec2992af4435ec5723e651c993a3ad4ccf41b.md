The family of 34-year-old Frankie Melvin have released the following statement through Police Scotland.

“Frankie was a much loved son, father, brother, partner and uncle. His loss will be sorely felt by many.

“We would ask that we are given privacy to come to terms with his loss at this time.”

A 41-year-old man was due to appear at Dundee Sheriff Court today (Friday, 28 August) in connection with his death.

Detective Inspector Allan Thomson said: “Our thoughts are with the family of Mr Melvin at this difficult time.

“There will continue to be a visible Police presence in the area as we carry out our enquiries and I would like to thank the community in Arbroath for their patience and support.

“We are urging anyone with information to contact Police Scotland through 101. Please do no post any comments on social media which could prejudice any future criminal proceedings.”
