Police in Glasgow are appealing for witnesses after an assault with intent to rob in the Balornock area of the city.

The incident happened around 9.50pm on Friday, 16 October, 2020, on Balornock Road near to its junction with Broomfield Road.

A 47-year-old woman was approached by a man who demanded her phone and threatened her. She was not injured and the man ran off when she refused to hand anything over.

The suspect is described as a white, in his late 20s to early 30s, around 5ft 9ins, slim build with a local accent and wearing all dark clothing and a face mask.

Constable Stuart Stevens, of the Community Investigation Unit in Glasgow, said: “Fortunately the woman was not injured but she was left extremely upset by what happened.

“We would ask anyone who was in the area around the time of this assault to get in touch if they saw anything and also anyone who may have dash-cam footage that could help with our investigation to contact us.

“If you can help please call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident number 3699 of Friday, 16 October, 2020 or make a call anonymously to the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
