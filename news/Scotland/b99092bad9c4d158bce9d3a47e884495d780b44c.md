Police in Shettleston are carrying out enquiries following the theft of a trailer containing whisky from an industrial estate in Carmyle, Glasgow.

At 9.15pm on Friday, 11 December, 2020 a red articulated trailer with white writing on the sides was stolen from Clydesmill Industrial Estate, Carmyle.

The trailer contained 2,400 cases of Glenfiddich 12 year single malt Scotch whisky valued at £200,000.

The empty trailer was then discovered abandoned on Whistleberry Road, Blantyre at 10am on Tuesday, 15 December.

Detective Sergeant Stephen Greenshields at Shettleston CID said: “I am keen to speak to anyone who has seen this trailer since it was stolen on Friday 11 December until the empty trailer was recovered in Blantyre on Tuesday, 15 December.

“I’d also like to speak to anyone who has been approached and offered to buy any of this type of whisky at a considerably reduced price and where the seller has no proof of purchase or ownership."

Anyone who has any information on the theft or knows of anyone selling the bottles of whisky should contact police at Shettleston immediately via 101 quoting incident number 0788 of 11 December 2020.
