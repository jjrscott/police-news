Officers in the Online Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation team based in Edinburgh acknowledge the sentencing of Donald Middleton, who appeared at the city's Sheriff Court on Tuesday, 11 August, and was given 12 months in prison for child sexual offences.

The 57-year-old was also added to the Sex Offenders Register, after pleading guilty to causing a young child to participate in a sexual activity, and an offence relating to indecent imagery and videos of children.

Detective Chief Inspector Richard Banks, National Child Abuse Investigation Unit, said: “Middleton is a predatory individual who targeted children online, believing his actions would be untraceable.

“The scale of child abuse and sexual exploitation offending online has grown in recent years, with the risk escalating throughout the coronavirus pandemic as people choose to stay indoors.

"We remain committed to bringing those who commit these kind of offences to justice, and protecting young people at risk.

"If you or anyone you know has been a victim of abuse, and you wish to report it, you should feel confident in contacting Police Scotland. We will listen and we will take action."
