Police Scotland can confirm that three men have been charged following the disorder that was seen in George Square in Glasgow on Sunday, 14 June, 2020.

Officers have been conducting a review of the events of Sunday, 14 June, and have charged two men, aged 20 and 24, in connection with public disorder offences. They are due to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court today (Wednesday, 8 July, 2020). A 54-year-old man has been charged in connection with an assault and is due to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court at a later date.

A fourth man, aged 22, was arrested in connection with the disorder and released pending further enquiries.

Detective Inspector Sarah McArthur, of Greater Glasgow CID, said: "Our investigation into the recent events in George Square continues. The disgraceful scenes we witnessed were completely unacceptable and the thuggish behaviour by those intent on causing violent disruption will not be tolerated. I would encourage anyone with information in relation to the disorder to contact Police Scotland on 101. We take all such incidents of disorder or hate crime seriously and all reports will be fully investigated."
