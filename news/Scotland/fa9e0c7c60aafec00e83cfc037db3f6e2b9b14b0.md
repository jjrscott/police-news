Police Scotland is appealing for information following a serious sexual assault in Livingston.

The incident happened around 5.45pm on Wednesday, 30 September, on a footpath on the south side of Riverside Court. A 30-year-old woman was walking along the path when she was approached by a man from behind and assaulted.

The suspect is described as white, in his late 20s, around 5 ft 9 ins tall and of slim build. He was wearing a black hoodie with the hood up and a black shiny puffer style body warmer.

Following the assault, the suspect ran off in an eastward direction.

Detective Inspector Craig Higgins said: "This was a terrifying ordeal for the victim and we are doing everything we can to provide her with all the necessary support she requires at this time.

"Officers have been searching the Riverside Court area, checking CCTV and carrying out enquiries in the surrounding area since this was reported.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the time who may have seen anything suspicious or a man matching this description to come forward.

"We believe there was a male cyclist who passed by shortly after the attack and may have seen the suspect running off. He is described as in his late 30s or early 40s, with brown hair and a beard and was using a blue bike. If you were cycling in the area at the time, please think back and get in touch with police if you have any information that may be able to assist our investigation.

"It does not matter if you think your information is small or minor - it could be just the detail we are looking for to help build a bigger picture of the circumstances.

"I would like to reassure the local community that we are doing everything we can to identify the man responsible. A highly visible police presence is in place in the area and that will remain while our investigation continues."

Anyone with information in connection is asked to contact police on 101, quoting reference number 2802 of 30 September. Alternatively, if you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass on information to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% confidential.
