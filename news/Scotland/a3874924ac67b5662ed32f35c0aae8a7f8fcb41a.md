Police are appealing for witnesses following a road crash in South Ayrshire in which a teenager died.

Around 1.15 am this morning, Sunday, 13 December, 2020, police and emergency services were called to a single vehicle road crash eastbound on the A70, Ayr Road, Coylton, where a white Vauxhall Corsa had left the road and struck a tree. The 19-year-old male driver, who was alone in the car at the time, died at the scene.

Sergeant Kevin Blackley, Road Policing Unit, Ayrshire, said:

"Although the crash happened in the early hours of the morning, from our enquiries so far, we know there were a number of cars on the road around the time of the collision.

"We are keen to hear from anyone who was in the area in the early hours of this morning, particularly between Dobbies Garden Centre, Ayr and the town of Coylton.

"Any information, including dashcam footage, can be passed to police via 101 quoting reference number 0319 of 13 December, 2020."
