A 39-year-old man has been arrested and charged in connection with an incident of fraud in High Valleyfield, Dunfermline.

He is due to appear at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court on Monday, 5 October, 2020.

The incident was reported to police on Friday, 25 September. The incident took place at a property on Chapel Street when a 75-year-old man was targeted by someone who offered to fix his roof for him. A considerable amount of money was then handed over prior to the work being completed.

Detective Inspector Karen Muirhead, of Dunfermline CID, said: “Following our investigation, we have been able to charge a man in connection with this incident.

“This type of activity often affects vulnerable and older people and we are committed to robustly investigating these crimes and dealing with the persons responsible.

“People can take some simple but effective steps to protect themselves. If someone turns up on your doorstep unannounced, offering to undertake work please ask for identification, do not make on the spot decisions and never hand over any money before the work is completed.

“Anyone with concerns regarding this type of activity should contact Police Scotland on 101.”
