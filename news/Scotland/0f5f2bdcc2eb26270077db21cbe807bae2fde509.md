Chief Superintendent Hazel Hendren, Divisional Commander for Greater Glasgow, said:

“The disgraceful scenes we have witnessed recently in George Square, Glasgow, are completely unacceptable.

“Police Scotland will not tolerate this type of threat to public safety or the appalling physical and verbal abuse suffered by our officers.

“We will police peaceful, lawful protests appropriately, however the thuggish behaviour by those intent on causing violent disruption will simply not be tolerated.

“Officer deployments are being stepped up as part of our robust response to this organised violence and anyone breaking the law or becoming involved in unlawful protest should expect to be arrested.

“Our priority is always to keep people safe and we will not hesitate to use the full force of the law to ensure that people feel safe on our streets anywhere in Scotland, whether that is those taking part in peaceful protest, or simply going about their daily lives during these challenging times.

"We will also continue to work with partners, including Glasgow City Council, to keep our streets safe for those who live in and visit our city."
