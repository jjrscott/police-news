Police Scotland carried out a drugs operation across Perth and Kinross yesterday (Tuesday 4 August) which resulted in drugs with an estimated street value of Â£35,000, along with a quantity of cash being recovered.

Officers executed six drugs warrants in Dunkeld Road, York Place, South Street, Simpson Square and Heiton Court in Perth along with George Street in Coupar Angus. Class B and Class C drugs along with cash were recovered.

Local Area Commander, Chief Inspector Graham Binnie said :

"A 20-year-old man was arrested and is expected to appear at Perth Sheriff Court today (Wednesday 5 August).

"The operation was aimed at those from out with Scotland who have established themselves in our local communities in order to deal drugs.

"We continue to work with our partners to continue to disrupt those involved in serious and organised crime in order to make Perth and Kinross a hostile environment for people from other parts of the UK to operate.

"I would like to thank our communities for their continued support in tackling the issues around drug dealing and would urge people to contact us on 101 if they have any information."
