Officers are appealing for the help of the public to find high value exotic animals stolen from a pet shop that could suffer in the cold weather if they are not looked after properly.

The animals, including 15 tortoises valued at around £125 each, three geckos valued at £50 each and two orchid mantises valued at £22 each, were taken from the premises in Albert Street, Motherwell, overnight between Friday, 11 December, and Saturday, 12 December, 2020.

Inspector Hugh Burns said: “This would appear to have been a deliberate and targeted act. We need to find these animals as soon as possible as they could suffer harm or even die due to being away from their normal, warm environment.

“I would appeal to anyone who has been offered these animals or who knows anything about them being offered for sale to get in touch.

Likewise if anyone saw anything suspicious in the area then please call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident number 1176 of Saturday, 12 December, 2020, or make a call anonymously to the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
