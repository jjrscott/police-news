On Wednesday, 22 July, officers from East Lothian Community Action Team searched an address on Edinburgh, Road, Tranent, under warrant and recovered a large quantity of cannabis plants with an estimated street value of one hundred and twenty five thousand pounds. (£125,000).

A man has been arrested and charged in connection with this recovery and is due before Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Friday, 24 July, 2020.

A full report has been forwarded to the Procurator Fiscal.

Sergeant Dougie Wardell from East Lothian Community Policing said: “This was a significant recovery and we will continue to disrupt those involved in the supply of drugs in East Lothian and work to track down those involved in this type of behaviour, and take the appropriate action.

“This was an intelligence-led operation and we rely on the support of the public on drugs-related issues. Information passed to police helps us gather intelligence that we can then act on.

“I would urge anyone with information about drugs in their local area to contact their local police office through 101, or alternatively Crimestoppers can be contacted on 0800 555 111, where anonymity can be maintained.”
