As the Easter holiday weekend gets under way, Chief Superintendent Alan Waddell, divisional commander, has thanked people across Lanarkshire for staying at home.

He said: “The overwhelming majority of people are complying with the instruction from government and we are very grateful for their support.

“I know that we normally look forward to enjoying the outdoors or gathering with friends and family at this time of year.

“However, please continue to play your part by staying at home to save lives and protect the NHS. Connect with friends online instead of in person and, at this time, don’t travel to our many beauty spots.

“The Chief Constable stressed the importance of this when he spoke with the First Minister today and asked the public to continue with the changes, even during the holiday and as the weather gets better.

“With your support, Police Scotland will continue to focus on engaging with the public, explaining the instructions, encouraging compliance and, as a last resort, using the enforcement powers available to us.

“I know that we are asking people to make significant changes to their lives but over the Easter weekend, I would ask that you continue staying at home for the benefit of all of us.”Under the emergency powers relating to coronavirus, a total of 57 Fixed Penalty Notices were handed out in Lanarkshire between March 27 and April 9.
