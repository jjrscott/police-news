Police in Tayside are appealing for information after a report of a serious sexual assault in Dundee.

The incident was initially reported to police as concern for a woman who was distressed on Kirk Street around 11.50pm on Saturday, 11 July, 2020. Officers attended and from speaking to the 20-year-old woman, they are treating her report as a serious sexual assault.

Detective Inspector Marc Lorente, of Dundee CID, said: "The woman would've been very distinctive as she was wrapped in a duvet with a strong Liverpool accent and clearly very distressed just before midnight on Saturday.

"We're trying to establish the full circumstances so we're appealing to anyone who has any information or saw anything suspicious in the Kirk Street area around that time to contact us."

Anyone with information should contact Police Scotland on 101 quoting incident number 5058 of 11 July 2020.
