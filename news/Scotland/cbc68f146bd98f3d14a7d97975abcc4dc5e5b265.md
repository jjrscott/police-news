Police Scotland is appealing for the public's help as part of the ongoing investigation into fatal one-car crash on the A90.

The crash involved a silver Ford Focus and took place on the A90 Stonehaven to Dundee road, near the B974 Fettercairn junction, about 6.10am on Monday, 20 July, 2020.

The male driver sadly died at the scene.

The road was closed until around 1.10pm to allow for investigations to take place at the scene, and motorists are thanked for their patience during this time.

Sergeant Peter Henderson of the Road Policing Unit said: "Our enquiries are at an early stage and I wish to thank those motorists who stopped and helped at the scene of this tragic incident.

"I appeal to any further witnesses who have not already spoken to police, or who may have dashcam footage of the crash, to contact us on 101 quoting incident 0548 of 20 July."
