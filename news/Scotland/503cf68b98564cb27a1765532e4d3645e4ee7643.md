Two men, both aged 31, have been arrested and charged in connection with a spate of housebreakings at commercial premises across Scotland.

The men, from the South of England, are due to appear at Aberdeen Sheriff Court today (Monday 14 September, 2020) following seven break-ins between Sunday, 30 August, and Sunday, 6 September, 2020, in Aberdeen, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Glenrothes, Forres and Elgin.

Detective Sergeant John Lumsden, from Aberdeen CID, said: “Police Scotland is committed to tackling serious and organised crime and we rely on information from our communities to help us.
