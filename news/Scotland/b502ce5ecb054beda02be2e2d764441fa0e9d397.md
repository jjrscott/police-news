Police in Dundee are investigating the theft of a caravan from the Struan compound on Jack Martin Way.

The theft is believed to have happened around 9.25pm on Monday 9 March.

Enquiries have established that two men, wearing dark clothing, were seen climbing over the compound’s fence and tampering with the white Compass caravan (WG07 EMV).

Soon after, a silver Volkswagen Passat Estate containing two other men was attached to the caravan and left the area.

Sergeant Chris Grieve, from Longhaugh Police Office, said: “In addition to the caravan itself, valued at around £14,500, a number of other items were stolen, including an awning and television.

“We are appealing to anyone with more information on the theft, or anyone who may have seen anything suspicious in the area, to contact Police and assist our enquiries.”

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting incident 2246 of 15 March. Alternatively, you can contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, if you wish to remain anonymous.
