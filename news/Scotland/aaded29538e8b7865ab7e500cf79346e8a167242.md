Police Scotland is releasing an image of a man that officers believe may be able to assist them with an investigation into an assault in Glasgow.

Around 4.55pm on Saturday, 6 April, 2019, following a Celtic v Livingston fixture at Celtic Park, a 74-year-old man was walking along Gallowgate near to its junction with Society Street.

The victim was attempting to board a bus when he became involved in a physical altercation, which resulted in an injury that required hospital treatment.

Officers are releasing an image of a man that they would like to speak to as part of their ongoing enquiries.

Detective Constable Gillian Alexander of Shettleston CID said: "I am appealing to anyone who may have any information, or who recognises the man in the image. He may have information which could be vital and assist our investigation, and I would ask anyone who recognises him to contact us.‚Äù
