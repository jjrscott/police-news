A 53-year-old man, Andrew Hart, has been sentenced to 6 years and 8 months at Edinburgh High Court today, 22 May, 2020, for rape and other sexual offences against three young females, committed over a period of time between 2007 and 2018 in the Larbert and Stenhousemuir areas of Forth Valley.

Speaking following the sentencing today, Detective Inspector Yvonne O'Rourke at Forth Valley Public Protection Unit said:

“The horrific crimes which Andrew Hart committed on the young victims will live with them for ever, and I would like to commend them for coming forward and speaking up. I hope that the sentencing today will offer them some comfort as they seek to put their ordeals behind them.

"We welcome the sentence, and his placement on the Sex Offenders register means that he will be the subject of monitoring and supervision in efforts to restrict his ability to harm anyone else.

"Police Scotland is committed to bringing all perpetrators of sexual abuse to justice, regardless of the passage of time. It is never too late to report these types of crimes and we would urge anyone who wishes to report sexual crime, regardless of when it occurred, to contact us on 101 so we can conduct a thorough investigation.”
