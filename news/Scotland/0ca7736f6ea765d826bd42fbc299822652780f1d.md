Police in Ayr are appealing for information following an incident of wilful fire raising in Irvine.

The incident happened around 1.10am on Thursday, 16 July, 2020 on Gottries Crescent where a man approached a white Audi A3 car from the direction of Beach Drive.

The man then poured an unknown substance over the vehicle before setting it on fire and running back towards the same direction.

The suspect is described as around 5ft 10in tall, of an average build. At the time of the incident he was wearing a hooded top with the hood up, dark shorts and dark trainers.

Detective Constable Ross Brierley, of Saltcoats CID, said: “Thankfully nobody has been injured as a result of this selfish and reckless act.

“We are appealing to members of the public who might have seen anyone matching this description acting suspicious in the area to come forward.

“Although this incident happened in the early of hours of the morning, I would ask if anyone has any information that could assist with our investigation, to get in touch with officers.

“I would also ask if anyone has possible dashcam or CCTV footage to contact police.

“Police can be contacted on 101 quoting incident number 0193 of Thursday, 16 July, 2020.”
