Detective Chief Inspector Alan Sommerville, of Police Scotland’s Major Investigation Team, said:

“Officers were called to an address in the Charles Street area of Craigneuk around 5.05am on Saturday, 7 March, 2020, following a report from the Scottish Ambulance Service that a 15-year-old boy had been seriously injured.

“He was taken by ambulance to Wishaw General Hospital, where he died a short time later. His death is currently being treated as suspicious and officers are providing support to his family at this very difficult time.

“A 20-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the death and enquiries are ongoing, however still at an early stage. Officers will remain in the area over the coming days as part of the ongoing investigation and to provide public reassurance.

“Anyone who may have information relating to the teenager's death or who saw any suspicious behaviour in the area around this time, particularly in Charles Street, Flaxmill Avenue and Glencairn Avenue, is urged to come forward.

“Information can be provided to Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident 0785 of 7 March, to a local officer or reported anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
