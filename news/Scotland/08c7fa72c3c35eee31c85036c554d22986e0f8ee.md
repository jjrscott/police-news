Police in North Lanarkshire are appealing for information following two incidents of wilful fire raising in Cumbernauld and Coatbridge.

The first incident happened around 5am on Sunday, 1 March, 2020, where a white Vauxhall Astra and a snack van were deliberately set on fire on Brown Street, Coatbridge.

On Monday, 2 March, 2020, in the Stoneylee Road area of Cumbernauld ,a blue Ford Kuga car was set on fire.

Both fires were quickly extinguished by the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and nobody was injured as a result.

Detectives do not believe the two incidents to be linked.

Detective Constable Craig Jeffrey, of Lanarkshire CID, said: “We are appealing to members of the public who may have any information relating to these deliberate fires.

“I would urge anyone who may have been in the area at the time or those who have any information to contact police.

"I would also ask anyone with dash cam footage of the area to get in contact with officers."

Police can be contacted on 101 quoting incident number 1062 of 1 March, 2020 and incident number 0271 of 2 March, 2020.
