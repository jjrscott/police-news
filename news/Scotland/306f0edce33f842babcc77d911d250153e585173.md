Detectives, supported by specialist scientific teams, are continuing to work to identify remains found on an industrial estate on Whitehill Road, Glenrothes, on Sunday, 27 September, 2020.

Following a post mortem examination, it's been established that the remains are not those of any local long-term missing people and their families have been updated.

Enquiries continue to identify the person, who was male, and establish a cause of death.

Detective Chief Inspector Kevin Houliston, of Police Scotland’s Major Investigation Team (MIT), said: “The families of long-term missing people in the local area have been informed that the remains are not those of their loved-ones and officers continue to support them at this difficult time.

“This is a complex and highly intricate investigation and we're working to find out who this is and how they came to be there. The death remains unexplained but if anyone has any information that may help our enquiries then please call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident 2692 of Sunday, 27 September, 2020.”
