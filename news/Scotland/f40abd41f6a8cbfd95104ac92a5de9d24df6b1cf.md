Detectives at Rutherglen are appealing for information after a car was set on fire on Tuesday, 5 January, 2021.

Around 2.20am, officers were called to a report of a Peugeot 107 car on fire outside a house on Fernhill Road, Rutherglen. The fire was extinguished by Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and no one was injured.

Detective Constable Grant McKechnie at Cambuslang Police Station said: “This fire is being treated as wilful and our enquiries are ongoing.

“We are working to identify and trace the occupants of a red Vauxhall Corsa which drove along Fernhill Road into Abbeydale Way shortly before the fire started. Two men were seen getting out the Corsa and approached the Peugeot 107. Each of these suspects were wearing dark grey hooded tops, and were seen a short time later heading back to the Vauxhall Corsa and it drove off along Fernhill Road in the direction of Burnside Road.

“Anyone with information on this vehicle or its occupants, or anyone with details that will assist our investigation into this deliberate fire, should contact Cambuslang Police Station through 101 quoting reference number 0219 of 5 January. Alternatively, Crimestoppers can be contacted on 0800 555 111, where anonymity can be maintained.”
