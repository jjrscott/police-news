Police in Glasgow are appealing for information after an attempted murder in the Bridgeton area.

Officers were made aware of a 26-year-old man who had been found seriously injured on Bernard Path around 5pm on Friday, 20 November. He was taken to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital where he is now in a stable condition.

The incident is believed to have happened near to Dunn Street around 4.45pm on Friday, 20 November. It involved a number of men dressed in dark clothing, possibly carrying bladed weapons.

Detective Sergeant Gary Boyle, of Shettleston CID, said: "We're appealing to anyone who has any information about this incident or witnessed the attack either shortly before, during or after to contact us.

"We don't believe there was a wider risk to the public however this level of violence can't be allowed to happen in our communities and we would also appeal to anyone who perhaps saw a group acting suspiciously around that time to contact us."

Anyone with information should contact Police Scotland on 101 quoting incident number 2674 of 20 November. Alternatively, Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.
