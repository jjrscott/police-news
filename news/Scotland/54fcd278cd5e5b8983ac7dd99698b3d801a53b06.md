Police at Ayr are continuing enquiries and appealing for information after a man was robbed within his home in Ayr on Saturday, 4 January, 2020.

Around 8.45 pm on Saturday, 4 January, two men forced their way into the 48-year-old man’s home in Main Road, Ayr. They threatened him and ransacked the house before making off with a four-figure sum of cash and some personal items.

The 48-year-old man sustained a slight injury to his hand but did not require medical attention.

The two suspects are described as white, medium build and were wearing dark clothing and scarves. One of the men was also wearing a dark coloured hat.

Detective Constable Barry Gibson at Ayr CID said:

“I believe that the suspects were only within the property for a very short time and that they may have left the area in a vehicle.

“I am keen to speak to anyone who may have seen the suspects hanging around the area prior to the robbery taking place or anyone who may have seen then making off afterwards.”

Anyone with information should contact Ayr CID via telephone number 101 quoting incident number 3322 of 4 January 2020. Alternatively calls can be made via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 where anonymity can be maintained.
