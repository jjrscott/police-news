Officers are appealing for information after a woman was assaulted on Stirling Street, Alva, last night.

The incident took place around 8.45pm on Sunday, 24 January.

The victim, a 29-year-old woman, was walking with her young son, who was on a scooter at the time, when a man approached and assaulted her before leaving the area.

The woman was uninjured, but left shaken as a result of the incident. She was assisted by a local shop assistant, before calling for police.

The suspect is described as being a white man with a large build, wearing a dark tracksuit. He had dark hair, with a receding hairline.

Sergeant Andy Chalmers, from Alloa Police Station, said: “We’re appealing for anyone who was in the Stirling Street area last night around the time of the incident and may have seen anything suspicious to please come forward.

“While we can be thankful that this incident did not lead to more serious injuries, it was clearly extremely distressing for the victim and her son. Any information which could help us establish the full circumstances and the identity of the man could prove vital.

“If you have any information, please contact police on 101, quoting incident 3799 of 24 January. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, if you wish to remain anonymous.”
