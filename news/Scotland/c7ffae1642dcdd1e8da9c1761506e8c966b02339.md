Officers are carrying out enquiries and appealing for information after a large-scale disturbance that took place in the Kirkton area of Dundee on Saturday, 31 October, 2020.

Around 7.05pm on Saturday evening, officers were called to a report of a large crowd causing a disturbance in Beauly Square, Dundee. Officers attended and were met with a crowd of around 100 people who began setting off fireworks at officers and trying to intimidate them.

Additional police resources were required, and public order trained officers attended to assist with dispersing the crowd who were mostly aged in their late teens to early twenties.

Chief Inspector David Mcintosh, Local Area Commander for Dundee said: “Luckily no one was injured during this disorder, however this kind of behaviour is completely unacceptable.

“Our main priority at the time was ensuring the safety of the public and our officers, however enquiries are ongoing to identify those involved in this disturbance and take the appropriate action.

“Officers are carrying out additional patrols in the area to provide public reassurance.

“If you have any information that will assist our ongoing enquiry, please contact us on 101 quoting reference number 3383 of 31 October.”
