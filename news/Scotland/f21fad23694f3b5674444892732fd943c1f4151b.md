Road Policing officers in Lanarkshire are appealing for witnesses following a serious crash that took place in the early hours of this morning (Saturday 7 March).

The crash involved a blue Volkswagen Polo and a pedestrian, and happened around 2.50am on the B717 Benhar Road in the Shotts area.

A second car was also involved in the incident, but has yet to be identified and traced.

The 17-year-old pedestrian has been taken to Wishaw General Hospital for treatment.

Sergeant Simon Reilly, from Motherwell Road Policing, said: “We are asking for anyone who witnessed the crash, or was driving through the area around the time, to come forward with any information they have, which could help our enquiries.

"We know that there was a second car and that it left the scene, but it is possible that the driver may not even know they were involved in anything. That is why we are keen for anyone who was driving in the area at the time to call us."

“Anyone with information can contact Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident 0522 of 7 March.”
