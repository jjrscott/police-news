Police in Greater Glasgow are appealing for information following three incidents of wilful fire raising in Bridgeton.

The first incident was reported to police around 12.30am on Thursday, 5 March, 2020 where a letterbox was set on fire at a property on Mill Street.
A short time later reports were received of two further fires in the closes on buildings on Main Street.

The fires were quickly extinguished by the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and nobody was injured as a result.

Detective Constable William Corkindale, of Glasgow CID, said:

“One of the fires has caused extensive damage to the building and all three could have caused serious harm to the residents within.

“I would urge anyone who may have been in the Main Street area of Bridgeton at the time or those who may have witnessed suspicious activity in the area to contact police.

“I would also ask anyone with CCTV or dash cam footage of the area to get in contact with officers."

Anyone with information should contact Shettleston Police Station on 101 quoting incident number 0070 of 5 March, 2020.
