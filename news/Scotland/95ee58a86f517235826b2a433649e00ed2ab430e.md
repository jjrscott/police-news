Police in Glasgow are appealing for witnesses following a serious assault in Thornliebank.

The incident happened around 6.15pm on Sunday, 11 October, 20202, in Carnwadric Road.

A 15-year-old male youth sustained a stab wound during a possible disturbance, at which a large crowd of young males and females were present.

The 15-year-old sought help in a nearby shop before being taken to the Royal Hospital for Children for treatment by a family friend.

The suspect is described as a white male, around 16-years-old, who was dressed in a black tracksuit with the hood pulled up.

Detective Constable Andy Reid, at Helen Street CID said: “I know that Carnwadric Road was busy at the time this incident took place and therefore I am certain that there would have been people who witnessed this male being assaulted.

“I would urge anyone who witnessed the assault or anyone who has any information on the suspect to contact us.”

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101 quoting incident 3708 of 11 October. Alternatively, information can be passed to Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555111.
