Police in Glasgow are appealing for information following a series of robberies in the city centre on Christmas Eve.

The three separate incidents happened between 6.40pm and 7pm on Thursday, 24 December, 2020, outside Argyle Street Train Station - on Argyle Street and a footpath on Virginia Street. Two men approached three men, aged 27, 33 and 39, and demanded that they hand over personal belongings before running north along Virginia Street.

The male suspects are described as:

1) white, in his 20s, with a shaved head. He was wearing a black jacket, black trainers and was carrying a black sports bag and wearing a black face mask.

2) white, aged in his 20s with dark hair. He was wearing a black puffer jacket, black joggers, black trainers and was carrying a plastic bag.

Detective Constable Neil Bonsor said: "Thankfully the three male victims were uninjured but have understandably been left shaken. The incidents happened in close succession within a 20-minute timeframe and we are treating them as linked.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the area of Argyle Street Train Station at the time and saw two men matching this description to contact police on 101, quoting reference 2951 of 24 December. You can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555111 which is 100% confidential.‚Äù
