Police in Edinburgh have renewed their appeal to trace a man they wish to speak to as part of an ongoing investigation into a number of serious incidents in the Craigmillar area.

It is believed the man pictured can help with the ongoing investigations and detectives are urging anyone who recognises him to come forward.

An incident took place at a flat in the area on 20th December 2017 when a 37-year-old woman was assaulted in her own home.

The person that police believe may be able to assist with their inquiries is described as a black male, originally from Gambia, tall, around 48 years old, of average build, with short black afro hair, a short dark beard and wears large distinctive rings.

Detective Constable Rachel Robertson, based at Gayfield Police Station, said:

“Despite extensive inquiries by detectives, we have been unable to identify and locate this man who we would like to speak to as we believe he may have information that could assist our investigation. We are further appealing for the public's help with this.

“Anyone who may recognise this man, or who has any information on where he may be, is urged to contact us as soon as possible.”

Those with information can call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident number 1630 of 20th December 2017, or report this anonymously to the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
