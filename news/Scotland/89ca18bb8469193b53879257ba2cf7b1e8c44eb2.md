Police Scotland has today welcomed the sentencing of a Dundee man at the High Court in Edinburgh for a series of offences against three of his former partners between 2010 and 2019.

Gavin Cooper was jailed for 5 years, with a further 3 years extended sentence. He will also be placed on the sex offenders register for life.

Detective Sergeant Gordon Patullo, of Police Scotland's Domestic Abuse Task Force, said: "Gavin Cooper is now justly being held accountable for his appalling conduct towards his victims, including repeated sexual assaults of one of his previous partners.

"In being given this significant custodial sentence and being required to register as a sex offender for life, I hope that the consequences of Cooper's actions will be heard far and wide. We can assure victims and perpetrators that reports of domestic abuse will be robustly investigated by Police Scotland.

"I would also like to take this opportunity to reach out to anyone who is experiencing or has experienced domestic abuse and tell them that it is never too late to contact police or seek support and advice from one of our partner agencies, such as Women's Aid."
