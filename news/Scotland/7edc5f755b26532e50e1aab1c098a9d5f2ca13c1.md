Officers in Livingston are appealing for witnesses to a serious crash involving a street sweeper vehicle and a pedestrian.

The incident took place at around 1.50pm on Monday, 5 October, on Binny Craig View, Livingston.

The pedestrian, a 38-year-old man, has been taken to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary with serious injuries. The driver of the street sweeper was uninjured.

Sergeant Jill Kirkpatrick, from Police Scotland's Road Policing Unit, said: "We are looking for anyone who was in the area and saw the crash to come forward. Particularly if you have any potential dashcam for local CCTV footage, which may be able to assist our enquiries.

"Enquiries have also suggested that the pedestrian was in the area for some time before the incident happened, so are asking for anyone who believes they saw his movements to contact us."

Anyone with information is encouraged to contact police on 101, quoting incident 1671 of 5 October.
