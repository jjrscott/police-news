Extra patrols will be deployed in Glasgow City Centre tonight under Operation Sideburn.

Officers will be targeting dangerous driving, with particular focus on Blythswood Square and the surrounding streets.

It's part of efforts to tackle anti-social behaviour and reassure locals, following a spike of incidents in the area as more people head back out onto the streets as restrictions ease.

Chief Inspector Craig Walker, Local Area Commander, said: "We would rather engage with people and try to prevent them from illegal driving and encourage them to abide the law, as opposed to forcing legislation onto them.

“Quite often, the vehicles are parked-up so we are able just to walk up and engage with the drivers or occupants. We’re using our powers to gather information so we can hopefully engage with individuals to try to influence their behaviour.

"If the traffic regulation order continues to be flouted, we will start to use enforcement.”
