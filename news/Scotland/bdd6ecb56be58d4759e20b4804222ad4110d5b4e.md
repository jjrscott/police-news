The two suspects are described as white males, both around 6ft tall, slim to medium build and were wearing black or dark grey tracksuits and scarves or masks covering their faces.

The victim was taken to Hairmyres Hospital with facial injuries.

Detective Constable Stephanie Bertram, of Lanarkshire CID, said: “This was a serious unprovoked attack that was a frightening experience for the victim.

“I am appealing to anyone who was on Fairhill Avenue or the surrounding area around this time who may have witnessed the attack, saw the two men getting out of the vehicle or saw any suspicious activity to contact the police as soon as possible.

“I would also ask anyone with dash-cam footage who was driving in the area at the time to check back.
