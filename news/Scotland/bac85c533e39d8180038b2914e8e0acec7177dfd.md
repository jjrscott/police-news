Police in Shetland have charged a man in connection with drugs offences after a significant amount of herbal cannabis and cocaine were seized in Lerwick.

An intelligence-led operation was carried out at Holmsgarth Ferry Terminal on Thursday, 16 January, by officers from Shetlands Local Policing Team and Dogs Against Drugs.

As a result, a large quantity of herbal cannabis and a quantity of cocaine were found with an estimated street value of £25,000.

A 50-year-old man was arrested and charged and a report has been sent to the procurator fiscal at Lerwick.

Chief Inspector Lindsay Tulloch, Shetland Area Commander said: “As a result of an intelligence led investigation a significant amount of drugs have been seized and removed from circulation and will not make it to our streets.

“This will have a significant impact on those involved in the supply of controlled drugs and those who gain financially from this type of criminality.

“Criminal behaviour like this spreads harm and misery and we are committed to detecting and disrupting those intent on bringing drugs to Shetland and enforcing that this type of behaviour will not be tolerated.”

“Members of the public have a vital role to play in reporting information to us, I would urge anyone who has information relating to those involved in the sale and supply of drugs to report this matter to police.”

Anyone with information should contact police on 101, or anonymously through Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
