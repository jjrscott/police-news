Police Scotland will be focussing on the issue of anti-social motorcycle riding on the A93 this weekend, as part of ongoing efforts to encourage safe driving on our roads.

Tayside’s Roads Policing Unit will be patrolling the A93 between Perth and Glenshee from Friday 28 to Monday 31 August 2020.

Officers will be using marked and unmarked cars, as well as police motorcycles and robust action will be taken against anyone found to be breaking the law.

Inspector Greg Burns from Tayside’s Road Policing Unit said:

“We like to see people enjoying riding their motorcycles in beautiful surroundings, however we ask they do it responsibly and ensure that they get home to their loved ones in the evening.

“We have received a number of complaints from local residents along the A93 about groups of motorbikes travelling at excess speed, overtaking dangerously, over-revving their engines disturbing residents and wildlife, and general anti-social behaviour for a significant period of time.

“The majority of motorcyclists who use the road do so appropriately and sensibly, and it is a shame that the image of those who ride responsibly is tarnished by those who don’t. Hopefully we can do something to reverse this, and we ask all riders to take care and be considerate on the roads not just this weekend, but every day.”
