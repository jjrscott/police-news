Police Scotland can confirm that a five-figure sum of Class A drugs has been seized following a proactive operation in Oban.

The recovery took place in the Ulva Road area, at around 6.30pm on Wednesday, 3 June, 2020. A quantity of heroin was recovered, with an estimated street value of around £15,000.

A 28-year-old man and a 42-year-old woman have been arrested and charged in connection with drugs offences. They both appeared at Oban Sheriff Court on Thursday, 4 June, 2020.

Detective Inspector Andrew Doherty, from Dunoon CID, said:

“Drug misuse brings nothing but misery to our communities and I want to reassure people that we will continue to use every tool at our disposal to remove these illegal substances from our streets.

“These efforts have continued throughout the ongoing pandemic and offenders should not believe themselves to be beyond the reach of the law.

“Our work often relies on the support of the public, so if you have any information or concerns about drug misuse, do not hesitate to contact Police Scotland on 101 or report this anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
