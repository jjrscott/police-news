Detectives are appealing for information following an attempted robbery at a petrol station in Hawick on Friday, 27 November, 2020.

Around 8.30pm a man entered Morrisons Petrol Station in Mart Street, threatened a staff member and demanded money, before leaving empty handed.

He is described as in his mid-20s to 30s, 5ft 10 inches tall, wearing a black jacket with a hood and a black snood covering his face, black jeans and black trainers with a white sole.

Detective Constable Andrew Loughlin from Galashiels Police Station said: “Thankfully nobody was injured during this incident, however it was still terrifying experience for the staff member involved.

“I am appealing for anyone who was near to the petrol station last night around 8.30pm and saw a man matching the above description, or anything at all suspicious, to come forward.

“I would also ask anyone in the surrounding area with private CCTV, as well as any motorists with dash-cams who were there around the time of the incident, to please get in touch in case you have captured any footage which could be of significance.

“Anyone with information is asked to contact Police Scotland through 101, quoting incident number 3446 of Friday, 27 November, 2020. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.”
