Officers in Fife are appealing for information following an attempted robbery at the post office in High Valleyfield.

A man entered the shop on Chapel Street around 4.50pm on Wednesday 6 January, and threatened the staff member with a knife, before demanding money. The staff member refused and the man left empty handed.

The suspect’s described as around 6’2”, of slim build and spoke with a local accent. He was wearing an army type olive green jacket with a black hoodie, and a black face mask.

Detective Constable Rob Finch from Police Scotland said: “The victim was providing an essential service to the community and has unfortunately had to endure this. This incident has left him in shock, but unhurt.

"We believe a number of other people entered the shop shortly after the man left, and we would be keen to speak to them. We would also like to hear from those who may have been travelling in the area at the time to check any dash cam footage they may have."

Anyone with any information is asked to contact us via 101 quoting incident number 2593 of 6 January 2021.
