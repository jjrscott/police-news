Police in West Lothian are appealing for witnesses following an assault in the George Street area of Bathgate.

The incident happened around 11.25am on Friday, 7 February, when a 41-year-old man was sprayed in the face with a pepper spray type substance by another man following an altercation.

The man responsible then walked off. He is described as white, aged in his mid-30s, and was wearing dark clothing and carrying a walking stick.

Detective Constable Sam Plastow, of Livingston CID, said: “The man who was assaulted was taken to hospital and returned home after treatment. Fortunately he has not suffered any long term effects as a result of being exposed to a noxious substance.

“It was the middle of the morning and the street would have been very busy at this time with people shopping and going about their day-to-day business and we would like to speak to anyone who saw what happened.

“If you have any information please call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident 1209 of Friday, 7 February, or contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.”
