Police Scotland can confirm that two men aged 18 and 26 and a 26-year-old woman have been arrested and charged in connection with human trafficking offences in Glasgow.

An intelligence led operation took place around 6.40am on Friday, 28 August, 2020 at a number of addresses in the city.

Detective Inspector Mark McLennan, of Glasgow Public Protection Unit, said: “On Friday, officers from Glasgow's Human Trafficking Unit carried out an operation to search five addresses in the South Side of Glasgow and one address in London, which has been supported by the Metropolitan Police.

“There has been a substantial period of planning for this operation alongside our partner agencies at the Home Office Immigration Enforcement Crime and Financial Investigation Scotland and as a result, two men aged 18 and 26 and a woman aged 26 have been arrested on suspicion of human trafficking.

“This would not be possible without the continued support of those within the community and I would encourage that if anyone has any information or concerns surrounding human trafficking that they get in contact with police.

“Our message is clear, we will use every policing tactic and resource available to us to target those who attempt to exploit vulnerable individuals.”

Detective Superintendent Fil Capaldi, Head of Police Scotland's Human Trafficking Unit said:
"Modern slavery and human trafficking have no place in our communities.

"As Friday's action demonstrates we will target criminals who abuse, control and exploit people.

"We will continue to work with partners, nationally and internationally, to bring offenders to justice, and to raise public awareness to help identify victims and ensure they get the support they need and to end this despicable trade in human beings."
