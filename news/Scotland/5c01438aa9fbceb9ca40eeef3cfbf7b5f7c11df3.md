Police are appealing for information after a 35-year-old man was attacked and seriously injured in Nitshill, Glasgow, on Saturday, 8 August, 2020.

Around 10.30 pm on Saturday night, police were called following a disturbance in Seamill Street in which the man was stabbed. He was taken by ambulance to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, where he received treatment for his injuries.

Detective Constable Stephen Findlay, Greater Glasgow CID, Govan, Glasgow, said:

"From our investigation, it appears that the injured man had been at a house party in the street and had gone out on to the road where he is met by two other men and a fight takes place. He is then stabbed by one of the men who ran off afterwards. He managed to make his way back to a nearby garden where an ambulance was called.

"Officers have been making local enquires and checking CCTV but we'd like to hear from anyone who was in the area and who saw what happened to get in touch. We are especially keen to hear from anyone who may have dash-cam or mobile phone footage from the time of the incident.

"Obviously we would be keen to see any footage and so would ask that witnesses, or indeed anyone who may have information that will assist our enquiry, contact Govan Police Station via 101. Please quote reference number 4870 of Saturday, 8 August 2020. If you wish to remain anonymous, please call Crimestoppers in confidence on 0800 555 111."
