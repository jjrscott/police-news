A man has today, (Friday, 6 March, 2020) been sentenced for the attempted murder of a baby in Edinburgh.

Lukasz Chomiczewsk, 26, was sentenced to six-years imprisonment having been convicted on Tuesday, 18 February, following a trial at Edinburgh High Court in which he plead not guilty.

Chomiczewsk committed the offence on Tuesday, 6 August, 2019 at an address in the Leith area of the city when he strangled the one-year-old girl which could have resulted in her death.

Detective Chief Inspector Iain Ramsay of Edinburgh’s Public Protection Unit said: “This was a senseless attack on a defenceless child resulting in serious injury.

“Chomiczewsk was in a position of care for the girl and was meant to protect her, instead he subjected her to a terrifying ordeal, for which there is no justification.

“I would like to thank all the officers and partners across all agencies involved in this investigation who helped to secure the conviction and today’s sentence. It sends a clear message to those in the community who would commit such crimes that this type of behaviour will not be tolerated.”
