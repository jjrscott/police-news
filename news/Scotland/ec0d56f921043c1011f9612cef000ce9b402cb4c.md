Chief Superintendent Alan Murray said:

"Significant police resources were deployed at George Square to prevent the disgraceful scenes of violence and disorder witnessed in recent days.

"Those who turned up to protest were facilitated with an appropriate policing response and I would like to thank all officers involved for their professionalism in preventing trouble and maintaining public safety.

"Acting on information, at the end of protest around midday, officers contained a large group of people, including individuals identified as football risk supporters, who we believed posed a threat to public safety both within George Square and at other locations.

"We engaged with this group and, at their request, escorted them to the Gallowgate area of the city where they dispersed.

"As part of our response, Police Scotland also imposed an Order under Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.

"This allows police to search any individual or vehicle within the Greater Glasgow area and covers the city to help maintain public safety in all areas.

"Our robust response will continue across the country and anyone intent on causing violence and disorder should expect arrest."
