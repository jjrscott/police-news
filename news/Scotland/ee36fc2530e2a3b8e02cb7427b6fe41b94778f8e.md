Police in Renfrewshire and Inverclyde can confirm a fatal fire in Paisley is not being treated as suspicious.

The incident happened around 9pm on Friday, 19 June, 2020 within a flat on Renfrew Road. Officers attended alongside the fire service and ambulance service.

Three children - aged 5, 8 and 12 - were taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow and died a short time later. A 39-year-old woman was taken to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley where she remains and her condition is now described as not life threatening.

Chief Inspector Rhona Fraser, area commander for Paisley, said: "My thoughts are with the family and the effect this has had on them and the local community.

"Officers remain at the address while enquiries continue. This is standard procedure and a report has been submitted to the Procurator Fiscal."
