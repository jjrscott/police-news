Over Â£100,000 worth of property has been recovered after it was stolen from a bike store and garden centres in Fife and West Lothian.

Two men, aged 48 and 34, and a woman, aged 36, have been charged in relation to the incidents.

The property was reported stolen from Leslie's Bike Store in Glenrothes on 9 December 2019, a garden centre in Dunfermline on 17 October 2019 and another garden centre in Broxburn on 30 November 2019. The items were recovered on Wednesday, 6 May, 2020 following a search of addresses in Ayr, Prestwick and Auchintiber and includes bikes, Christmas trees, barbecues, lawn mowers, plants and statues.

All three are due to appear at court at a later date.

Detective Constable Fraser Simpson, of Glenrothes CID, said: "The incidents were reported last year and as a result of our investigation, we are now able to return the property to its rightful owners.

"We believe there are still a number of bikes outstanding so if anyone has been offered bikes for sale in Ayrshire recently, perhaps at a reduced price or unusual circumstances, I would encourage people to please contact us on 101 quoting incident number 0862 of 9 December 2019."
