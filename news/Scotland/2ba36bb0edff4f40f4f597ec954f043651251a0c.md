**Published 27 April**

Police are appealing for information after a 74-year-old woman was robbed of a two-figure sum of money in Port Glasgow this morning, Monday, 27 April, 2020.

Around 8.55 am this morning, police were called after two men who had shared a taxi with the woman from upper Port Glasgow to the bus stance in the town, stole money from her handbag before running off.

The lady was not injured but has been left shaken by the incident.

Detective Sergeant Stuart Young, Greenock CID said:
"The lady was befriended by two men at the bus stop in Arran Avenue, Port Glasgow, and they agreed to share a taxi into the town centre rather than wait for a bus, however, after alighting from the taxi, one of the men grabbed her bag, removed the purse and then managed to get money from it before they both ran off.

"The suspects are both white, one is of a heavy build wearing dark clothing and carrying a rucksack and the other, a slim build, wearing light clothing.

"Officers are currently checking CCTV in the area, however, would appeal to anyone who saw what happened or have any information that will help the enquiry to get in touch. Please contact Greenock CID via 101 quoting reference number 0575 of 27 April 2020 or call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 in confidence."
