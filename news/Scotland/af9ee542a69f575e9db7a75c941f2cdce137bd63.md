Police in Stornoway are appealing for information following vandalism at the primary school.

Sometime between Wednesday, 23 December, 2020 and Saturday, 2 January, 2021 entry has been gained to Stornoway Primary School on Jamieson Drive and extensive damage has been caused to various areas of the building.

Sergeant Ross Masson of Stornoway Police Station said: “It is very disappointing that this mindless act of vandalism has taken place at Stornoway Primary School.

“There is a minority in our community who feel this sort of behaviour is acceptable, but I want to be clear that it is not.

“We are following all lines of enquiry to make sure that those responsible are found. I would urge anyone with information or who may have seen anything to come forward.”

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting incident number 2527 of 2 January, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
