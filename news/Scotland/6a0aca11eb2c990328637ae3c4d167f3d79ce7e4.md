Jamie Collins (32) from Ayrshire, was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment at the High Court in Glasgow today, Thursday, 16 January, 2020, for serious sexual and violent offences against his former partner.

Police Scotland launched an investigation into Collins in March 2018 following a report of years of abuse.

Detective Constable Colin Jones, of Kilmarnock Police Office, said: “Jamie Collins was a violent man who subjected his former partner to serious and violent abuse throughout their relationship.

“Thankfully she found the courage to come forward to police and report what was happening to her and we, as a result of the information she provided, were able to secure this conviction.

“His conviction and sentencing for domestic abuse related offences sends a clear message that we will always investigate reports of domestic abuse whether recent or not.

“I would encourage anyone who is experiencing or has experienced domestic abuse to contact police; it is never too late to report to the police or to seek support and advice from one of our partner agencies."

Police Scotland can be contacted by calling 101, or 999 in an emergency.
