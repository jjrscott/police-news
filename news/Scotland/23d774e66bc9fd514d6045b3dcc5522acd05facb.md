Police in West Dunbartonshire are appealing for information following an incident of wilful fire-raising in Balloch.

Around 12.55am on Saturday, 14 March, police received report of a blue Kia Ceeâ€™d car on fire in the car park adjacent to Haldane Court, Balloch. The fire was extinguished by the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and nobody was injured as a result.

The suspect is described as a white man, slim build and was wearing a dark hooded top and dark clothing.

Detective Constable Iain Allison, of Argyll and West Dunbartonshire CID, said:

"We are appealing to members of the public who may have any information relating to this deliberate fire.

"I am particularly keen to speak to the taxi driver who was in the area at the time and may be able to help with our enquiries.

"I would urge anyone else who may have been in the area at the time or anyone with dash cam footage of the area to get in contact with officers."

Anyone with information can contact police on 101, quoting incident number 0248 of 14 March.
