This month, officers in East Ayrshire launched Operation Ellipse which is a joint initiative between Police Scotland and East Ayrshire Council aimed at targeting anti-social behaviour.

We know that anti-social behaviour remains a key concern to our local communities.

This week, during the evenings, local officers carried out high visibility patrols in Cumnock and Catrine which were focused in areas that we've been told groups of young people are causing anti-social behaviour and damaging property.

We have been using quad bikes to patrol off-road, meaning nowhere is off limits and officers can cover large areas of land more quickly than they would be able to on foot or in a vehicle.

Officers have also been supported by East Ayrshire Council Youth Workers, who have been engaging with the young people.

Chief Inspector Steven Meikle, Area Commander for East Ayrshire, said: "Operation Ellipse is about engagement as much as enforcement and, along with the council, we're trying to encourage young people to take a better path.

"We will take enforcement action where we have to and will continue, in the coming days and weeks, to patrol these areas. We will also be contacting a number of parents and carers whose children have come to our attention.

"I would strongly encourage parents and carers to ensure they are aware of their children's whereabouts on an evening and talk to them about the impact anti-social behaviour can have on their future, as well as the effect on the community."

As a result of these specialist patrols, we have spoken to a number of youths, seized alcohol and fireworks and reported a young person to the Children's Reporter for a disorder offence.

Three youths, aged 14 and 16, have been reported to the Children's Reporter in connection with break-ins to garden sheds and two youths, aged 12 and 15, are being reported in connection with a break-in to an outdoor swimming pool.

CI Meikle added: "In these challenging times, we recognise the significant sacrifices people have made recently. We know that the restrictions continue to have a major impact on the way we live our lives.

"However, we need people to do the right thing and remember the purpose of these measures is to aid the collective effort to stay safe, protect others and save lives by preventing the virus from spreading."

Feedback from the local community is important to us and part of how we shape our local priorities. This is especially important during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
