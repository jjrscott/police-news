The man we want to trace in relation to this robbery is described as being male, spoke with a Scottish accent and is in his 40s. I would ask anyone who may have been in the McColl Avenue area last night to call police if they saw or heard anything which might assist in the investigation. Likewise I would ask anyone who may have been in a vehicle fitted with a dash-cam device to examine it to see if it holds any footage which might assist us.
