Police in Helensburgh are appealing for information after an 18-year-old man was seriously assaulted on Saturday night (29 August, 2020).

The incident happened around 11pm on East Princes Street near Helensburgh Central Train Station. The victim was taken to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley for treatment to serious facial injuries.

The male suspect is described as around 6ft tall, heavy build with a shaved head. He was believed to be wearing a white t-shirt, black shorts and a grey jumper.

Detective Constable Stuart Lindsay said: "The serious assault occurred in a public area where people were visiting pubs and takeaways and waiting for public transport. I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the time and witnessed the assault but has not yet spoken to police to come forward.

"I would also ask anyone who was driving in the area and has a dash-cam to check back and see if there is any footage that may be able to assist our investigation."

Those with information can contact police on 101, quoting reference number 4367 of 29 August, or can pass on information anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
