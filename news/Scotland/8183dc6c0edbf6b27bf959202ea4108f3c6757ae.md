Police Scotland can confirm that a significant quantity of Class B drugs has been seized after a search warrant was carried out in Motherwell over the weekend.

The operation took place in the Dalriada Crescent area at around 6pm on Saturday, 9 January. The cannabis plants and associated material recovered has been valued at over £180,000.

No arrests have been made at this point and further enquiries into the recovery are ongoing.

Sergeant Thomas Cairns said: “Drugs misuse brings nothing but misery to our communities and I want to reassure the people of Lanarkshire that we will continue to use every tool and tactic at our disposal to remove illegal substances from the streets.

“These efforts have continued throughout the ongoing pandemic and offenders should not believe themselves to be beyond the reach of the law.

“Our work often relies on the support of the public, so if you have any information or concerns about drug misuse, do not hesitate to contact Police Scotland on 101 or report this anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
