Around 5.40 pm on Sunday, 26 January, a 73-year-old man was driving a Ford Mondeo car south on the A9 - Inverness to Perth Road when at about 300 metres north of the House of Bruar it collided with a Kia Ceed car that was travelling in the opposite direction.

Both drivers were taken by ambulance to Ninewells Hospital in Dundee where the 73-year-old man is currently being treated. Hospital staff describe his condition as serious but stable. The 70-year-old female driver of the Kia car was released after being treated for minor injuries.
