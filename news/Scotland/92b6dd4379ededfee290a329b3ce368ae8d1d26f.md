A 54-year-old man has been arrested and charged in connection with the death of a man in a car in Ayrshire which is being treated as murder.

Michael Thomson, 46, was found dead in a blue Ford Fiesta parked on a layby on the A77 near Dalmilling Golf Course, between Holmston and Whitletts roundabouts in Ayr. This was reported to police around 6pm on Saturday, 25 July.

His death was initially treated as unexplained, however, following an extensive investigation, it is now being treated as murder.

Detective Chief Inspector Alan McAlpine, senior investigating officer, said: "I would like to thank the public for their response to our appeals for information during our investigation. I'd also like to thank the local community for their patience during the part closure of the A77 while we conducted enquiries."

The 54-year-old is due to appear at Ayr Sheriff Court on Thursday, 6 August.
