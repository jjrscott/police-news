Detective Sergeant Stephen McCulloch, of Saltcoats CID, said: “The victim was not hurt but was left extremely shaken by this incident. Our enquiries are ongoing to trace the suspects and the victim’s car.

“We are particularly keen to speak to a woman who spoke to the victim after the incident and commented on his dog.

“If anyone has any information relating to the incident, or saw anyone matching the descriptions either before or after the incident, they should contact police.”
