Detectives are appealing for information after two cars were damaged within the car park of HMP Low Moss in Bishopbriggs which happened around 10pm on Wednesday, 25 November, 2020.

One car was deliberately set on fire and a second car parked next to it was also damaged.

Officers are keen to trace two men who were seen at the time. Both were wearing dark clothing and ran off onto Crosshill Road towards the golf range.

Detective Constable Craig Paterson said: “We are keen to speak to these men who may be able to help us with our inquiries. The clothing of one of them may have been damaged as a result of the fire and he may even have been injured.

“I would ask anyone who may have been driving in the area at the time, particularly in Crosshill Road and near the golf range, to get in touch if they have dash-cam footage that could help with our investigation.

“In addition, anyone who say anything suspicious or may know who these men are is asked to call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident number 3691 of Wednesday, 25 November, 2020, or make a call anonymously to the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
