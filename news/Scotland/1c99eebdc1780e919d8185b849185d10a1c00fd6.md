Police are appealing for information after a black Seat Leon was deliberately set alight in a car park in Gair Crescent, Carluke, in the early hours of Saturday, 17 October, 2020.

Around 3.40 am, three men, only described as being white and between 16 and 20 years of age, were seen at the car which was then set alight and subsequently seriously damaged.

Detective Sergeant Jim Williamson, Wishaw CID, said:

"The motive for this has still to be established, however, from our enquiries so far, we believe that it is more of an opportunist crime as the youths seen on CCTV at the car gain access, rummage about and then set it alight rather than do that at the outset.

"However, whatever the reason, we need to catch those responsible.

"We are carrying out enquiries in the area but are keen to hear from anyone who may have seen the youths in the area, or who may have CCTV or dash-cam footage from the street, to get in touch with officers.

"Information can be passed to officers at Wishaw Police Station via 101. Please quote reference number 0538 of 17 October, 2020 when calling. Alternatively, details can be passed anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
