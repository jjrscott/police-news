Police are appealing for information following an attempted robbery in Irvine on Tuesday, 19 May, 2020.

Around 10.20 am, a 35-year-old woman was walking along the underpass in Long Drive, Irvine, when a man riding a black mountain bike pushed her to the ground whilst attempting to grab her phone.

The suspect is described as white, in his 20s, wearing dark clothing, black tracksuit trousers with white stripes from the waist to the knee, and white trainers.

Detective Constable George Robertson, Saltcoats CID, said:

"Thankfully the lady, who was with her Labrador dog, was not seriously injured but did sustain cuts to her knee and face following the incident. The suspect made off on the bike empty-handed on same footpath towards a nearby hotel.

"I would appeal to anyone who was in the area, which is well used by locals, who either saw the assault or maybe the cyclist in the area, to get in touch with police.

"Any information can be passed to Saltcoats CID via 101. Please quote reference number 1300 of the 19th June 2020 when calling. Alternatively, information can be passed anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
