Detectives in Fife are continuing their investigation into the serious sexual assault of an 18-year-old woman in Kelty.

The incident was reported around 11.15pm on Monday, 6 July, 2020. The woman was found in the Limepark Crescent area and disclosed to officers that she has been attacked shortly before within a car.

The suspect is described as being a man in his late 20s with a slim build and tanned complexion, dark hair and a short dark beard.

Detective Inspector Kelly McEwan said: “We’d like to thank members of the public who have assisted our investigation up to this point and continue to appeal for anyone who was in the area and may have seen something suspicious to please come forward.

“In particular, I would ask motorists and taxi drivers with dash cams to check their footage for the vehicle in question, as this information could prove vital in our enquiries.”
