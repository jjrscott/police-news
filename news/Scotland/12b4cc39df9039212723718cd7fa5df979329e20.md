Police in Clydebank have released a CCTV image as part of an investigation into wilful fire raising in the Dumbarton area.

The incident occurred at around 10pm on Thursday, 18 July, 2019 at a business premises on Ash Road.

The fire was extinguished by the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and no one was injured as a result of the incident.

Detectives are looking to speak to the male shown in this image as they believe that he may have some information that could assist with their investigation.

He is described as white, of medium build, aged in his late teens to early twenties, and is pictured wearing a grey coloured tracksuit.

Detective Constable Adam McCreery from Clydebank CID said: “Deliberately starting fires is dangerous and reckless and it is fortunate that no one was hurt.

"I’d urge anyone who recognises the man in the image, and who can identity and help trace his current whereabouts, to come forward as soon as possible in order to assist our investigation.”

"Those with information should contact Police Scotland on 101 and quote incident number 4307 of 14 July 2019. Information can also be given to the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.”
