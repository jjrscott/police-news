Police Scotland is appealing for information following the report of an assault near to the River Dee in the Torry area of Aberdeen.

The assault reportedly took place between 7.30am and 8.30am on Saturday, 30 May, near the riverside and the area of South Esplanade West.

The victim is a woman aged early 20s, with long dark hair and was wearing a light-coloured pattern top and leopard print cycling shorts.

The man is described as white, aged between 20-30 years, medium build with broad shoulders and was wearing a blue t-shirt and dark-coloured jeans.

Detective Sergeant Ryan Morris, from Bucksburn Police Station, said: “This was a traumatic incident for the woman and we are keen for anyone with information to come forward, so we can establish the full circumstances.

“If you were in the area at the time and saw a woman or man matching the descriptions, please contact Police as soon as you can. We are also looking to speak with a woman who was driving a silver car, who may have spoken with the victim near to Riverside Drive.

“Anyone with information should contact Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident 1302 of 30 May. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, if you wish to remain anonymous.”
