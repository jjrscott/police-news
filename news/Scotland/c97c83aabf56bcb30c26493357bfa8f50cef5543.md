Police Scotland is appealing for information after a car drove into a shop window in Glasgow.

At around 3.30am this morning (Wednesday 23 September) a silver Toyota Hilux 4 x 4 was deliberately driven into a beauty shop on Broomknowes Road in the city. The driver got out of the car and he then set the vehicle on fire and then left in the direction of Hornshill Street.

Detective Constable Paul Friel of Maryhill CID said :

“Our enquiries are at an early stage but the man we are looking to trace was wearing a dark hooded top and dark jogging bottoms. The shop was empty at the time, so thankfully no-one was injured.

“I am appealing for anyone who was in the area at the time to come forward, especially motorists who may have captured the incident on dashcam.

“Anyone who has any information is asked to call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident number 0310 of Tuesday 23 September."
