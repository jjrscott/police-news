Police in Lanarkshire are appealing for information following a wilful fire-raising in Blantyre.

The incident happened between 12.35am and 1.50am on Saturday, 11 July, 2020 in Blantyre Industrial Estate, where six HGV and heavy plant equipment vehicles were deliberately set on fire.

The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service attended and safely extinguished the fire and there were no injuries.

Detective Constable Paul Mooney, of Lanarkshire CID, said: “This deliberate fire was a reckless act and we are asking for the public’s help to help trace those responsible.

“Although this happened in the early hours of the morning, I would ask if anyone noticed anyone acting suspicious in the area or has information that could assist with our investigation, to get in contact with officers.

“I would also appeal to anyone that may have CCTV or dashcam footage of the area to contact police.

“Police can be contacted on 101 quoting incident number 0680 of Saturday, 11 July, 2020.”
