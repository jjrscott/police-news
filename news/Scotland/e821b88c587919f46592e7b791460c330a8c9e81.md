Police are re-appealing for information following a road crash on the A939, north of Grantown-on-Spey, on Wednesday, 7 October, 2020, in which an 86-year-old man died.

Matthew Donnell (86), from Grantown-on-Spey, died after the black Peugeot 2008 he was driving collided with a DAF articulated lorry on a section of the A939 known as the Dava road, four and a half miles north of Grantown-on-Spey. His relatives are aware.

His 81-year-old female passenger was taken by the ambulance to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness where she remains for treatment. Medical staff describe her condition as serious.

Sergeant David Miller, of the North Road Policing Unit, said:

“Our thoughts are with Mr Donnell's family.

“I would ask anyone who may have been driving along that stretch of road before the collision happened to get in touch and to check if they have any dash-cam footage that could help with our investigation.

“If you can help please call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident 0987 of Wednesday, 7 October, 2020.”
