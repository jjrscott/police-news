A man has been charged following a fatal collision on the M60.

John Bowers (12/07/1987) of Sefton Road, Preston, Lancashire has been charged with causing death by careless driving.

He will appear before Manchester Magistrates' Court this morning (Saturday 23 January 2021).

Shortly before 8.45am on Thursday 21 January 2021 officers were called to a report of a road traffic collision on the M60 close to Junction 20 involving a Kia Ceed car and a lorry.

Despite the best efforts of medical staff, the driver of the Kia Ceed was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.
