At around 8:20pm last night (Saturday 13 June 2020), a disturbance took place in the area of Briscoe Lane before continuing onto the Asda car park on Old Church Street. During the course of the disturbance, a man believed to be in his late 30s was seriously assaulted before leaving the area and making his way to a property on Rosebank Road.

The ambulance service were called a short time later and the man was taken to hospital where he is being treated for a fractured skull and a bleed on the brain. He remains in a critical condition.

A 27-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of section 18 and remains in custody for questioning.

Detective Inspector Stuart Woodhead, of GMP's City of Manchester Division, said: "Last night we received reports that a man had been assaulted outside the Asda on Old Church Street in Newton Heath and left seriously injured.

"He was taken to hospital where he was confirmed to have suffered a fractured skull and a bleed on the brain during what must have been a vicious attack. He remains in hospital today in a critical condition, and we have officers conducting enquiries at the scene and in the nearby area so residents may notice an increased police presence.

"I want to appeal to anyone who may have information about the disturbance to please come forward."

Anybody with information should contact police on 0161 856 1146 or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
