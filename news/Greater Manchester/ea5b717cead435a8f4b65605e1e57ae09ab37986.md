Yesterday afternoon (Wednesday 27 November 2019), police responded to an incident involving a number of fireworks which had been set off at the Arndale Centre in Manchester.

Enquiries are still ongoing and Greater Manchester Police are reviewing all available CCTV in an effort to trace and identify those responsible.

Chief Inspector Zac Fraser, of GMP's City of Manchester division, said: "Any behaviour of this kind is unacceptable, the panic and distress caused to members of the public will not be tolerated, especially in light of recent events - those responsible have shown a real disregard for others and put people at potential risk through the panic caused.

"I would like to thank members of the Arndale Security team and my own officers, who when faced with an unknown threat, ran towards any potential danger to protect the people of Manchester City Centre.

"I would like to appeal to members of the public who witnessed the incident to contact GMP, especially if they witnessed those responsible committing the act or have video footage of any fireworks being used. It is really important at this time for us to stand together and make it clear that we will not tolerate behaviour which makes people feel unsafe within the City Centre or indeed anywhere in Greater Manchester."
