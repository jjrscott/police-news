Appeal

Officers are appealing for information following a robbery at a shop in Astley.

At around 9pm on Sunday 6 December 2020, three offenders - believed to be male - entered the Pennywise Off-licence on Ennerdale Road, Astley and threatened staff before demanding they hand over goods.

The offenders made away with money and cigarettes from the store. They are believed to have fled the scene in a blue Skoda Octavia in the direction of Astley street before heading towards the Manchester road area.

The offenders are described as skinny to medium build, wearing dark coloured clothing and balaclavas.

Detective Constable Winnard of GMP's Wigan district said: "Thankfully no injuries were sustained during the robbery but staff were left understandably shaken.

"We're keen to speak to anyone in the area at the time who may have witnessed the robbery or have information that could assist us in our enquiries. Did you see anyone behaving suspiciously at the time? Did you see the Skoda in the area or have dash-cam footage of the vehicle? Please come forward and speak with police."

Anyone who has any information, or dash-cam footage, is encouraged to contact police on 0161 856 7056 quoting incident number 2304 of 06/12/20.

Alternatively, details can be passed on anonymously via the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
