At around 3:30pm on Tuesday 5 May, police were called to reports of a burglary on Brandlesholme Road in Greenmount.

Enquiries have established that a man entered an address and took a pair of car keys.

After failing to start the victim's car, the offender returned the car keys and made off.

No one was injured during the burglary and the offender didn't leave with anything. However the victims were left understandably shaken.

Police Constable David Green, of GMP's Bury district, said: "I am appealing for anyone who may know the man pictured to please come forward with information so we can speak to him in relation to this incident.

"This burglary happened in broad daylight and I am confident that there are a number of witnesses who may have seen something that may be able to assist officers with their enquiries."

Anyone with any information should contact police on 0161 856 8204, quoting incident number 2772 of 5/5/20.

Reports can also be made anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
