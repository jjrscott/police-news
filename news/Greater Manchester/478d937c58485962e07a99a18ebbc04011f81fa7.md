A man has been arrested following the death of a woman in Hale earlier today (24 March 2021).

Officers were called just before 9.15am today to a report of a woman with fatal injuries at an address on Canterbury Road in Hale.

Emergency services attended and sadly a woman in her 70s was pronounced dead at the scene.

A 72-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and taken to hospital with serious neck and arm injuries.

Detective Superintendent Neil Jones, from GMP's Serious Crime Division, said: "This is understandably a distressing incident for those in the community nearby but I want to reassure residents that we have officers at the scene progressing a number of lines of enquiry.

"We're doing all we can to fully establish the circumstances of the woman's death and give her family some much needed answers.

"Detectives remain at the scene and a cordon is in place but I would urge anyone with information to come forward.

"Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 9908 quoting log 671 of 24/03/2021. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
