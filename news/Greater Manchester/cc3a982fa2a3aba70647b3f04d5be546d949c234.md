Tribute to William Phelan

The family of a man who was murdered in Harpurhey in March 2018 have paid tribute to him.

William Phelan died of multiple stab wounds inflicted by Matthew Jones (10/12/1978), of no fixed abode, who was today (Monday 1 February) sentenced to serve life with a minimum term of 20 years in custody.

Speaking after today's verdict, William's family paid tribute to him, saying: "William was the kindest, most-caring and loving person you could wish to meet.

"He would do anything for anyone - he would give you his last penny if he thought he could help you.

"Possessions meant nothing to him and family meant everything.

"He had a hard life living with his mental illness and struggled on a day-to-day basis but through it all he remained the Willy we all know and love.

"He would make us laugh no matter how hard life got and would always be there if you needed someone to talk to - a heart of gold!

"Our family will be forever tortured by the pain of what has happened to him - so cruel and sickening!

"But in the words William once said: 'no matter how hard life gets you down, you just have to smile and be happy'.

"Just be happy - so with that in mind we said we will continue with our lives in the belief that one day we will meet again.

"We will forever hold him in our hearts.

"We finally have justice for William, and he can now rest in peace."
