Officers are appealing for information after a vulnerable autistic man was robbed on a cycle path behind Donald Avenue on Thursday 8 August 2019.

At around 19:30, a group of five males approached the victim before one of them threatened him, demanding money and the bottle of coke he had bought for his mum.

During the robbery, the victim - a 20-year-old man - was punched, which caused him to fall to the floor. He was later taken to hospital with a cut and bruising to his eye and has been left very shaken by the incident.

The offenders fled on foot.

They are described as five white males, 17-19 years old, all wearing dark clothing.

Anyone who has any information about the robbery should call police on 0161 856 5887 quoting incident number 2964 of 08/08/19

Details can also be passed on anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
