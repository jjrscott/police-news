A sixth man has been charged in relation to a large fight outside the Dubai Cafe in Rusholme in January 2020.

Amir Zada (10/01/1996), of Kent Court, Rusholme, has been charged with one count of violent disorder and one count of criminal damage. He has been bailed and is due to appear at Manchester Magistrates' Court on Friday 15 May 2020.

In the early hours of Sunday 26 January, police were called to reports of a large fight on Wilmslow Road.

During the disorder, Emanuel Simon - aged 33 - was assaulted and sadly later passed away in hospital on Monday 10 February, despite the best efforts of medical staff.
