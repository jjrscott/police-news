A man has been arrested following two incidents in Stockport.

At around 5pm on Thursday 14 November 2019 police received a report of a man claiming to be in possession of a firearm on Outwood Road, Heald Green.

A short time later, at around 5.15pm, a woman was walking along Crantock Drive, Heald Green when a man walking in front of her turned around and threatened her with what appeared to be a handgun.

He then apologised and told the woman is was a toy gun.

Officers from Stockport CID subsequently arrested a man aged 45 on suspicion of possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.

He has been released under investigation and a weapon has been recovered.

Police are appealing for information following the incidents.

Detective Constable Rob Shakespeare of GMP's Stockport District said: "There is nothing to indicate that the weapon seen in these incidents was a real firearm. The one recovered was an air weapon of realistic appearance.

"While we have made an arrest our enquiries are ongoing and would appeal to anyone who was in the area at the time to get in touch.

"Perhaps you have dash-cam footage or other information that could assist our investigation. If so, please contact us."

Police can be contacted on 0161 856 9735 or 14085@gmp.pnn.police.uk. Alternatively, contact the independent charity, Crimestoppers, on 0800 555 111.
