Appeal

Police have released a CCTV image of a man they would like to speak to in relation to fraud in Stockport.

At around 8.05pm on Wednesday 5 August 2020, police were called to Offerton Lane, Stockport following a report of a bogus workman.

Officers attended and enquiries have established that a man had approached and entered a property before speaking to the occupier - an elderly man with dementia - and offering gardening services. The offender carried out the bogus service before requesting payment, claiming that he would return later that week to collect further payment.

Police Constable Amy Maguire, of GMP's Stockport division, said: "We are aware that this may cause concern to members of the local community and rest assured we are doing everything we can to help trace the person or persons responsible.

"Do you recognise the man in these images? Police are keen to speak with him as part of our enquiries and we have released these images today in the hope that someone may have information that could assist us."

Anyone with any information should contact police quoting incident 1596 of 05/08/2020 or the independent charity - Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
