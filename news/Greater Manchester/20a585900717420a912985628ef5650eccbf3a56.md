At around 8.30pm on Monday 21 December 2020, three people entered McColls on Atherton Road, Hindley.

At around 9.55pm, three people entered the Spar on Firs Lane, Leigh.

On both occasions, staff were threatened and the offenders left the scene with cash and cigarettes in a silver Vauxhall Insignia.

At around 10.15pm, the vehicle was recovered from the West Leigh Lane/ Pickley Green area.

The offenders are described as being male and of slim/ medium build. At the time of the incidents, they were wearing dark clothes and balaclavas.

DC Sally Skellern, of GMP's Wigan district, said: "Thankfully, no one was injured during either of these incidents but the staff in both shops were, understandably, shaken.

"We are keen to speak with anyone with information about these robberies.

"Did you see anyone acting suspiciously or a silver Vauxhall Insignia in those areas at around those times? Do you have dash cam footage of a vehicle matching the description? Are you aware of anyone selling cheap cigarettes?

"If so, please contact us or Crimestoppers, anonymously, without hesitation."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 7770 quoting 2645 of 21/12/20 or the independent charity - Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
