Police are appealing to the public for information after a firearm discharge in Cheetham Hill in the early hours of Monday 11 May 2020.

Officers were called at around 1.15am to reports of between two and four gunshot sounds on Galsworthy Avenue.

Initial enquiries have established evidence that a firearm discharge took place.

No injuries have been reported but some damage was caused to a vehicle on the street.

No arrests have been made and enquiries are ongoing.

This is believed to have been a targeted attack and there is no wider threat to the public.

Investigators are appealing to anyone with any information to contact police.

Detective Inspector Jen Tattersall, of GMP's City of Manchester division, said: "I am appealing to the public for any information that may aid our enquiries into this incident.

"We are currently pursuing all lines of enquiry to establish further details about this incident and it is vital that anyone with any information - no matter how small - gets in contact with police as it could prove to be vital.

"While there is an increase in high-visibility patrols in the area at this time, I am keen to stress that there is no wider threat to the public and anyone with concerns should feel assured that they can approach our officers to discuss them in confidence."

Anyone with any information should contact police on 0161 856 3924 quoting incident number 124 of 11/05/2020. Details can also be anonymously passed to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
