Shortly after 3.10am on Thursday 13 August, police were called to reports of a robbery at the Coop store on Barlow Moor Road, Manchester.

Officers attended and established that a number of men had attacked the front of the cash machine attached to the store, before breaking through the store's side shutters and entering the property.

The offenders subsequently fled the scene in a car with money from the cash machine. They are believed to have headed in the direction of Hardy Lane.
