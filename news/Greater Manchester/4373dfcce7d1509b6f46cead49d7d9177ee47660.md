Officers are appealing for witnesses following a collision that left a man in critical condition.

At around 11pm last night (Sunday 13 December 2020), officers were called to a report of a collision involving a white Mercedes A200 AMG and a white Toyota Prius taxi at the crossroads on Oldham Road, near the junction with Newmarket Street and Wilshaw Lane in Ashton-under-Lyne.
