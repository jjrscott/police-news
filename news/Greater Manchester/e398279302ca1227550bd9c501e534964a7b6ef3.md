Police have released CCTV of a man they would like to speak to after two robberies at a post office in Tameside within four days.

Shortly after 9.50pm on Tuesday 31 March 2020, a man smashed the glass front door of Droylsden Post Office on Manchester Road, Droylsden. In the hour that followed, he entered the premises on four occasions and stole a large quantity of cigarettes and alcohol before fleeing on foot in the direction of Moorcroft Street.

At around 4.45am on Friday 3 April 2020, a man ran through a glass window at the front of the post office and stole a large quantity of cigarettes and alcohol.

An investigation is underway.

No arrests have been made.

At the time of the second incident, the offender was wrapped in a duvet.

Sergeant Stephanie O'Brien, of GMP's Tameside district, said: "These incidents were a few weeks ago but our investigation is ongoing and I'm hopeful that releasing this CCTV footage will assist us with our enquiries by bringing new information to light.

"The robberies have forced the closure of both the post office and the shop which it is situated within. This has left the victim devastated and had a massive impact on local residents who are now unable to access many post office services.

"Our enquiries have led us to believe that the robberies are linked and that the man in this footage could assist us with our enquiries so I would like to appeal to anyone who can help us identify him or has any other information to contact us without delay."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 5889 quoting 2474 of 31/03/20 or the independent charity - Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
