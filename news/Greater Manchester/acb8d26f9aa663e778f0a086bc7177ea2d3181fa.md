Detectives have released images of three men they would like to speak to in connection with an assault at a restaurant in Openshaw.

At around 3.30am on Wednesday 25 December 2019 police were called to reports of an assault at a restaurant on Ashton Old Road in Openshaw.

Three men walked into the premises and began threatening staff and customers with a large knife.

Several people were attacked during the incident, but no one suffered life threatening injuries.

Detective Constable Sarah Wright of GMP's City of Manchester North District said: "This was a traumatic and terrifying experience for those who were at the restaurant hoping to enjoy a festive night with their friends, family or colleagues.

"We understand this incident took place last year but after following every possible line of enquiry our officers have released these images in the hope that someone will be able to help.

"If you have any information or were nearby the Tinapa Bar and Restaurant at the time of the attack and saw anything unusual or suspicious please get in contact with police as soon as possible so that we can continue to piece together the events of that morning."

Anyone who has any information can contact police on 0161 856 1146 quoting incident number 436 of 25/12/2019.

Reports can also be made anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
