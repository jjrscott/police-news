The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) has today released a statement confirming they have discontinued their investigation into Greater Manchester Police's handling of Yousef Makki's murder investigation confirming they found no potential misconduct by any individual officer, and acknowledging that a number of changes to procedures will be implemented as a result of learnings identified by the internal review.

Assistant Chief Constable Mabs Hussain commented: "My thoughts go out to Yousef's family to whom this news will bring little comfort in their quest for justice for the murder of their son. It is important that we conducted a thorough review of our investigation into the tragic circumstances surrounding Yousef's death, which the IOPC has recognised. This remains a difficult time for the Makki family and I hope this brings some reassurance of our commitment to reviewing our actions."
