Shortly before 2pm on Wednesday 20 May 2020, officers were called to reports of a burglary at an address on Bolton Road, Aspull.

Officers attended and established that the burglary occurred between 1pm and 1:30pm earlier that day (Wednesday 20 May 2020).

It is believed that three men forced entry to the property.

No one was home at the time of the burglary and the offenders made off with a large quantity of cash and four shotguns - which the owner was licensed to keep in the house.

No arrests have been made and enquiries are ongoing.

Detective Constable Cherylin Allen, of GMP's Wigan division, said: "This burglary happened in broad daylight and we are confident that there may be a number of witnesses who are able to assist with our enquiries.

"We are treating this burglary very seriously and are following all lines of enquiry available to us to find these offenders."

"It is believed that when the offenders fled from the address, three men ran across the road in front of the traffic.

"If you were in the area at the time and saw anything suspicious, or have any dash cam footage of the offenders running across the road, please contact police as soon as possible."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 3034, quoting incident number 1472 of 20/05/2020.

Reports can also be made anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
