Appeal following violent robbery

Officers are appealing for information after a violent robbery left a 63-year-old woman with serious head injuries.

Between 8.45pm and 9.30pm on Saturday 9 January 2021, the victim was walking on Henderson Street in Buckley, Rochdale when she was approached by an unknown person.

This person punched the woman several times, and then kicked her in the stomach as she lay injured on the ground. Â£10 in cash was also stolen from the woman during the attack.

She suffered serious head injuries and was taken to hospital, where she remains in a serious but stable condition.

It is unknown at this stage if the offender was acting alone or with others and officers are urging anyone with information to come forward and speak with police.

Detective Constable Ricky Hutchings, of GMP's Rochdale District, said: "This was a senseless and brutal attack and the victim has been left completely traumatised by the terrifying ordeal she was subject to.

"I would appeal to anyone out there who was in the area at the time and saw anything suspicious to contact us.

"If you have any information, no matter how small or insignificant it might seem, please get in touch with police as soon as you can as it could be vital in allowing us to catch the cowardly individuals responsible for this."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 8719 quoting incident 506 of 11/01/21. Alternatively, details can be passed on anonymously via the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
