Officers were called around 8am on Friday 15 January 2021 to Leigh Road, Leigh, to a report of a robbery at Costcutters.

Officers attended and established that an employee and two members of the public were threatened with a wooden bat by three offenders.

The offenders attempted to steal a large quantity of cigarettes by stuffing them into a bedsheet but when they tried to make their escape, the shop owner and members of the public intervened.

Following a struggle, the offenders dropped the items and left the scene in a red Audi A3 in the direction of Atherton.

One member of the public who was injured in the robbery was taken to hospital to be treated for a knee injury but has since been released.

The red Audi believed to be involved in the incident was found abandoned in Pickley Green, Leigh.

Detective Constable Sean Goddard, of GMP's Wigan District, said: "This was a terrifying ordeal for the shop owner and members of the public who were involved.

"We have launched a full investigation and our enquiries are ongoing to establish who is responsible for this.

"If you were in the area and saw anything suspicious then please get in touch with police as soon as possible."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 7254 quoting incident number 533 of 15/01/21. Alternatively, details can be passed on anonymously via the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
