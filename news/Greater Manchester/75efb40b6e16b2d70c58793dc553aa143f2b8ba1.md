Kent

Prosecutors told Manchester Crown Court that on Saturday 26 September 2020, during an argument at a property on Leicester Road, Jak Kent (21/07/99) punched 49-year-old Lee Oates several times causing him to fall and sustain a serious head injury.

Lee was taken to hospital, where he sadly died on Friday 2 October 2020.

Kent was arrested, taken into police custody for questioning and, later, charged.

After pleading guilty to manslaughter, today (Thursday 11 February 2021), Kent was sentenced to eight years and four months imprisonment.
DC Katie Halstead, of GMP's Salford district, said: "In this case, an argument escalated and resulted in a man's death. Kent was undeniably violent towards Lee. Our thoughts remain with Lee's loved ones, who have been devastated.

"I hope this case warns violent individuals that their behaviour can have devastating consequences and won't be tolerated by the Police, Crown Prosecution Service or the Courts."
