Police are appealing for more information after a man died following a collision in Levenshulme.

At around 7pm on Thursday 21 November 2019 police were called to a report that a motor cyclist had collided with metal fencing after trying to avoid a collision with a black Hyundai on Broom Lane, Levenshulme.

The motor cyclist, a 21 year old man, sadly died later in hospital.

Enquires are ongoing and no arrests have been made.

Police Constable Philip Drummond of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit said: "This was a tragic incident in which a young man has sadly lost his life."

"Our thoughts are with his family during this devastating time and our officers are working hard to find out more details about what happened during and after the collision."

"We are still searching for the motorcycle that was involved in the incident and was removed shortly after.

"If you were on or around Broom Lane at the time of the incident and may have heard or seen anything unusual or suspicious please contact police. Any dash cam or CCTV footage could prove invaluable in our search for more information."

Anyone with information should call GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit on 0161 856 4741 or 101 quoting incident number 2674 of 21/11/2019, or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
