Leanne Bentley (23/10/1992) of Brookcroft Road, Wythenshawe was sentenced today (Thursday 10 December) at Manchester Crown Square Court to six years and nine months in prison after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of Peter Richardson.

On Wednesday 20 May 2020, Bentley was involved in a fight with Peter after he let himself into a friend's property uninvited and refused to leave when he was asked to do so by the occupants.

The fight between Bentley and Peter continued into the front garden of the property, causing the neighbours to come out and see what the disturbance was.

The neighbour asked Peter to leave the property. Peter apologised to the neighbour before turning to leave.

As Peter was about to leave, Bentley ran out from the house and stabbed him in the back with a knife.

Following the stabbing, Peter walked away from the address before collapsing a short while later. A passer-by called an ambulance and Peter was taken to hospital, where he sadly died in the early hours of the next morning.

Detective Chief Inspector Andrew Butterworth, of GMP's Major Investigation Team, said: "This is a tragic incident in which a man lost his life as he was walking away from the situation and not looking for conflict.

"This attack by Bentley was brutal, unwarranted and has sadly cost Peter his life.

"Our thoughts remain with Peter's family and friends at this incredibly difficult time as they come to terms with this loss."
