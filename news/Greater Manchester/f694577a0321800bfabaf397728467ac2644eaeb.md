At around 4.30pm on Friday 8 January 2021, police received a report that a 19-year-old man had been riding his bicycle on St Helens Road, close to the junction of Plodder Lane, when he was approached by three teenagers who verbally abused him with comments of a racist nature and assaulted him.

Emergency services attended and the man was taken to hospital with head and facial injuries. He has since been discharged.

The offenders are described as being white boys, aged in their late teens.

One of the boys is described as having brown hair and stubble on his chin and at the time of the incident he was wearing a black Armani puffer jacket.

Another one of the boys is described as being tall with blonde hair, clean shaven and at the time of the incident he was wearing a grey Rab jacket.

No arrests have been made and enquiries are ongoing.

Police Constable Scott Bradbury, of GMP's Bolton division, said: "This was a completely unprovoked racially aggravated assault on an innocent member of the public. This type of behaviour is completely unacceptable and will absolutely not be tolerated.

"If anyone was in the area at the time and witnessed this assault, or anything at all suspicious, please get in touch with police as soon as possible. Even the smallest piece of information could prove vital in helping officers to complete their enquiries."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 5542, quoting incident number 1697 of 10/01/2021.

Reports can also be made anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
