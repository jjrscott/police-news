Appeal

Police are appealing for witnesses following a burglary in Farnworth, Bolton.

Five men, armed with weapons, burgled a property just off Smethurst Lane in Farnworth at around 9.05pm on Tuesday 27 October 2020.

The men stole a number of items including items of gold and jewellery.

The offenders are described as male, dressed in dark clothing and were carrying weapons, including an axe. One of the men was described as of large build.

The occupants, who are in their 20's, were inside the property at the time of the incident and received minor injuries that did not require medical treatment.

Detective Constable Leanne Strong of GMP's Bolton District said: "This was a brazen attack that has left the occupants understandably shaken and we want to ensure we find those responsible.

"We're appealing to anyone who may have been in the area at the time and saw anything suspicious to come forward and speak with police. Did you see any of the five men or see anyone acting suspiciously around the time? We are keen to speak to anyone that has information that could help us find those responsible."

Information can be passed on to police by calling 0161 856 5757 quoting incident number 2497 of 27/10/20.

Alternatively, information can be passed on to the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
