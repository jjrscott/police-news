On Wednesday 25 December 2019, occupants at an address on Buckley Lane, Farnworth woke up and discovered that they had been burgled.

Numerous items had been taken from the property, including their children's Christmas presents.

Extensive and diligent enquiries from two officers - PC Shaw and PC Von-Vadkerthy - led to an address a short distance away. On arrival, officers searched the property and found the stolen presents from the burglary.

Prior to the presents being recovered, local community group Homeless Aid UK, heard of the burglary and kindly donated gifts to the children.

A man - aged 29 - and a woman - aged 38 - have been arrested on suspicion of burglary.

Inspector William Jennings-Wharton, of GMP's Bolton division, said: "Sadly at this time of year we often deal with people who do not usually have dealings with the police, especially those who are victims of crime.

"Burglary is an extremely emotive crime, which is heightened at Christmas time especially when it involves children.

"The officers worked incredibly hard and their extensive enquiries enabled us to obtain information about the whereabouts of the presents, before we searched an address and were able to recover them.

"I would like to take this opportunity to thank PC Shaw and PC Von-Vadkerthy for their swift response and hard work."
