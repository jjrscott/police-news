At around 7.15pm on Monday 3 February 2020, police were called to reports of a firearms discharge on Hollyhouse Drive in Woodley.

Emergency services attended and a man in his 40s was taken to hospital with gunshot injuries to his legs. He remains there for treatment.

A 23-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and remains in custody for questioning.

Detective Inspector Darren Scar of GMP's Stockport Borough said: "This was a violent incident which has left a man in hospital for over two weeks with serious injuries. Our thoughts remain with him as he recovers.

"Although we have made an arrest we are keen to establish the circumstances around this shooting and are appealing to the public for further information to assist us with this case.

"We understand that this incident happened after dark but occurred in a well-populated residential street in the early evening therefore we expect people will be able to assist our investigations.

"I would urge anyone who has any information or who was around Hollyhouse Drive, Woodley at the time of the shooting and saw anything unusual or suspicious to contact police as soon as possible."
