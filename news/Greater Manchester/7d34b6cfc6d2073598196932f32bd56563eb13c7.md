Officers have released CCTV images of three males they would like to speak to following a robbery in the Trafford Centre.

At around 5.30pm on 16 June 2020, officers were called to a report of a robbery on the lower deck car park near the escalators at the Trafford Centre.

Three males made threats to a 16-year old and demanded him to hand over his Gucci bag.

They made off with the bag. No one was injured.

PC Singh, of GMP's Trafford district, said: "Thankfully no one was injured during this robbery but the victim was left understandably shaken.

"Enquiries are on-going and now we're appealing to members of the public to come forward if they recognise any of the males in the images.

"Anyone with information should call 0161 856 7530 or email TraffordSouth@gmp.police.uk quoting log 2394 of 16/06/2020.

"Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
