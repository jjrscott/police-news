At around 5.10pm on Tuesday 22 September 2020, police were called by the ambulance service responding to reports of a stabbing on Royal Oak Road.

Emergency services attended and a man was taken to hospital, where he was sadly pronounced dead a short time later. His next of kin has been informed.

Detective Chief Inspector Stuart Wilkinson, of GMP's Major Incident Team, said: "This was a particularly violent incident and the consequence is that a man has sadly lost his life. Our thoughts are with his loved ones as specially trained colleagues support them.

"Our investigation is already well underway and we are doing everything in our power to establish exactly what happened and catch the person or people responsible.

"We are appealing for information - this incident happened near the busy junction with Southmoor Road, where there are a number of businesses as well as homes so it is highly likely that members of the public who were leaving work, commuting or arriving home saw or heard something of significance.

"There are dedicated investigators and patrols in the area, where they will remain for the coming days at least. I hope this reassures members of the public but anyone who is worried should speak directly with those officers."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 9908 quoting 2251 of 22/09/20 or the independent charity - Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
