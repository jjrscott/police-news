Shaun Ward (30/04/1997) of no fixed abode has been charged with manslaughter and will appear at Bolton Magistrates Court today (Wednesday 4 March 2020).

Shortly before 8.15am on Monday 2 March 2020, emergency services were called to Tennyson Road, to reports of a collision involving a pedestrian and a dark grey VW Golf car.

The pedestrian was seriously injured as a result of the incident and despite best efforts from medical staff, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

A 24-year-old woman who was arrested on suspicion of murder has been bailed pending further enquiries.
