## Detectives have released an image of a man they want to speak to following a burglary in Stockport

Officers were called to a report of a burglary on Wellington Road North in Heaton Chapel, Stockport, at around 9.15pm on 24 November 2020.

A man broke into a property and made off with a wallet and mobile phone.

A man in his 60s was inside the property at the time of the incident and sustained minor injuries after confronting the suspected offender.

Detective Constable Kirsty Pierce, of GMP's Stockport CID, said: "Thankfully the man in the property only suffered minor injuries after confronting the man who broke into his home.

"A number of lines of enquiry have been carried out since the incident but we're now asking the public to come forward if they may recognise the man pictured.

"Anyone with information is asked to call 0161 856 9821 quoting incident number 2650 of 24/11/2020.

"Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."

_GMP recommends the following advice to prevent burglaries which often spike during the winter months._

_ _

 * _Always locking doors even when inside your home, or out of the house for a short time._
 * _If you have one, setting your burglar alarm when leaving the house._
 * _Use light timers or leave the lights on to deter criminals._
 * _Keeping bins away from windows when they 're not being used as they can be used as a climbing aid for burglars._
 * _Registering your valuables on immobilise.com so property can be returned to its rightful owner if stolen._
 * _Working with neighbours by setting up or joining a Neighbourhood Watch scheme. Details can be found at ourwatch.org.uk_
