A 54-year-old man who died on Friday 6 September 2019 as a result of severe injuries to his head has been formally identified as John Rimmer.

He was admitted to hospital with life-threatening injuries around 8.40pm on Wednesday 4 September 2019, and police were later notified by the hospital.

A 42-year-old man and a 59-year-old woman were arrested on Thursday 5 September on suspicion of assault and they have since been released under investigation.

Officers are appealing for anyone with any information to come forward to police.

Detective Chief Inspector Colin Larkin, of GMP's Major Incident Team, said: "Our thoughts are with John's family, who are being supported by specially trained officers at this difficult time.

"We believe the assault occurred shortly before John was taken to hospital, however enquiries are still ongoing to determine where the assault took place.

"I would urge anyone who thinks they may have information about what happened to get in touch with us as soon as possible."
