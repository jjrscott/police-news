A man and a teenager have been charged following an aggravated burglary in Leigh.

Dale Bailey (31/08/1995) of Balmoral Drive, Leigh, has been charged with aggravated burglary and a 17-year-old boy who cannot be named for legal reasons has been charged with aggravated burglary and possession of a bladed article.

They appeared at Manchester and Salford Magistrates' Court today (Tuesday 20 October 2020) and were remanded to next appear at Bolton Crown Court on Tuesday 17 November 2020.

Police were called at around 2.20am on Monday 19 October 2020 to reports that two masked men allegedly forced entry into an address on Warwick Street and threatened the female occupant with machetes while assaulting her.

A number of items including a mobile phone were taken.

The woman - aged in her 40s - suffered serious cuts to her hands and went to hospital for treatment. She has since been discharged.
