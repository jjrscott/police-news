Due to the social distancing measures put in place by the UK Government, in light of the Covid-19 outbreak, the International Visitor Registration Office (IVRO) will close at 1530hrs on Friday 20th March 2020, until further notice.

All current appointments have been cancelled and we will not be booking any new appointments at this time. You do not need to attend your local police station to make any updates to your registration. This will not affect your immigration status and you will not face any penalty for late registrations under these unprecedented circumstances.

We will update this website as soon as we have any further information, so please keep checking here.

Please email gmp.ivro@gmp.police.uk for any queries
