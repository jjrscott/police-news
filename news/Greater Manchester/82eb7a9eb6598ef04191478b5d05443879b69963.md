At around 8pm on Friday 29 November 2019, police were called to reports that a car had collided with a pedestrian on Boundary Street, Rochdale.

The pedestrian - a 25-year-old man - suffered a serious head injury. He was taken to hospital where he remains in a life-threatening condition.

The car - which is described as a light coloured Mercedes C class - was travelling towards Tweedale Street and failed to stop at the scene.

Enquiries are ongoing to trace the car and the driver. No arrests have been made.

Sergeant Brian Orr, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "A man has been left fighting for his life as a result of this collision.

"The Mercedes failed to stop at the scene and we're now appealing for the public's help in order to trace the driver and establish exactly what happened in the moments leading up to the collision.

"I am particularly interested in speaking with anyone who may have dash cam footage and was in the area at the time. I'm also keen to talk to any members of the public who saw the Mercedes after the collision."

Anyone with information should call GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit on 0161 856 4741 or 101 quoting incident number 2790 of 29/11/2019, or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
