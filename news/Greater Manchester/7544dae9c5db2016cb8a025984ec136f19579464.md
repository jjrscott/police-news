At around 12.40pm on Sunday 27 October 2019, police were called to Broad Street to reports of a collision involving one car - a silver BMW.

Emergency services attended and a 32-year-old man and 30-year-old woman were taken to hospital with serious injuries. Despite best efforts from emergency services the woman was sadly pronounced dead a short time later.

The man remains in hospital in a stable condition.

Pendleton roundabout was closed in the direction of Manchester - but this has since reopened.

Enquiries are ongoing.

DC Diana Dyer-Barron, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "This is a tragic set of circumstances that has left a man fighting for his life in hospital and a woman sadly dead. Specialist officers are with their families and supporting them through this horrific time.

"This happened at a busy time of day, so I would like to take this opportunity to make a direct plea to anyone who may have seen anything that can assist our enquiries. We're particularly keen to speak to anyone witnesses with dash cam footage who saw the BMW in the lead up to the collision. If you have any information that could help - please get in touch as a matter of urgency."

Anybody with information should call GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit on 0161 856 4741, quoting incident number 1576 of 27/10/19. Reports can also be made anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
