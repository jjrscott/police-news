A murder investigation has been launched after a man died in Tameside.

At around 2.45am on Friday 16 August 2019, the Ambulance service were called to Wood Square in Droylsden to reports that a man had sustained injuries.

Despite best efforts of emergency services staff, the man sadly died in hospital three days later (Monday 19 August 2019). He has since been formally identified as 66-year-old John Aldred.

Following a referral to the Police Coroner's Office on Wednesday 21 August 2019, a murder investigation was launched by detectives.

A 32-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of murder. She remains in custody for questioning.

Detective Sergeant Clare Smith, of GMP's Tameside district, said: "We have a dedicated team of officers working hard to establish the full circumstances of this incident and provide answers for John's loved ones.

"Whilst we have a person in custody, I would like to stress that our enquiries remain very much ongoing and we would appeal to anyone who has any information to please come forward and speak with us - no matter how insignificant or unimportant it may seem."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 5887, quoting incident number 401 of 16/08/19. Reports can also be made anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers 0800 555 111.
