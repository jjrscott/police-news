Officers in GMP's Force Intelligence Unit identified that a rave-style event with hundreds of attendees was due to be held in the Dovestones area.

Working alongside Oldham Council and GMP, United Utilities have closed a number of access routes in the vicinity to prevent the event from occurring.

GMP created a dedicated operation to carefully monitor any planned rave-style events following serious disorder linked to raves in Oldham and Carrington in June.

Chief Inspector Claire Galt said: "I'd like to thank the support of the public as we continue to investigate and prevent these gatherings.

"Such events are illegal; their organisers irresponsible and events like this have in the past been linked to serious violent disorder and drugs use.

"Unfortunately, due to the selfish actions of those who sought to stage this event, the people of Oldham will see several access points in the Dovestones area cordoned off this weekend.

"However, it is for everyone's safety that we have taken today's positive action and I'd like to thank the public for their patience."

Anyone with information on planned illegal events is urged to contact police on 101. Reports can also be made anonymously to the independent Charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
